A sudden increase or decrease in air temperature, increasingly frequent, extreme weather phenomena can cause enormous economic damage to countries and cities. The occurrence of random weather phenomena and their negative impact on technical infrastructure nowadays are the basic problem related to ensuring the safety of the functioning of each system. Climate changes and significant air temperature amplitudes have a direct impact on the functioning of the critical infrastructure of cities, which includes collective water supply systems (CWSS). The paper presents the impact of climate change on the failure of a water supply network. Correlation between failure rate and air temperature was determined. This was used to determine the number of failures for the near 2036-2050 and distant 2086-2100 future in terms of climate change (temperature increase). The results confirm the thesis known from the literature that the failure rate decreases as the temperature increases. For forecasted periods as a result of temperature rise due to climate change, the reduction of the number of water pipe failures is expected in the range of 1.22% to 2.35% for the 2036-2050 period and from 2.96% to 8.66% for the 2086-2100 period, depending on the development of Representative CO2 Concentration Scenarios (RCP). The decrease in the total number of failures will have an impact on the increase in the reliability and safety of water supply to consumers. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Failure rate; Reliability; Water supply system","air temperature; climate change; nature-society relations; urban area; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079488729

The short, medium and long term solutions go towards a progressive electrification of the vehicle towards fully electric vehicles, type BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle). In this context, the hybrid powertrain (HEV - Hybrid Electric Vehicle) represents an evolution of conventional traction systems destined to become increasingly electric. The work presents, through a WTW (Well To Wheel) analysis, the comparison between powertrains with increasing electrification levels: from conventional to pure electric through hybrid. For the type of powertrains considered, the consumption of non-renewable primary energy and CO2 emissions are calculated and compared, based on experimental data on consumption and efficiency of the following vehicles: Toyota Yaris 1500 Petrol, Toyota Auris Diesel (conventional), Toyota Yaris Hybrid, Toyota Prius (HEV) and Nissan Leaf (BEV). Non-renewable primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions have been calculated under real usage conditions; the data were acquired in a road acquisition campaign in Rome on urban, extra-urban and highway routes for a total of 5,400 km and 197 hours of road acquisitions. The results show how the hybrid powertrain achieves significant reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared to the conventional powertrain (petrol and diesel). On urban traffic-intensive routes (average speed up to 30 km/h) consumption and emissions are reduced by more than half and are still relevant even on extra-urban routes with average speeds of up to 80 km/h. For higher average speeds (highway, over 100 km/h) consumption and yields tend to be similar. Consumption and emissions of electric powertrains, potentially for consumption and zero emissions, are closely linked to the methods of production and distribution of electricity. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077850246

In addition, this article applies the local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to unveil the spatial variation of air pollution's capitalization effects on housing prices across different cities. Because air pollution will negatively impact housing prices, considering the benefits of air quality can help the government to create public policies intended to address air pollution, as well as help the public to improve both awareness regarding the environment and willingness to pay for improved air quality.

In this study, we compile and analyze monthly temperature and precipitation fields derived from regional climate model simulations performed over different CORDEX domains at a spatial resolution of 50 km. This unique multi-model, multi-scenario, and multi-domain “super-ensemble” is used to update projected changes for the Mediterranean region. The statistical robustness and significance of the climate change signal is assessed. By considering information from more than one CORDEX domains, our analysis addresses an additional type of uncertainty that is often neglected and is related to the positioning of the regional climate model domain. CORDEX simulations suggest a general warming by the end of the century (between 1 and 5 °C with respect to the 1986–2005 reference period), which is expected to be strongest during summer (up to 7 °C). A general drying (between 10 and 40%) is also inferred for the Mediterranean. However, the projected precipitation change signal is less significant and less robust. The CORDEX ensemble corroborates the fact that the Mediterranean is already entering the 1.5 °C climate warming era. It is expected to reach 2 °C warming well within two decades, unless strong greenhouse gas concentration reductions are implemented. The southern part of the Mediterranean is expected to be impacted most strongly since the CORDEX ensemble suggests substantial combined warming and drying, particularly for pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; CORDEX; Dynamical downscaling; Ensemble; Mediterranean",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076205699

Because these trees are of central importance both for ecosystem function and for the economic value of the forest for management, the impact on these trees due to the increase of bamboo abundance following anthropogenic disturbances is both an environmental and a commercial concern. Context: Bamboo-dominated forests in southwestern Amazonia are increasingly exposed to the combined impacts of fire and selective logging. Although the climbing bamboos (Guadua spp.) are considered native species of these forests, disturbances contribute to a discontinuous canopy, which is an ideal scenario for an increase in abundance of these opportunistic plants. The regeneration of tree biomass is limited in these cases, decreasing the carbon stock of the forest. Aims: This study compares changes in bamboo abundance and forest structure in the face of forest fire and post-burn logging in the municipality (county) of Rio Branco, Acre state, Brazil. Methods: The study was conducted on the Transacreana Highway (AC 090) in the eastern portion of Acre state, Brazil. We compared changes in bamboo abundance and aboveground biomass (AGB) of an area of forest with no known recent disturbances to areas in the same forest that had been disturbed by fire and post-burn logging, which are frequent sources of disturbance in this region. The live and dead AGB values were estimated by field inventory in 2016, which was 11 years after a fire and 9 years after selective logging. The AGB values for trees and palms were estimated by allometric equations in three 2-ha areas. Bamboo abundance was expressed both by bamboo biomass (Mg ha−1) and culm density (culms ha−1), sampled by direct measurements in three 200-m2 areas. Results: Bamboo abundance was over 20% higher in forest that had been burned but not logged, as compared to undisturbed forest. Compared to undisturbed plots, aboveground forest biomass (live + dead) was 34% lower in plots exposed to fire but not logging, and 36% lower if exposed to both. Live trees and palms represented 77% of the total forest biomass (live + dead), and almost a half of this contribution (41%) was in individuals in the largest diameter class (diameter at breast height &gt; 50 cm). Conclusion: Increase in the level of impact led to a reduction in aboveground carbon stock of the forest. One of the main consequences of disturbances in open forests dominated by bamboo is reduction of live trees and palms, especially in the diameter at breast height (DBH) class over 50 cm. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Acre; Bamboo forest; Brazil; Forest fires; Guadua spp; Logging","aboveground biomass; abundance; allometry; anthropogenic effect; bamboo; carbon sequestration; dominance; environmental disturbance; forest fire; logging (timber); Acre [Brazil]; Brazil; Rio Branco [Acre]; Bambusa; Guadua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076397781

However, because of growing concerns over greenhouse gas emissions, the integration of renewable energy sources is mandatory to meet power demands and reduce climatic effects. The advancements in renewable generation sources and battery storage systems pave the way for microgrids (MGs). As a result, MGs are becoming a viable solution for power supply shortage problems in remote-area applications, such as oceanic islands. In this paper, an islanded MG, which consists of PV system, tidal turbine (TT), diesel generator (DG), and Li-ion battery, is considered for Ouessant island in Brittany region in France. The economic operation of the MG is achieved by including battery degradation cost, levelized costs of energy of the PV system and TT, operating and emission costs of DG, and network constraints. The developed model leads to a non-linear and non-convex problem, which unfortunately can converge to a local optimum solution. The problem has, therefore, been relaxed and converted to a convex second-order cone model to achieve an optimal decision strategy for islanded MG operations with a global or near-global solution. Numerical simulations are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in reducing the operating and emission costs of the islanded MG. It is shown that the developed convex energy management system formulation has an optimality gap of less than 1% with reduced computational cost. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Convex optimization; demand response (DR); energy management system (EMS); island; microgrid (MG); PV system; second-order cone programming; tidal turbine (TT)","Convex optimization; Cost reduction; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lithium-ion batteries; Relaxation processes; Tidal power; Demand response; island; Micro grid; PV system; Second-order cone programming; Tidal turbines; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075531951

Although specialty crops compose the majority of the state’s crops in both economic value and land area, the portion of GHG emissions contributed by them is still highly uncertain. Current and emerging soil management practices affect the mitigation of those emissions. Herein, we review the scientific literature on the impact of soil management practices in California specialty crop systems on GHG nitrous oxide emissions. As such studies from most major specialty crop systems in California are limited, we focus on two annual and two perennial crops with the most data from the state: tomato, lettuce, wine grapes and almond. Nitrous oxide emission factors were developed and compared to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors, and state-wide emissions for these four crops were calculated for specific soil management practices. Dependent on crop systems and specific management practices, the emission factors developed in this study were either higher, lower or comparable to IPCC emission factors. Uncertainties caused by low gas sampling frequency in these studies were identified and discussed. These uncertainties can be remediated by robust and standardized estimates of nitrous oxide emissions from changes in soil management practices in California specialty crop systems. Promising practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and meet crop production goals, pertinent gaps in knowledge on this topic and limitations of this approach are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.

Here, we investigated methanogenic activity and microbial community of a paddy soil enrichment in response to different biomineralization pathways of ferrihydrite, which was reduced and transformed to magnetite and vivianite in the absence and presence of phosphate, respectively. For methanogenic degradation of both acetate and propionate, CH4 production rates in the magnetite cultures were significantly enhanced compared with the vivianite cultures. Characterization of 16S rRNA genes from methanogenic soil microbial community indicated that, (i) biomineralization of ferrihydrite was an important factor affecting soil microbial community structure; (ii) Geobacteraceae was only enriched in the vivianite cultures for both acetate- and propionate-fed incubations; and (iii) the abundance of Anaerolineaceae was increased in the magnetite cultures for both acetate- and propionate-fed incubations. The facilitated CH4 production in the magnetite cultures might be related to the dynamic cycle of Fe(III)–Fe(II)–Fe(III) or magnetite-stimulated direct interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic acetate/propionate oxidizers and methanogens, which need further investigation. These results lend insight into the biogeochemical cycling of Fe, C, and P in anaerobic soils and sediments, as well as the development of mitigation strategies of CH4 production. © Copyright © 2019 Zhuang, Tang, Yu, Li and Tang.","biomineralization of ferrihydrite; methanogenesis; microbial community; paddy soil; phosphate","Biogeochemistry; Biomineralization; Electron transport properties; Magnetite; Microorganisms; Phosphate minerals; Phosphates; RNA; Sediments; Volatile fatty acids; Ferrihydrites; Methanogenesis; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Mineralization pathway; Paddy soils; Soil microbial community; Soil microbial community structure; Soils; biomineralization; community structure; ferrihydrite; microbial community; paddy field; RNA; soil microorganism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077322418

Due to low consumer acceptance, however, the market size of remanufactured products remains small. There are different ways to promote remanufacturing, two of which being providing cash subsidy and imposing carbon regulation. Cash subsidy demonstrates the direct role of governments in promoting consumption of specific products, whereas carbon regulation indirectly promotes the manufacture of low-emission products through mandatory measures. In this paper, we study how these two intervention policies affect the demand for remanufactured products, firm profit and social welfare, taking total carbon emissions into consideration. We model a monopoly firm that sells both new and remanufactured products to capture the economic and environmental impacts of these policies. By comparing the two policies, we derive the closed form of regions or intervals that indicate which policy incurs higher remanufacturing output or lower total emission. Important findings obtained include: (1) The two policies may have different impacts on recycling economy – remanufacturing subsidy increases the consumption of remanufactured products, and this indicates that more obsolete products are collected and remanufactured; whereas carbon regulation only works when the remanufacturing acceptance level is high enough or when the unit carbon emission of remanufactured products is low enough. (2) Remanufacturing subsidy promotes profit, however, carbon regulation might hurt the firm's profit. On consumer surplus and social welfare, both policies show uncertain trends. (3) On the total carbon emission, a mandatory carbon tax can help to decrease it. However, remanufacturing subsidy works only when the remanufacturing acceptance level is high enough or when the unit carbon emission of new products is large enough. © 2019","Carbon regulation; Environmental performance; Remanufacturing subsidy; Social welfare; Sustainability","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Profitability; Sustainable development; Carbon regulations; Consumer acceptance; Environmental performance; Obsolete products; Remanufactured products; Remanufacturing subsidy; Social welfare; Sustainable production; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070698612

Before launching the world largest ETS, China experimented with seven independent regional pilots, whose effects are only indirectly explored. Here we provide firm-level evidence of the innovation effect directly from China’s pilot emissions trading, based on latest patenting information and a quasi-experimental design. China’s pilots increase low-carbon innovation of ETS firms by 5–10% without crowding out their other technology innovation. The increase from ETS firms accounts for about 1% increase of the regional low-carbon patents, while a similar increase from large non-ETS firms is also induced by the ETS. Most importantly, the effect is not associated with permit price, auction, or firm characteristics, but is driven by mass-based allowance allocation.

The ambient PM concentrations and spatial distribution of plant communities in urban forest parks are not random, but show strong spatial patterns. We selected Ma'’anshan Mountain Forest Park in Wuhan, China, as an example of a typical park. The monitoring network consisted of 44 different plant communities at various locations that were monitored in December, April, July and October. The effects of the spatial heterogeneity of plant communities on ambient PM10 and PM2.5 were analysed using a spatial model to investigate the relationships between plant communities and levels of ambient PM. The results showed that differences in levels of ambient PM among plant communities resulted from both their composition and location. However, when spatial patterns were corrected, large seasonal variations in PM patterns were revealed due to seasonal differences in the characteristics of plants communities and pollution emissions. Significantly lower ambient PM concentrations were recorded in small-scale plant communities that were mainly distributed in the mountain areas and comprised of Pinus, Platycladus, Cunninghamia, Taxodium, Metasequoia, Quercus, Platycarya, and Cinnamomum. Correlation results revealed that six factors — diameter at breast height (DBH), leaf area index (LAI), canopy area (CA), slope (S), distance from pollution source (DPO) and distance from edge of park (DP) — had significant effects on ambient PM reduction. We found that ambient PM decline was primarily attributed to large DBH and community DPO. The effect of small-scale plant communities on ambient PM decline was the most significant in December, followed by October, April, and July. These plant community attributes are the basis of forest ecological services, and our findings indicate that the regulation of plant communities could improve urban forest services by increasing the efficiency of ambient PM concentration reduction. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Ambient PM10; Ambient PM2.5; Particulate matter (PM); Plant community; Spatial distribution; Urban forest park","heterogeneity; leaf area index; park management; particulate matter; plant community; pollutant source; seasonal variation; spatial distribution; urban forestry; Anhui; China; Hubei; Maanshan; Wuhan; Cinnamomum; Cunninghamia; Metasequoia; Platycarya; Platycladus; Quercus; Taxodium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074578639

This study charts patterns in these services and analyses the impacts of biophysical and social-economic factors such as land use allocation and proximity. A spatially explicit survey was conducted among 767 farmer households on the urban–rural fringe of rapidly urbanizing Wuhan (China). The hypothesis of a largely linear change with distance from the urban centre was tested separately for 7 quantified landscape services with RDA and regression analysis. Significant linear patterns were found for 4 landscape services: food, vegetables and fruits, trees, and storm water runoff reduction. Air pollution mitigation and recreation were found to be associated with nearby water rather than green infrastructure, which is likely due to the abundance of water around Wuhan. In addition, storm water runoff reduction correlated with green infrastructure (grasslands and forests). Bundling of landscape services was found to vary along the urban–rural fringe, with recreation and air pollution mitigation bundled at the urban end, while ponds and recreation bundled in the rural outer zone. In short, several provisioning and regulating services varied linearly with distance, whereas others did not, due to the strong geographical forcing by water. © 2019, The Author(s).","Drivers; Landscape planning; Landscape service bundles; Peri-urban farmland use; Urbanization; Urban–rural gradient",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071254605

This study, for the first time, compiles a plant-specific inventory for six HMs (Hg, As, Se, Pb, Cd, and Cr) avoided by CFPPs decommissioned in China during the 12th Five Year Plan period. The reduced HM amounts to 271.58 t (9.19 t Hg, 45.84 t As, 60.76 t Se, 85.30 t Pb, 1.74 t Cd, and 68.75 t Cr), accounting for 12.71% of the total emissions from all China's CFPPs in 2010. Small units which have low boiler efficiency and lack air pollutant control devices are more than tenfold HM-intensive as the large units. The detailed HM emission factors for each CFPP decommissioned in each provincial region are also identified. HM content in the coal consumed is a key parameter to determine their corresponding emission factors, while the capacity of decommissioned coal plants plays a decisive role in the reduced emissions. The high-resolution inventory not only verifies China's progress in alleviating HM pollution, but also provides basis for further investigation into HM relevant environmental and human health impact.

Based on the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and NH3-N (Ammonia Nitrogen) emissions Database of 339 Cities at the city level in China, this study explores the impact of economic agglomeration on water pollutant emissions, including the differences in magnitude of the impact in relation to city size using an econometric model. The study also examines the spillover effect of economic agglomeration, by conducting univariate and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis. The results show that economic agglomeration can effectively reduce water pollutant emissions, and a 1% increase in economic agglomeration could lead to a decrease in COD emissions by 0.117% and NH3-N emissions by 0.102%. Compared with large and megacities, economic agglomeration has a more prominent effect on the emission reduction of water pollution in small- and medium- sized cities. From the perspective of spatial spillover, the interaction between economic agglomeration and water pollutant emissions shows four basic patterns: high agglomeration-high emissions, high agglomeration-low emissions, low agglomeration-high emissions, and low agglomeration-low emissions. The results suggest that the high agglomeration-high emissions regions are mainly distributed in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Shandong Peninsula, and the Harbin-Changchun urban agglomeration; thus, local governments should consider the spatial spillover effect of economic agglomeration in formulating appropriate water pollutant mitigation policies. © 2019, Science Press.","bivariate spatial autocorrelation; city size; economic agglomeration; emission reduction effect; spatial spillover effect; water pollutant emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079698032

Based on the monthly observation data of the main meteorological stations on the ground in Tibet from 1960 to 2015, this paper constructs a tourism climate index model. This index is used to quantitatively evaluate the tourism climate changes in Tibet, and investigate the impact of climate change on tourism. The results show that from 1960 to 2015, the temperature in Tibet increased by 1.35°C, and the tourism climate index changed significantly, especially in the regions of Changtang, Ngari and Kunlun Mountain. The fluctuation of temperature-humidity index, wind-chill index and index of clothing of these areas was larger than that of other regions. The changes of each index in different months are different, where spring observes larger changes while summer observes smaller changes. The tourism climate index in northwestern Tibet has increased, and the climate comfort period is expanding. In southeastern Tibet, the comfort level has declined and the comfort level in the central part has been slowly increasing. The comfort index in the southeastern part of Tibet has gradually declined, and the comfort index in central Tibet has slowly increased. According to the comprehensive assessment method including temperature and humidity index, wind-chill index, index of clothing and altitude adaptability index, the types of tourism climate index in Tibet can be divided into reduced, low-speed growth, medium-speed growth and rapid growth. Different regions should adopt alternative tourism products, strengthen energy conservation and emission reduction technology applications and green infrastructure construction, and appropriately control the scale of tourism activities so as to adapt to and mitigate the impact of climate change on tourist destinations. © 2019, Science Press.","adaptation countermeasures; climate change; Tibet; tourism climate index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079709974

The influences of RGO on the free volumes and electrical conductivity of PC were systemically studied by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, and electrical conductivity measurements for PC/RGO nanocomposites. The nanosized effect, good conductivity of RGO, and strong interfacial interaction between RGO and PC result in the low conductive threshold of 0.36 wt %. Ten orders of magnitude increase in electrical conductivity was obtained. The results of PALS indicate the properties of free volumes fluctuate around the conductive percolation threshold. The conformational change of PC segments in the interfacial region induced by the strong interfacial interaction leads to an increase in free volume radius. The concentration of free volume decreases due to the depression of free volume holes as the introduction of RGO. Significantly, an exponential function is proposed to describe the effect of relative fractional free volume on the electrical conductivity, suggesting that free volume plays an important role in regulating electrical conductivity of PC/RGO.

This article reviews the recent progress in studies of how climate modes in the Indo-Pacific respond to greenhouse warming, including the consensus and uncertainty across climate models. Recent Findings: Recent studies revealed a range of robust changes in the properties of climate modes, often associated with the mean state changes in the tropical Indo-Pacific. In particular, the intermodel diversity in the ocean warming pattern is a prominent source of uncertainty in mode changes. The internal variability also plays an important role in projected changes in climate modes. Summary: Model biases and intermodel variability remain major challenges for reducing uncertainty in projecting climate mode changes in warming climate. Improved models and research linking simulated present-day climate and future changes are essential for reliable projections of climate mode changes. In addition, large ensembles should be used for each model to reduce the uncertainty from internal variability and isolate the forced response to global warming. © 2019, The Author(s).","El Niño-Southern Oscillation; Greenhouse warming; Indian Ocean basin warming; Indian Ocean dipole; Indo-western Pacific ocean capacitor; Internal climate variability; Uncertainty in model projections",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075923390

However, biochar’s effectiveness in acidic tea soil and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We conducted a short-term microcosm experiment using two biochars (1% w/w, LB, generated from legume and NLB, non-legume biomass, respectively) to investigate the effects of biochar amendments on soil chemical properties, N2O emission, and microbial community in an acidic soil. Soil and headspace gas samples were taken on 1, 10, and 30 day’s incubation. Biochar amendment increased soil pH and DOC, however, significantly reduced soil inorganic N. Both biochars at ~ 1% addition had little effect on microbial CO2 respiration but suppressed soil N2O emission by ~ 40% during the incubation. The divergence in N2O efflux rates between soils with and without biochar addition aligned to some degree with changes in soil pH, inorganic N, and dissolved organic C (DOC). We also found that biochar addition significantly modified the fungal community structure, in particular the relative abundance of members of Ascomycota, but not the bacterial community. Furthermore, the copy number of nosZ, the gene encoding N2O reductase, was significantly greater in biochar-amended soils than the soil alone. Our findings contribute to better understanding of the impact of biochar on the soil chemical properties, soil N2O emission, and microbial community and the consequences of soil biochar amendment for improving the health of acidic tea soil. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Acidic soil; Biochar; Denitrification; Microbial community; N2O emission; Tea plantation","acid soil; bacterium; biochar; denitrification; fungus; microbial community; nitrous oxide; plantation; soil amendment; soil emission; soil fertility; Ascomycota; Bacteria (microorganisms); acid; biochar; charcoal; nitrogen dioxide; air pollutant; bacterium; biomass; chemistry; microbiology; microflora; soil; tea; Acids; Air Pollutants; Bacteria; Biomass; Charcoal; Microbiota; Nitrogen Dioxide; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Tea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074827500

The past decade has seen great success in the high-quality synthesis of upconversion nanoparticles with controlled structure, crystalline phase, size, and shape. The unique capacity of upconversion nanocrystals to undertake near-infrared excitation, amalgamated with their excellent luminescent characteristics, such as massive anti-Stokes spectral shift, sharp emission band, multicolor emission, and long luminescence lifetime, makes these nanomaterials prime candidates for a plethora of applications. Herein, we review the field of upconversion nanoparticles from the perspectives of fundamental luminescence mechanisms, new synthetic routes, and current practical approaches to tuning emission color and enhancing upconversion efficiency. In particular, we highlight the recent advances in utilizing upconversion nanocrystals for bioimaging, therapy, biosensing, neuroscience, super-resolution imaging, photoswitching, and lasing applications.

To shorten the start-up time, and increase the stability of treatment systems, this work focused on the effects of three seeding sources on treatment performances of 2,3,4-trifluoroaniline (2,3,4-TFA) during start-up and shock, as well as the acclimated strategy. After 246–323 days of acclimation in a stepwise feeding according to the inhibition degree, three sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) successfully achieved efficient removal, i.e., 300.00 mg/L of 2,3,4-TFA, with over 95.00% of degradation efficiency and 60.00–80.00% of defluorination rates. The sludge obtained from the fluorizated hydrocarbon wastewater treatment plant(FHS) without prior exposure to fluoroaniline was determined to be optimal, based on the observed shortest start-up time of 246 days, the highest defluorination rate of 70.00–80.00%, the fastest recovery time of 7 days after shock, and the highest microbial diversity with nine dominant bacterial groups. Furthermore, compared with the sludge obtained from pharmaceutical wastewater containing part of municipal wastewater treatment plant(PMS), the seeding source used in treating the comprehensive wastewater in industrial park (CIS) exhibited earlier defluorination reaction, higher defluorination rate and microbial diversity, but lower shock resistance. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that microbial diversity was dependent on the origin of the inoculum after acclimation. We identified two predominant phyla in PMS, namely, Deinococcus-Thermus (24.43%) and Bacteroidetes (18.44%), whereas these were Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi in FHS and CIS. During the shock of 400 mg/L 2,3,4-TFA, the predominant bacteria norank_f_Blastocatellaceae and norank_f_Methylobacteriaceae disappeared, and the defluorination reaction hardly occurred, indicating that the bacterial genera could contribute to the defluorination reaction. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2,3,4-trifluoroaniline; Acclimation; Inoculum sources; Microbioal community; Shock","Aniline; Batch reactors; Degradation; Industrial water treatment; Seed; Sewage pumping plants; Water treatment plants; 2,3,4-trifluoroaniline; Acclimation; Inoculum sources; Microbioal community; Shock; Wastewater treatment; 2,3,4 trifluoroaniline; aniline derivative; unclassified drug; acclimation; biodegradation; efficiency measurement; hydrocarbon; inoculation; microbial community; oxic conditions; reaction kinetics; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; acclimatization; Acidobacteria; activated sludge; analytic method; Article; Bacteroidetes; Chloroflexi; controlled study; defluorination; degradation; Deinococcus; DNA extraction; EC50; exposure; inoculation; Methylobacteriaceae; microbial community; microbial diversity; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; phylogeny; Thermus; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Acidobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Deinococcus-Thermus; Methylobacteriaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075740628

In particular, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has become the major component of haze with many adverse impacts and has therefore become of great concern to scientists, government, and the general public in China. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5 in 269 Chinese cities from 2015 to 2016 and its associations with socioeconomic factors to identify the possible strategies for PM2.5 pollution mitigation. Specifically, we first quantified the spatial pattern of PM2.5 concentrations in both 2015 and 2016, and then changes between the two years. Next, we examined the relationship between socioeconomic factors and PM2.5 concentrations and changes. The results showed that most cities in eastern China experienced decreases in PM2.5 concentration, although most of these cities already had high PM2.5 pollution level. Cities with low PM2.5 concentrations experienced increases in PM2.5 concentrations and were mostly located in southern and southwestern China. The PM2.5 concentration was the highest in winter, followed by in spring, autumn and summer; for changes in PM2.5 concentrations, the highest magnitude of decrease occurred in summer, followed by the decreases in winter, autumn and spring. Cities with high PM2.5 concentrations tended to be clustered, but the clustered characteristics were not clearly related to the changes in PM2.5 concentrations. The relationship between PM2.5 concentration and urban size was an inverse U-shaped curve, suggesting the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve for air quality in China. Population density and secondary industry share are the keys factors relating to air pollution control. In comparison to other cities, most moderately developed cities had a greater magnitude of decrease in PM2.5 concentrations and the key factor for pollution improvement was industrial structure; however, smaller cities tended to have a greater increase in PM2.5 concentrations and population density was the most important influencing factor. As a result, for air pollution control in China, specific regulations should be carried out according to different regions and different developmental stages based on the locations of cities. © 2019 The Authors","Environmental Kuznets curve; PM2.5 concentrations; Socioeconomic factors; Spatial autocorrelation","Air quality; Economics; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Environmental Kuznets curves; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Industrial structures; PM2.5 concentration; Population densities; Socio-economic factor; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatio-temporal variation; Air pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; autocorrelation; concentration (composition); Kuznets curve; particulate matter; socioeconomic impact; spatiotemporal analysis; urban atmosphere; air pollution control; air quality; article; autocorrelation; autumn; China; city; developmental stage; population density; socioeconomics; spring; summer; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; China; city; economics; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; procedures; season; socioeconomics; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Population Density; Seasons; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071965453

Spray–flame interaction involving in split injections is significantly complex, which affects the ignition process and even pollutant emissions. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate how the flame–spray interaction affects the subsequent ignition process and combustion features in split injections under diesel engine-like conditions. In this work, large eddy simulation coupled with a 54-species mechanism for split injections of n-dodecane is performed to study the effect of injection duration and dwell times (DTs) on spray–flame interactions and the ignition mechanism. The numerical model gives a reasonable agreement with the experiments in terms of the vapor penetration length, ignition delay times, mixture fraction distributions and the flame structures. The present study revealed that combustion for split injections is a multi-stage process and the ignition processes for the first and second injections are controlled by different mechanisms, namely autoignition for the first injection, and the accelerating ignition for the second injection due to the intermediate species and heating effect formed in the first injection. Moreover, the increase in dwell time between individual injections reduces the subsequently promoting ignition effect for the second injection and thus weakens the interacting process between the two injections. Consumption of the fuel in the first injection leads to a temperature increase and production of different species, which in turn accelerates the ignition of the second injection. Finally, the competition between the local flow timescale and chemical timescale is investigated based on the chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) methods. A balance between reaction and mixing processes dominates the combustion of the quasi-steady spray in the second injection with a short DT. However, the flame is controlled by autoignition when a longer DT is used. © 2019 The Combustion Institute","CEMA; Flame structure; Flame–spray interaction; Ignition; Split -injection","Chemical analysis; Diesel engines; Flame spraying; Fuel injection; Large eddy simulation; Pollution; CEMA; Combustion efficiencies; Compression ignition engine; Engine like conditions; Flame structure; Split injection; Split injection strategy; Spray interaction; Ignition; dodecane; explosive; formaldehyde; fuel; hydroxyl group; oxygen; aerosol; Article; chemical composition; combustion; decomposition; diesel engine; dwell time; evaporation; flame; heating; high temperature; low temperature; oxygen concentration; priority journal; reaction analysis; reduction (chemistry); simulation; stoichiometry; temperature sensitivity; vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071660364

The modification and fabrication of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based FSC are recent research focus. Enhancing electrical conductivity of rGO is an important factor to improve the electrochemical performance of FSC. Hence, we fabricated iodine-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (I-rGO) on oxidized carbon yarn (OCY) by a simple iodine steam functionalization method. The I-rGO displays enhanced electrical conductivity which facilitates the ion and electron transport and increases the utilization of rGO. The I-rGO combined with the OCY which processes good hydrophilicity and high electrochemical activity very well, endowing the FSCs with high performance. The all-solid state FSC, assembled by using two intertwined I-rGO/OCY electrodes and KOH-polyvinyl alcohol gel electrolyte, shows high specific capacitance of 1.7 mF cm−1 at scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and the capacitance almost increases linearly with device length increasing. Meanwhile, the FSC exhibits well cycling performance of 88% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, considerable mechanical flexibility and stability of 94% capacitance retention after 1000 continuous bending cycles, fascinating series-parallel performance and knittability. Therefore, the FSC based on I-rGO/OCY has great potential to be applied to wearable electronics in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fibriform supercapacitors; Iodine functionalized reduced graphene oxide; Knittability; Oxidized carbon yarn","Capacitance; Electric conductivity; Electrodes; Electron transport properties; Potassium hydroxide; Solid electrolytes; Supercapacitor; Textiles; Wearable technology; Electrochemical activities; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage components; Functionalized; High specific capacitances; Knittability; Oxidized carbons; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072775121

Energy-saving technology utilization is an effective measure to achieve high-performance buildings. However, numerous studies are greatly limited to practical application due to their strong regional pertinence and technical simplicity. This paper aims to further optimize various commonly used technologies on the basis of the current national standards, and to individually establish four recommended technology selection systems corresponding to four major climatic regions for realizing nearly zero energy educational buildings (nZEEBs) in China. An educational building was selected as the case study. An evaluation index of energy-saving contribution rate (ECR) was proposed for measuring the energy efficiency of each technology. Thereafter, high energy efficiency technologies were selected and implemented together in the four basic cases representing different climatic regions. The results showed that the total energy-saving rate in severe cold regions increased by 70.74% compared with current national standards, and about 60% of the total energy-saving rate can be improved in cold regions. However, to realize nZEEBs in hot summer and cold winter regions as well as in hot summer and warm winter regions, photovoltaic (PV) technology needs to be further supplemented. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy-saving contribution rate; Energy-saving technologies; Four major climatic regions; Nearly zero energy educational buildings; Recommended technology selection systems","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; School buildings; Climatic regions; Contribution rate; Educational buildings; Energy-saving technologies; Technology selection; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076689531

Existing sSMLM relies on extracting spectral signatures, such as weighted spectral centroids, to distinguish different molecular labels. However, the rich information carried by the complete spectral profiles is not fully utilized; thus, the misclassification rate between molecular labels can be high at low spectral analysis photon budget. We developed a machine learning (ML)-based method to analyze the full spectral profiles of each molecular emission and reduce the misclassification rate. We experimentally validated our method by imaging immunofluorescently labeled COS-7 cells using two far-red dyes typically used in sSMLM (AF647 and CF660) to resolve mitochondria and microtubules, respectively. We showed that the ML method achieved 10-fold reduction in misclassification and two-fold improvement in spectral data utilization comparing with the existing spectral centroid method. © 2019 Optical Society of America.",,"Budget control; Emission spectroscopy; Molecules; Spectrum analysis; Emission spectrums; Misclassification rates; Misclassifications; Molecular emissions; Single-molecule localizations; Spectral classification; Spectral signature; Super resolution imaging; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075752427

Areas of concentrated population tend to be regions with higher PM2.5 concentrations, which further aggravate the impact of PM2.5 pollution on population health. Using PM2.5-concentration and socioeconomic data for 225 cities in China in 2015, we adopted a PM2.5-health-risk-assessment method (with simplified calculation) and applied the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model to analyze the effects of socioeconomic factors on PM2.5 health risks. The results showed that: (1) At the national level, the order of contribution degree of each socioeconomic factor in the PM2.5-health-risk and PM2.5-concentration model is consistent. (2) From a regional perspective, in all three regions, the industrial structure is the decisive factor affecting PM2.5 health risks, and reduction of energy intensity increases PM2.5 health risks, but the impact of the total amount of urban central heating on PM2.5 health risks is very low. In the eastern region, the increased urbanization rate and length of highways significantly increase PM2.5 health risks, but the increasing effect of the extent of built-up area is the lowest. In the central region, the increasing effects of the extent of built-up area on PM2.5 health risks are significantly greater than the decreasing effects of the urbanization rate. In the western region, economic development has the least effect on reducing PM2.5 health risks.

Scanning confocal PL measurements have been performed across BSFs regions and BSF-free regions. For the blue LED, both the emission intensity and the emission wavelength exhibit a periodic behavior, matching the periodic distribution of BSFs. Furthermore, the BSF regions show a longer emission wavelength and a reduced emission intensity compared with the BSF-free regions. However, with increasing indium content, this periodic behavior in both emission intensity and emission wavelength becomes weaker and weaker. When the indium content (and correspondingly, wavelength) increases up to achieve yellow emission, only random fluctuations have been observed.

Corn oil (CO) is rich in unsaturated fatty acid with &gt;50% PUFA, which may enhance ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids, leading to changes in ruminal H2 metabolism and methanogenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of CO supplementation of a diet on CH4 emissions, nutrient digestibility, ruminal dissolved gases, fermentation, and microbiota in goats. Six female goats were used in a crossover design with two dietary treatments, which included control and CO supplementation (30 g/kg DM basis). CO supplementation did not alter total-tract organic matter digestibility or populations of predominant ruminal fibrolytic microorganisms (protozoa, fungi, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Fibrobacter succinogenes), but reduced enteric CH4 emissions (g/kg DMI, -15.1%, P = 0.003). CO supplementation decreased ruminal dissolved hydrogen (dH2, P &lt; 0.001) and dissolved CH4 (P &lt; 0.001) concentrations, proportions of total unsaturated fatty acids (P &lt; 0.001) and propionate (P = 0.015), and increased proportions of total SFAs (P &lt; 0.001) and acetate (P &lt; 0.001), and acetate to propionate ratio (P = 0.038) in rumen fluid. CO supplementation decreased relative abundance of family Bacteroidales-BS11-gut-group (P = 0.032), increased relative abundance of family Rikenellaceae (P = 0.021) and Lachnospiraceae (P = 0.025), and tended to increase relative abundance of genus Butyrivibrio-2 (P = 0.06). Relative abundance (P = 0.09) and 16S rRNA gene copies (P = 0.043) of order Methanomicrobiales, and relative abundance of genus Methanomicrobium (P = 0.09) also decreased with CO supplementation, but relative abundance (P = 0.012) and 16S rRNA gene copies (P = 0.08) of genus Methanobrevibacter increased. In summary, CO supplementation increased rumen biohydrogenatation by facilitating growth of biohydrogenating bacteria of family Lachnospiraceae and genus Butyrivibrio-2 and may have enhanced reductive acetogenesis by facilitating growth of family Lachnospiraceae. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of CO led to a shift of fermentation pathways that enhanced acetate production and decreased rumen dH2 concentration and CH4 emissions. © The Author(s) 2019.","Corn oil; Dissolved hydrogen; Goat; Methane; Rumen fermentation; Rumen microbes","corn oil; hydrogen; methane; RNA 16S; animal; animal food; biosynthesis; diet; dietary supplement; drug effect; female; fermentation; Fibrobacter; goat; intestine flora; metabolism; microflora; physiology; rumen; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Corn Oil; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Female; Fermentation; Fibrobacter; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Goats; Hydrogen; Methane; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076875281

The CuPS-driven CO2 reduction catalyzed by a water-soluble cobalt porphyrin possessing four N-methylpyridinium acceptors at the meso positions (CoTMPyP) achieves the highest catalytic activity among those reported for aqueous systems: TONCO = 2680 and TOFCO max = 1600-2600 h-1 with SelCO2 = 77-90% (selectivity for CO vs H2).

In key regions of China, the mass concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic equivalent diameters less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) have dropped significantly. However, the contributions of meteorological changes to PM2.5 reduction are largely uncertain, which has attracted particular concern from the government and the public. Here, we investigated the impact of large-scale and boundary layer (BL) meteorological conditions on aerosol pollution and estimated the contributions of meteorological changes to PM2.5 reduction based on in-depth analysis and diagnosis of various observed meteorological elements and an integrated pollution-linked meteorological index (PLAM, which is approximately and linearly related to PM mass concentration). In this study, we found that the meteorological conditions worsened in 2014 and 2015 and improved in 2016 and 2017 relative to those in 2013 in key regions in China. In 2017 relative to 2013, only ∼5% (approximately 13% of the total PM2.5 decline) of the 39.6% reduction in PM2.5 mass concentrations can be attributed to meteorological changes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, and only ∼7% (approximately 20% of the total PM2.5 decline) of the 34.3% reduction can be attributable to meteorological changes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Overall, the PM2.5 reduction due to meteorological improvement is much lower than the observed PM2.5 reduction in these areas, which indicates that emission reduction during the five-year implementation of the “Ten Statements of Atmosphere” is the dominant factor in the improvement in air quality. The changes in meteorology and climate are conducive to PM2.5 reduction but do not dominate the substantial improvement in air quality. Similar to the above regions, in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, the impact of meteorological changes on the annual averaged PM2.5 concentration from 2013 to 2017 was relatively weak, and the PM2.5 reduction was mainly due to emission reductions. During winter 2017 (January, February, and December of this year), the meteorological conditions improved ∼20% in the BTH region (observed total PM2.5 reduction: 40.2%) and ∼30% in the YRD region (observed total PM2.5 reduction: 38.2%) relative to those in 2013, showing the meteorological factors played more important role in the decrease of PM2.5 in winter of these years in the two regions, respectively. The meteorological conditions in winter 2016 were 14% better than those in winter 2017, but the PM2.5 reduction in winter 2016 was still less than that in winter 2017, reinforcing the significant contributions of the increasing efforts to reduce PM2.5 emissions in 2017. The substantial progress of strict emission measures was also confirmed by a comparison of several persistent heavy aerosol pollution episodes (HPEs) with similar meteorological conditions. It is found that the decrease of PM2.5 mass caused by emission reduction increases year by year, especially the decrease of PM2.5 concentration in 2016 and 2017. In China, HPEs mainly occur in winter, when meteorological conditions are approximately 40–100% worse than in other seasons. This worsening is partly due to the harbor effect of high topography, including downdrafts and the weak wind zone, and partly due to the increasingly stable regional BL structure caused by climate warming. For the formation of HPEs, it occurred under regional stagnant and stable conditions associated with upper-level circulation patterns, including the zonal westerly winds type and high-pressure ridges. After pollution formation, PM2.5 with mass accumulated to a certain degree can further worsen the BL meteorological conditions. The feedback effect associated with worsening conditions dominates PM2.5 mass explosive growth. In the context of high air pollutant emissions in China, unfavorable meteorological conditions are the necessary external conditions for the formation and accumulation of HPEs. Therefore, reducing aerosol pollution significantly during the earlier transport stage is critical in reducing persistent HPEs. Currently, even under favorable meteorological conditions, allowing emissions without restriction is also not advisable because aerosol pollution allowed to accumulate to a certain extent will significantly worsen the BL meteorological conditions and close the “meteorological channels” available for pollution dispersion. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Contribution of Meteorological Conditions to PM2.5 Change; Quantifying unfavorable meteorological conditions; Ten Statements of Atmosphere","Aerosols; Air quality; Boundary layers; Emission control; River pollution; Topography; Aerodynamic equivalent diameters; Air pollutant emission; Circulation patterns; Meteorological condition; Meteorological elements; Meteorological factors; Pollution dispersion; Prevention and controls; Atmospheric movements; aerodynamics; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; meteorology; particulate matter; pollution control; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Tianjin; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065412879

However, activities in the visible-light region are still far from satisfactory due to the uncontrollable defect location. Herein, we demonstrate a facile confinement reduction route to introduce controllable defects to mesoporous TiO2 microspheres with phase junctions (denoted as M-TiO2-PJs) by using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the reducing agent. In this case, the confinement decomposition effect of mesopore channels over NaBH4 enables the generation of defects more effectively at a mild reaction condition, enabling the well-retained mesoporous and phase junction structures of mesoporous TiO2 microspheres. Moreover, by changing the reduction temperature, the defects are migrated from the nanocrystalline-exposed surfaces to phase junction interfaces, enabling that the location of the defects can be well-tuned. After the reduction at 300 °C, the resultant defective mesoporous TiO2 microspheres show the well-retained mesostructure, high surface areas (~75.6 m2 g-1), large pore volumes (0.36 cm3 g-1), slightly disordered surfaces and intimately contacted anatase-rutile interfaces, which exhibit the state-of-the-art activities for photocatalytic water splitting. The H2 generation rate is as high as 42.6 μmol h–1 (based on 50 mg of catalyst) under visible-light (λ &gt; 400 nm) and the apparent quantum efficiencies are estimated to be 12.7% and 2.8% at 420 and 520 nm, respectively, which are the best values among TiO2-based photocatalysts reported to date. We also show that the defective mesoporous TiO2 microspheres possess a super CH4 selectivity (57%) and yield (15 nmol h-1) for CO2 reduction under visible-light because of the activation and adsorption effect of defects for CO2 molecules.

Yet, whether smart factories affect the environmental performance remains unknown. In this article, we examine the environmental performance of a smart refrigerator factory by comparing the environmental impacts of its product to a similar model that is produced in a traditional fashion. This article quantifies and verifies the theoretically predicted impacts of this smart factory on the individual processes. Though the overall differences in the two models are quite minor, we find that this smart factory can notably reduce the values of most impact categories associated with the parts and refrigerator production; the reduction in the value of climate change is 33%. Owing to higher material efficiency—raw material savings in this smart factory contributes to the greatest reductions in most categorized impacts—the contribution to the reduction of climate change is 39%. Yet, all categorized impacts of procurement and delivery are increased due to product personalization and direct delivery. The results of sensitivity analysis show that promoting product modularity, adopting clean energy such as wind power can further improve the environmental performance of the selected refrigerator. The introduction of auxiliary equipment and systems slightly increases the value of each category; yet their impacts are negligible compared to their benefits as facilitating production efficiency.

However, they may be subject to expensive battery replacement caused by battery aging. This paper designs an online, coordinated optimization approach, based on Pontryagin's minimum principle, for a single-shaft parallel plug-in hybrid electric bus, aiming at minimizing the total cost of energy consumption and battery degradation. Specifically, three key contributions are delivered to complement the relevant literature. First, a capacity loss model for lithium ion batteries emulating dynamics of both cycle life and calendar life is exploited in the optimization framework, in order to highlight the importance of considering calendar life and its implication to overall energy management performance in real bus operations. Second, the online adaptive mechanism of the optimization method with respect to varying driving conditions is achieved by tracking two reference trajectories to adjust the state of charge and effective ampere-hour throughput of the battery. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, various comparative studies are carried out, accounting for different driving scenarios. Simulation results show that the maximum control errors between the proposed strategy and Pontryagin's minimum principle are only 0.4% in the battery capacity loss and 2.7% in fuel economy under four random driving cycles, which indicates the prominent adaptability and optimization performance of the designed strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery degradation; Co-optimization; Energy management; Fuel economy; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle; Pontryagin's minimum principle","Battery management systems; Battery Pack; Buses; Charging (batteries); Energy management; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Fuels; Lithium-ion batteries; Random errors; Battery degradation; Battery replacements; Co-optimization; Coordinated optimization; Optimization framework; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Pontryagin's minimum principles; Reference trajectories; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; electric vehicle; energy planning; equipment; optimization; performance assessment; replacement; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072271401

However, current research mainly focuses on energy-saving and emission reduction through improving the energy efficiency of equipment or optimizing the operation and management of cold chain logistics enterprises, rarely considering the government policy. This paper constructs a decision-making model of cold chain logistics system by using the method of bilevel programming. The upper level is the government's goal, pursuing the total cost minimization of the whole cold chain logistics system. The lower level is the goal of the cold chain logistics enterprise, pursuing the cost minimization of the enterprise. Chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) was developed to improve this model, and this method was applied to the decision-making of cold chain logistics system in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The study reveals: (1) The joint use of carbon emission reduction subsidies and carbon emission quota optimization measures is more effective in promoting energy-saving and emission reduction of enterprises than using them separately; (2) The carbon emission quota set by the government should not be too high or too low; (3) The government subsidy limits for carbon emission reduction have a significant impact on the carbon emission reduction of enterprises; (4) The subsidy rate per unit carbon emission reduction can adjust the total carbon emissions and total carbon emission reduction of enterprises.

Thus, mitigation efforts to curb BC emissions from Arctic shipping have elicited considerable research interest. In this study, we revisit potential technical and operational solutions to reduce BC emission from shipping. Possible barriers to the main solutions that are applicable to Arctic shipping are discussed. We argue that Arctic shipping, which operates in a sensitive region with complicated navigational conditions, can affect the practical performance of BC abatement solutions. On the basis of a comprehensive analysis, this study mainly recommends that 1) combinations of technical and operational solutions are encouraged, but empirical studies are needed to test the effectiveness of those abatement technologies in the Arctic; 2) given the potential costs and average robust BC reduction performance, the switch from heavy fuel oil to distillate fuels should be prioritized for adoption by shipowners; 3) low impact and fuel efficient fishing needs to be introduced for fishing vessels, which are the largest fleet in the Arctic, to improve fishing practices and gears; and 4) regional actions and global cooperation are imperative for the governance of Arctic shipping. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic shipping; Black carbon; Emission reduction; Policy implication","Carbon; Emission control; Fisheries; Fishing vessels; Fuel oils; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Ships; Abatement technologies; Arctic shipping; Atmospheric particulate matter; Black carbon; Black carbon emission; Comprehensive analysis; Emission reduction; Policy implications; Fleet operations",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071835702

However, current studies are mainly derived from the Arctic area, with limited evidence from other permafrost regions. By combining large-scale laboratory incubation across 51 sampling sites with machine learning techniques and bootstrap analysis, here, we determined regional patterns and dominant drivers of CH4 oxidation potential in alpine steppe and meadow (CH4 sink areas) and CH4 production potential in swamp meadow (CH4 source areas) across the Tibetan alpine permafrost region. Our results showed that both CH4 oxidation potential (in alpine steppe and meadow) and CH4 production potential (in swamp meadow) exhibited large variability across various sampling sites, with the median value being 8.7, 9.6, and 11.5 ng g-1 dry soil h-1, respectively. Our results also revealed that methanotroph abundance and soil moisture were two dominant factors regulating CH4 oxidation potential, whereas CH4 production potential was mainly affected by methanogen abundance and the soil organic carbon content, with functional gene abundance acting as the best explaining variable. These results highlight the crucial role of microbes in regulating CH4 dynamics, which should be considered when predicting the permafrost C cycle under future climate scenarios.

Its excellent catalytic performance could be attributed to the fact that Ce4+ was reduced to Ce3+ by Co2+ ions with the presence of Ag in Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC, which facilitated the removal of lattice oxygen of the CeO2 surface to form high concentration oxygen vacancy.

Here, for the first time, qualitative and quantitative static and dynamic behavior of complex confined CO2 fluids in dual-scale nanopores are experimentally performed in nanofluidics, which combines with the theoretical model, the statistical mechanics coupled with the thermodynamic equation of state, to investigate the CO2 utilization in shale reservoirs. In experiment, a series of phase behavior and fluid flow laboratory tests are conducted through a self-manufactured nanofluidic system at different conditions; in theory, a generalized equation of state including the confinements and pore-size distributions and five dynamic models are developed and applied to calculate the vapor–liquid equilibrium and fluid dynamics. Results from this study show that the static behavior has drastic changes in the dual-scale nanopores that the measured saturation pressure of the confined CO2–C10 fluids reduces by 10.19% at T = 25.0 °C and 7.26% at T = 53.0 °C from bulk phase to nanometer scale. Furthermore, under the strong confinements in the dual-scale nanopores, the calculated phase properties including the pore-size distribution effects are more accurate. In addition, effects of the temperature and feed gas to liquid ratio on the confined fluids in nanopores share similar manners with the bulk phase cases. The proposed theoretical models are capable of calculating the static and dynamic behavior of the confined fluids and all calculations have been validated by the experimentally measured results.

However, the prediction skills are generally limited over many extra-tropical land areas where the oceanic effects are relatively weak. In this study, we address the potential of preceding spring soil moisture condition to predict summer hot days over Northeastern China, a typical Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude region. The results show that spring soil moisture condition over Central-Eastern China is closely related with following summer hot days over Northeastern China for the period of 1979–2017. The statistical model based on the preceding spring soil moisture condition yields temporal cross-validated correlation skill of 0.57 for summer hot days over Northeastern China. The spatial pattern correlation skills of independent hindcast experiments for 2009–2017 are also high, ranging from 0.87 to 0.94. Our results can be easily applied to practical prediction of summer hot days over Northeastern China, and help to provide better climate services and reduce the detrimental effects of extreme heat over this extra-tropical region. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; China; climate; heat; high temperature; latitude; Northern Hemisphere; prediction; skill; soil moisture; spring; summer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071754980

The direct reduction with (a) nearby radical; (b) nearby oxygen and (c) nearby vacancy is calculated. The results show that the nearby oxygen will increase the activation energy by 51.8 kJ/mol and the nearby vacancy will reduce the exothermicity by 269.7 kJ/mol. This leads us to the firm conclusion that the nearby radical site will provide a favorable route. The indirect reduction reactions from surface migration are also determined. According to the calculated results, the high-spin singlet reactions are more complicated than the low-spin triplet reactions. The barrier height involved in the singlet reactions is much lower than that encountered in the triplet reactions, indicating that the reaction with singlets holds potential of being an important channel for N2 production. Our qualitative analysis of the density functional theory (DFT) results confirms that the high-spin excited-state changing the electronic properties of the carbonaceous surface is much more favorable for the reduction than the low-spin ground-state.

To analyze the emissions reduction effect and economic effect of China's ETS and further discuss the mechanisms of economic development differences and industrial development differences on the final effect of the policy, this study adopts the propensity score matching-difference in differences method and triple difference method. The empirical results show the following: (1) The ETS can simultaneously achieve both the emissions reduction effect and economic effect when key control variables are included. (2) The population, carbon emissions intensity and per capita GDP have significant positive impacts on carbon emissions; the environmental pollution control intensity, research structure, and research intensity have negative impacts on carbon emissions; and the capita stock, employment, and energy consumption have significant positive economic effects. (3) The ETS has a stronger inhibitory effect on the provinces with higher levels of economic and service development compared to the provinces with lower levels of economic and service development. In contrast, the policy has a weaker inhibitory effect on provinces with higher levels of industrial and construction development compared with the lower level provinces. © 2019 by the authors.","DDD; Heterogeneity; Porter effect; PSM-DID","carbon emission; economic development; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; heterogeneity; industrial development; pollution control; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076681136

In this study, we estimate the daily SO2 levels across China on 0.1o grid from 2013 to 2016 by assimilating satellite- and ground-based SO2 observations using the random-forest spatiotemporal kriging (RF-STK) model. The cross-validation R2 is 0.64 and 0.81 for predicting the daily and multiyear averages, respectively. The multiyear population-weighted average of SO2 for China is 28.1 ± 14.0 μg/m3, and the severest SO2 pollution occurs in the northern China (45.1 ± 14.7 μg/m3). The SO2 concentration shows a strong seasonality, i.e., highest in winter (41.6 ± 26.4 μg/m3) and lowest in summer (19.6 ± 8.3 μg/m3). During 2013–2016, the annual SO2 decreases from 34.4 ± 18.2 to 22.7 ± 11.1 μg/m3, and the population% exposed for more than 100 nonattainment days (SO2 &gt; 20 μg/m3) drops from 86% to 48%. While the seasonality of SO2 is mainly determined by the meteorological variation, the substantial decrease attributes to the reduced emissions such as from coal consumption. The effectiveness of SO2 emission reduction varies widely in different prefectures of China. In Shandong province, the SO2 concentration decreases by −45% while the coal consumption increases by 9%. In Shanxi province, the SO2 concentration decreases by −15% while the coal consumption decreases by −3%. The contrasting effectiveness between these two provinces is associated with the much fewer waste gas disposal facilities in Shanxi than Shandong. Stricter regulation is required to further lower the SO2 concentration in order to protect the public health, especially in the northern China. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","China; Human exposure; Remote sensing; SO2; Spatiotemporal distribution","coal; concentration (composition); ground-based measurement; public health; remote sensing; seasonal variation; seasonality; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; temporal distribution; waste disposal; article; China; gas waste; human; information retrieval; kriging; public health; random forest; remote sensing; seasonal variation; summer; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; satellite imagery; China; Shandong; Shanxi; sulfur dioxide; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Satellite Imagery; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072940107

To obtain further insights into the temporal and spatial characteristics of PM2.5 flux, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) have been applied during January, April, July and October 2016. The results demonstrated that the modeling flux calculation method was suitable for investigating the evolutionary trend of PM2.5 flux by comparing cross–district simulations and observations. The total of monthly inflow, outflow and net flux indicated the intensive interactions and prominent temporal and spatial variations of PM2.5 transport though the boundary segment of the district, city and region. The vertical distribution analysis of net flux shows that PM2.5 net flux between target megacity/region and surroundings differed with the altitude, and the altitude at which its maximum intensity was closely related to neighboring areas and occurrence of month. Notably, three main transport pathways during four months have been identified based on the investigation of cross–city transport, namely the northwest–southeast (NW–SE) for January and April, the southeast–northwest (SE–NW) for July and October, the southwest–northeast (SW–NE) for all months, which were further confirmed by cross–region transport. Additionally, summer and winter monsoon have significant influences on the SE–NW and NW–SE pathway, respectively. Furthermore, this research draws upon a typical process of PM2.5 haze episodes from 11 to 17 October in Beijing, Tangshan and Shijiazhuang, with the aim of demonstrating flux intensity variations in different stages of haze episodes. Overall, the evolution of flux intensity at the higher–altitude layer have similar pattern to that of lower–altitude layer, in which the former was approximately 2 times the latter. Furthermore, inter–city transport along the SW–NE pathway played a crucial role before reaching the most severe stage of pollution, while the local emissions were more conductive to forming heavy pollution extremes.

However, the impact of fire disturbance on soil microbial metabolism and its relationship with plant growth remains poorly understood. Burned zones, unburned zones and transition zones with low intensity fire were surveyed in an area dominated by Carex brevicuspis communities. Results show a significant difference in soil properties, microbial biomasses, microbial carbon utilization pattern and plant growth in different zones. The lowest average value of soil carbon content, nitrogen content and moisture occurred in burned zones, while the highest occurred in unburned zones. Furthermore, soil microbes under burned zones had the highest biomasses, average well color development value and richness index. Plant growth decreased in the following order: burned > transition > unburned zones. Redundancy analysis indicated that this variation can be explained mostly by the difference of carbon utilization patterns of soil microbes. Correlation and regression analyses show that soil microbial metabolism had a significant correlation with the plant growth variables tested in this study. Overall, our results suggest that fire changes the soil microenvironment and further changes the soil microbial metabolic patterns and plant growth in the Lake Poyang wetland. © 2018, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Carex brevicuspis communities; Fire; Lake Poyang; Microbial carbon utilization; Wetland","buffer zone; burning; disturbance; ecosystem function; growth; herb; microbial community; plant community; soil carbon; soil microorganism; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Basin; Carex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045146948

To understand distribution of PFAS in plant-soil-water systems, eight perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) at three different concentrations were spiked to Juncus effusus grown in a greenhouse for 21 days. Results from this study demonstrated that mass-based plant uptake of PFAAs correlated positively with concentrations and time. On the basis of removal percentages, the higher the initial PFAA concentrations, the less removal by plant was observed. With the low level of PFAA spike, J. effusus roots and shoots accumulated 30–40% of PFAAs (C4 to C8) except PFOS with a lower uptake of approximately 20%. Together with soil sorption, >82.8% of PFAAs were removed from the aqueous solution in 21 days. Uptake of PFAAs also depended on their carbon chain length and plant compartments (roots or shoots). This dependence resulted in different bioaccumulation factors and translocation factors for different PFAAs.

Increasing engineering activities, i.e., road construction and operations, are aecting the thermal stability in permafrost regions and have already led to the degradation of permafrost and caused environmental problems. To understand the spatiotemporal influence of road construction and operations on the thermal dynamics in permafrost regions, we conducted a study in the Ela Mountain Pass where multiple roads intersect on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and calculated the thermal dynamics from 2000 to 2017 using normalized spectral entropy (measuring the disorderliness of time-series data). Our results indicate that road level is a significant influencing factor, where high-level roads (expressways) exhibit stronger thermal impacts than low-level roads (province-and county-level roads). Our results also indicate that duration of operation is the most significant factor that determines the thermal impacts of roads on permafrost: the thermal impacts of the newly paved expressway are positively related to elevation, while the thermal impacts of the old expressway are positively related to less vegetated areas. The study provides an excellent method for understanding the spatiotemporal impacts of engineering activities on the temperature dynamics in permafrost regions, thereby helping policymakers in China and other countries to better plan their infrastructure projects to avoid environmentally vulnerable regions. The study also calls for advanced techniques in road maintenance, which can reduce the accumulated disturbance of road operations on permafrost regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Entropy; Permafrost; Qinghai-tibet plateau; Road construction; Thermal impact","low temperature; motorway; permafrost; policy making; road construction; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079489931

Here, we implemented several spectral fitting methods to retrieve tropospheric NO2, SO2, and HCHO from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI), with radiative simulations providing necessary information on the interactions of scattered solar light within the atmosphere. We analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal trends of satellite-observed air pollutants over eastern China during 2005–2017, especially in heavily polluted regions. We found significant decreasing trends in NO2 and SO2 since 2011 over most regions, despite varying temporal features and turning points. In contrast, an overall increasing trend was identified for tropospheric HCHO over these regions in recent years. Furthermore, generalized additive models were implemented to understand the driving forces of air quality trends in China and assess the effectiveness of emission controls. Our results indicated that although meteorological parameters, such as wind, water vapor, solar radiation and temperature, mainly dominated the day-to-day and seasonal fluctuations in air pollutants, anthropogenic emissions played a unique role in the long-term variation in the ambient concentrations of NO2, SO2, and HCHO in the past 13 years. Generally, recent declines in NO2 and SO2 could be attributed to emission reductions due to effective air quality policies, and the opposite trends in HCHO may urge the need to control anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Air quality; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Satellites; Troposphere; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Volatile organic compounds; Water pollution; Ambient concentrations; Anthropogenic emissions; Generalized additive model; Meteorological parameters; Ozone monitoring instruments; Radiative simulation; Seasonal fluctuations; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075099393

We planted seedlings of the same species in eighteen ecological regions along a latitudinal gradient in eastern and western China, in order to explore the regulation of multi-climatic factors on active ingredient accumulation in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. The correlations between six active ingredient contents and ten climatic factors were investigated to clarify their relationships. We found that climatic factors not only regulated active ingredient contents but also markedly influenced their composition and led to a specific geospatial distribution of these active ingredients in China. The main climatic factors include the air temperature, precipitation, atmospheric vapour pressure and sunshine duration. Future warming in high-latitude regions could cause continued northward expansion of planting areas suitable for S. miltiorrhiza. The effect of extreme climatic conditions on active ingredients should not be overlooked. The findings of this study can help farmers scientifically choose suitable cultivation regions in the future.

This framework is evaluated by horizontal and vertical dimensions which assess policy actions designed to close the gap between national and local levels. Melaka is aiming to become a greener city, and its carbon reduction target is intended to support climate mitigation. This is discussed in relation to dynamic horizontal and vertical interactions at various scales. This study also examined why Melaka is considered a testing ground for climate mitigation projects that may subsequently be applied in other Malaysian states. A dual, collaborative, top-down and bottom-up approach and likely ways forward are also discussed as elements of good multi-level governance.

Hydropower development will disproportionately impact areas of high freshwater megafauna richness in South America, South and East Asia, and the Balkan region. Sub-catchments with a high share of threatened species are considered to be most vulnerable; these are located in Central America, Southeast Asia and in the regions of the Black and Caspian Sea.

Six main factors of desertification including: soil, climate, plant cover, management, erosion state and ground water situation were considered for the model approach. Then several sub-factors determining the quality of each main factor were quantified according to their quality and weighted on a scale between 1.0 and 2.0. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) software to analyze and prepare the spatial distribution of the factor layers. Subsequently, the final desertification hazard map was prepared by combining the different MEDALUS factors in Arc GIS 10.3 in order to define the final hazard classes on the basis of hazard scores based on the geometric mean of the main factors. The MEDALUS and MMEDALUS models show the “Desertification Potential” that in turn was validated with the current state of desertification observed in the field. The results show that the applied MMEDALUS approach yield significantly better results than the MEDALUS model in the study area. The results also show that the areas under severe and very severe hazard are the most extensive classes in the desertification map. Thus, we illustrate that most of the study area is sensitive to desertification. However, we highlight that management, climate and water table qualities were the most important indicators affecting the desertification processes, while soil quality seems to play a minor role in our study area. © 2019 The Authors.","Assessment; Desertification; MEDALUS; MMEDALUS","desertification; GIS; mapping; modeling; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; soil quality; water table; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078479491

Surveys find that public acceptance of the mining industry is low, particularly in the EU, suggesting that mining conflicts may increase in both number and intensity. Conflict usually occurs in places where a significant number of local actors mobilize resistance against a mining company. Their success is dependent on the emergence of a broader social movement that jumps to the relevant scale of regulation, often the national level. Despite this, very little attention is being paid to the emergence of such a movement, as well as to the state and its institutions, in studies on mining conflicts. Most research into mining conflicts examines developing countries, while mining resistance is an emerging issue also in developed nations, not least in the Arctic. Understanding mining resistance is important in avoiding or addressing conflicts that can be costly for companies, communities, and the state. This paper explores the relationship between state politics and mining resistance at the national level, drawing on social movement research and the concept of political opportunity structures. The results show that confrontational mining resistance will grow at the national level when the state offers little access nor influence to mining-sceptical actors in either policy formulation or implementation, and where there is a sufficient number of simultaneously ongoing contested licensing processes. In cases where indigenous people are involved, weak or contested indigenous rights may also spur resistance. © 2019 The Authors","Conflict; Governance; Mining; National mineral policy; Political opportunity structures; Social movements","Developing countries; Minerals; Mining; Conflict; Energy transitions; Governance; Indigenous people; Licensing process; Mineral policies; Policy formulation; Social movements; Mineral exploration; conflict management; environmental politics; European Union; governance approach; indigenous population; mining; social movement; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072623739

Thus, carbon emission from deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and increasing vulnerability of coastal communities are inevitable. TERANGI together with ICCTF initiated Belitung Mangrove Park (BMP) to convert inactive tin mining in Seberang Bersatu Community Forest, Belitung, into a mangrove tourism park. Local community were trained in ecotourism management, mangrove rehabilitation, ecosystem monitoring, tour guiding, promotion, and financial management. The total carbon stock in Juru Sebrang Community Forest equalled to 4,704.159 tonnes with unequal distribution. Mangrove rehabilitation was conducted over a 1.5 ha with current carbon stock of 3 tonnes. In order to support low-carbon ecotourism activities, two solar power electric generator were installed and able to reduce emissions of 872 kg CO2/year. The local community was able to develop, promote, and manage ecotourism activities independently, and increased their group assets, from IDR 698,014,118 to IDR 18,655,700,000 just within 18 months. Tourist visits increased from around 3,000 visits/month to 14,000 visits/month.

The Jurassic non-marine deposits are well developed and cropped out in the basin. The Middle Jurassic Yan’an Formation is rich in coal and contains diverse plant remains. We recognize 40 species in 25 genera belonging to mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycadophytes, ginkgoaleans, czekanowskialeans and conifers. This flora is attributed to the early Middle Jurassic Epoch, possibly the Aalenian-Bajocian. The climate of the Ordos Basin during the Middle Jurassic was warm and humid with seasonal temperature and precipitation fluctuations. The result tends to support the palaeophytogeographic/palaeoclimatic setting of the Ordos Basin in the North Floristic Province, or the North Chinese Province in the warm temperate zone during the Middle Jurassic. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","China; Middle Jurassic; Ordos Basin; Palaeoclimate; Palaeophytogeography; Plant diversity; Yan’an Formation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081607993

Many studies on the relationship between urbanization and the supply and demand of ES have been conducted. However, studies on the process and trend of the conflict between ES supply and demand, as well as the spatial differences, are lacking. Developing countries around the world are experiencing rapid urbanization. The aim of this study was to summarize the relationship between urbanization and the supply and demand of ES in China. China has experienced rapid urbanization since the reform and opening up, and the urban population reached 56.10% in 2015. Urban sprawl was twice that of population expansion, and led to a loss in value of ES. We calculated the loss in value of the five ES (food production, water conservation, climate regulation, habitat support and cultural service) due to the increase in construction area by means of spatial analysis. The total loss was US $110.95 billion in China from 1985 to 2015. This result indicated that the increases in construction land area had a negative impact on ES. At the same time, there was a conflict between the scarcity index of ES and their loss in value. The leading cause of this conflict was that economic development was highly dependent on the area of urban construction land. The results suggested that we should adopt “intensive” and “compact” strategic development models, quantify the value of ES, focus on the conflict between the loss in value and ES supply, and try our best to reduce the decline in ES in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; Conflict; ES; Land use; Scarcity index; Urbanization","Developing countries; Economics; Einsteinium; Land use; Urban growth; Water conservation; China; Conflict; Economic development; Land use and land cover change; Scarcity index; Strategic development; Urbanization; Value of ecosystem services; Ecosystems; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; future prospect; land cover; land use; supply chain management; urban sprawl; urbanization; article; China; climate; developing country; economic development; food industry; habitat; human; land use; spatial analysis; urban population; urbanization; water conservation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071611966

Typical metal resistance genes (MRGs), pathogenic bacterial indicators, the bacterial community, and wastewater properties were also explored to determine their effects on the fates of ARGs. Results indicated that the purification process could hardly effectively remove ARGs’ prevalence. 3.1 × 104–7.1 × 108 copies/L were present after purification, and 4%–57% of them persisted in the subsequent creek and adjacent soil. 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that the discharge of wastewater significantly changed the bacterial community in receiving creek and soil. Molecular ecological networks analysis detected the wide co-occurrence among ARGs, MRGs, and PBGs, which could further facilitate the propagation of antibiotic resistance. ARG incidence and specific bacterial genera were closely correlated, suggesting an extensive hosting relationship. Redundancy analyses showed wastewater organics and nutrients showed positive correlation to most ARGs’ abundance, but negatively correlated to their relative abundance. Practitioner points: Fate of five ARGs and intI was studied in a swine wastewater treatment system. The treatment process could not effectively reduce ARGs’ abundance. ARGs and pathogens in wastewater were transferred to the receiving creek and soil. The network analysis found wide co-occurrence among ARGs, metal resistance genes, and pathogens.

The geochemical carbon sequestration processes (CO2-water-rock interaction and mineral capture) known as the ""capture-rereaction"" model, are considered to be the most effective means of long-term CO2 storage, since the saline aquifers are covered with thick saline-alkali soils, once CO2 is involved in rock weathering or mineralization, it will become a part of the geological structure that can hardly be released again. This review provides an important reference for the carbon sequestration mechanism of arid underground saline-alkali aquifers, and is helpful for the estimation of regional carbon balance and the mitigation of Greenhouse Effect. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aquifers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Greenhouse effect; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Minerals; Weathering; Carbon sequestration; Formation mechanism; Geological structures; Groundwater aquifer; Inorganic carbon; Saline aquifers; Saline-alkali soils; Water rock interactions; Saline water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076984730

This study explores the cradle-to-gate life cycle environmental impacts of amine solvent based carbon capture systems on U.S. ammonia production, petroleum refineries, supercritical and subcritical pulverized coal power plants, and natural gas combined cycle plants. We use publicly available data to create comprehensive life cycle inventories for petroleum refining and ammonia production for 2014. We use these processes and additional modeled carbon capture processes to compare carbon capture on ammonia production and petroleum refining to inventories for coal and natural gas fired electricity with carbon capture. This analysis found that particulate matter formation potential, eutrophication potential, and water consumption increase in all sectors as a result of installation and operation of CCS technologies per kg CO2e abated, while the effect on acidification potential and particulate mater formation potential is mixed. The differences in tradeoffs among systems are driven primarily by three factors: the combustion emissions from fuel used to operate the capture unit, the upstream supply chain to obtain that fuel, and the relative impact of the carbon capture unit on baseline flue gas emissions (i.e. possible co-benefits from capture). © 2019","Ammonia; Carbon capture; Life cycle assessment; Petroleum refining; Thermoelectric power","Ammonia; Carbon capture; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Combined cycle power plants; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refineries; Petroleum refining; Pulverized fuel; Supply chains; Thermoelectric power; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Environmental life cycle assessment; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Natural gas combined cycle plants; Particulate matter formations; Pulverized coal power plant; Life cycle; ammonia; carbon sequestration; comparative study; electricity generation; life cycle analysis; refining industry; thermal power; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073594496

In Japan, a reduction in the carbon monoxide content of domestic gas supply began in the early 1970s, and carbon monoxide emissions standards of new passenger cars were significantly strengthened in 1978. However, little is known about the impact of detoxification of these gases on gassing-related suicides in Japan. Therefore, we examined the changing patterns of suicide due to domestic gas or car exhaust gas inhalation by gender and age in Japan between 1968 and 1994. METHODS: Suicide mortality data were obtained from the Vital Statistics of Japan. In this study, age was divided into four groups: 15-24, 25-44, 45-64 and 65+ years. Method of suicide was divided into three groups: domestic gas, car exhaust gas and non-gases. We calculated method-specific age-standardised suicide rates by gender within each of the four age groups. We applied joinpoint regression to the data and quantified the observed changes. RESULTS: Suicide rates by domestic gas, regardless of gender and age, increased from 1968 to the mid-1970s and then decreased sharply. The proportion of all suicides accounted for by domestic gas was comparatively high in the mid-1970s among females aged 15-24 and 25-44 years, while for other gender-age-groups the proportion of domestic gas suicides remained small, even at the peak. For females aged 15-44 years, the decrease in domestic gas suicides appeared to cause a substantial decrease in overall suicides in this gender/age group. Car exhaust gas was a more common method for males, particularly those aged 25-64 years. Car exhaust gas suicide rates for males aged 25-64 years peaked in the mid-1980s, followed by a sharp decrease. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the carbon monoxide content of the domestic gas, which began in the early 1970s in Japan, was associated with a decrease in domestic gas suicides for both genders of all ages. Concerning females aged 15-44 years, a decrease in domestic gas suicides caused a substantial decrease in overall suicides in this gender/age group since the proportion of domestic gas suicides among all suicides combined was comparatively large. However, it remains uncertain whether the introduction of catalytic converters in the 1970s in Japan resulted in a reduction of suicides from car exhaust gas inhalation.","Community mental health; epidemiology; population survey; social factors; suicide","adolescent; adult; age distribution; carbon monoxide intoxication; exhaust gas; female; gas poisoning; health survey; human; intoxication; Japan; male; middle aged; psychology; sex ratio; suicide; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Female; Gas Poisoning; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Sex Distribution; Suicide; Vehicle Emissions; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074741887

This paper established an indirect method of measurement for determining Vd: the indirect method was derived from a closed system (smog chamber), and an exponential attenuation model was used to measure the decline in PM2.5 concentration under conditions caused by hanging leaves in the chamber, and an empty chamber without leaves, respectively. The value of Vd was thus calculated by fitting data to prevent inaccurate results caused by a single measurement error. The experimental conditions such as initial concentration, test duration, and time interval (Δt) were then determined from empirical observations. The equation showed that Vd could be determined only by measuring the attenuation rate constant, k, and the leaf area, LA. Although the particle size, tested tree species and some other experimental conditions may affect the determination results of Vd, the values of Vd tested by indirect method were still within scientifically acceptable range. Overall, along with the traditional wind tunnel method, the indirect measurement is considered as the complement for a less expensive and easier way to determine Vd, and offers a novel idea that Vd might be gained by attenuation equation, and can augment the choices for researchers to quantify the ability of retaining particles. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Deposition velocity (Vd); Exponential attenuation model; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Indirect method; Plant leaves","air quality; concentration (composition); deposition velocity; dry deposition; experimental study; greenspace; leaf; numerical model; particulate matter; urban atmosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073105444

In China, agricultural sources contribute to the majority of ammonia emissions. It is necessary and valuable to explore air quality improvements caused by the mitigation of agricultural ammonia emissions. The purpose of this study was to quantify the reduction effects on PM2.5 and secondary inorganic aerosols by performing air quality simulations based on the developed agricultural ammonia emission inventory at the county-level within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The results demonstrated that the total NH3 emission in the BTH region was 1625.03 Gg in 2015. Livestock manure spreading represented 58% of the total emissions (941.79 Gg NH3), while synthetic fertilizer applications accounted for the remaining 42% of the emissions. Spatially, the agricultural ammonia emissions were generally distributed over the southern BTH regions (Handan and Shijiazhuang) due to the intensive agricultural activities in this area. Temporally, the agricultural ammonia emissions peaked during summer, consistent with variations in temperature and agricultural practices. Compared to the baseline scenario, the annual average PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH region were reduced by 2.57%, 5.08%, and 5.71%, respectively, under the Progressive (NH3 emission cut by 21.26%), Stringent (NH3 emission cut by 45.58%), and Complex (NH3 emission cut by 46.63%) scenarios. Moreover, under the same conditions, secondary inorganic aerosols such as sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium were alleviated by 2.94–6.85%, 3.45–17.9%, and 4.24–23.32%, respectively. The results confirmed that mitigating ammonia emissions could lead to the considerable reduction of nitrate, followed by ammonium. In contrast, the impact on sulfate was relatively limited. This study could provide helpful and reliable evidence to determine effective mitigation measures and control strategies for policy makers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural ammonia emission; PM2.5; Reduction effect; Secondary inorganic aerosols; WRF-CMAQ","Aerosols; Agriculture; Air pollution control; Air quality; Fertilizers; Nitrates; Sulfur compounds; Ammonia emissions; PM2.5; Reduction effects; Secondary inorganic aerosol; WRF-CMAQ; Ammonia; ammonia; nitrate; nitrogen fertilizer; sulfate; aerosol composition; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; fertilizer application; inorganic compound; manure; particulate matter; pollution control; sulfate; aerosol; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; environmental temperature; fertilizer application; livestock; manure; nonhuman; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); simulation; summer; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073102375

The morphology of CIS/Au/PCN can be well adjusted through the formation of Au−S covalent bond and the electrostatic adsorption between Au and PCN during the hydrothermal process. Furthermore, the intimate interface contact inside CIS/Au/PCN heterojunction was indeed constructed, which may promote the charges separation and transfer process at the interface as evidenced by ESR spectra and time-resolved PL spectra. Under visible light illumination, the CIS/Au/PCN exhibited an enhanced CO (19.46 μmol/g) and CH4 (1.18 μmol/g) yield in CO2 reduction, which was about 5.04 times and 2.03 times higher than pure PCN.

We used data from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas version 5, which include about 2 million pCO2 measurements in the tropical Pacific. Unlike many previous studies that estimated pCO2 fields from relationships with other variables like sea surface temperature, we developed gridded products of monthly means using a technique to interpolate measured pCO2 values. Large seasonal variation of pCO2 appears in the cold tongue region (EQ–20°S, east of 120°W) corresponding to the seasonal variation of coastal upwelling, and in the off-equatorial region where the thermodynamic effect on pCO2 dominates. Consistent with previous findings, pCO2 along the equator declines during El Niño due to weakening of the easterly winds and therefore reduced upwelling of CO2 rich subsurface water. We also quantified the spatial distribution of the long-term pCO2 trend beyond the area-averaged trend presented previously. The long-term trend of pCO2 is positive in all regions with an area average of 1.8 ± 0.1 μatm yr−1. However, along the equator the trend is &gt; 2 μatm yr−1 linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation forcing. Using the same methodology, we also analyzed about 20,000 surface nutrient measurements from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project version 2, World Ocean Database 2013, and ship-of-opportunity sampling by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan. We present the spatial patterns of reduced surface nutrient concentration in the central to eastern tropics along the equator during El Niño, but there are not enough data to characterize the trends of nutrients in the tropical Pacific. Decorrelation analyses are also applied using covariance between pCO2 anomalies separated by a lag increment for zonal, meridional, and temporal directions. The e-folding scale of pCO2 is estimated to be 6° in latitude, 13° in longitude, and 2 months with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4, which are used as input for the interpolation as well as an assessment of ideal observation density and frequency. Decorrelation analyses such as this are critical for evaluating existing observing system design and informing future sampling strategies. © 2019 The Authors",,"Carbon dioxide; Nutrients; Oceanography; Signal to noise ratio; Tropics; Environmental studies; Nutrient concentrations; Observing system designs; Pacific decadal oscillation; Sea surface temperature (SST); Ship of opportunities; Spatiotemporal variability; Water partial pressure; Surface waters; carbon dioxide; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; signal-to-noise ratio; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water; Japan; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075437752

MSW incineration for power generation is playing an increasingly important role in MSW management in China. In order to study the reduction of GHG emissions caused by MSW incineration for power generation, the GHG emissions under the baseline level is calculated by using Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) methodology. Then, the GHG emission reduction is estimated based on the improved upstream-operation-downstream (UOD) framework. Finally, the GHG emission reduction in Beijing is studied and forecasted through grey prediction model and scenario analysis, and the main factors affecting the reduction potential are identified. The results show that the GHG emission reduction target can be achieved through MSW incineration for power generation. Direct and alternative GHG emissions from MSW incineration are the main sources of emissions, while indirect emissions account for a small proportion. The MSW disposal volume, the moisture content of MSW, the installed capacity of biomass energy, the average line loss of power generation and the quantity of fossil fuels consumed by power generation are five important factors that affecting GHG emission reduction potential.

Using the “synthetic” NO2 vertical column densities (VCD) simulated from a hypothetical “true” emission inventory, the top-down estimates of NOX emissions for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region at 9 km resolution and the Southern Jiangsu City Cluster (SJC) at 3 km resolution were obtained using various inverse modeling approaches and the a priori emissions for January and July 2012. The normalized mean biases (NMBs) between the top-down and the hypothetical “true” emissions for all the cases were smaller than 6%, which indicates that both linear and nonlinear approaches could effectively constrain the total amount of emissions, with limited influence from spatial resolution, a priori emissions, and seasons. Larger differences for most cases were found for the normalized mean errors (NMEs), implying that the inverse modeling approach and other influencing factors played a more important role on the spatial distribution of the top-down estimates. Two NO2 VCD products from real satellite observation (Dutch OMI NO2 data product v2 (DOMINO v2) and Peking University OMI NO2 data product v2 (POMINO v2)) were then applied to emissions constraints. The NMEs between the top-down estimates derived from the two products were calculated at 182% and 99% for January and July, respectively, indicating the great importance of satellite observation in constraining emissions. With the nonlinear inverse modeling approach, the top-down estimates of NOX emissions based on POMINO v2 were 25%–60% smaller than the national bottom-up inventory for the four seasons in the YRD, which indicates overestimation by the bottom-up method due to the insufficient consideration of recent air pollution control policy. At the 9 km resolution, the simulated NO2 concentrations with air quality modeling based on the top-down estimates were much closer to available ground observation than the bottom-up ones for all seasons, which suggests improved emissions estimation from the inverse model at regional scales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","NOX emissions; Satellite observation; Top-down estimate; YRD","Air pollution control; Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; River pollution; Satellites; Air quality modeling; Emission inventories; Emissions estimation; NOx emissions; Satellite observations; Topdown; Vertical column densities; Yangtze river delta; Inverse problems; nitrogen oxide; abundance estimation; atmospheric pollution; emission; estimation method; modeling; nitric oxide; pollution control; satellite; seasonal variation; spatial distribution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; model; nonlinear inverse modeling; observation; priority journal; seasonal variation; spatial analysis; summer; synthetic satellite observation; winter; China; Jiangsu; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073820190

This is particularly true for tropical forests in the Amazon region, as these comprise approximately 50% of the world's tropical forests. It is therefore important for us to understand and represent the processes that determine the fluxes and storage of carbon in these forests. In this study, we show that the implementation of phosphorus (P) cycle and P limitation in the version 1 of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model land model (ELM v1) improves simulated spatial pattern of wood productivity. The P-enabled ELM v1 is able to capture the declining west-to-east gradient of productivity, consistent with field observations. We also show that by improving the representation of mortality processes using soils data, ELMv1 is able to reproduce the observed spatial pattern of above ground biomass. Our model simulations show that the consideration of P availability leads to a smaller carbon sink associated with CO2 fertilization effect and lower carbon emissions due to land use and land cover change. Our simulations suggest P limitation would significantly reduce the carbon sink associated with CO2 fertilization effects through the 21st century. We conclude that P cycle dynamics affect both sources and sinks of carbon in the Amazon region, and the effects of P limitation would become increasingly important as CO2 increases. Therefore, P limitation must be considered for projecting future carbon dynamics in tropical ecosystems. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

The respective contribution of precipitation (P) and temperature (T) to evapotranspiration (ET) and hydrological regimes (annual mean runoff, high flow, and low flow) were also quantified using the analysis of variance method (ANOVA). For the scenario period (2031–2060), the projected runoff is projected to increase in vary between 11.33% and 64.08% in winter, while increases in summer range from 8.64% to 40.97%. The changes in ET are different depending on the climate mode used; these increase during winter and decrease in summer under the influence of temperature. In addition, we found that low flows are projected to decrease while the mean annual runoff will increase in the future period. These projected changes demonstrated that temperature effects dominate in the study area for the future period under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario. © 2019","ANOVA method; Climate change signal; Delta change method; Hydrological regimes","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Climate models; Rivers; Runoff; Adaptation policies; Analysis of variance method; Delta change method; Hydrological regime; Mean annual runoffs; Middle and lower yangtze rivers; Spatiotemporal variability; Variable infiltration capacity models; Climate change; climate change; CMIP; coastal morphology; evapotranspiration; future prospect; hydrological modeling; hydrological regime; precipitation (climatology); temperature; variance analysis; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069640515

China faces particularly severe pressures and challenges in transportation carbon reduction. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2015, this study explored the influencing factors and spatial spillover effects of TC by estimating spatial panel data models. It found that China's TC will continue to increase in the future, because the increase in per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is the primary driving force to accelerate the growth of TC, but an increasing proportion of tertiary industry (PTI) in the national economy will help reduce the growth in emissions. Moreover, urban road density (URD) and per capita highway mileage (PHM) are the other two major factors promoting the growth of TC. In contrast, urban population density (UPD) has a negative direct impact on per capita CO2 emissions from transportation (PTC) but also has a larger positive spatial spillover effect, which indicates that these three factors should be properly planned and controlled. Meanwhile, we should actively advocate the development of urban public transport because it plays an important role on reducing TC. The conclusions provide important inspiration and a scientific basis for formulating policies to effectively curb the growth of CO2 emissions in China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; CO2 emissions from transportation; Influencing factors; Spatial panel data model; Spatial spillover effect","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Population statistics; Urban growth; China; CO2 emissions; Influencing factors; Spatial panel data models; Spillover effects; Urban transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental policy; panel data; pollution tax; public transport; spatial analysis; spillover effect; traffic emission; Article; calculation; carbon footprint; China; climate change; environmental impact; mathematical analysis; population density; population research; priority journal; spatial autocorrelation analysis; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070792879

We examined three types of policies for EVs formulated by the Chinese government since 2010. Aiming to understand consumers' perceptions of these policies and their impacts on adoption intentions, a survey was sent to potential vehicle consumers in urban China. The survey asked respondents about their cognitions of EVs, including environmental performance and vehicle property, and their perceptions toward three types of incentive policies and their adoption intentions. Results show that consumers' adoption intentions of EVs are determined by product cognition toward EVs and perceptions of incentive policies. Respondents’ perceptions of policies are also diverse when grouped according to different demographic characteristics.

However, human beings usually focus on the benefits they can gain from the ecosystem by developing the land and ignore the degradation of environment. In this paper, we will offer an ecological services evaluation model to measure the value of ecological services and provide land use planners with a method to compute the true economic costs of the land use development projects. First, we define ecological services value (ESV), which means the value of the benefits that ecosystem can provide. Then, we classify the functions of ecosystem into five kinds: water purification, climate regulation, air purification, biodiversity conservation and vegetation conservation. For each function, we choose a related index to measure the performance. After the classification, we adopt Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to calculate the weight for each of the function and do the consistency test; second, we apply knowledge of economics to study the true economic costs; third, after getting the equation of the true economic costs, we realize it in the cost-benefit analysis. We offer two case studies to analyze the small community-sized project and large national project respectively; fourth, we take ten examples including U.S., Switzerland and China to apply our model in practice. We fit data and find the average level of land use percent over time, and form a model with differential equation in order to calculate the time-varying model of ESV; fifth, we focus on humanities field to explore the impacts on land use project planners and managers. They should not only be responsible for environmental degradation and monitor environmental index carefully, but also pay for the benefits which were ever owned by human beings before land development. In order to make our work more accurate and complete, we use SWOT Analysis across the analytical process. Finally, we promote our model and extend the factors from six to twelve, which increases the accuracy. © 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Air cleaners; Biodiversity; Costs; Differential equations; Economics; Ecosystems; Energy conservation; Historic preservation; Land use; Planning; Pollution control; Thermal pollution; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Analytical process; Biodiversity conservation; Development project; Ecological services; Environmental index; Evaluation modeling; Time-varying models; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076779323

To do so, we incorporate weather simulations with commute-adjusted population profiles over 16 major U.S. metropolitan areas. Urban residents’ exposure to heat waves is intensified by 1.9° ± 0.7°C (mean ± SD among cities), and their exposure to cold waves is attenuated by 0.6° ± 0.8°C. The higher than expected exposure to heat waves significantly correlates with the spatial temperature variability and requires serious attention.

In this regard, this study constructs a regional contribution index of different factors through an extended LMDI (Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index) method and investigates regional differences in factors driving the changes of China's major APEs (SO 2, NO x, and PM 2.5). It reveals that the regional emission efficiency effect was a key inhibitory factor on APEs, which was more obvious in the eastern and northern regions. The regional energy intensity had greater inhibitory effects on SO 2 and NO x than on PM 2.5, and these inhibitory effects were more obvious in the eastern region. The regional population structure promoted APEs for northern, southern, northeastern, and eastern regions, and inhibited APEs for central, southwestern, and northwestern regions. The regional relative income had a slight effect, which curbed APEs for northern, eastern, southern, and northern regions. The national economic growth effect was the key factor in promoting APEs, which was obvious in eastern and northern regions, followed by southern, central, and southwestern regions.

Assessing the impact of emission control strategies on O3 levels is complicated by the disturbance of meteorological factors. This study employs a statistical methodology named generalized additive model (GAM) to characterize the relationship between meteorological factors and ozone levels as well as to meteorologically adjust the ozone trends in Tianjin from 2009 to 2015. The results indicate that the afternoon temperature and the morning solar radiation are the leading meteorological factors controlling O3 in Tianjin. GAM proves to be an effective tool in predicting ozone levels, because it could capture 40–77% of the variance in the daily ozone maxima for different seasons. Only 3–5 parameters are incorporated into the final model for each season. During summer months, the most important explanatory variables are those influencing the photochemical production. Whereas in winter, ozone destruction by titration with NO is the dominant mechanism affecting the O3 levels. After adjustment for meteorological effect, general upward trends are evident in ozone levels, which is − 0.34, 0.97, 0.70 and 0.12 ppb year−1 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively, indicating that the emission reduction strategies in Tianjin from 2009 to 2015 appear to be more beneficial in reducing the effect of O3 loss using titration rather than mitigating the photochemical pollution. The clear rising tendency of yearly medians of the meteorologically adjusted ozone (0.24 ppb year−1) strongly suggests formulating a specialized mitigation strategy for regional O3 pollution. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"assessment method; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; ozone; seasonal variation; solar radiation; trend analysis; urban area; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062789009

However, from the projected air quality and associated health impacts it is not known if the updated emission limits have been completely followed. Here, we develop emission inventories based on the emission limits at different stages and use the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model and health impact function to determine the potential air quality and health impacts for different scenarios. We found that full implementation of the special emission standards would decrease PM2.5 concentrations by over 25% in April, July and October, and decrease O3 concentrations in July by 10%-20%. Overall, the number of PM2.5-related premature deaths could be reduced by 0.15 million (95% confidence level 0.13-0.17 million) if special emission limits were met and that O3-related premature deaths would decrease by 18oo (95% confidence level 500-3000). However, even with these special emission limits, a greater than 25% increase in O3 levels occurred in northern China during October, January and April, leading to an increase in O3-related premature deaths in northern provinces which would offset the decrease in provincial PM2.5-related mortality by 10%-20%. These findings indicate that emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) should be reduced to avoid increases in O3 in VOC-limited provinces. Despite the increase in O3 in certain provinces, improvement of industrial emission standards could greatly limit PM2.5 pollution and reduce the associated health burden. Therefore, we suggest that government should accelerate full implementation of strict emission standards in order to improve air quality. © 2019 The Author(s).

A biogas fermentation inoculum adapted to be active at 9°C was used in a 10-L batch-type temperature-controlled fermentor, using pig manure as the raw material. Fermentation at 9°C was followed for 120 days. A combination of nonbiological and biological factors was analyzed. Species were identified from OTU analysis based on 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and correlation analysis was used to study the effect of nonbiological factors, bacterial communities, and archaea communities. Biogas production was most effective between days 50 and 90, where gas production was above 0.70 L/d and the CH4 yield was above 0.36 L/g-volatile solid. The relative abundance of the first dominant bacterial OTU with 99% identity to Clostridium cellulovorans varied between 16.17% and 27.30%. These bacteria typically degrade cellulose and hemicellulose. The second dominant bacterial OTU (relative abundance 15.23%-27.15%) was 99% identical to Terrisporobacter petrolearius, a typical fermentative species. The most abundant (4.15%-37.14%) archaeal OTU was 98% identical to Methanocorpusculum sinense, which is a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen. A low-temperature biogas metabolic pathway was constructed, based on abundant bacterial and methanogen OTUs. The most suitable metabolic pathway describes that hydrogen is produced by one part of the community and then used to reduce the produced carbon dioxide into CH4; this seems to be the major pathway by which biogas is produced under low-temperature conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

As one of the infrastructures of buildings, energy systems are crucial to control overall energy consumption and associated emissions. Despite much consideration on improving the efficiency of buildings energy system and the utilization of renewable energy, there has been little discussion on the carbon footprint quantification of building distributed energy systems as well as the reduction potentiality. In such a context, this paper proposed a life cycle economic and carbon emissions assessment framework by dividing the building distributed energy system into five stages. Subsequently, a multi-objective mathematical model is developed with minimal life cycle cost and carbon footprint, while respecting energy balance and technical constraints, and the optimal energy system and the carbon footprint distribution are obtained by solving the model. Finally, a case study is conducted on the building energy system design in a district in Xuzhou to test the effectiveness of this method. The correlation between optimal energy system carbon footprint by facility attributes, and the distribution of energy system carbon footprint by stage and source are investigated. It's found that the carbon emissions in the operation and maintenance stage accounts for the largest share in the entire life cycle. In addition, the proportion of carbon emissions from natural gas is the highest, accounting for 65–73% under environmental optimization and 85–88% under economic optimization. Followed by electricity, with a share of 26–34% and 10–14% under environmental and economic optimization, respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to analyze the impact of energy carbon emission factors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building distributed energy system; Carbon footprint; Life cycle assessment; Multi-objective mathematical programming; Sensitivity analysis","Artificial life; Buildings; Distributed computer systems; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Mathematical programming; Sensitivity analysis; Stages; Building energy systems; Carbon emission factors; Distributed energy systems; Economic optimization; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi-objective mathematical programming; Operation and maintenance; Primary energy consumption; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070808716

The process of fruiting‐body development in Lentinula edodes is complex and is greatly affected by environmental conditions. In this paper, 14 multicopper oxidase‐encoding (laccase) genes were analyzed in the draft genome sequence of L. edodes strain W1‐26, followed by a search of multiple stress‐related Cis‐elements in the promoter region of these laccase genes, and then a transcription profile analysis of 14 laccase genes (Lelcc) under the conditions of different carbon sources, temperatures, and photoperiods. All laccase genes were significantly regulated by varying carbon source materials. The expression of only two laccase genes (Lelcc5 and Lelcc6) was induced by sodium‐lignosulphonate and the expression of most laccase genes was specifically upregulated in glucose medium. Under different temperature conditions, the expression levels of most laccase genes decreased at 39 °C and transcription was significantly increased for Lelcc1, Lelcc4, Lelcc5, Lelcc9, Lelcc12, Lelcc13, and Lelcc14 after induction for 24 h at 10 °C, indicating their involvement in primordium differentiation. Tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin synthesis, was clustered with the same group as Lelcc4 and Lelcc7 in all the different photoperiod treatments. Meanwhile, five laccase genes (Lelcc8, Lelcc9, Lelcc12, Lelcc13, and Lelcc14) showed similar expression profiles to that of two blue light receptor genes (LephrA and LephrB) in the 12 h light/12 h dark treatment, suggesting the involvement of laccase genes in the adaptation process of L. edodes to the changing environment and fruiting‐body formation. This study contributes to our understanding of the function of the different Lelcc genes and facilitates the screening of key genes from the laccase gene family for further functional research. © 2019 by the authors.

Here we ask: does urban vegetation provide more cooling arranged in fewer and larger patches or more numerous but smaller patches in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA? We hypothesized the combination of energy exchanges between adjacent patches and microclimate cooling induced by vegetation are key processes determining how configuration affects LST. Using high resolution thermal data (7 m), we evaluated predictions from this hypothesis through a multiple scale analysis spanning from within individual patches to among neighborhoods. We found tree cover is the dominant factor influencing urban cooling and that tree and grass configurations also substantially affect cooling, with effects generally exceeding 40% that of tree cover. The effects of tree and grass cover and configuration on LST were scale-dependent and reflect differences from within individual patches to among neighborhoods. In general, greater edge density and shape complexities of vegetation patches cool the landscape but may warm individual vegetation patches. Conversely, increasing individual vegetation patch size and reducing shape complexity may lead to cooler vegetation patches but a hotter landscape. Our findings suggest more edge area strengthens energy exchanges between vegetation and surroundings and more vegetation core area lead to greater cooling within individual patches. Through applications of high resolution thermal remote sensing, we are able to more directly connect effects of land cover composition and configuration to LST distributions that can help cities plan and evaluate local climate adaptation strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Configuration; MASTER; Microclimate; Remote sensing; Scale; Urban; Vegetation","cooling; grass; land cover; landscape structure; metropolitan area; microclimate; patch size; remote sensing; urban area; Arizona; Phoenix; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070950998

In China, after implementation of aggressive emissions control measures under the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (2013–2017), air quality has significantly improved. In this work, we investigated changes in PM2.5 exposure and the associated health impacts in China for the period 2013–2017. We used an optimal estimator of PM2.5 combining in-situ observations, satellite measurements, and simulations from a chemical transport model to derive the spatial and temporal variations in PM2.5 exposure, and then used well-developed exposure-response functions to estimate the premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 exposure. We found that national population-weighed annual mean PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 67.4 µg m−3 in 2013 to 45.5 µg m−3 in 2017 (32% reduction). This rapid decrease in PM2.5 pollution led to a 14% reduction in premature deaths due to long-term exposure. We estimated that, during 2013–2017, the premature deaths attributable to long-term PM2.5 exposure decreased from 1.2 million (95% CI: 1.0, 1.3; fraction of total mortality: 13%) in 2013 to 1.0 million (95% CI: 0.9, 1.2; 10%) in 2017. Despite the rapid decrease in annual mean PM2.5 concentrations, health benefits associated with reduced long-term exposure were limited, because for many cities, the PM2.5 levels remain at the portion where the exposure-response function is less steeper than that at the low-concentration end. We also found that the deaths associated with acute exposure decreased by 61% during 2013–2017 due to rapid reduction in the number of heavily polluted days. Our results confirm that clean air policies in China have mitigated the air pollution crisis; however, continuous emissions reduction efforts are required to protect citizens from air pollution. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Action plan of air pollution prevention and control; Air quality improvement; Health impact assessment; Mortality; PM2.5","Air quality; Emission control; Environmental protection; Quality control; Air pollution prevention; Air quality improvement; Health impact assessment; Mortality; PM2.5; Health; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health impact; health risk; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069660021

And the assessment of atmospheric environmental governance across China has also become an important basis for environmental compliance. General weather forecasting models only consider the information of atmospheric pollutants, which ignores the impact of emission reduction measures promulgated by government departments. In order to solve this problem and achieve more exact and realistic assessment, this paper establishes environmental countermeasures impact assessment of central China (Hubei, Jiangsu, Shaanxi and Sichuan) through AIM/Technology and WRF/CMAQ models. The model can combine the basic air pollution data with local government policies to achieve accurate numerical weather prediction. In this work, the air pollution control policies formulated by the four provinces from 2012 to 2014 are used to assess whether the atmospheric environment in 2017 meets the standards. The assessment results show that in the past five years, most of cities with a 10% reduction target in central China can achieve emission reduction targets, but cities with a target of 20% emission reduction target are difficult to achieve the target. Through the assessment of the impacts of atmospheric environmental governance policies in Hubei, Jiangsu, Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces, it proves that our proposed estimation framework is a necessary and effective tool to test the impact of air pollution control in other areas with scarce observation points in China. © 2019 IEEE.","Chinese government policy; IPAC-AIM/Technology; PM observation; WRF/CMAQ","Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Emission control; Weather forecasting; Chinese Government; Emission reduction targets; Environmental compliance; Environmental governances; IPAC-AIM/Technology; Numerical weather prediction; Weather forecasting model; WRF/CMAQ; Public policy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080881577

Leaf PM accumulation capacity will saturate in the absence of runoff. Rainfall is an effective way for PM to “wash off” into the soil and renew leaf PM accumulation. However, little is known about how PM wash-off varies with PM size and health problems caused by particulate pollution vary with PM size. This study thus used artificial rainfall with six plant species to find out how size-fractioned PM are washed off during rain processes. Total wash-off masses in fine, coarse and large fractions were 0.6–10.3 μg/cm2, 1.0–18.8 μg/cm2 and 4.5–60.1 μg/cm2 respectively. P. orientalis (cypress) and E. japonicus (evergreen broadleaved shrub) had the largest wash-off masses in each fraction during rainfall. P. cerasifera (deciduous broadleaved shrub) had the largest cumulative wash-off rates in each fraction. Rainfall intensity had more influence on wash-off masses and rates of large particles for six species and for small particles in evergreen species, but limited effect on wash-off proportions. Wash-off proportions decreased in large particles and increased in small particles along with rainfall.

We apply two approaches to project future climate change: an ensemble of temperature and precipitation perturbations on the historical record and an ensemble of global and regional climate models. We incorporate climate projections into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to estimate daily streamflow, then quantify flood risk using indices related to flood probability, duration, magnitude, and frequency. Results indicate rising temperatures may counteract small increases in precipitation, likely due to increased evapotranspiration. Climate model data without bias correction used in SWAT produced reasonable future streamflow changes—similar to the perturbation of historical climate—therefore retaining the predicted change in the flood frequency distribution.

Urban land planning shapes the urban form and is considered to be an effective approach for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, there is little knowledge about what urban forms can reduce both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate stresses while considering trade-offs between them. Here, we investigate the role of urban land use in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, we assess quantitatively the competition between strategies for mitigation and adaptation and identify potential win-win solutions in land use responses. Using a coastal city as a case study, we find that the land use strategies for unilateral mitigation or adaptation can cause contradicting consequences with respect to the reductions in GHG emissions and climate stresses, i.e. reductions in GHGs could increase climate stresses or vice versa. Poorly integrated strategies potentially may compromise international efforts to meet the Climate Action in the Sustainable Development Goals. Properly integrated mitigation and adaptation strategies, or climate-sensitive land use planning, however, can lead to win-win outcomes and eventually achieve co-benefits. Yet, any co-benefits will gradually diminish if there is a delay in climate-sensitive land use planning, implying growing GHGs and intensified climate stresses. Our analysis indicates that integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation in urban land use needs to be enacted as soon as possible: any delays in implementation reduce the window to act to maximize the co-benefits. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptation; Coastal cities; Mitigation; Trade-offs; Urban land use","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Planning; Adaptation; Coastal cities; Mitigation; Trade off; Urban land use; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; coastal zone; empirical analysis; land use planning; mitigation; trade-off; urban area; article; carbon footprint; city; climate change; competition; empiricism; quantitative analysis; stress; sustainable development; urban area; acclimatization; city; city planning; human; sea; Acclimatization; Cities; City Planning; Climate Change; Humans; Oceans and Seas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073506703

Desertification induced by both climate changes and human activities seriously threatens dryland vegetation. However, the impact of climate change on distribution of dryland plant species has not been well documented. Here, we studied the potential distribution of four representative dryland plant species (Haloxylon ammodendron, Anabasis aphylla, Calligonum mongolicum, and Populus euphratica) under current and future climate scenarios in a temperate desert region, aiming to improve our understanding of the responses of dryland plant species to climate change and provide guidance for dryland conservation and afforestation. Location: Junggar Basin, a large desert region in northwestern China. Methods: Occurrence data of the studied species were collected from an extensive field investigation of 2,516 sampling sites in the Junggar Basin. Ensemble species distribution models using 10 algorithms were developed and used to predict the potential distribution of each studied species under current and future climate scenarios. Result: Haloxylon ammodendron and A. aphylla were likely to lose most of their current suitable habitats under future climate scenarios, while C. mongolicum and P. euphratica were likely to expand their ranges or remain relatively stationary. Variable importance evaluation showed that the most important climate variables influencing species distribution differed across the studied species. These results may be explained by the different ecophysiological characteristics and adaptation strategies to the environment of the four studied species. Main conclusions: We explored the responses of the representative dryland plant species to climate change in the Junggar Basin in northwestern China. The different changes in suitability of different species imply that policymakers may need to reconsider the selection and combination of the afforestation species used in this area. This study can provide valuable reference for the management and conservation of dryland ecosystems under future climate change scenarios. © 2019 The Authors.

Industry-level emissions analysis can help policymakers determine better ways to achieve mitigation targets. This study is the first to target the total-factor carbon emission performance (TCPI) of secondary and service industries. We first compile industry-level CO2 emission inventories of 25 Yangtze River Delta cities during 2007–2016. The TCPI of secondary and service industries is then estimated by the non-radial directional distance function. We then compare the TCPI of the two industries across levels, dynamics, and inequalities using a global metafrontier approach. The results show the TCPI of the service industry (0.563 in 2016) was significantly higher than that of secondary industry (0.256 in 2016), suggesting that the service industry was more carbon-friendly. The TCPI gap between the secondary and service industries narrowed over the study period. The TCPI of secondary industry showed a promising increase during 2007–2016 with an annual growth rate of 2.30%, reflecting the positive effects of the government's reforms and environmental regulations. By contrast, the service industry saw a downward trend in TCPI, decreasing by 1.68% annually, primarily because it is a newcomer to low-carbon development. TCPI inequality in secondary industry was much larger than in the service industry, suggesting that significant heterogeneity exists in secondary industry. Therefore, policymakers should implement targeted mitigation policies for secondary industry, and place decarbonising the service industry on the agenda to reverse its decreasing TCPI. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission performance; Inequality; Non-radial directional distance function; Secondary industry; Service industry","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; emission control; emission inventory; industrial emission; performance assessment; pollution policy; service sector; Article; carbon footprint; city; energy consumption; environmental impact; global climate; government; human; industry; regulatory mechanism; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; river; China; Yangtze River; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073171093

Yet, it is uncertain what effects of vegetation restoration have on autotrophic bacterial community and associated C-fixing potential. To investigate the responses of autotrophic bacterial community and microbial C-fixing rate to vegetation restoration of eroded agricultural land, three abandoned croplands (ES1, ES2 and ES3) and two secondary grasslands planted with Coronilla varia (GS1 and GS2) in the Qiaozi watershed of Chinese Loess Plateau were selected, and high-throughput sequencing and 13C stable isotope labeling were applied in this study. Results showed that vegetation restoration significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved soil C and N contents while reduced soil moisture level. Total autotrophic bacterial abundance and species diversity in nutrient-rich secondary grasslands were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower than those in nutrient-poor croplands. However, positive responses of obligate autotrophic bacteria, such as Alkalililimnicola and Synechococcus, to vegetation restoration were observed. Correlation analysis showed that autotrophic bacterial abundance and diversity were positively (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with soil moisture, while negatively (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with soil C and N nutrients. Microbial C-fixing rate ranged from 0.621 to 1.414 Mg C km−2 y−1 and the maximum value was observed in the ES3 site, followed by the ES1 site (1.088 Mg C km−2 y−1). Microbial C-fixing rate in abandoned cropland was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than that in secondary grassland, and it was positively influenced by autotrophic bacterial abundance and diversity. Overall, vegetation restoration of eroded agricultural land has negative impacts on autotrophic bacterial community and microbial C-fixing potential. In arid and semi-arid regions, great transpiration loss induced by vegetation restoration may inhibit autotrophic bacteria growth, and which further reduces the potential of CO2 fixation by autotrophic bacteria. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","autotrophic bacteria; Chinese Loess Plateau; CO2 fixation; erosion; organic carbon; vegetation restoration","autotrophy; bacterium; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; erosion; grassland; microbial community; restoration ecology; soil carbon; species diversity; stable isotope; watershed; China; Loess Plateau; Bacteria (microorganisms); Securigera varia; Synechococcus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064258448

In this study, a spatial Durbin model that integrates a spatial lag model and a spatial error model is used to measure the degree of influence held by the energy consumption structure and other factors over carbon emission intensity and the spatial spillover effect. The results show that there is a spatial demonstration effect on the reduction in interregional carbon emission intensity in China. While the carbon emission intensity in the adjacent region decreases by 1%, the carbon emission intensity in this region will decrease by 0.05%, indicating that China’s regional low-carbon development model is also applicable to neighboring provinces and plays a large role in driving and demonstrating a low-carbon economy. Every additional 1% improvement toward optimizing the energy consumption structure enables the carbon emission intensity of the region to decrease by 0.21%; further, there is a positive spatial spillover effect driving carbon emission intensity decreases in neighboring areas of 0.25%. Industrial structure, energy intensity, energy price, and level of openness are the main factors influencing regional carbon emission intensity. According to the “14th Five-Year Plan,” there is an urgent need to optimize the energy consumption structure in the medium and long term and give full play to its ability to contribute to declines in carbon emission intensity. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon emission intensity; Demonstration-driving effect; Energy consumption structure; Spatial Durbin model; Spatial spillover","carbon emission; consumption behavior; emission control; energy use; industrial production; spatial analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057083130

It is located within the Baoshan Block, in the Sanjiang Tethys orogenic belt and is hosted along fractures within carbonates of the Lower Carboniferous Xiangshan Formation. The deposit is hosted by veins within NE–SW trending strike-slip and steeply dipping NW–SE trending normal fault zones. The formation of the deposit involved sedimentary, hydrothermal, and supergene oxidation stages. The hydrothermal stage associated with mineralization include three sub-stages (i) a steeply-dipping quartz–calcite-rich sphalerite sub-stage; (ii) a polymetallic sulfide sub-stage; and (iii) a vein-host calcite–pyrite sub-stage. The deposit is enriched in Pb, Zn, Sb, Cd, Ag, and U, and depleted in Ni, Se, Ti, and Co. The ores have total rare-earth element (REE) concentrations of 17.4–186 ppm and are enriched in the light REE (LREE) with (La/Yb)N ratios of 3.75–9.23 and strongly positive Eu (Eu/Eu* = 1.42–4.60) and slightly negative Ce (Ce/Ce* = 0.70–0.88) anomalies. The positive Eu anomalies and LREE enrichment suggest that the ore-forming fluids were exsolved from a concealed intrusion during magmatic degassing. The S isotopic compositions of sulfides and sulfates indicate that S within the deposit was derived from both magmatic sources and barite within the hosting carbonates via thermochemical sulfate reduction. In-situ LA–ICP–MS analysis indicates that sphalerite within the deposit is texturally and chemically variable, with elevated Fe, Mn, Cd, Cu, Ag, Sb, Sn, Pb, and Tl contents. In comparison, galena within the deposit is enriched in Sb, Ag, Cd, Sn, and Tl, and pyrite has elevated Ag, As, Sb, and Pb contents. The trace element compositions of sphalerite and galena indicate that the Xiyi deposit may be the product of a distal hydrothermal event although the direct genetic relationship is not clear. The fracture-hosted nature, mineral assemblages, geochemistry, and mineral S isotopic and trace-element compositions of the Xiyi Pb–Zn deposit indicate that it is an epigenetic carbonate-hosted Pb–Zn deposit. This study also indicates that sphalerite is a more useful mineral than galena in terms of using mineral trace-element geochemistry to discriminate different deposit types. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Baoshan Block; Epigenetic carbonate-hosted Pb–Zn deposit; In-situ LA–ICP–MS; Positive Eu anomalies; Xiyi deposit","epithermal deposit; europium; geochemistry; inductively coupled plasma method; lead; sphalerite; sulfur isotope; trace element; zinc; Baoshan Block; China; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073226469

In this study, we combined a previously developed spatially explicit network model with an analysis of carbon sequestration and emission by different land use or cover types, and illustrate its use by examining carbon flows in Beijing, China, from 1990 to 2015. The goals were to characterize the temporal changes of the integrated (total direct + indirect) flow structure by applying ecological network analysis and to identify the structure of the urban metabolism by analyzing temporal and spatial changes of the integrated flows. The results showed that the similarity between input and output trophic structures and their spatial pattern indicate increasingly carbon-balanced urbanization by Beijing. The balanced input and output flows for the transportation and industrial land and cultivated land played key roles in forming a central area of aggregated carbon flows between the city's peripheral plains, which also resulted in similar trophic structures for inputs and outputs.

In this study, we combined a spatially explicit network with carbon budget of energy consumption and land use and cover change in Beijing, China. From 1990 to 2010, energy related carbon emissions accounted for roughly 90% of the city's total. The network's integrated flux decreased at an average rate of 7.5%. The output flux primarily decreased when moving outward from the center through the periphery of southeastern plains and towards the northwestern mountains. In contrast, the input flux increased moving from the periphery to both the center and mountains. The ecological hierarchy was irregular based on both the driving and pull weights for the components of the model, with excessively small producer and decomposer layers and excessively large consumer layers. The changing structure of Beijing's carbon metabolism over time indicated a tendency to a better organized city. Understanding the evolution of these hierarchies during urban development provides a more solid empirical basis for improving use of the urban space and reducing carbon emission. © 2019","Ecological network analysis; Hierarchical structure; Integrated flows; Land use and cover change; Urban carbon metabolism","Budget control; Ecology; Energy utilization; Land use; Metabolism; Urban growth; Carbon metabolism; Ecological network analysis; Hierarchical structures; Integrated flows; Land use and cover change; Carbon; carbon budget; consumption behavior; energy use; hierarchical system; integrated approach; land cover; land use; urban development; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070113205

Based on an integrated hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) with new regional electricity mixes and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) model with local inventories, the carbon footprints of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) are calculated for all size segments. For the A-class segment, the most popular size segment, the results show that the carbon footprint of ICEVs is approximately 250.6 gCO2e/km. The BEV carbon footprint under a nationwide electricity mix is 217.6 gCO2e/km and ranges between 104.4 (Yunnan) and 265.7 (Shandong) gCO2e/km. These results can be explained by the proportion of coal in provincial electricity consumption mixes (10% to 90%). Out of the 31 provinces in mainland China, A-class BEVs driven in 26 provinces will reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to ICEVs. In addition, the maximum BEV carbon footprint exceeds the minimum by 79%–121% owing to size segments, which is much higher than that for ICEVs, 59%. The interprovincial variability in vehicle carbon footprints calls for modifications to the interregional priority assignments in the EVSE2020 plan, which currently focuses on air pollution control and economic status. After incorporating explicit considerations of climate mitigation, this study recommends raising the level of priority of three provinces in Central and Southwest China (Sichuan, Chongqing, and Hubei) in the EVSE2020 plan. For provinces with a high share of coal-based electricity, the development of BEVs of small size segments (A00/A0) should be encouraged. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Charging infrastructure policy; Electric vehicle; Integrated hybrid LCA; Interregional variation","Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Coal combustion; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Martian surface analysis; Charging infrastructures; Climate mitigations; Electricity-consumption; Hybrid LCA; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Interregional variation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Thermal emission imaging system; Carbon footprint; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; carbon footprint; electric vehicle; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; pollution control; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072564225

Based on a multiyear Nested Regional Climate Model coupled with Chemistry simulation, we developed a daily index (Hazy Weather Index for India, HWII) to characterize the meteorology-pollution relationship over three heavily polluted cities (Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai) and Indo-Gangetic Plain. HWII consists of near-surface (10 m) zonal wind (U10) and temperature at 200 hPa (T200) over the northwestern Indian Ocean, and local planetary boundary layer height. The simulated PM2.5 levels during the Historical Period (1997–2004) exhibit robust negative correlation with the HWII. The negative correlation captures day-to-day covariability of surface PM2.5 and meteorology, highlighting the role of monsoon-related large-scale circulation in redistributing locally emitted pollutants. More importantly, two future (2046–2054) simulations with regional warming under the Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0 and 8.5 were analyzed. The future changes in HWII and the three predictive meteorological variables work in favor of a stronger pollution horizontal dispersion and vertical ventilation and thus could lead to a reduction of PM2.5 level by 7%. The meteorology-driven reduction in PM2.5, however, is overwhelmed by the projected growth in anthropogenic emission (especially under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 emission by 31%).

The results showed that the air quality in Hangzhou greatly improved after the implementation of strict emission controls. Compared to the same dates from the five preceding years, the G20 period exhibited low relative humidity during the early stage (August 27–31) and no significant differences in other meteorological conditions. The SO2, NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 concentrations averaged across the five sites in Hangzhou decreased by 42.6%, 57.1%, 36%, and 38.5%, respectively, although the average O3 concentration increased by 19%. These changes indicate that the emission reduction measures decreased the concentrations of several pollutants. Compared to the same dates from the previous year (August 24–September 6, 2015), the G20 period exhibited significantly decreased concentrations for most of the chemical components of PM2.5, particularly SO4 2–, NO3–, and NH4+.

Our findings indicate that the most commonly adopted emission reduction targets are relative to emissions in the base year and to baseline scenarios. Approximately half of these countries request technological and financial support from the international community in their NDC reports. Greenhouse gas inventory accounting, and data management, modeling, and tools are the most commonly identified technological needs. Moreover, the NDC reports indicate that $2.88 trillion of financial support is explicitly required, while a reliable international financial assistance and technology transfer would enable considerably higher emission reduction targets to be reached in Belt and Road countries. Our analysis of the top four emitters among these countries reveal a future decreasing trend for China and Russia and an increasing trend for India and Indonesia. China can effectively promote its Belt and Road green development initiative through measures such as capacity building in the areas of emission inventory accounting, constructing an ""Internet Plus"" platform for the use and management of low-carbon data, and technology exchanges aimed at strengthening low-carbon development. © 2019 by the authors.","Belt and road initiative; Climate change; Emission reduction; Nationally determined contribution","capacity building; data management; emission control; emission inventory; financial provision; financial system; greenhouse gas; technology transfer; China; India; Indonesia; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083852434

Research has found that displacement does cause negative health impacts to evacuees, but few studies have observed how planned sheltering might reduce adverse health impacts. This article identifies the good practice and lessons learned from China's response to severe flooding in Anhui province in 2016. Methods: First, we identified the key phases for disaster sheltering by analyzing related government reports. We then interviewed 21 relevant professionals in order to identify good practice and lessons learned which could lead to better health outcomes (e.g., reduce fatalities, infectious diseases, and mental health problems). Interviewees were selected through a purposive sampling strategy, which identified emergency management professionals and those who had been assigned evacuation, sheltering, or medical tasks. Finally, thematic analysis and the constant comparative method were used to code, identify, and describe the good practice and challenges during key phases. Results: Good practice included: using early warning systems to advise communities of risks and enforce evacuation in the flood zone; preparing and using schools as shelters with open-ended periods of operation; and, providing stable shelter accommodations which offered medical and public health services, clean drinking water and food, sanitation, and toilet hygiene through multiagency cooperation. Challenges included: providing mental health services, evaluating intervention effectiveness, managing volunteers, monitoring long-term health effects, and providing economic support. Conclusions: The unintended negative effects caused by sheltering during extreme weather can be reduced. This requires close cooperation among government entities to establish planned mass shelters with appropriate levels of personal, environmental and healthcare support and to ensure long-term physical and mental health support. Additionally, if disaster mitigation strategies are integrated with climate adaptation plans, we can design more health-oriented and sustainable cities. © 2019","China; Climate change adaptation; Environmental interventions; Extreme weather events; Flood; Planned sheltering","Disasters; Floods; Health; Health risks; Planning; Potable water; Public risks; Risk management; Sustainable development; China; Climate change adaptation; Environmental interventions; Extreme weather events; Planned sheltering; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; comparative study; disaster management; extreme event; flooding; shelter; state role; access to information; adaptation; Article; China; climate change; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; controlled study; emergency shelter; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; flooding; food; health care personnel; health service; human; hygiene; interpersonal communication; learning; practice guideline; priority journal; risk reduction; sanitation; thematic analysis; disaster planning; flooding; Anhui; China; China; Climate Change; Disaster Planning; Floods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070114331

This reduction in PM2.5 potentially affected the intensity of urban heat islands (UHIs), as the presence of fine particles can influence the energy balance of the earth-atmosphere system. In this study, the effect of the pollution control plan on the UHI intensity in the Yangtze River Delta, China, was investigated via observational analysis and numerical modeling. According to the observational data, the PM2.5 concentrations in the megacities of the Yangtze River Delta, viz., Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Hefei, in 2017 were ~35 µg m–3, showing decreases of approximately 48.36%, 28.25%, 29.41% and 32.5%, respectively, compared to 2014. Furthermore, these reductions in the PM2.5 concentration correlated well with the strengthened diurnal intensity (increasing by up to 1 K) and the weakened nocturnal intensity (decreasing by up to 1 K) of the UHIs. Numerical simulations confirmed that this “seesaw effect” on the UHI intensity was due to the decrease in PM2.5 and the consequent increase in the downward surface shortwave radiation and the outgoing top-of-the-atmosphere longwave radiation. Thus, the Air Pollution Control Plan noticeably affected the UHI intensity by reducing PM2.5—a factor which should be considered in future studies on urban climate and environmental planning. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","PM2.5; Urban heat island; WRF-Chem; Yangtze River Delta","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Atmospheric temperature; Numerical models; Rivers; Energy balance of the earth; Observational analysis; PM2.5; Top of the atmospheres; Urban heat island; Urban heat island intensities; WRF-Chem; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; aerodynamics; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); heat island; megacity; particulate matter; policy implementation; pollution control; weather forecasting; Anhui; China; Hangzhou; Hefei; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Shanghai; Yangtze Basin; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075784454

Here we assess the relative contribution of these processes in community-level body-size changes in tropical moth assemblages that moved uphill during a period of warming. Based on resurvey data for seven assemblages of geometrid moths (>8000 individuals) on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo, in 1965 and 2007, we show significant wing-length reduction (mean shrinkage of 1.3% per species). Range shifts explain most size restructuring, due to uphill shifts of relatively small species, especially at high elevations. Overall, mean forewing length shrank by ca. 5%, much of which is accounted for by species range boundary shifts (3.9%), followed by within-boundary distribution changes (0.5%), and within-species size shrinkage (0.6%). We conclude that the effects of range shifting predominate, but considering species physiological responses is also important for understanding community size reorganization under climate warming. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"community composition; moth; physiological response; range expansion; adult; article; body size; Borneo; climate warming; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; moth; nonhuman; wing; altitude; anatomy and histology; animal; body size; Borneo; climate change; Malaysia; physiology; Borneo; East Malaysia; Malaysia; Mount Kinabalu; Sabah; Geometridae; Lepidoptera; Altitude; Animals; Body Size; Borneo; Climate Change; Malaysia; Moths",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073116130

But the risk must be assessed because of the potential damage caused by these agents. We conducted this project to investigate the mechanism driving the choice of a native obligate parasite, Cuscuta australis, between the exotic, Humulus scandens, and native plants as its host through field and pot experiments. The results showed that C. australis preferred the exotic weed over native (naturalized) hosts and caused a notable reduction in the biomass of H. scandens in the field. In contrast, the results of the pot experimentindicated that C. australis preferred a mix of native (naturalized) hosts over the exotic weed. Both texperiments indicated that the parasitic preference of C. australis was induced more by light irradiance than plant water, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents, indicating that the native parasite can only be used to control H. scandens when the exotic weed forms mono-cultures or dominates the community. Accordingly, induction and release of C. australis to control H. scandens should be conducted with great caution. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; water; biomass; Cuscuta; host parasite interaction; Humulus; metabolism; parasitology; physiology; weed; weed control; Biomass; Carbon; Cuscuta; Host-Parasite Interactions; Humulus; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant Weeds; Water; Weed Control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060544981

As opposed to SI engines that use a spark to control combustion timing, HCCI combustion is enabled by compression induced autoignition which is characterized by rapid global and spatial combustion yielding fuel efficiency benefits. This process is highly dependent on the in-cylinder state, including pressure, temperature and trapped mass. The absence of a direct combustion control proves to be a major challenge and results in unstable engine operation especially at the limits of the narrow operation range. In recent studies, direct water injection is used in HCCI combustion to stabilize combustion and increase the operation range. This paper outlines the thermodynamic influence and evaluation of the potential of water injection for HCCI combustion. Investigations were performed on two single cylinder research engines using different fuels to investigate the effect of direct water injection on HCCI combustion. In this work, the required energy to achieve autoignition is obtained using internal exhaust gas recirculation which is controlled via negative valve overlap. Steady state water injection timing, pressure and mass sweeps were performed to analyze the influence on HCCI combustion. Based on these single cylinder investigations, simulations were performed to simulate the effect of water on the amount of residual gas, in-cylinder temperature and rate of heat release. In addition, cyclic water injection investigations were performed, to separate the long term from the short term cooling effects. The results show a significant reduction of 44.5 % in NOX emissions when injecting water every cycle, and even a 12.2 % reduction when injecting water every 2 cycles. This trade-off between water consumption, combustion phasing and NOX emissions reduction can be useful for optimization in future control applications. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Economic and social effects; Emission control; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuels; Ignition; Powertrains; Temperature; Water injection; Combustion timings; Control applications; Cylinder temperatures; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Low temperature combustion; Negative valve overlap; Rate of heat release; Single-cylinder research engines; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084459083

Physical disturbances such as fire often overcome the resistance of sagebrush communities to biological disturbances such as invasion by non-native species, but the impact of burn severity or combined disturbance types on sagebrush community composition remains unclear. We examined the relationship between native functional groups and non-native annual grass cover to the number of fires, burn severity, anthropogenic development, and vegetation treatments in northern Nevada, USA. We used Bureau of Land Management vegetation monitoring plots and existing climate, fire, and vegetation treatment databases to explore relationships using beta regression. After accounting for mean annual precipitation and temperature, and elevation, we quantified functional group mean cover related to levels of burn severity, numbers of fires, development, and vegetation treatments. Native herbaceous (grass and forb) groups were resilient to fire, but fire caused large declines in shrub and sagebrush cover. Non-native annual grass cover was associated with higher burn severity and the first fire at a site. We did not find evidence that post-fire restoration treatments were associated with increased native cover or decreased non-native cover. However, shrub control and soil disturbing treatments (discing and chaining) were associated with decreased native perennial grass cover and increased non-native annual grass cover. Functional groups displayed varying patterns related to anthropogenic development and fire. For example, development had a larger impact on non-native cover at lower levels of burn severity, whereas forbs increased following fire only at lower levels of development. Although in some cases sagebrush communities showed resilience to disturbance, our results showed resistance to invasion by non-native annual grasses can be overcome by combinations of disturbances at lower levels or by severe events. © 2019 The Authors.

In this review, the processing methodologies for biodiesel are extensively evaluated, particularly the mechanisms and theories of the intensification approaches. Recent techniques implemented to produce biodiesel vary but are aimed at addressing production challenges such as the natural mass transfer limitation of reactants, feasibility in upscaling, and ease of downstream processing. Key trends within the context of biodiesel processing technologies include, transitions from batch-type to continuous reactors for transesterification, edible to non-edible biodiesel feedstocks, homogeneous to heterogeneous catalytic transesterification, and base-type to acid catalyst driven transesterification. Overarching insights indicate that the focus of interests are converging towards modularity and greater sustainability, while maintaining feasibility in commercialisation. Techno-economic analysis revealed that there are Southeast Asian nations that have immense potential for biodiesel production, and are able to almost replace their diesel consumption completely. Different biodiesel standards have localised context to facilitate the predominant feedstock used in the production, storage and usage. Therefore, the selection of biodiesel feedstock has to ensure lowered emissions when replacing diesel to mitigate potential health hazards. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Intensification; Process integration; Reactor; Transesterification","Batch reactors; Biohazards; Diesel engines; Economic analysis; Feedstocks; Fuel storage; Health hazards; Mass transfer; Sustainable development; Transesterification; Catalytic transesterification; Intensification; Mass transfer limitation; Process integration; Process intensification; Reactor; South-East Asian Nations; Techno-Economic analysis; Biodiesel",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072667455

The legislation establishing the California forest offset program, for example, requires that offsets be ""real, additional, quantifiable, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable"". While these are all clearly desirable attributes, their implementation has been a great challenge in balancing complexity, expense, and risk. Most forest offset protocols carry similar accounting objectives, but often with different details, (e.g. Richards and Huebner in Carbon Manag 3(4):393-410, 2012 and Galik et al. in Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change 14:677-690, 2009). The result is that the complexity, expense, and risk of participation discourage participation and make it more difficult to achieve climate mitigation goals. We focus on the requirements for accounting and permanence to illustrate that current requirements disproportionately disadvantage small landowners. Results: The simplified 1040EZ filing system for U.S. income taxes may provide insight for a protocol model that balances reward, effort, and risk, while still achieving the overall objectives of standardized offset protocols. In this paper, we present initial ideas and lay the groundwork behind a ""2050EZ"" protocol for forest carbon sequestration as a complement to existing protocols. Conclusion: The Paris Agreement states that ""Parties should take action to conserve and enhance, as appropriate, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases."" The Paris Agreement also refers to issues such as equity, sustainable development, and other non-carbon benefits. The challenge is to provide incentives for maintaining and increasing the amount of carbon sequestered in the biosphere. Monitoring and verification of carbon storage need to be sufficient to demonstrate sequestration from the atmosphere while providing clear incentives and simple accounting approaches that encourage participation by diverse participants, including small land holders. © 2019 The Author(s).","Carbon accounting; Forest offset; Sequestration program","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental economics; forest ecosystem; global climate; sustainable development; California; France; Ile de France; Paris; United States; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076098246

The models differ by whether or not the ocean velocity is included in the shear calculation applied to the ocean and the atmosphere. All three cases are employed in climate or ocean simulations. Analytic calculations for the models with deterministic and random forcing (white and coloured) are presented. The short-term behaviour is similar in all models, with only small quantitative differences, while the long-term behaviour differs qualitatively between the models. The fluctuation-dissipation relation, which connects the fast atmospheric motion to the slow oceanic dynamics, is established for all models with random forcing. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which compares the response to an external forcing to internal fluctuations, is established for a white-noise forcing and a coloured forcing when the phase space is augmented by the forcing variable. Using results from numerical integrations of stochastic differential equations, we show that the fluctuation theorem, which compares the probability of positive to negative fluxes of the same magnitude, averaged over time intervals of varying lengths, holds for the energy gained by the ocean from the atmosphere. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

But they largely disagree on the amount of carbon uptake. The historical CO 2 increase has resulted in enhanced photosynthetic carbon fixation (Gross Primary Production, GPP), as can be evidenced from atmospheric CO 2 concentration and satellite leaf area index measurements. Here, we use leaf area sensitivity to ambient CO 2 from the past 36 years of satellite measurements to obtain an Emergent Constraint (EC) estimate of GPP enhancement in the northern high latitudes at two-times the pre-industrial CO 2 concentration (3.4 ± 0.2 Pg C yr −1 ). We derive three independent comparable estimates from CO 2 measurements and atmospheric inversions. Our EC estimate is 60% larger than the conventionally used multi-model average (44% higher at the global scale). This suggests that most models largely underestimate photosynthetic carbon fixation and therefore likely overestimate future atmospheric CO 2 abundance and ensuing climate change, though not proportionately. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; climate change; climate modeling; concentration (composition); growth; latitude; leaf area index; physiological response; plant; Article; carbon dioxide fixation; climate change; controlled study; latitude; measurement; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant; plant growth; astronomy; biological model; carbon cycle; climate change; ecosystem; geographic and geological phenomena; metabolism; plant; plant leaf; season; temperature; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Earth (Planet); Ecosystem; Geological Phenomena; Models, Biological; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061963378

But despite more than two millennia as a cultural icon in southern Brazil, Araucaria is on the brink of extinction, having lost 97% of its extent to 20th-century logging. Although logging is now illegal, 21st-century climate change constitutes a new—but so far unevaluated—threat to Araucaria's future survival. We use a robust ensemble modelling approach, using recently developed climate data, high-resolution topography and fine-scale vegetation maps, to predict the species' response to climate change and its implications for conservation on meso- and microclimate scales. We show that climate-only models predict the total disappearance of Araucaria's most suitable habitat by 2070, but incorporating topographic effects allows potential highland microrefugia to be identified. The legacy of 20th-century destruction is evident—more than a third of these likely holdouts have already lost their natural vegetation—and 21st-century climate change will leave just 3.5% of remnant forest and 28.4% of highland grasslands suitable for Araucaria. Existing protected areas cover only 2.5% of the surviving microrefugia for this culturally important species, and none occur in any designated indigenous territory. Our results suggest that anthropogenic climate change is likely to commit Araucaria to a second consecutive century of significant losses, but targeted interventions could help ensure its survival in the wild. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Araucaria angustifolia; Brazil; climate change; conservation; microrefugia; species distribution modelling","climate change; climate modeling; conservation management; endangered species; ensemble forecasting; habitat management; microclimate; survival; Araucaria; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]; Araucaria; Araucaria angustifolia; biodiversity; Brazil; climate change; environmental protection; forest; tree; Biodiversity; Brazil; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070313101

Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth's land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17).

Bi2WO6 shows great potential in photocatalysis due to its high chemical stability, non-toxicity and appropriate band position. However, the CH4 yield from CO2 photoreduction over bulk Bi2WO6 is relatively low ascribed to its single-component structure. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, Z-scheme system with photosystem I (PS I)-photosystem II (PS II) coupling via an electron mediator can improve charge separation and at the same time, renders large overpotential, attributed to the vectorial electron transfer from PS II to PS I. In this contribution, an all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst that is composed of 2D Bi2WO6 nanosheets coupled with WO3 along with the incorporation of copper foil sheet as the electron mediator is designed to improve the CO2 reduction efficiency. The Bi2WO6/Cu/WO3 composite demonstrated a remarkable CH4 yield of 8.80 μmol g−1 catalyst over 8 hours of visible light illumination, which is superior to the Bi2WO6 standalone. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In order to promote its development, it is in urgent need to do the researches focusing on enhancing domestic CBM industry. In this paper, PetroChina Coalbed Methane Co. Ltd. was taken as an example. Its technical progress and achievements in the construction of CBM industrial base at the eastern margin of the Ordos Basin and the CBM exploration and development in Xinjiang since it was founded in 2008 were systematically studied and summarized. Then, the opportunities and challenges of domestic CBM industry in the process of its development were analyzed. Finally, five main study directions for accelerating the development of CBM industry were put forward. First, speed up the scale breakthrough of the strategic replacement of medium- and low-rank CBM resources in Xinjiang. Second, continuously research the technologies for increasing production and recovery factor of developed areas, so as to enhance the development benefits greatly. Third, strengthen the comprehensive development of deep CBM and coal measure gas, so as to improve the comprehensive utilization ratio of resources. Fourth, develop the intelligent information technology based on artificial intelligence and big data suitable for CBM fields, to improve the development level of CBM fields. Fifth, study the innovative management system of CBM benefit development, to provide a scientific institutional guarantee for the benefit development of CBM. It is concluded that the scale CBM development at the eastern margin of the Ordos Basin supplies the nation with precious clean energy and provides new ways and contributions for the safe production and energy saving & emission reduction of coal mines. In addition, it is recommended to continuously promote management innovation and technological innovation and speed up the construction of the third CBM industrial base in Xinjiang so as to accelerate the development of CBM industry in China. © 2019 Sichuan Petroleum Administration","China; Coalbed methane (CBM); Development strategy; Eastern margin of the Ordos Basin; Exploration and development; Industrial base; PetroChina Coalbed Methane Co.

In addition, AD technology has a number of other potential benefits including: energy production for use on the farm and for sale, separation of manure solids for ease of use or export off-farm, pathogen reduction leading to healthier labor and herd outcomes and odor control. It is also clear that in the USA, research and extension efforts, including public financing of AD technology installations, have disproportionally been focused on larger farms- e.g., dairy farms with at least 500 milking cows. The latter has begun to change as more resources are being invested in AD technology for smaller livestock farms. We present the results of a pre and post survey implemented at four workshops on small-scale AD technology for livestock farmers in northeastern New York State. Results indicate that information presented shifted farmers' attitudes such that they viewed AD technology as not overly complex; and, they became less interested in selling generated surplus power off-farm.

In response, oversummer snow storage, attempted primarily using woodchips as a cover material, has been successfully employed as a climate change adaptation strategy by high-elevation and/or high-latitude ski centers in Europe and Canada. Such storage has never been attempted at a site that is both low elevation and midlatitude, and few studies have quantified storage losses repeatedly through the summer. Such data, along with tests of different cover strategies, are prerequisites to optimizing snow storage strategies. Here, we assess the rate at which the volume of two woodchip-covered snow piles (each ∼ 200 m3), emplaced during spring 2018 in Craftsbury, Vermont (45° N and 360 m a.s.l.), changed. We used these data to develop an optimized snow storage strategy. In 2019, we tested that strategy on a much larger, 9300 m3 pile. In 2018, we continually logged air-to-snow temperature gradients under different cover layers including rigid foam, open-cell foam, and woodchips both with and without an underlying insulating blanket and an overlying reflective cover. We also measured ground temperatures to a meter depth adjacent to the snow piles and used a snow tube to measure snow density. During both years, we monitored volume change over the melt season using terrestrial laser scanning every 10- 14 d from spring to fall. In 2018, snow volume loss ranged from 0.29 to 2.81 m3 d-1, with the highest rates in midsummer and lowest rates in the fall; mean rates of volumetric change were 1.24 and 1.50 m3 d-1, 0.55 % to 0.72 % of initial pile volume per day. Snow density did increase over time, but most volume loss was the result of melting. Wet woodchips underlain by an insulating blanket and covered with a reflective sheet were the most effective cover combination for minimizing melt, likely because the aluminized surface reflected incoming short-wave radiation while the wet woodchips provided significant thermal mass, allowing much of the energy absorbed during the day to be lost by long-wave emission at night. The importance of the pile surface-area-tovolume ratio is demonstrated by 4-fold lower rates of volumetric change for the 9300 m3 pile emplaced in 2019; it lost &lt; 0:16 % of its initial volume per day between April and October, retaining ∼ 60 % of the initial snow volume over summer. Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of oversummer snow storage at midlatitudes and low elevations and suggest efficient cover strategies. © 2019 Author(s).",,"adaptive management; air temperature; climate change; seasonality; snow accumulation; snow cover; snowmelt; volume change; Canada; Europe; United States; Vermont",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076798252

To fulfill legislation requirements and potential future challenges, increasing number of technologies and actuators have been developed and implemented into powertrain systems. This trend poses new challenges on engine development process by harmonizing early stage technology implementation, hardware selection and performance evaluation with late stage calibration and validation works. Frontloading feedbacks to design and development team enable better decision making, hardware selection and calibration optimization. Seamless powertrain simulation toolchains can realize such frontloading tasks to reduce development cost and provide late stage information at early development period. However, frontloading virtualized development remains a large challenge for model developers with limited data during early phase of development. For various usages of simulations and models, especially robust calibration usage purpose, the models need to have high level of accuracy, reasonable simulation runtime and predictability over wide range of operating conditions at the same time; meanwhile there is limited quantity of test data available to generate data driven and statistical models and to perform optimizations. Therefore, this paper would focus on the flexibility and predictability of GT-Suite DI-Pulse predictive engine models and their capability as virtual testing cell by demonstrating late stage altitude calibration application with engine models developed with relative small amount of early stage sea-level data. Detailed phenomenological based combustion model, air path model and emission models have been developed for a turbocharged 4 cylinder diesel engine using steady state points over entire operating area; such data could be collected at early phase of engine development and there are many use cases of similar models for hardware evaluation and selection. The air path was later reduced to simplified geometries and crank-angle based combustion calculation step became coarser to achieve a fast runtime model (FRM). The major pressure pulsations within the systems were well captured, which is mandatory to determine volumetric efficiency, turbocharger operation and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) distribution. The predictive combustion model remained similar level of accuracy on engine efficiency and exhaust gas temperature. After model validations, design of experiments (DoEs) of control and actuator variables were carried out with FRM model to generate virtual testing data and to make optimized altitude calibration maps. Finally, altitude engine dyno tests were conducted to verify both calibration and model prediction capability at altitude conditions. The work has demonstrated high accuracy predictive models developed with limited data and the frontloading capabilities to reduce calibration work and provide late stage information at very beginning of projects. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Actuators; Altitude control; Calibration; Combustion; Decision making; Design of experiments; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Exhaust gas recirculation; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Sea level; Calibration and validations; Design and Development; Emissions regulations; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Exhaust gas temperatures; Powertrain simulation; Technology implementation; Volumetric efficiency; Powertrains",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084438756

This study estimates Beijing ozone precursor emission, anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs) being 325.3 kilotons in 2010, 231.8 kilotons in 2013 and 190.7 kilotons in 2015 and NOx being 211.3 kilotons in 2010, 238.3 kilotons in 2013 and 166.2 kilotons in 2015. Then, we conduct surface O3 simulation based on WRF-Chem through using different precursor emissions, to evaluate the influence of precursor control measures on Beijing O3. From 2010 to 2013, AVOCs reduction in Beijing would lead to O3 decrease in urban and suburban areas and O3 increase in some parts of northern rural areas; while from 2013 to 2015, AVOCs and NOx reductions would produce O3 increase in urban and northern suburban areas and O3 decrease in southern suburban and northern rural areas. Overall, the synergic reduction during 2010–2015 could effectively mitigate summer O3 pollution over Beijing, with daily maximum 1-h ozone (DAM1h O3) reduction exceeding 3 ppb. Finally, based on 2015 emission condition, 30% NOx and 30% VOCs emission reduction are further simulated to study O3-NOx-VOCs sensitivity over Beijing. The simulated DAM1h O3 reduction due to NOx- or VOCs-reduction shows that O3 is predominantly sensitive to VOCs in urban and northern suburban Beijing, but seems to be control more by the mixed chemistry in southern suburban and northern rural Beijing. However, NOx-sensitive condition is never found in rural Beijing. The distribution of simulated H2O2/HNO3 for the distinguished VOCs- and NOx-sensitive grids shows that 95th percentile for VOCs-sensitive distribution and 5th percentile for the NOx-sensitive distribution are 2.48 and 1.17 in all simulated days. According to the determined transition values, most Beijing is under VOCs-sensitive regime on the condition of 2015 precursor emission. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Precursor emission change; Sensitivity; Surface ozone; WRF-Chem simulation","Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Rural areas; Different precursors; Emission change; Emission reduction; Sensitive conditions; Sensitivity; Surface ozone; Urban and suburban areas; WRF-Chem simulation; Air pollution; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission; emission control; modeling; ozone; rural area; sensitivity analysis; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; suburban area; summer; urban pollution; air pollutant; air quality; Article; chemical composition; China; control strategy; photochemistry; priority journal; rural area; simulation; suburban area; summer; surface property; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072373976

We use pore water geochemistry, pressure core CT scanning, degassing quantification, seismic data and in situ temperature test at four drill sites (W01, W07, W08 and W09) to investigate the gas hydrate characteristics and discuss the dynamics of the gas hydrate system. Based on the CT scanning and pressure core degassing, we demonstrate the coexistence of pore-filling and vein-like gas hydrates. Gas hydrate saturation estimated based on the chloride concentration (0–92%) is higher than that based on the degassing quantification (0–52.9%). The saturation discrepancy is mainly resulted from the sampling discrimination. Based on the average gas hydrate saturation estimated using chloride concentration and degassing, the methane gas volume contained in the gas hydrate of one cubic meter sediment at drill sites W07, W08 and W09 are calculated to be 13.7 m3, 26.82 m3 and 22.24 m3 and 3.03 m3, 14.30 m3 and 16.25 m3. The geothermal gradients estimated based on the in situ temperature measurements at sites W07, W08 and W09 (102–111 °C/km) are more than 50% higher than that at the background site W01 (65 °C/km). It is inferred that the fractures and faults in the gas chimney at sites W07, W08 and W09 are the major contributors for the efficient fluid pathways and high geothermal gradients. The pore water sulfate profiles and inferred sulfate-reduction methane-oxidation interface (SMI) depths indicate that methane flux is lowest at site W01 and highest at site W08. The SMI depths and top of gas hydrate occurrence is linearly correlated which provides an experienced function for understanding the local gas hydrate distribution. Kick-type sulfate profiles at sites W07 and W09 indicate an ongoing increase of methane flux and corresponding shoaling SMI depths. In addition, chloride enrichment in the shallow sediment at site W08 indicates a recent fast gas hydrate formation process. The kick-type sulfate profiles, positive chloride anomalies and authigenic carbonates at multiple depths suggest that the system experienced dynamic changes in fluid flux and multi-stage gas hydrate evolution on time scale from months to thousands of years. Understanding the controlling mechanism and periodicity of the composite pressure system is important for evaluating the gas hydrate resource and carbon cycling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Gas chimney; Gas hydrate; Geothermal gradient; QiongDongNan Basin; South China Sea","Chimneys; Chlorine compounds; Computerized tomography; Degassing; Drills; Gas hydrates; Gases; Hydration; Infill drilling; Methane; Seismology; Sulfur compounds; Temperature measurement; Water; Chloride concentrations; Controlling mechanism; Gas hydrate saturations; Geothermal gradients; Hydrate formation process; Pore water geochemistry; Qiongdongnan basin; South China sea; Phase interfaces; degassing; drilling; gas hydrate; geothermal gradient; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon resource; Pacific Ocean; Qiongdongnan Basin; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069628909

Empirical results find the positive impacts of Fuel Standard V on the reduction in SO2, PM2.5 and CO. The impact is strongest in the context of SO2, with Fuel Standard V Diesel having a larger impact compared to Fuel Standard V Petrol. In addition, the operation of subway systems leads to a decrease in CO. Furthermore, this paper explores not only separate but also the joint effects of fuel standards and subway. Interestingly, the results indicate that while the operation of the subway system itself cannot affect PM2.5 concentrations, it contributes to the reduction in PM2.5 when Fuel Standard V is implemented.

Here we present the longest running time-series of DMS-water (DMS W ) concentrations in the world, obtained at the Rothera Time-Series (RaTS) station in Ryder Bay, West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We demonstrate the first ever evaluation of interseasonal and interannual variability in DMS W and associated flux to the atmosphere from the Antarctic coastal zone and determine the scale and importance of the region as a significant source of DMS. Impacts of climate modes such as El Niňo/Southern Oscillation are evaluated. Maximum DMS W concentrations occurred annually in January and were primarily associated with sea-ice break-up. These concentrations resulted in extremely high (up to 968 µmol m −2 d −1 ) DMS flux over short timescales, which are not parameterised in global-scale DMS climatologies. Calculated DMS flux stayed above the aerosol nucleation threshold of 2.5 µmol m −2 d −1 for 60% of the year. Overall, using flux determinations from this study, the total flux of DMS-sulfur from the Austral Polar Province (APLR) was 1.1 Tg sulfur yr −1 , more than double the figure suggested by the most recent DMS climatologies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061805646

Although specific definitions may vary, CSA is typically conceived as having three pillars, namely Adaptation, Food Security and Mitigation. These three pillars as such, however, do not suffice for assessing scaling potentials of different CSA technologies as several other drivers may accelerate or impede large-scale adoption. This paper introduces a systematic approach for a comparative assessment of technology-specific scaling potentials distinguishing among three clusters of criteria. The ranking system requires scoring of CSA technologies by different stakeholder groups, namely farmers and extension workers/policy makers as well as research-based scoring. These scored values are then incorporated into a formula for calculating technology-specific ranking indices. This procedure also includes weighting factors to account for high and low significance of individual criteria for CSA scaling. The entire scoring procedure is illustrated through the case of a Climate-smart Village in Laos which is dominated by rainfed rice with low resource inputs. Improvements of rice varieties and seed systems clearly emerged as the most promising CSA intervention. Ideally, seeds used by farmers should (i) be a drought-tolerant rice variety and (ii) have better quality in terms of seed vigor and purity. Finally, the article discusses the applicability and versatility of this ranking system for other land use systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate-smart Agriculture; Incentives; Paradigm shift; Policy; Rice; Seed systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063912199

Increasing energy demand and environmental concerns has led the way for cost effective microgrids with energy storage and backup generation which helps in minimizing energy imbalance, reducing losses and carbon emission, enhancing the overall reliability and resilience of the system. This paper first discusses the main impact of deployment of microgrids in smart cities considering different aspects like societal, economic and environmental.

This framing has, however, not resulted in exceptional measures to tame the purported threat. This article examines the workings of such attempts at climate securitization and interrogates its lack of success in galvanizing exceptional action. We do so informed by two cases, which both point to the instrumental nature of these attempts to securitise climate change, often with the intention to use alarming framings to promote rather mundane actions. Also, both cases show that the strategic nature of the speech acts and the aim to make them sound highly dramatic, makes audiences sceptical, thereby weakening their success. Our first case sketches how the United Kingdom’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office framed climate change as an existential security threat with a view to enrolling other countries to promote collective climate action. Whilst partially successful on an international level, key audiences – the BRICS countries – remained unconvinced, and the discourse lost support at the domestic level. Likewise, the Dutch Delta State Advisory Commission securitized climate to instil a sense of urgency in the domestic target audience. While initially generating blanket support for the costly spatial Delta interventions it advocated, the mood soon turned. Both cases show that while the tendency to ‘securitize’ climate may be on the rise, instrumental securitization can easily backfire like a ‘policy boomerang’, reinforced by parallel economic and political changes. © The Author(s) 2019.","Climate change; Delta Plan; securitization; The Netherlands; UK","climate change; collective action; Commonwealth of Nations; environmental planning; politics; security threat; Netherlands; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063053622

In order to avoid the production of a large number of nitrogen oxides, the low temperature combustion associated with cool flame is getting more and more attention. But until now the cool flame characteristics of methane is still unclear, even its existence is controversial. In this work, the property of premixed methane/oxygen cool flame has been experimentally studied in a cylindrical reactor and numerically analyzed using different mechanisms. The effects of pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio on methane cool flame have been investigated experimentally. The experimental results show that the cool flame can be obtained in the range of 0.2–4.8 equivalent ratio. The lower limit of pressure of the cool flame region decreases with the increasing initial temperature. The sensitivity and reaction path have been analyzed through the numerical simulation, which reveals that the bifurcation in CH3 oxidation process has remarkable effects on cool flame formation. © 2018 Energy Institute","Auto-ignition; Cool flame; Methane; Reaction kinetics","Fuels; Low temperature production; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction kinetics; Temperature; Auto-ignition; Combustion characteristics; Cool flame; Cylindrical reactors; Different mechanisms; Energy supply system; Initial temperatures; Low temperature combustion; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056217104

Cu foam naturally possesses three-dimensional (3D) porous structure and catalytically active Cu elements, exhibiting very good catalytic ability for ERCD. Herein, nanostructured self-supporting Cu electrodes with Cu foam as the substrate, with progressive morphologies of nanowires (CuNW), nanosheets (CuNS) and nanoflowers (CuNF), are in-situ prepared by simply adjusting the reaction time in a strongly alkaline oxidizing solution. It is found that the performance and products distribution of ERCD are affected by both the morphology of the as prepared nanostructured self-supporting Cu electrodes and the electrolyte species. As electrode micromorphology evolves from nanowire to nanoflower, the initial electrode potential required for C2 products generation shifts to more positive values. The CuNS electrode shows the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 86.9% at −0.4 V (vs. RHE) and superior performance, owing to its nanosheet morphology that can better stabilize the intermediate state products. Moreover, both total FE and products distribution are affected by the electrolyte anion species. The highest total FE in the investigated electrolyte on CuNS electrode obeys the following order: KHCO3 (86.9%, −0.4 V (vs. RHE)) &gt; KCl (54.7%, −0.5 V (vs. RHE)) &gt; KH2PO4 (1.0%, −0.9 V (vs. RHE)). In 1.0 mol L−1 KHCO3, the CuNS electrode shows a very complex products distribution; in 1.0 mol L−1 KCl, the products distribution can be feasibly controlled by the applied potential; while in 1.0 mol−1 L KH2PO4, ERCD is almost totally suppressed by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is the first time that the CuNS electrodes are applied for ERCD with low cost, simple synthesis, easy scale-up and high activity. Combined with the flexible control ability in FE and products distribution, CuNS electrode possesses great potential for the industrial application of ERCD. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide; Electrode (micro) morphology; Products distribution control; Self-supporting Cu electrode","Carbon dioxide; Chlorine compounds; Copper oxides; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Morphology; Nanoflowers; Nanosheets; Nanowires; Population distribution; Potassium compounds; Cu electrode; Electrochemical reductions; Electrode possesses; Electrode potentials; Faradaic efficiencies; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Products distributions; Threedimensional (3-d); Tungsten compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074233539

A hydrological model is implemented and integrated with a hydrodynamic model to assess flood risk under three scenarios. The streamflow into the BYD was validated against historical flash-flood events. The results indicate that the changing climate increased extreme precipitation, upstream total inflow and the flood risk at the core region of Xiong’an New Area (XNA), the newly announced special economic zone in the BYD area.

In the investigation, the laser Thomson scattering (LTS) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) have been adopted to measure electron temperature (Te) and electron excitation temperature (Texc), respectively. The LTS measurements show that a remarkable nonlinear behavior of Te as a function of the N2/(Ar + N2) ratio is found, which is caused by the collective interaction between the superelastic collision and the electron-impact excitation. The superelastic collisions by the highly excited vibrational nitrogen molecules can effectively heat the free electrons, while the electron kinetic energy can be transferred to N2 molecular internal energy via the electron impact with N2 in the ground state.

It is well known that free-living diazotrophic microorganisms are important to nitrogen cycling in mountain systems. However, the elevational patterns of free-living diazotrophs and the underlying ecological processes in controlling their turnover along broader gradients are less well documented. Here, we investigated the pattern of diazotrophic diversity along the elevational gradient (1800 m-4100 m) in Mount Gongga of China. The results showed that the α-diversity of diazotrophs did not change with the elevation from 1800 m to 2800 m, but decreased at elevations above 3000 m. Such diversity pattern was driven mainly by soil total carbon, nitrogen, and plant richness. Various diazotrophic taxa showed differential abundance-elevation relationships. Ecological processes determining diazotrophic community assemblage shift along the elevations. Deterministic processes were relatively stronger at both low and high elevations, whereas stochastic processes were stronger at the middle elevation. This study also suggested a strong relationship among aboveground plants and diazotrophs, highlighting their potential interactions, even for free-living diazotrophs. © 2019, Higher Education Press.","Community assemblage; Diazotrophs; Elevational gradient; Mount Gongga",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076565195

Understanding the energy use and environmental impacts of crop production will help identify environmentally damaging hotspots of agro-production, allowing environmental impacts to be assessed and crop management strategies optimized. Conventional farming has been widely employed in wolfberry (Lycium barbarum) cultivation in China, which is an important cash tree crop not only for the rural economy but also from an ecological standpoint. Energy use and global warming potential (GWP) were investigated in a wolfberry production system in the Yellow River irrigated Jingtai region of Gansu. In total, 52 household farms were randomly selected to conduct the investigation using questionnaires. Total energy input and output were 321,800.73 and 166,888.80 MJ ha−1, respectively, in the production system. The highest share of energy inputs was found to be electricity consumption for lifting irrigation water, accounting for 68.52%, followed by chemical fertilizer application (11.37%). Energy use efficiency was 0.52 when considering both fruit and pruned wood. Nonrenewable energy use (88.52%) was far larger than the renewable energy input. The share of GWP of different inputs were 64.52% electricity, 27.72% nitrogen (N) fertilizer, 5.07% phosphate, 2.32% diesel, and 0.37% potassium, respectively. The highest share was related to electricity consumption for irrigation, followed by N fertilizer use. Total GWP in the wolfberry planting system was 26,018.64 kg CO2 eq ha−1 and the share of CO2, N2O, and CH4 were 99.47%, 0.48%, and negligible respectively with CO2 being dominant. Pathways for reducing energy use and GHG emission mitigation include: conversion to low carbon farming to establish a sustainable and cleaner production system with options of raising water use efficiency by adopting a seasonal gradient water pricing system and advanced irrigation techniques; reducing synthetic fertilizer use; and policy support: smallholder farmland transfer (concentration) for scale production, credit (small- and low-interest credit) and tax breaks. © 2019, The Author(s).","Energy use; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas emissions; Wolfberry plantation","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical contamination; Crops; Cultivation; Economics; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Nitrogen fertilizers; Pollution control; Surveys; Water conservation; Water supply; Electricity-consumption; Energy use; Environmental pollutants; Ghg emission mitigations; Global warming potential; Non-renewable energy use; Synthetic fertilizers; Wolfberry plantation; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; diesel fuel; fertilizer; methane; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; phosphate fertilizer; potassium fertilizer; unclassified drug; carbon; agricultural land; carbon emission; cleaner production; crop production; cultivation; energy use; fertilizer application; food production; global warming; greenhouse gas; oasis; strategic approach; water use efficiency; agricultural land; agricultural procedures; Article; carbon footprint; China; crop production; electricity; energy conservation; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental policy; fertilizer application; food industry; fruit air drying; greenhouse effect; harvesting; household; industrial production; irrigation (agriculture); Lycium; nonhuman; pest control; plantation; questionnaire; renewable energy; river; sustainable development; tax; tree pruning; water supply; weeding; wood; agriculture; China; Gansu; Yellow River; Lycium barbarum; Agriculture; Carbon; China; Fertilizers; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Lycium; Methane; Nitrous Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075373966

However, little is known about the effects of these activities on GHG emissions, especially under different grazing management. This paper aimed to measure changes in CO2 and CH4 efflux with varying grazing management during the warm and cold seasons and to relate CO2 and CH4 efflux to pika burrow density and zokor mound density with different grazing management. Results of this study showed that CO2 efflux was significantly affected by the grazing season, whereas CH4 efflux was significantly affected by the grazing system. There were significant relationships between GHG efflux and rodent population density which were regulated by grazing management. CO2 efflux increased linearly with rodent density under seasonal continuous grazing in warm season. CO2 and CH4 efflux and rodent population density showed a significant quadratic convex relationship under rotational grazing at 24 SM/ha in warm and cold seasons and rotational grazing at 48 SM/ha in cold season. Under rotational grazing at light stocking rate (24 SM/ha), appropriate populations of rodents were beneficial for decreasing GHG emissions.

Regional disparities of socioeconomic conditions intensify the complexity of region-oriented policy making. With this circumstance, this paper explores the spatiotemporal features and driving mechanisms of SO2, NOx and PM2.5 emissions from TPG during 2005–2015 in 30 provincial regions of China by applying a holistic approach. Firstly, the temporal variations of the emissions are analyzed followed by the identification of spatial aggregation characteristics through spatial autocorrelation analysis. Secondly, the contributions of the drivers of temporal changes in emissions are quantified by LMDI method. Finally, principal component analysis and clustering analysis are combined to further investigate the classification features of regions in terms of the drivers. The results indicate that there is spatial aggregation effect of pollutant emissions and the regions pertain to high-high type mainly gather in the Yangtze River delta and the North China. Treatment technology, power generation technology and power structure are the main inhibitory drivers, while power demand and population are the promotive ones. Emissions in less developed and power-abundant regions are mainly driven by energy structure, power generation technology and power transmission. In developed regions, GDP, population and industrialization rate present greater impacts on emissions. The approach and the analytical results are expected to offer better decision support to targeted national and local emission reduction policies for TPG. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollutants; LMDI; Principal component analysis; Socioeconomic drivers; Spatial analysis; Thermal power generation","Decision support systems; Emission control; Principal component analysis; Spatial variables measurement; Air pollutants; LMDI; Power generation technology; Socio-economic conditions; Spatial analysis; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatio temporal features; Thermal power generation; Air pollution; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; emission; power generation; principal component analysis; socioeconomic impact; spatiotemporal analysis; thermal power; air pollution; Article; China; controlled study; decision support system; energy consumption; environmental policy; gross national product; industrialization; limit of quantitation; particulate matter; principal component analysis; spatial autocorrelation analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; thermal analysis; thermal power generation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071917429

This study explored the dose effects of calcium peroxide (CaO2) on inhibiting harmful gases emissions and restoring the scenic effect (including visual sense and olfactory sense) of anoxic/anaerobic landscape water system. The results indicated that the emissions of H2S, CO2 and CH4 from the anoxic/anaerobic water system were obviously inhibited in the reactors with CaO2 additions and the effect was positively correlated with the CaO2 dose. Meanwhile, the concentrations of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and soluble sulfide (S2−), and turbidity in the overlying water (the water-layer above the sediment-water interface) were also decreased in the reactors dosed with CaO2. The reason was ascribed to the improvement of the anoxic/anaerobic condition in the water system and the increase of the species richness, bacteria count and aerobic microorganism abundance in sediment. Furthermore, 0.12 kg-CaO2 m−2-sediment was selected as the optimal dose, which was based on considering the inhibiting effect of the harmful gases emissions, comprehensive influence and costs. Compared with control check (CK, the reactor without adding CaO2), the optimal dose of CaO2 could reduce 75.10% CH4, 81.02% CO2 and 100% H2S in gases, and decrease 81.52% S2−, 42.85% TCOD and 84.01% turbidity in the overlying water. In conclusion, all the dosages of CaO2 could improve the anoxic condition of water system and 0.12 kg-CaO2 m−2-sediment was the optimal dose in inhibiting harmful gases emissions, which could keep an excellent water quality in this simulation experiment. Therefore, this study may provide a feasible method and the optimal dose for inhibiting the emissions of harmful gases and restoring the scenic effect in the similar anoxic/anaerobic landscape water. © 2019","Anoxic/anaerobic condition; Calcium peroxide dosages; Harmful gases; Landscape water system; Sulfur transformation","Aerobic bacteria; Aquatic ecosystems; Carbon dioxide; Chemical oxygen demand; Gases; Health risks; Hydrogen sulfide removal (water treatment); Oxidation; Peroxides; Sulfur compounds; Turbidity; Water quality; Waterworks; Aerobic microorganisms; Anoxic/anaerobic condition; Calcium peroxides; Inhibiting effect; Landscape water systems; Sediment water interface; Sulfur transformation; Urban landscape waters; Calcium compounds; calcium peroxide; carbon dioxide; hydrogen disulfide; peroxide; sulfide; unclassified drug; water; calcium peroxide; peroxide; anoxic conditions; aquatic ecosystem; calcium; dose-response relationship; emission inventory; hypoxia; inhibition; reaction kinetics; sulfur; water quality; anoxia; Article; bacterial count; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; cost; gas; harmful gases emission; landscape; physical chemistry; pollution; population abundance; sediment; species richness; turbidity; water supply; anaerobic growth; ecosystem; hypoxia; water pollutant; water quality; Anaerobiosis; Ecosystem; Gases; Hypoxia; Peroxides; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072298341

A conceptual framework of long-term adaptation planning for climate change in road systems is proposed to ensure the resilience and sustainability of road transport systems under various climate risks such as flooding and increased temperature. To do so, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is first employed to evaluate the climate risks in the UK road transport networks. This modelling approach can tackle the high uncertainty in risk data and thus facilitate the development of the climate adaptation framework and its application in the UK road sector. To examine the feasibility of this model, a nationwide survey is conducted among the stakeholders to analyse the climate risks, in terms of the timeframe of climate threats, the likelihood of occurrence, the severity of consequences, and infrastructure resilience. From the modelling perspective, this work brings novelty by expanding the risk attribute “the severity of consequence” into three sub-attributes including economic loss, damage to the environment, and injuries and/or loss of life. It advances the-state-of-the-art technique in the current relevant literature from a single to multiple tier climate risk modelling structure. Secondly, an Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach is used to prioritise the best adaptation measure(s) by considering both the risk analysis results from the FBR and the implementation costs simultaneously. The main new contributions of this part lie in the rich raw data collected from the real world to provide useful practical insights for achieving road resilience when facing increasing climate risk challenges. During this process, a qualitative analysis of several national reports regarding the impacts posed by climate change, risk assessment and adaptation measures in the UK road sector is conducted for the relevant decision data (i.e. risk and cost). It is also supplemented by an in-depth interview with a senior planner from Highways England. The findings provide road planners and decision makers with useful insights on identification and prioritisation of climate threats as well as selection of cost-effective climate adaptation measures to rationalise adaptation planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation measure; Bayesian networks; Climate change; Evidential reasoning; Risk analysis; Road planning; Transportation","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Highway planning; Losses; Motor transportation; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Roads and streets; Sustainable development; Transportation; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptation measure; Evidential reasoning; Evidential reasoning approaches; Increased temperature; Infrastructure resiliences; Road planning; Road transport systems; State-of-the-art techniques; Climate change; adaptive management; Bayesian analysis; climate change; climate effect; risk assessment; road transport; transportation planning; transportation system; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062479391

Different relationships were found among regions. The economic growth, population, energy consumption structure, industrialization, and FDI were the key factors influencing air quality. Verification of the EKC curve indicated that the central region was linear, and the other regions had an inverted N-shape. The dynamic evolution of urbanization and the air quality were also analyzed with a panel threshold regression model. Urbanization in China has a triple threshold for air quality as an economic growth threshold. There were significant double thresholds in the eastern, central, and western regions. In view of the above analysis, policies and recommendations are proposed regarding how to change the mode of economic development and narrow the urbanization gap among regions to reduce air pollutant emissions and facilitate sustainable development. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","economic growth; kernel density estimation; panel threshold effect, PM2.5; urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073826178

This study identified the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the U.S. The goal was to determine if the rigid link between the two can be changed, and identify the potential drivers of this trend. We combined the Cobb–Douglas (C-D) production function and the extended Kaya equation to develop decomposition and decoupling techniques to quantify six potential effects. The results show that the investment effect and economy structure effect played the most important roles in increasing carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast, the energy intensity effect cut carbon emissions in most of the years studied. Strong decoupling and weak decoupling are the main states; the energy intensity effect accelerated the decoupling process. In contrast, the investment effect and labor effect decelerated the decoupling process in recent decades. The study concludes that emission mitigation and decoupling policies should emphasize energy efficiency, investment patterns, and improvements in labor force quality. © 2019","CO2 emission; Decomposition techniques; Decoupling; Economic growth; The United States","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Investments; CO2 emissions; Decomposition technique; Decoupling; Economic growths; The United States; Economic and social effects; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic growth; economic structure; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; investment; policy approach; pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; economic aspect; economic development; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental policy; gross national product; investment; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; United States; workforce; United States; Torreya nucifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072167511

In sugarcane, HXK is involved in regulating source/sink carbon balance. However, the characteristics of sugarcane HXK genes remain unclear. This study revealed that the full-length cDNA sequence of the HXK gene ShHXK8 cloned from sugarcane mature leaves contains a 1560 bp open reading frame and encodes a putative protein of 519 amino acids. Amongst HXKs from monocot and dicot subjected to phylogenetic analysis, ShHXK8 was clustered into a monocot-specific group with OsHXK7, SbHXK8 and ZmHXK1. Gene expression analysis in Saccharum spp. hybrid ROC22 plants showed that ShHXK8 was expressed in leaves and stalks and expressed highly in mature leaves and young internodes. The difference in the expression of ShHXK8 was compared in high-sugar-content (HSC) and low-sugar-content (LSC) Saccharum officinarum plants. The expression of ShHXK8 in the leaves and internodes 3–24 of HSC plants was lower than that of LSC plants. The expression of ShHXK8 in the internodes 1–2 of HSC plants was higher than that of LSC plants. ShHXK8–GFP fusion was located in the cytosol by transiently expressing the corresponding vectors in rice mesophyll protoplasts.

Engaged with anticipatory risk governance and urban climate experimentation literatures, this article critically examines recent resiliency infrastructure experiments in Miami Beach, Florida, a key climate change site known as ground zero for sea level rise in the United States. Using critical analysis of media and policy documents, site observation, and political and ecological theory, this article explores resilience experimentation in Miami Beach as a matter of transforming modes of anticipatory risk governance in the Anthropocene “back loop.” Beyond mere technical innovations, what visions of urban life and futures are forwarded in these experiments, and how are they transforming the nature of urbanism? Rather than courageous, utopian attempts to positively transform the city, the paper argues, these projects seek to lock Miami Beach and its residents into a single, unitary vision of the future, one of high-end real estate and luxury lifestyles buttressed by an invisible background of service and other wage work. The paper further argues however that this dream of Miami Beach's static future may be undone by the city's own experimental efforts to secure it. To conclude the paper argues that Miami Beach's resilience experiments represent an emergent paradigm of “back loop urbanism,” a form of urban governance devised amidst dislocation, made up of distinct experiments that fold in local trajectories in unique and sometimes conflicting ways. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropocene; Climate futures; Experimentation; Government; Miami; Resilience; Urbanism","Anthropocene; beach; climate change; coastal zone; critical analysis; experimental study; future prospect; sea level change; state role; urbanization; Florida [United States]; Miami; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074474731

This “Eastern African climate paradox” confounds use of climate projections for adaptation planning across Eastern Africa. Here we show the decline corresponds to a later onset and earlier cessation of the long rains, with a similar seasonal maximum in area-averaged daily rainfall. Previous studies have explored the role of remote teleconnections, but those mechanisms do not sufficiently explain the decline or the newly identified change in seasonality. Using a large ensemble of observations, reanalyses and atmospheric simulations, we propose a regional mechanism that explains both the observed decline and the recent partial recovery. A decrease in surface pressure over Arabia and warmer north Arabian Sea is associated with enhanced southerlies and an earlier cessation of the long rains. This is supported by a similar signal in surface pressure in many atmosphere-only models giving lower May rainfall and an earlier cessation. Anomalously warm seas south of Eastern Africa delay the northward movement of the tropical rain-band, giving a later onset. These results are key in understanding the paradox. It is now a priority to establish the balance of mechanisms that have led to these trends, which are partially captured in atmosphere-only simulations. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"climate change; climate prediction; computer simulation; rainband; rainfall; teleconnection; Arabian Sea; East Africa; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080861095

The City of Kitakyushu, Japan has actively implemented eco-friendly policies since 1967 and recently inspired the pursuit of sustainable development around the world, especially in the Global South region. However, empirical studies on the effects of green growth policies are still lacking. This study explores the relationship between road infrastructure development and average industrial firm size with air pollution in the city through the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Non-linear Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) methods were applied on nearly 50-years’ time series data, from 1967 to 2015. The results show that the shape of the EKC of industrial growth, measured by average firm size, depends on the type of air pollution: inverted N-shaped relationships with NO2 and CO, and the U-shaped relationships with falling dust particle and Ox. Regarding infrastructure development, on the one hand, our analysis shows a positive effect of road construction on alleviating the amount of falling dust and CO concentration. On the other hand, the emissions of NO2 and Ox are shown to rise when plotted against road construction. The decline of CO emission, when plotted against both industrial growth and road development, indicates that the ruthlessness of the local government in pursuing green growth policies has been effective in this case. However, the story is not straightforward when it comes to other air pollutants, which hints at the limits of the current policies. The case of Kitakyushu illustrates the complex dynamics of the interaction among policy, industry, infrastructure, and air pollution. It can serve as an important reference point for other cities in the Global South when policies are formed, and progress is measured in the pursuit of a green economy. Finally, as an OECD SDGs pilot city and the leading Asian green-growth city, policymakers in Kitakyushu city are recommended to revise the data policy to enhance the findability and interoperability of data, as well as to invest in the application of big data. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075947083

Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone-carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of &gt;90%, and a work of 40-90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing &lt;30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Adsorption; Carbon capture; Carbon nanotubes; Carboxylation; Electric discharges; Electrochemical cells; Energy dissipation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Quinone; Ancillary equipment; Carbon-nanotube composites; Cell architectures; Faradaic efficiencies; Incumbent technology; Negative electrode; Parasitic energy loss; Reactive adsorption; Carbon dioxide; adsorption; carbon nanotube; concentration (composition); electrochemical method; energy efficiency; equipment; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076515533

Its use is demonstrated on the OH(A-X) spectrum near 310 nm. A limitation of the method is identified: for overlapping spectra of the OH(A-X) and N2(C-B, Δv = 1) band sequence, the calculation may often fail due to insufficient number of measured points. This is solved by introducing experimentally determined bounds for the N2(C) rotational distribution. Three cases are presented: (i) with undisturbed OH(A-X) emission, (ii) with strong emission of N2(C-B) in the said spectral range, and (iii) with weak but not negligible nitrogen emission. In case (ii), the data in the spectral range 306-320 nm are sufficient for the analysis. In case (iii), information from another spectral range with undisturbed N2(C-B) emission is necessary. These illustrate all relevant cases often encountered in laboratory plasmas. The calculated Boltzmann plots are not further analyzed in this article but can be used for development and validation of kinetic models with rotational resolution.

Our objective is to identify decisive factors, methodological gaps and processes that affect environmental performance. We generally identified methodological gaps in expanding systems borders. In energy systems, the replaced energy source did not consider power generation or dynamic regulation. All studies adopted mixed energy sources or marginal approaches. Agroecosystems included the carbon sequestration potential and compensation for the production of synthetic fertilizers only. A limited range of scientifically proven benefits of compost use has been reported. In general, studies provided a limited account of the effects of use on land emissions, but contradictory assumptions emerged, mainly in modelling synthetic fertilizer compensation. Only three studies compensated direct emissions from the use of synthetic fertilizers, and none included indirect emissions. Further studies should include an analysis of the additional benefits of compost use, compensate for the effects of emissions from synthetic fertilizer use on land and mix attributional and consequential approaches in energy system expansion. © The Author(s) 2019.","Anaerobic digestion; carbon sequestration; circular economy; composting; environmental assessment; organic waste; sustainable agriculture; waste-to-energy","Agriculture; Composting; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental management; Fertilizers; Life cycle; Carbon sequestration; Circular economy; Environmental assessment; Organic wastes; Sustainable agriculture; Waste to energy; Anaerobic digestion; fossil fuel; nitrogen fertilizer; phosphorus; fertilizer; alternative agriculture; anaerobic digestion; carbon sequestration; compost; environmental assessment; environmental economics; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; waste treatment; agroecosystem; anaerobic digestion; bioremediation; carbon sequestration; compensation; composting; ecotoxicity; energy conservation; energy consumption; energy recovery; energy resource; energy use impact; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; food waste; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; incineration; life cycle assessment; low income country; middle income country; municipal biowaste; municipal solid waste; municipal waste; narrow waste system; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; ozone depletion; particulate matter; priority journal; recycling; Review; volatilization; waste disposal; composting; Composting; Fertilizers; Recycling",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074434361

The change of closed canopy forests to open canopy forests may indicate disturbance within the closed canopy forest. Within the local context of the Philippines, few studies have been conducted to monitor changes in closed canopy forest lands. Efforts to do so are limited by the spatial extent, remoteness and ruggedness of closed canopy forests. Satellite imagery can cover the spatial extent of forest lands as well as provide constant revisit periods for monitoring. However, while multispectral imaging can detect changes in land cover, it has limitations when detecting the subtler change from closed canopy to open canopy forest cover. This study aims to provide baseline spectral characterization of a closed canopy forest in the Philippines. For this study, a hyperspectral sensor (EO1-Hyperion) with 198 band channels ranging from 426.82 nm to 2395.50 nm and a pixel size of 30 m was used to characterize the spectral variations of closed canopy forest, open canopy forest, shrubs and cropland in Northern Sierra Madre, Philippines. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was employed to sort the image into classes as well as to characterize intra-spectral variations among the identified classes. Spectral library endmembers were assembled, optimized and used to classify the image. The spectral libraries were optimized by using Endmember Average Root Mean Square Error (EAR), Minimum Average Spectral Angle (MASA) and Iterative Endmember Selection (IES).

Analysing the natural hydrological regime depending on rainfall, soils and topography in the region and the man-made interventions lies at the heart of this landscape archaeological study. Integrating evidence from various disciplines (hydrology, geomorphology, soil science, archaeobiological methods, ceramic studies, evaluation of literary sources based on papyri) and from various periods (late 2nd millennium BCE to 7th century CE) allowed for the reconstruction of the ancient water management and the related life-strategies. An assessment of climatic conditions and morphological features of the Eastern Marmarica is provided, where wadis, alluvial fans, but also lateral wadi slopes and to a certain extent even parts of the vast tableland plains represent favourable geomorphological units for water harvesting and hence, agricultural production. Yet, a characteristic that sets the Marmarican systems apart from those in other arid regions are cultivated terrace systems (run-in areas) that are located on lower lateral valley slopes and even on the tableland plains. The results provide insights into the long-term responses of the inhabitants in antiquity to catchment hydrology by water harvesting and the effects of their interventions, the adapted livelihoods, regional specialization of rural production and intra- and interregional exchange of goods.

The aim of this study was to predict the future distribution of two estuarine species (Bassia diffusa and Hibiscus tiliaceus) from two biogeographical regions under climate change. The Bioclim and Maxent modelling algorithms were used to calculate current climate suitability and were projected onto future climate data to develop climate suitability maps. The trained area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values ranged from 0.723 to 0.936 for both species under the current climatic conditions, and from 0.695 to 0.933 for future conditions. Distribution range contraction for Bassia diffusa is predicted along its eastern distribution limit (South-East coast) in South Africa, suggesting extirpation in 42 out of 62 estuaries. This may allow mangroves to expand into areas where B. diffusa will be lost. Low suitability was predicted for H. tiliaceus in warm temperate estuaries which may limit further expansion. Future climate change scenarios in this region predict that temperature will not increase above the minimum temperature tolerance of H. tiliaceus.

While several studies have developed land use regression surfaces to describe the intra-urban variability of these environmental exposures, it is less well known how green spaces modify these surfaces. In this study, we investigated these environmental benefits of green spaces for the Canadian Central Experimental Farm, a 4 km2 agricultural facility, located adjacent to the urban core of Ottawa, Canada. Fall, winter and summer mobile monitoring campaigns were conducted in 2016/17 within a 40 km2 area centered on the CEF to characterize the spatial variability of: fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ultrafine particles (UFPs), black carbon (BC) and temperature. We concurrently measured two routes each morning (09:30-10:30) and evening (17:00-18:00) for 14 consecutive days in the three seasons. Median exposure levels for each road segment were calculated and used as inputs for season-specific land use regression models. These models were developed for each combination of environmental variable (PM2.5, UFP, BC, and temperature) and season (fall, winter, and summer). Predictors included land and road types as well as season-specific urban greenness represented by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Levels and spatial patterns of air pollution and temperature varied by season. We characterized the spatial relationship between the CEF and ambient air pollution and temperature measures by developing linear regression models with the distance to the closest border of the farm as the main predictor. Other land use variable which changed the main effect by ≥ 10% were included in the models. Within the study area, each kilometer of distance from the closest CEF border was associated with increases of fall PM2.5 (12.1%, 95%CI: 6.1%–18.4%), winter PM2.5 (6.8%, 95%CI: 2.4%–11.3%), summer BC (74.1%, 95%CI: 12.2%–167.7%), and fall temperature (2.8%, 95%CI: 1.3%–4.2%). These results suggest that this unique urban green space has important beneficial impacts on ambient air pollution concentrations and for mitigating extreme heat events for which a large portion of Ottawa's populace is exposed. © 2019","Air pollution; BC; Green space; Land use regression; Mobile monitoring; PM2.5; UFP; Urban heat","Agricultural robots; Air pollution; Land use; Pollution control; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Urban planning; Vegetation; Environmental Monitoring; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Green spaces; Land use regression; Land-use regression models; Mobile monitoring; Normalized difference vegetation index; PM2.5; Atmospheric temperature; black carbon; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); greenspace; heat island; land use change; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution exposure; regression analysis; air pollution; ambient air; Article; autumn; Canada; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; particulate matter; priority journal; summer; temperature measurement; urban area; vegetation; winter; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Ottawa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072525784

Spatial interpolation methods and linear regression models with regularization have been compared to perform the ensemble. The study case is based on the region of the Bay of Algeciras (Spain). This area is very industrialized and presents high concentrations of traffic. Air pollution data has been collected from the monitoring network maintained by the Andalusian Government in the region. On one hand, two totally different methods have been used and compared such as inverse distance weight (IDW) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in order to generate maps of pollutant concentration values. On the other hand, an ensemble approach has been developed using the outputs of the previous models. The ensemble is based on an ANN with backpropagation learning. An experimental procedure using cross-validation has been applied in order to compare the different models based on several performance indexes (R correlation coefficient, MSE, MAE and d index of fitness) and together to Friedman test and Bonferroni correction. The results reveal that the proposed ensemble approach presents better performance than single models in general terms. A validation procedure has been conducted using a leave-one-out strategy using each monitoring station. IDW method presents an average value of R equals 0.72 and a maximum R equals 0.87, a minimum MSE equals 78.00, a minimum MAE equals 5.841 and a maximum d equals 0.913. LASSO presents an average value of R equals 0.76 and a maximum R equals 0.86, a minimum MSE equals 59.13, a minimum MAE equals 5.490 and a maximum d equals 0.900. Finally, the ANN ensemble shows an average value of R equals 0.77 and a maximum R equals 0.87, a minimum MSE equals 54.05, a minimum MAE equals 4.972 and a maximum d equals 0.915. The main objective has been to produce adequate atmospheric pollutant concentration maps and, therefore, to obtain estimations for locations that are distinct to the monitoring stations. Another objective has been to have in hand a system to produce robust measurements. This kind of system could be useful for missing data imputation and to find out reading errors (i.e. unexpected deviations or calibration problems) in some of the nodes of a network. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution maps; Artificial neural networks; Ensemble; IDW; LASSO","Backpropagation; Inverse problems; Neural networks; Pollution detection; Regression analysis; Air pollution maps; Artificial neural network ensembles; Backpropagation learning; Ensemble; LASSO; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Linear regression models; Spatial interpolation method; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); ensemble forecasting; mapping method; nitrogen dioxide; pollution monitoring; spatial analysis; air pollution; Article; artificial neural network; concentration (parameter); correlation coefficient; information processing; linear system; measurement; Spain; spatial analysis; traffic; validation study; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; procedures; statistical model; time factor; Algeciras Bay; Andalucia; Cadiz [Andalucia]; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Linear Models; Neural Networks, Computer; Spain; Spatial Analysis; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074698322

One technology that has the potential to meet future legislation is Low Temperature Combustion (LTC), which has the potential to significantly reduce NOx over conventional diesel combustion. Most studies reported in the literature evaluating this technology only change 'one-factor-at-a-time' at steady state conditions. This paper addresses these issues and presents a methodology utilising DoE analysis to optimise a validated multi-fidelity engine simulation for LTC over a transient cycle (WLTP) which makes the results more applicable to real world driving conditions. A validated simulation for a 2.4-litre compression ignition engine was developed in Ricardo WAVE. To increase the fidelity of the model, empirical data such as 3D scans of the inlet geometry were included. The simulation was validated against experimental engine emissions and performance data. A characterization study using a full factorial DoE was performed on the whole engine simulation to minimise vehicle emissions using LTC. The vehicle simulation was tested against the WLTP and the response of the emissions for different levels of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), pilot start of injection (SOI) and main SOI timings and pilot injection duration were recorded. The results of the optimization showed that over the WLTP the NOx emissions decreased by approximately 85 % with an EGR of 47.5 %, retarding the pilot SOI and main SOI maps with 1 CAD compared to the default maps and increasing the pilot injection duration by 200 microseconds. NOx emissions were reduced by approximately 18 % with the use of 12 % EGR without exceeding the Euro 4 CO emissions limit. Further increase in EGR percentage significantly increased the CO emissions. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Automobile manufacture; Combustion; Computer aided design; Design of experiments; Diesel engines; Digital storage; Gas emissions; Laws and legislation; Nitrogen oxides; Powertrains; Temperature; Automotive manufacturers; Characterization studies; Compression ignition engine; Emissions legislation; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Low temperature combustion; Real-world drivings; Steady-state condition; Exhaust gas recirculation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084415405

However, due to the complexity of the combustion process the addition of renewable content, such as biodiesel and ethanol, can have a detrimental effect on other engine emissions. In particular the engine load can have a significant impact on the emissions. Most research that have studied this issue are based on steady state tests that are unrealistic of real world driving and will not capture the difference between full and part loads. This study aims to address this by investigating the effect of renewable fuel blends of diesel, biodiesel and ethanol on the emissions of a compression ignition engine tested over the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). Diesel, biodiesel and ethanol were blended to form binary and ternary blends, the ratios were determined by Design of Experiments (DoE). The total amount of emissions for CO, CO2 and NOx as well as the fuel consumption, were measured from a 2.4 L compression ignition (CI) engine running over the WLTP drive cycle. The results depicted that percentages smaller than 10% of ethanol in the fuel blend can reduce CO emissions, CO2 emissions as well as NOx emissions, but increases fuel consumption with increasing percentage of ethanol in the fuel blend. Blends with biodiesel resulted in minor increases in CO emissions due to the engine being operated in the low and medium load regions over the WLTP. CO2 emissions as well as NOx emissions increased as a result of the high oxygen content in biodiesel which promoted better combustion. Fuel consumption increased for blends with biodiesel as a result from biodiesel's lower heating value. All the statistical models describing the engine responses were significant and this demonstrated that a mixture DoE is suitable to quantify the effect of fuel blends on an engine's emissions response. An optimised ternary blend of B2E9 was found to be suitable as a ’drop in’ fuel that will reduce harmful emissions of CO emissions by approximately 34%, NOx emissions by 10% and CO2 emissions by 21% for transient engine operating scenarios such as the WLTP drive cycle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Design of experiment; Engine emission; Ethanol; Ternary blend; WLTP","Biodiesel; Calorific value; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Design of experiments; Ethanol; Laws and legislation; Nitrogen oxides; Combustion pro-cess; Compression ignition engine; Compression-ignition engines; Engine emission; Lower heating value; Real-world drivings; Ternary blends; WLTP; Diesel engines; alternative fuel; biofuel; carbon emission; diesel; diesel engine; emission; ethanol; European Union; experimental design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072303247

This interventional implementation study among 649 adults and children living in rural communities in Uganda, Vietnam and Kyrgyzstan, was performed after situational analyses and awareness programmes. Outcomes included household air pollution (PM2.5 and CO), self-reported respiratory symptoms (with CCQ and MRC-breathlessness scale), chest infections, school absence and intervention acceptability. Measurements were conducted at baseline, 2 and 6–12 months after implementing improved cookstoves/heaters. Mean PM2.5 values decrease by 31% (to 95.1 µg/m3) in Uganda (95%CI 71.5–126.6), by 32% (to 31.1 µg/m3) in Vietnam (95%CI 24.5–39.5) and by 65% (to 32.4 µg/m3) in Kyrgyzstan (95%CI 25.7–40.8), but all remain above the WHO guidelines. CO-levels remain below the WHO guidelines. After intervention, symptoms and infections diminish significantly in Uganda and Kyrgyzstan, and to a smaller extent in Vietnam. Quantitative assessment indicates high acceptance of the new cookstoves/heaters. In conclusion, locally tailored implementation of improved cookstoves/heaters is acceptable and has considerable effects on respiratory symptoms and indoor pollution, yet mean PM2.5 levels remain above WHO recommendations. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"adult; air pollution; air quality; Article; chest infection; child; comparative study; dyspnea; female; health program; household; human; Kyrgyzstan; major clinical study; male; middle income country; outcome assessment; particulate matter; population and population related phenomena; rural population; Uganda; Viet Nam; World Health Organization; adverse event; clinical trial; cooking; family size; incidence; indoor air pollution; multicenter study; preschool child; prevention and control; respiratory tract infection; rural population; Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Child, Preschool; Cooking; Family Characteristics; Female; Household Articles; Humans; Incidence; Kyrgyzstan; Male; Respiratory Tract Infections; Rural Population; Uganda; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070997688

This paper looks at the impacts of this policy in the context of The Netherlands, where up to 2016 substantial tax incentives were provided to fuel efficient lease cars, especially for hybrid and electric lease cars. For this analysis this paper uses a new model of vehicle type choice. Existing models for the choice among car type alternatives either exclude electric and hybrid cars or are based on stated preference data. In both cases, the models usually focus on privately-owned cars. The car type choice model for lease cars, that is used in this paper, includes electric and hybrid alternatives and is estimated on revealed preference data from lease car users in The Netherlands. Simulations with this model show that the tax incentives provided over the period 2011–2016 have led to a reduction in CO2 emissions of lease cars, but also to an increase in the share of diesel cars and local air pollution. © 2019 World Conference on Transport Research Society",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069950503

Climate change-related health problems due to floods and waterborne diseases are increasing. With increasing insight into impacts of climate change and urbanization on water availability and quality and of required adaptations, a shift towards climate-resilient water safety planning was introduced into an Ethiopian strategy and guidance document to guarantee safe drinking water. Climate-resilient water safety planning was implemented in the urban water supplies of Addis Ababa and Adama, providing drinking water to 5 million and 500,000 people, respectively. Based on the risks identified with climate-resilient water safety planning, water quality monitoring can be optimized by prioritizing parameters and events which pose a higher risk for contaminating the drinking water. Water quality monitoring was improved at both drinking water utilities and at the Public Health Institute to provide relevant data used as input for climate-resilient water safety planning. By continuously linking water quality monitoring and climate-resilient water safety planning, utilization of information was optimized, and both approaches benefit from linking these activities. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Drinking water; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk-based monitoring; Water quality; Water safety plans","drinking water; risk assessment; safety; urbanization; water availability; water management; water planning; water quality; Article; climate change; climate resilience; environmental planning; Ethiopia; human; population growth; public health; quality control; risk assessment; urban population; urbanization; water borne disease; water quality; water supply; climate change; risk management; Addis Ababa; Ethiopia; Climate Change; Drinking Water; Ethiopia; Humans; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Water Quality; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076979725

Here, we present the Spectral-to-NarrOWBand ALbedo module (SNOWBAL, version 1.2) to couple effectively a spectral albedo model with a narrowband radiation scheme. Specifically, the Two-streAm Radiative TransfEr in Snow model (TARTES) is coupled with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS), cycle 33R1, atmospheric radiation scheme based on the Rapid Radiation Transfer Model, which is embedded in the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model version 2.3p2 (RACMO2). This coupling allows to explicitly account for the effect of clouds, water vapor, snow impurities and snow metamorphism on albedo. Firstly, we present a narrowband albedo method to project the spectral albedos of TARTES onto the 14 spectral bands of the IFS shortwave radiation scheme using a representative wavelength (RW) for each band. Using TARTES and spectral downwelling surface irradiance derived with the DIScrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer atmospheric model, we show that RWs primarily depend on the solar zenith angle (SZA), cloud content and water vapor. Secondly, we compare the TARTES narrowband albedo, using offline RACMO2 results for south Greenland, with the broadband albedo parameterizations of <span classCombining double low line""cit"" idCombining double low line""xref_text.1""><a hrefCombining double low line""#bib1.bibx20"">Gardner and Sharp</a> (<a hrefCombining double low line""#bib1.bibx20"">2010</a>)</span>, currently implemented in RACMO2, and the multi-layered parameterization of <span classCombining double low line""cit"" idCombining double low line""xref_text.2""><a hrefCombining double low line""#bib1.bibx34"">Kuipers Munneke et al.</a> (<a hrefCombining double low line""#bib1.bibx34"">2011</a>, PKM)</span>. The actual absence of radiation penetration in RACMO2 leads on average to a higher albedo compared with TARTES narrowband albedo. Furthermore, large differences between the TARTES narrowband albedo and PKM and RACMO2 are observed for high SZA and clear-sky conditions, and after melt events when the snowpack is very inhomogeneous. This highlights the importance of accounting for spectral albedo and radiation penetration to simulate the energy budget of the Greenland ice sheet. © Author(s) 2019.

This article characterizes livestock production and evaluates the potential and limitations of organic conversion and the energy efficiency of conventional dual purpose (milk and meat) cattle production in a humid tropical region of Chiapas, Mexico. Our analysis indicates that for the Livestock Production Units (LPU) of the study region, the greater the organic livestock conversion index (OLCI, 0–100%), the lower the values for herd size, stocking rate, total feed supplement, annual cost of feed purchased for cattle, and production cost per cow; by contrast, those LPU with greater OLCI have greater economic efficiency. Furthermore, the greater the OLCI, the greater the values of the following indicators: Feeding management, Sustainable grassland management, Ecological weed control in grasses and crops, Veterinary prevention and care, Food safety, and Ecological farm management. A direct relationship exists between the potential for organic conversion (>OLCI) and energy and economic efficiency. Meanwhile, an inverse relationship was found between OLCI and energy efficiency on the one hand, and - on the other - use of direct and indirect energy, total energy input, energy output, and number of people that could be fed with the energy from milk and meat produced. Converting LPU to organic production and increasing their energy efficiency depends on farmers further developing their abilities to manage sustainable agricultural systems through advisory, technical assistance, and permanent financial support. © 2019","Ecological agriculture; Energy; Indicators; Organic conversion; Sustainability","Agriculture; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Ecosystems; Fossil fuels; Indicators (instruments); Sustainable development; Tropical engineering; Tropics; Weed control; Ecological agricultures; Economic efficiency; Energy; Inverse relationship; Livestock production; Organic conversions; Sustainable agricultural system; Technical assistance; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072162479

In southern Chile, young peatlands (few centuries old) have originated due to clearcutting or fire at forest sites with high precipitation on poorly drained soils. These novel ecosystems are called anthropogenic peatlands here. Their role in the regional C cycle remains largely unknown. Here, we present 18 months of eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in an anthropogenic peatland in northern Chiloé Island, part of which is kept undisturbed for 30–40 years, by excluding human uses, and another section of the same peatland that has been disturbed by cattle grazing and Sphagnum moss extraction. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) were modeled from NEE, based on measured photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature, separately for each section of the peatland. Uncertainties of the annual flux estimates were assessed from the variability of modelled fluxes induced by applying different time-windows for model development between 10 and 20 days. The undisturbed area of the peatland was on average (± SD) a larger net CO2 sink (NEE = − 135 ± 267 g CO2 m−2 year−1) than the disturbed area (NEE = − 33 ± 111 g CO2 m−2 year−1). These NEE CO2 balances are small even though GPP and Reco were larger compared with other peatlands. Reco had a direct relationship with water table depth (from soil surface) and a negative relationship with soil water fraction. Our results show that the disturbance by moss extraction and cattle grazing is likely to reduce the CO2 sink function of many anthropogenic and natural peatlands on Chiloé Island, which are subjected to the same impacts. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon balance; Minerotrophic peatland; Moss harvest; Southern hemisphere; Sphagnum magellanicum","anthropogenic effect; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; clearcutting; disturbance; moss; net ecosystem exchange; net primary production; peatland; precipitation (climatology); Southern Hemisphere; Chile; Chiloe Island; Los Lagos; Patagonia; Bryophyta; Chilo; Sphagnum magellanicum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070418816

This technology will improve the transient control of the engine and its exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. This article describes the development of a rule-based algorithm for the air path control, which uses the knowledge of upcoming driving events to reduce especially NOX and particulate (soot) emissions. In the first section of this article, the boosting and the lean NOX trap systems of a diesel powertrain are investigated as relevant sub-systems for shorter prediction horizons, suitable for Car-to-X communication range. Reference control strategies, based on state-of-the-art engine control unit algorithms and suitable predictive control logics, are compared for the two sub-systems in a model in the loop simulation environment. The simulation driving cycles are based on Worldwide harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle and Real Driving Emissions regulations. Due to the shorter, and consequently more probable, prediction horizon and the demonstrated emission improvements, a dedicated rule-based algorithm for the air path control is developed and benchmarked in the Worldwide harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle as described in the second part of this article. Worldwide harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle test results show an improvement potential for engine-out soot and NOX emissions of up to 5.2% and 1.2%, respectively, for the air path case and a reduction of the average fuel consumption in Real Driving Emissions of up to 1% for the lean NOx trap case. In addition, the developed rule-based algorithm allows the adjustment of the desired NOx–soot trade-off, while keeping the fuel consumption constant. The study concludes with brief recommendations for future research directions, as for example, the introduction of a prediction module for the estimation of the vehicle operational profile in the prediction horizon. © IMechE 2019.","air path; Diesel; lean NOx trap; predictive control; vehicle connectivity","Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Model predictive control; Nitrogen oxides; Powertrains; Soot; Aftertreatment systems; Air paths; Car-to-X communications; Diesel; Engine control strategy; Future research directions; Lean NOx trap; Predictive control; Exhaust systems (engine)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063009437

We describe a base model imitating the operations of a real-world retailer using agents. We then introduce electric vehicles and charging hubs into our model. We evaluate how the use of electric vehicles, charging power and charging hubs influence the retailer's operations. Our simulation experiment suggests that, though they are useful, technological interventions alone are not sufficient to match the performance of a diesel fleet. Hence, reorganization of the urban delivery system is required in order to reduce carbon emissions significantly. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Diesel engines; Trucks; Agent based simulation; Base models; Carbon emissions; Real-world; Urban delivery; Electric automobiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081116488

However, it is little known how various plants respond to increasing precipitation in this region. Here we determined the impacts of water addition on leaf metabolites of grasses (Cymbopogon distans and Arundinella sitosa) and shrubs (Carissa spinarum and Bauhinia brachycarpa) in this area. Four levels of water additions (CK, T1, T2 and T3 indicating 0%, +20%, +40% and +60% relative to the current monthly precipitation, respectively) were designed. Sphingolipids substantially increased in the leaves of all four species with increasing water supply which suggests that these plants adopted biochemical strategy to tolerate the wet stress. However, both shrubs showed decreases in valine and threonine (amino acids), threonate, succinate and ascorbic acid (organic acids), galactose and rhamnose (sugars) and epicatchin and oleamides (secondary metabolites) with increasing water supply. Both grasses increased in the total metabolites at T1, but the total metabolites in A. sitosa significantly decreased at T2 and T3 while remains unchanged in C. distans. Tri-carboxylic acid cycle and amino acid metabolism in shrubs and shikimate pathway in grasses were strongly affected with water supply. Overall, shrubs and grasses respond differentially to variation in water addition in terms of metabolomics, which is helpful in understanding how plants respond to climate change. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"water; biology; China; climate change; ecosystem; energy metabolism; irrigation (agriculture); lipid metabolism; mass fragmentography; metabolism; metabolomics; phenotype; plant; plant leaf; Poaceae; procedures; Agricultural Irrigation; China; Climate Change; Computational Biology; Ecosystem; Energy Metabolism; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolomics; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Plants; Poaceae; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069268408

These include making optimal use of limited space, avoiding empty trips, meeting driver shortages as well as reducing costs and emissions such as CO2, particulate matter and noise. The mutual acceleration and reinforcement of technological trends such as electrification, digitization and automation may enable new vehicle and mobility concepts that can meet these challenges. One possible vehicle concept is presented in this article. It is based on on-the-road modularization, i.e., a vehicle that can change different transport capsules during operation. The vehicle is divided into an electrically propelled autonomous drive unit and a transport unit. Standardized interfaces between these units enable the easy design of capsules for different uses, while the drive unit can be used universally. Business models and operating strategies that allow optimal use of this vehicle concept are discussed in depth in the article. First, the current situation is analyzed followed by a detailed description of an exemplary business model using a business model canvas. The operating strategies and logistics concepts are illustrated and compared with conventional concepts. © 2019 by the authors.","Business model; City traffic; Freight transport; Mobility concepts; Public transport","Autonomous vehicles; Freight transportation; Modular construction; Roads and streets; Business modeling; City traffic; Commercial transport; Freight transport; Particulate Matter; Public transport; Standardized interfaces; Technological trends; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078707641

The design of public participation is often determined by local government. Yet, it remains largely unclear to what extent there is deliberate design of participation efforts and which objectives are served with the designs put into practice. This article reviews three cases of adaptation planning in the Netherlands, using a theory-derived framework that links the design of public participation with nine different objectives that participation could have. These case studies illustrate that participants did not depart from an explicitly formulated and agreed-upon objective, leading to a design of the participatory process that was highly contingent. The findings suggest that a more systematic and deliberate approach, in which both the objectives and the design of public participation are communicated explicitly, and are discussed by participants, increases the chance that the objectives are met. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The ARM mission goal is to ‘‘provide the climate research community with strategically located in situ and remote sensing observatories designed to improve the understanding and representation, in climate and earth system models, of clouds and aerosols as well as their interactions and coupling with the Earth’s surface.’’ Since 1996, ARM has met this goal by operating Aerosol Observing Systems (AOS) for in situ measurement of aerosols. Currently the five ARM AOSs are the most comprehensive field deployable aerosol systems in the United States. The AOS suite includes seven measurement classes: number concentration, size distribution, chemical composition, radiative and optical properties, hygroscopicity, trace gases, and supporting meteorological conditions. AOSs are designed as standardized measurement platforms to enable intercomparison across the ARM Facility for regional process studies within a global context.

At the same time, policies integrating agri-environmental and climate change mitigation reforms seem to keep farmers skeptical about structural changes in farm management. The formulation of agro-energy districts is the key to merge economic and environmental motives for farmers in the European Union. Our main goal is the assessment of sustainability based on environmental and economic data and the identification of potential energy generation from crop residues for thirteen major crops in Northern Greece. Furthermore, we follow a life cycle assessment and a life cycle costing approach to investigate the environmental and economic implications of conventional agricultural practices in the area under two scenarios. The first scenario depicts the common practice of burning residues in the side of the fields, while the second scenario integrates the idea of residues exploitation for energy generation. Agricultural residues from maize, peach trees, and sunflower could be the cornerstone of agro-energy districts based on the savings of emissions under the two relevant scenarios. Finally, tree crops (cherry, olive, and peach) are the most profitable crops as expected, while seven annual crops are heavily dependent on subsidiary help. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural residues; Agricultural sustainability; Biomass; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing","Agricultural wastes; Artificial life; Biomass; Climate change; Composting; Costs; Crops; Forestry; Fruits; Potential energy; Sustainable development; Agricultural practices; Agricultural sustainability; Climate change mitigation; Common agricultural policy; Economic and environmental assessments; Economic implications; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070078065

Andrews, and McDonald Forest), each under two different tree species (Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii and red alder, Alnus rubra). We found that nitrification-dependent N2O production across a range of acid forest soils depends on the site-specific contribution of AOB and AOA to nitrification because of their inherently distinct N2O yields. The latter were determined to be ~0.15 ± 0.01% for AOB and 0.06 ± 0.01% for AOA. Soil pH regulated the nitrifier-specific N2O production by affecting the nitrifier activity. AOA-dependent N2O production dominated at low pH (&lt;4.5), while AOB-dependent N2O production was favored in less acidic soils. Increase in relative contribution of the AOB nitrifying activity, favored by the increase in soil pH, was accompanied by higher total N2O yields. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Acid forest soils; Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea; N2O yield; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide production; Soil pH","Ammonia; Bacteria; Forestry; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea; Forest soils; N2O yield; Nitrous oxide production; Soil pH; Soils; acid soil; ammonia; bacterium; coniferous tree; emission; forest soil; inhibitor; nitrification; nitrous oxide; slurry; McDonald Forest; Oregon; United States; Alnus rubra; Nitrosomonadales; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072726851

Cluster analysis of the size distributions was performed to aid in the interpretation of the data. The results confirm previous findings of decreasing aerosol mass and number during the last decades as a result of reduced anthropogenic emissions in Europe. We show that both particle modal number concentration and size have substantially been reduced during the last 17 years. Negative trends in particle number concentration of about 10 cm-3 yr-1 are present for nuclei, Aitken, and accumulation modes. In total, integral particle number concentration has decreased by 30 %, from 1860 to ca. 1300 cm-3. The reduction in modal number concentration is accompanied by a decrease in modal size, and this decrease is largest for the accumulation mode (2 nm yr-1 or about 17% for the whole period). These reductions have resulted in a decrease in submicron particle mass (&lt; 390 nm) by more than 50% over the period 2000-2017. These decreases are similar to observations found at other stations in northern Europe. Although all size classes show a downward trend as annual averages, we also show that observed trends are not evenly distributed over the year and that a rather complex picture emerges where both sign and magnitude of trends vary with season and size. The strongest negative trends are present during spring (accumulation mode) and autumn (Aitken mode). The strongest positive trends are present during summer months (Aitken mode). The combined trajectory and data analyses do not present evidence for an increase in new particle formation formed locally, although some evidence of increased new particle formation some distance away from the receptor is present. Observed aerosol size distribution data, together with an adiabatic cloud parcel model, were further used to estimate the change in cloud droplet concentration for various assumptions of updraught velocities and aerosol chemical composition. The results indicate a substantial increase in the atmospheric brightening effect due to a reduction in cloud reflectivity corresponding to 10 %-12% reduction in cloud albedo over the period 2000-2017. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group.

The results showed that the dry weight and lipid productivity of C. pyrenoidosa was significantly increased by 84.92 and 74.44% in the presence of power plant tail gas, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimum carbon fixation sequestration of microalgae was 1.121 g/L and the average carbon fixation rate was 0.209 g/(L·d), which was 134.22% and 107.07% higher than the blank group. The effects of various toxic components of power plant tail gas on the growth of microalgae were also investigated. The results showed that the pretreatment process including desulfurization and denitrification of the power plant tail gas is needed before the utilization of CO2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chlorella pyrenoidosa; CO2 fixation; Lipid productivity; Microalgae; Municipal wastewater; Power plant tail gas","Algae; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Gases; Microorganisms; Productivity; Chlorella pyrenoidosa; CO2 fixation; Lipid productivities; Micro-algae; Municipal wastewaters; Tail gas; Power plants; carbon fixation; denitrification; growth rate; limiting factor; lipid; microalga; power plant; sequestration (chemistry); wastewater; Chlorella pyrenoidosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073671486

However, this has led to a contradictory situation where both high carbon emission and reduction exist together. The average economic growth of Inner Mongolia reached 15.76% between 2006 and 2016, which caused huge CO2 emissions. However, promotion of the renewable energy policy (since 2005) resulted in an energy self-sufficiency rate that reached 270.80% by 2016. In this study of the Inner Mongolia carbon emission situation, the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model was used to analyze the factors affecting carbon emission fluctuations from 2005 to 2016. The decoupling elasticity index was then used to measure the decoupling effect of the economic growth and carbon emissions. The results of this research show that: firstly, CO2 emissions increased rapidly from 651.03 million tons in 2006 to 1723.24 million tons in 2013. Despite a slight decline in CO2 emissions, a level above 1600 million tons was maintained between 2014 and 2016. Secondly, the industry sector was the main source of CO2 emissions in Inner Mongolia, and coal-based fuel played a determining role. Thirdly, in this study, two important contributions were made, including the discovery of two new drivers: labor and emission intensity factors. Further, findings about the effect of the six industrial sectors, economic structure, energy density, and emission intensity factors were also decomposed. It was found that during research period, the population factor, labor factor, and labor productivity factor all had a positive influence on CO2 emissions, whereas the economic structure factor and emission intensity factor had different impacts on the CO2 emissions depending on the particular industrial sector. Furthermore, the energy intensity of six industrial sectors contributed to the decrease in aggregate CO2 emissions. Finally, in this study, it was also found that economic growth and CO2 growth in Inner Mongolia presented a weak decoupling state. Policy recommendations based on these results have been presented. © 2019 by the authors.","China; CO2 emissions; Decoupling index; Inner Mongolia; LMDI analysis","carbon emission; economic growth; economic structure; energy intensity; energy policy; environmental economics; labor productivity; spatiotemporal analysis; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083864807

Prescribed reduction in stand density, i.e. thinning, has been proposed as a management tool to improve forest sustainability in face of a warmer, drier future. Thinning should potentially reduce net stand water use and improve water-availability for remaining trees, thus reducing their subsequent drought vulnerability. However, few studies have directly measured these effects. In 2009 we established a large-scale thinning experiment in a semi-arid, 40-years-old pine afforestation. Study plots (70 × 70 m) were thinned to 100, 200, and 300 trees ha−1, and compared with unthinned control plots (210–400 trees ha−1), each at five replications. Stem and needle growth, and needle gas exchange were measured along 3–9 consecutive years at seasonal to annual temporal resolution. Measurements at the tree-scale were further up-scaled using both simple upscaling relationships and using an ecosystem model of coupled carbon, energy and hydrology (Regional Hydro Ecologic Simulation System, RHESSys). At the needle scale, photosynthesis was 70% higher at the 100 trees ha−1 than at 300 trees ha−1, whereas transpiration was merely 10% higher. Consequently, stem and needle growth increased by 100% and 20%, respectively. For most parameters, there was little change between 200 and 100 trees ha−1. Applying RHESSys at the stand-scale, these effects on tree physiology translated into 35% reduction in CO2 uptake and a 47% reduction in tree water-use, which was compensated for by increased evaporation from exposed soil. Our long-term measurements at the dry timberline highlight the role of thinning in enhancing the activity and growth of remaining trees, with increased water-use efficiency. Unexpectedly, this density reduction was associated with a relatively small decrease in forest carbon uptake. Light availability was a limiting factor in the higher density plots, even in our light-abundant forest. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon assimilation; Evaporation; Photosynthetically active radiation; Thinning; Transpiration; Water balance","Carbon; Drought; Evaporation; Needles; Reforestation; Carbon assimilation; Forest sustainability; Large-scale thinning; Long-term measurements; Photosynthetically active radiation; Thinning; Water balance; Water use efficiency; Transpiration; afforestation; carbon; carbon flux; drought stress; evaporation; forest ecosystem; forestry production; light availability; limiting factor; long-term change; mortality; photosynthetically active radiation; scale effect; semiarid region; stand dynamics; stand structure; sustainability; thinning; transpiration; vulnerability; water availability; water budget; water flux; Carbon; Drought; Evaporation; Needles; Reforestation; Thinning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072191743

However, changes in global climate and advances in climate science research reveal significant differences between historical meteorological trends and the patterns of current and future climate. The increasing variability and uncertainty associated with climate change will affect buildings in complex ways that depend on the interaction of buildings’ properties, human behavior, and climatic context. Previous studies developed and tested methods to create future climate files by modifying historical data, typically assuming a single model of global climate and a single emission scenario. The present study takes a more comprehensive approach, using an ensemble of fourteen Global Climate Models and two Representative Concentration Pathways to incorporate the uncertainty of future climate projections into building energy simulations. To understand the effects on buildings over their lifespan, a prototypical large office was tested in three different US cities (Boston, Miami and San Francisco) and three future time windows (2030, 2060 and 2090). Driven by increases in cooling energy, annual primary energy consumption increased by 2090 for all projected climate conditions tested, by up to 10% in the edge-case climate of San Francisco where cooling requirements had hitherto been minor. There was significant variability in results and drivers among the different locations and projections, emphasizing the need for specific modeling to support local design practices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy modeling; Future weather files; Morphing; Office buildings","Behavioral research; Climate models; Energy utilization; Office buildings; Building energy performance; Building energy simulations; Cooling requirements; Energy model; Future climate projections; Future weathers; Morphing; Primary energy consumption; Climate change; building; climate effect; climate modeling; energy planning; energy use; ensemble forecasting; future prospect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072270240

This increases the risk of localized corrosion as the critical pitting/crevice potential can be overcome, especially for lower grade stainless steel. In this study, we assessed the influence of dissolved oxygen content (DOC) on the crevice corrosion of duplex and super duplex stainless steels. In addition, we used DNA amplicon sequencing to identify the bacteria most likely associated with the ennoblement. Above approximately 100 parts per billion (ppb) of dissolved oxygen, the ennoblement of OCP was observed leading to an increased risk of localized corrosion. Below approximately 100 ppb of dissolved oxygen, no ennoblement occurred and the risk of localized corrosion was reduced. We identified certain hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria whose presence correlated with the ennoblement of super duplex stainless steel at saturated DOC.

Hence, the logistics organizations' priority is to utilize natural resources towards the highest reduction in CO2 consumption from their logistics activities. It is rarely seen that a logistics organization publishes its strategy. This is true especially when it comes to sustainability elements; because it could be a potential threat to the leakage of the organization's confidential data. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to discuss environmental sustainability strategies for logistics service providers (LSPs) based on the case study of DHL. In particular, this research explores two distinctive aims: 1) Constructing the general framework of environmental sustainability strategy for LSPs with the support from actual data of DHL to eventually applying it to other LSPs, and 2) Discussing the impact of environmental sustainability strategy on both logistics organization's activities and the environment in general. Methodology: The study data collection was entirely conducted by the secondary approach. More specifically data has been collected from actual DHL annual report from 2010 to 2017 which was professionally and independently audited by PWC. A general framework of environmental sustainability strategy is proposed by investigating the case study of DHL in their period 2010-2017 sustainability campaign. Findings: The findings of this research indicate the need for an environmentally sustainable strategy for logistics firms using the data from DHL case study. Prior to this study no framework has been offered or implemented except for internal DHL operation. Hence, it is inevitable to build up a general framework to help other logistics businesses gain awareness of the importance of environmental sustainability. The findings will help their growth and will improve the community as affected by pollution. The strategic framework is tested with the actual DHL data to perceive how practical this strategic framework would perform in reality. Research implications: This study would help logistics firms to have a better understanding of the applicability of the aspects of the framework in their businesses. Logistics organizations may put some of the elements up to the scale to view what is the best for them towards their environmental sustainability goal. As the businesses grow faster and bigger, their new adaptation of environmentally sustainable strategies will benefit from the findings of this decade-long study. © 2019 Allied Business Academies.","DHL; Environmental sustainability strategy; Logistics; Logistics service providers (LSPs)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082668162

Water extraction decreases the level of fresh groundwater, reducing the water pressure and allowing saltwater to flow further inland. Tools for simulating, monitoring and managing saltwater intrusion can provide valuable support in decision-making for management options. In this work, such a tool was developed for the arid coastal aquifer of La Paz in Baja California, Mexico. A geomodel was generated by using a transient electromagnetic method (aquifer geometry, saltwater intrusion). This geomodel, in turn, was used to construct a three-dimensional density-dependent flow model to simulate groundwater flow and saltwater intrusion during the past decades. The results confirmed that a large cone of depression had formed due to excessive pumping in the agricultural area. This successively led to the inversion of the hydraulic gradient and seawater intrusion advancement on the order of 6–8 km inland in the northern-central portion of the aquifer.

It may also occur as pyrogenic lime plaster and laboratory-precipitated crystals. All of these formation processes are conducive to different degrees of local structural order in CaCO3 crystals, with the pyrogenic and precipitated forms being the least ordered. These variations affect the manner in which crystals interact with electromagnetic radiation, and thus formation processes may be tracked using methods such as X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. Here we show that defects in the crystal structure of CaCO3 may be detected by looking at the luminescence of crystals. Using cathodoluminescence by scanning electron microscopy (SEM-CL) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), it is possible to discern different polymorphs and their mechanism of formation. We were thus able to determine that pyrogenic calcite and aragonite exhibit blue luminescence due to the incorporation of distortions in the crystal lattice caused by heat and rapid precipitation, in agreement with infrared spectroscopy assessments of local structural order. These results provide the first detailed reference database of SEM-CL and LIF spectra of CaCO3 standards, and find application in the characterization of optical, archaeological and construction materials. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074684676

Biochar has also attracted attention as a soil amendment capable of improving yield and soil quality and of reducing soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this work, we review the literature on biochar production potential and its effects on climate, food security, ecosystems, and toxicity. We identify three key factors that are largely affecting the environmental performance of biochar application to agricultural soils: (1) production condition during pyrolysis, (2) soil conditions and background climate, and (3) field management of biochar. Biochar production using only forest or crop residues can achieve up to 10% of the required CDR for 1.5 °C pathways and about 25% for 2 °C pathways; the consideration of dedicated crops as biochar feedstocks increases the CDR potential up to 15-35% and 35-50%, respectively. A quantitative review of life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies of biochar systems shows that the total climate change assessment of biochar ranges between a net emission of 0.04 tCO2eq and a net reduction of 1.67 tCO2eq per tonnes feedstock. The wide range of values is due to different assumptions in the LCA studies, such as type of feedstock, biochar stability in soils, soil emissions, substitution effects, and methodological issues. Potential trade-offs between climate mitigation and other environmental impact categories include particulate matter, acidification, and eutrophication and mostly depend on the background energy system considered and on whether residues or dedicated feedstocks are used for biochar production. Overall, our review finds that biochar in soils presents relatively low risks in terms of negative environmental impacts and can improve soil quality and that decisions regarding feedstock mix and pyrolysis conditions can be optimized to maximize climate benefits and to reduce trade-offs under different soil conditions. However, more knowledge on the fate of biochar in freshwater systems and as black carbon emissions is required, as they represent potential negative consequences for climate and toxicity. Biochar systems also interact with the climate through many complex mechanisms (i.e., surface albedo, black carbon emissions from soils, etc.) or with water bodies through leaching of nutrients. These effects are complex and the lack of simplified metrics and approaches prevents their routine inclusion in environmental assessment studies. Specific emission factors produced from more sophisticated climate and ecosystem models are instrumental to increasing the resolution and accuracy of environmental sustainability analysis of biochar systems and can ultimately improve the characterization of the heterogeneities of varying local conditions and combinations of type feedstock, conversion process, soil conditions, and application practice. © 2019 by the authors.","Biochar; Biogeochemical cycles; Biophysical effects; Carbon dioxide removal; Climate mitigation; Environmental assessment; Food security; Life-cycle assessment; Negative emission technology; Pyrolysis",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079775956

In particular, when tropical VWS is under the weakening phase and thus favorable for increased hurricane activity in the Main Development Region (MDR), a protective barrier of high VWS inhibits hurricane intensification along the U.S. East Coast. Here we show that this pattern is driven mostly by natural decadal variability, but that greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing erodes the pattern and degrades the natural barrier along the U.S. coast. Twenty-first century climate model projections show that the increased VWS along the U.S. East Coast during decadal periods of enhanced hurricane activity is substantially reduced by GHG forcing, which allows hurricanes approaching the U.S. coast to intensify more rapidly. The erosion of this natural intensification barrier is especially large following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (rcp8.5) emission scenario. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; climate; greenhouse gas; hurricane; seashore",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066933524

Agulhas leakage constitutes a fraction of warm and saline water transport from the Indian Ocean into the South Atlantic. The leakage is stronger during intensified westerlies. Here, we analyze the wind stress of different observational and modeled atmospheric data sets (covering the last 2 millennia, the recent decades, and the 21st century) with regard to the intensity and position of the southeasterly trades and the westerlies. The analysis reveals that variations of both wind systems go hand in hand and that a poleward shift of the westerlies and trades and an intensification of westerlies took place during the recent decades. Furthermore, upwelling in South Benguela is slightly intensified when trades are shifted poleward. Projections for strength and position of the westerlies in the 21st century depend on assumed CO2 emissions and on their effect relative to the ozone forcing. In the strongest emission scenario (RCP8.5) the simulations show a further southward displacement, whereas in the weakest emission scenario (RCP2.6) a northward shift is modeled, possibly due to the effect of ozone recovery dominating the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse forcing. We conclude that the Agulhas leakage has intensified during the last decades and is projected to increase if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. This will have a small impact on Benguela upwelling strength and may also have consequences for water mass characteristics in the upwelling region. An increased contribution of Agulhas water to the upwelling water masses will import more preformed nutrients and oxygen into the upwelling region. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Commerce; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Ozone; Agulhas current; Anthropogenic greenhouse forcing; Atmospheric data; Emission scenario; Regional oceanographies; Upwelling region; Upwelling waters; Water transport; Saline water; anthropogenic source; atmospheric dynamics; atmospheric modeling; data set; trade wind; westerly; Agulhas Current; Atlantic Ocean; Benguela Current; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076215362

Objectives: This study aims to (1) evaluate PM2.5 pollution-related health impacts on China's road transport sector at both national and provincial levels towards the 2-degree target by 2050; (2) uncover the contribution from the road transport sector compared with that of all sectors; (3) distinguish the contribution from climate change mitigation actions compared with air pollution control oriented actions in road transport sector; and (4) identify the heterogeneous influences at the provincial level. Methods: Health and economic impacts are estimated using an integrated approach that combines the GAINS (Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies) model, the IMED/CGE (Integrated Model of Energy, Environment and Economy for Sustainable Development/computable general equilibrium) model and IMED/HEL (Health) model. Five scenarios are proposed based on climate change mitigation and stringency of air pollution control policy. Results: It is found that China's road transport sector could contribute to around 10.6% of total PM2.5 concentration reduction resulting from all sectors' participation in achieving the 2-degree target, equivalent to 10.8% of the monetized health benefits obtained from achieving the 2-degree target by all sectors. Populous provinces dependent on secondary industries would benefit more under the 2-degree target. Meanwhile, compared with the potential maximum benefits from air pollution control oriented measures in the road transport sector, such climate actions could bring noticeable synergies as well. Approximately climate change mitigation action alone can lead to 70% reduction of health impacts by applying air pollution control measures. Conclusions: This research has implications for other emerging economies and those reluctant to engage in climate action and is deserving of further attention. The government should also realize the heterogeneity of road transport sector development in different provinces, and adopt a more flexible policy approach to take into account regional pollution levels and abatement options. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2-degree target; Air pollution; China; Co-benefits; Governance; Public health",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074170182

Global total CH4 and N2O emissions increased by 15.0% in 2012 compared to 1990, mainly driven by increasing demands of agricultural and energy products. Mainland China, Western Europe, the USA, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa were identified as the largest five CH4 footprint contributors (55.6% of the global total), while Mainland China, the USA, Western Europe, Brazil and Sub-Saharan Africa as the largest N2O footprint contributors (59.2% of the global total). In most developed economies, the CH4 and N2O footprints were much higher than their emissions on the production side, but opposite picture is observed in emerging economies. 36.4% and 24.8% of the global CH4 and N2O emissions in 2012 were associated with international trade, respectively. Substantial energy-related CH4 and agricultural CH4 and N2O emissions were transferred from developed countries to developing countries. Several nations within Kyoto targets have reduced their CH4 and N2O emissions significantly between 1990 and 2012, but the generally-believed success is challenged when viewing from the consumption side. Mainland China, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, Middle East and India witnessed prominent increase of CH4 and N2O footprints in the same period.

Given the large uncertainties surrounding the spatio-temporal pattern of fluid flow and the equilibrium state within subducting slabs, a model of H2O and CO2 transport in slabs should be balanced between model simplicity and capability. We construct such a model in a two-part contribution. In this Part I of our contribution, thermodynamic parameterization is performed for the devolatilization of representative subducting materials—sediments, basalts, gabbros, peridotites. The parameterization avoids reproducing the details of specific devolatilization reactions, but instead captures the overall behaviors of coupled (de)hydration and (de)carbonation. Two general, leading-order features of devolatilization are captured: (1) the released volatiles are H2O-rich near the onset of devolatilization; (2) increase of the ratio of bulk CO2 over H2O inhibits overall devolatilization and thus lessens decarbonation. These two features play an important role in simulation of volatile fractionation and infiltration in thermodynamically open systems. When constructing the reactive fluid flow model of slab H2O and CO2 transport in the companion paper Part II, this parameterization can be incorporated to efficiently account for the open-system effects of H2O and CO2 transport. ©2019.

Our results show that the transverse-electric (TE) polarized light can be obtained even if the emission wavelength becomes even shorter by reducing the quantum well thickness. The ultrathin quantum well enables the enhanced TE-polarized emission that arises from the redistributed subbands for holes. On the contrary to the common belief, we observe a blueshift for the emission wavelength when the AlN composition in the quantum barrier increases. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for DUV LEDs with ultrathin quantum wells is no longer determined by the quantum-confined Stark effect, while quantum barrier with high AlN composition is vitally important to improve the electron injection efficiency and thus enhance the IQE. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Aluminum gallium nitride; Aluminum nitride; Efficiency; III-V semiconductors; Light emitting diodes; Light polarization; Semiconductor quantum wells; Ultraviolet radiation; Deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes; Injection efficiency; Inter-band transition; Internal quantum efficiency; Quantum confined stark effect; Transverse electric polarized lights; Transverse-magnetic polarized lights; Ultra-thin quantum wells; Quantum efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077359791

The awareness of living in a sustainable society is pushing people to target a low-carbon energy structure. Hydrogen, a carbon-free energy source, draws more and more attention. Particularly, biohydrogen from organic waste calls great interest by generating hydrogen and disposing waste simultaneously. Therefore, the three main technologies converting waste to biohydrogen: biological fermentation, thermochemical gasification and microbial electrolysis cell, were reviewed in this study from both technological and environmental perspective. The results showed that a variety of waste streams have been tested to produce hydrogen and different production efficiency were reported. The most favourable waste material for fermentation and microbial electrolysis cell were different types of wastewater, and agricultural lignocellulosic waste was also intensively studied in fermentation. Whereas wooden waste and municipal solid waste were the two wastes investigated the most in gasification. Optimization of the operational parameters was proved to improve the hydrogen production. However, researches focusing on scale-up of these technologies are still needed. On the other hand, life cycle assessment demonstrated that waste gasification had a better environmental profile compared to other technologies. However, the majority of the reviewed life cycle assessment studies failed to further explain the robustness due to the lack of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, indicating high quality life cycle assessment studies are needed in the future. © 2019","Biohydrogen production; Fermentation; Gasification; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Microbial electrolysis cell","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Environmental technology; Fermentation; Fossil fuels; Free energy; Gas emissions; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Lignocellulosic biomass; Microbial fuel cells; Municipal solid waste; Quality control; Regenerative fuel cells; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Bio-hydrogen production; Environmental impact analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lignocellulosic wastes; Operational parameters; Production efficiency; Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis; Technological development; Hydrogen production; emission; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; fermentation; fuel cell; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; technological development; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073006807

Agricultural practices and the use of N-fertilizers have greatly enhanced emissions of N2O. Here, we present estimates of N2O emissions determined from three global atmospheric inversion frameworks during the period 1998–2016. We find that global N2O emissions increased substantially from 2009 and at a faster rate than estimated by the IPCC emission factor approach. The regions of East Asia and South America made the largest contributions to the global increase. From the inversion-based emissions, we estimate a global emission factor of 2.3 ± 0.6%, which is significantly larger than the IPCC Tier-1 default for combined direct and indirect emissions of 1.375%. The larger emission factor and accelerating emission increase found from the inversions suggest that N2O emission may have a nonlinear response at global and regional scales with high levels of N-input. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"agricultural land; atmospheric chemistry; fertilizer application; global perspective; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; ozone; soil emission; Far East; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075335563

The product of hydrogen combustion is water vapour. It does not emit climate-damaging greenhouse gas CO2 and health-damaging pollutants such as CO, HC or NOx. The impact into the environment is negligible. This allows therefore zero impact mobility, as long as hydrogen fuel being produced from renewable energies and water. Hydrogen combustion strategies take the avoidance of NOx formation is a priority parameter to control. The idea of using hydrogen in combustion engines to power vehicles is not new and has been successfully demonstrated in the recent past by companies such as BMW, MAN and Ford. The Start-up company KEYOU is bringing hydrogen engines technology to a new level now by presenting a new combustion concept that is applied 'dd-on' to existing Diesel engines. The result is an attractive clean engine solution to power clean vehicles, especially in the heavy-duty vehicle sector, where current clean solutions (such as battery electric or fuel cell electric) penalize customers with too high cost and low durability. KEYOU has developed an approach to convert conventional Diesel engines into hydrogen engines that meets today's customer requirements with minor necessary adaptations. The technology contains four basic components: 1. Lean-burn combustion with exhaust gas recirculation; 2. Efficient injection strategy; 3. Optimized turbocharging; and 4. H2-SCR catalyst. The result is a highly powerful and efficient engine with ultra-low NOx emissions. The use of EGR in modern Diesel engines is state-of-the-art to reduce NOx emissions while simultaneously improve efficiency. However, the impact of these benefits is considerably augmented in hydrogen combustion. The positive effects of optimizing a cooled high pressure EGR system operation for hydrogen engines are presented in this paper. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Catalysts; Combustion; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gases; High pressure effects; Hydrogen engines; Nitrogen oxides; Powertrains; Combustion engines; Customer requirements; Effective solution; Heavy duty vehicles; Hydrogen combustion; Lean-burn combustion; Renewable energies; Start-up companies; Hydrogen",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084494717

In particular, this led in the late 90's to the introduction of high pressure injection systems inside Diesel engines. This created a tricky situation in which at the same time, the state-of-the-art Diesel engines were requiring more lubricity from the fuel (to make the high pressure pump operate in proper conditions) while the lubricity of the fuels were decreasing due to the removal of sulphur & polar compounds. To cope with this, a method for measuring the lubricity of fuels has been developed (i.e. the HFRR test) and the use of lubricity additives became usual. Lately, as it is the case for Diesel engines, the Gasoline Direct Injection engines are using higher and higher injection pressures. The state of the art GDI engines are currently using injection pressure as high as 500 bar. A lot of work is also currently ongoing on Gasoline Compression Ignition (GCI) engines which use even higher injection pressure (above 1 000 bar). A high injection pressure means that a high pressure pump has to be used and so, proper lubricity has to be brought by the fuel. In this paper, tests on the lubricity of gasoline have been done using a pump bench test and determined how the pumps operate when fueled with various gasoline formulations using either a high amount of aromatics (typical of a refinery with reforming capacities) or a low amount of aromatics (typical of a refinery equipped with alkylation capacities). It also focused on the effect of an acid-type lubricity additive on the pump operations. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Automobile manufacture; Combustion; Diesel engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel additives; Gasoline; Gasoline refining; Powertrains; Pumps; Compression ignition; Emissions regulations; Gasoline direct injection engine(GDI); Gasoline formulation; High injection pressures; High pressure injection system; Injection pressures; Lubricity additives; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084501527

One commercial gas chromatograph coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and one proton transfer mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) were deployed. In addition, sorbent tubes and canisters were implemented within the megacity close to major emission sources. More than 70 species including non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), and organic compounds of intermediate volatility (IVOCs) have been quantified. Among these compounds, 23 anthropogenic and biogenic species were continuously collected at the urban site. VOC concentrations show a great variability with maxima exceeding 10 ppb (i.e., n-butane, toluene, methanol, and acetaldehyde) and mean values between 0.1 (methacrolein C methyl vinyl ketone) and 4.9 ppb (methanol). OVOCs represent 43.9 % of the total VOC concentrations followed by alkanes (26.3 %), aromatic compounds (20.7 %), alkenes (4.8 %), terpenes (3.4 %), and acetonitrile (0.8 %). Five factors have been extracted from the Positive Matrix Factorization model (EPA PMF 5.0) and have been compared to source profiles established by near-field measurements and other external variables (meteorological parameters, NOx, CO, SO2, etc.). Surprisingly, road transport is not the dominant source, only explaining 15.8 % of measured VOC concentrations contrary to the local emission inventory. Other factors are toluene from solvent use (14.2 %), biogenic terpenes (7.8 %), natural gas evaporation (25.9 %) composed of butanes, and a last factor characterized by mixed regional emissions and composed of most of the species (36.3 %). The PMF model results point out the influence of industrial emissions while there is no clear evidence of the impact of ship emissions on the measured VOC distribution. For the latter additional measurements of organic compounds of lower volatility like IVOC would be helpful. The sensitivity of PMF results to input data (time resolution, meteorological period, peak episode, interpolation method) was tested. While some PMF runs do not perform as well statistically as the reference run, sensitivity tests show that the same factors (number and type) are found with slightly different factor contributions (up to 16 % of change). Finally, the emission ratios (ERs) of VOCs relative to carbon monoxide (CO) were established. These ratios are usually higher than the ones of other cities worldwide but in the same range of magnitude. These ERs and the road transport factor from PMF were used to estimate VOC emissions and to evaluate three downscaled global emissions inventories (EDGAR, ACCMIP, and MACCity). It was found that the total annual VOC anthropogenic emissions by global inventories were either within the same range by a factor of 2 to 3 for alkanes and aromatics or underestimated by an order of magnitude, especially for oxygenated VOCs. © 2019 Author(s).",,"chemical composition; concentration (composition); emission inventory; gas chromatography; human activity; mass spectrometry; megacity; nonmethane hydrocarbon; organic pollutant; pollutant source; port operation; volatile organic compound; Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076695110

The active enzyme harbors the nickel(I) hydrocorphin coenzyme F-430 as a prosthetic group and catalyzes the reversible reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (CH3-S-CoM) with coenzyme B (HS-CoM) to methane and CoM-S-S-CoB. MCR is also involved in anaerobic methane oxidation in reverse of methanogenesis and most probably in the anaerobic oxidation of ethane, propane, and butane. The challenging question is how the unreactive CH3-S thioether bond in methyl-coenzyme M and the even more unreactive C-H bond in methane and the other hydrocarbons are anaerobically cleaved. A key to the answer is the negative redox potential (Eo) of the Ni(II)F-430/Ni(I)F-430 couple below-600 mV and the radical nature of Ni(I)F-430. However, the negative one-electron redox potential is also the Achilles heel of MCR; it makes the nickel enzyme one of the most O2-sensitive enzymes known to date. Even under physiological conditions, the Ni(I) in MCR is oxidized to the Ni(II) or Ni(III) states, e.g., when in the cells the redox potential (E) of the CoM-S-S-CoB/HS-CoM and HS-CoB couple (Eo =-140 mV) gets too high. Methanogens therefore harbor an enzyme system for the reactivation of inactivated MCR in an ATP-dependent reduction reaction. Purification of active MCR in the Ni(I) oxidation state is very challenging and has been achieved in only a few laboratories.

Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) has been acknowledged as one of the most effective systems for Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) due to its simplicity, reliability and improved overall efficiency. The expander and working fluid used in ORC WHR greatly impact the overall performance of an integrated engine and WHR system. This paper presents the effects of volumetric expanders on the ORC WHR system of a long haulage HD truck engine at a steady-state engine operating point chosen from a real-time road data. Performance of a long haulage HD truck engine is analyzed, based on the choice of three volumetric expanders for its WHR system, using their actual performance values. The expanders are: An oil-free open-drive scroll, a hermetic scroll and an axial piston expander with working fluids R123, R245fa and ethanol, respectively. Performance of the engine that accommodates the WHR system, with each expander and working fluid combination, is assessed based on the overall system efficiency that can be achieved through heat recovery from the engine exhaust. This simulation study is carried out using validated 0D models of the scroll expanders and performance data of the piston expander, adopted from literature, and a 1D system model of a long haulage HD truck engine encompassing a WHR system. Under the given conditions, the open-drive scroll expander (R123) leads to a higher system efficiency of 6.3% at an optimum expander speed of 3400 rpm with an estimated fuel saving of 3.6% in the vehicle under study. The hermetic scroll expander (R245fa) exhibits potential performance at higher rotational speeds; it leads to 5.4% system efficiency at 5000 rpm and 3% fuel-saving. The axial piston expander (ethanol) results in a consistent performance over a wide range of expander speeds. The effect of sizing a volumetric expander in improving the overall system efficiency is also investigated. This study provides insights on the suitability of volumetric expanders in HD truck WHR. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Digital storage; Efficiency; Ethanol; Fuel economy; Fuels; Pistons; Powertrains; Rankine cycle; Scroll compressors; Solid wastes; Trucks; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Working fluids; Consistent performance; Heavy duty trucks; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Overall efficiency; Performance analysis; Performance value; Simulation studies; System efficiency; Exhaust systems (engine)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084495787

The aim of this study was to evaluate climate variability and characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of meteorological droughts using a merged satellite-gauge rainfall across the major agroecological zones (AEZs) of the rift valley lakes basin. To this end, coefficient of variation (CV) and standardized rainfall anomaly (SRA) were used to evaluate rainfall variability; Mann-Kendell test was used to examine trends of temperature and rainfall; and a grid-rainfall based standardized precipitation index (SPI) was used to assess the spatiotemporal distribution and severity of meteorological droughts. The SPI was computed for 37 years over 1981–2017 at 3-month and 4-month timescales for the bimodal rainy seasons. Finally, a higher inter-annual and spatial variability of rainfall and frequent meteorological droughts were found across the basin. Compared to the nationally documented historical drought years in the country, more frequent drought events were found in this basin, signifying its higher vulnerability to climate variability. As a result, between 1981 and 2017, the basin has partially experienced at least a moderate drought intensity on average every 1.68 and 1.76 years during the ‘Belg’ and ‘Kiremt’ season, respectively. Drought frequency was higher at the ‘Kolla’ AEZ, characterized by the highest CV of rainfall. Furthermore, these frequent droughts were accompanied by significant rising trends in monthly temperature. Such a warming trend, in this inherently warm area, coupled with expected global climate change scenarios could further aggravate drought conditions in the future. Moreover, the spatiotemporal distribution of drought events was found to be variable between and within AEZs in the basin so that more localized drought adaptation strategies could help to alleviate potential impacts. Thus, the drought history of each agroecological zone and the spatiotemporal distributions of recent droughts, this study has delivered, could enhance the awareness of concerned decision makers in tracing frequently affected locations, which could in turn enable them to design and implement improved water management techniques as a means of drought mitigation strategy. © 2019","Climate variability; Drought; Mann-Kendall test; Merged satellite-gauge rainfall; Rift valley lakes basin; SPI","air temperature; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; drought; global climate; rainfed agriculture; raingauge; rift zone; spatiotemporal analysis; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075377121

For calculations, an existing heating network located in central Poland was adopted, where heat is transported for heating purposes of buildings and domestic hot water with circulation of domestic hot water through four separate pre-insulated underground pipes. The idea of the construction of four pre-insulated pipes presented in the paper consists in the location of four steel pipes in a common round thermal insulation, which perform the role of heat transport for heating purposes in multi-family buildings (supply and return) and two pipes transporting hot water (a pipe with domestic hot water with circulation). In Poland, heating pipes used in multi-family housing have a larger diameter compared to domestic hot water pipes, which is why standard twin pipe heating pipes have been used in the construction of four pre-insulated networks, in which the domestic hot water pipe has been added to the thermal insulation and circulation of domestic hot water. In order to determine heat losses, a simplified two-dimensional model of conductive heat transfer was developed using Fortran to create a computer program. The results of numerical simulations show that the use of twin pipes for the construction of pre-insulated quadruple networks has contributed to a significant reduction in heat loss in relation to the existing single pre-insulated network (up to 57.1%), while reducing the thermal insulation field of the cross-section of the pre-insulated pipe by 21.4%. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy savings; Network; Pollutants emission; Pre-insulated district heating; Quadruple pipes; Single pipes; Twin pipes","Air pollution; Energy conservation; Heat losses; Heating; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Networks (circuits); Water; Water pipelines; Water piping systems; Conductive heat transfer; Domestic hot water; Insulated pipes; Multi-family housings; Pollutants emissions; Twin pipes; Two dimensional model; Underground pipes; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076974543

It is needed to adopt optimal powertrain considering CO2 reduction and convenience for the users. Diesel engines are beneficial from the points of view of thermal efficiency and reliability, but further emission reduction is needed. To reduce soot formation and late combustion, lowering equivalence ratio at the lift-off position, or fuel-rich spray core is thought to be effective. One approach to realize this is by enhancing air introduction from entrainment section (""(1)Increasing entrainment amount""), diluting the entire spray core. In addition to the conventional approach, this study discusses an alternative approach in which entrained air is selectively supplied to over-rich region to homogenize equivalence ratio at lift-off point, (""(2)Homogenization""). The investigations were performed by varying not only injection method like injection pressure or nozzle hole specification, but also fuel properties. Oxygenated fuel investigation revealed that homogenizing equivalence ratio of spray core leads to fast combustion. Furthermore, lowering surface tension investigation revealed that it can shorten break-up length and promote air introduction from entrainment section without higher injection pressure, and it leads to reduce equivalence ratio of spray core. In addition, it was found that Jet number which is a dimensionless number for break-up can organize the smoke emission for different fuel or injection pressure. Ducted Fuel Injection (DFI) was investigated by both measurement and calculation, and it was found that the duct makes equivalence ratio distribution inside the spray to be more homogeneous, or promotes entrainment of air into spray core. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Air entrainment; Combustion; Diesel engines; Emission control; Equivalence classes; Powertrains; Smoke; Soot; Automotive powertrains; Conventional approach; Dimensionless number; Emission reduction; Equivalence ratios; Fuel spray formation; Injection pressures; Thermal efficiency; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084510559

In the hot summer and cold winter areas, DES is an efficient alternative for district cooling and heating. A case study located in Changsha, China, which is a typical hot summer and cold winter area, is analyzed. Four control strategies are proposed in this study. The four cases under different control strategies are compared in terms of energy, economy, environment, solar fraction, and soil annual heat imbalance rate. Results show that the DES can be an energy saving and environmentally friendly alternative. The primary energy saving (PES) is more than 36.70% and can reach up to 48.04%, whereas DES can realize economical operation and reduce the emission of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and dust. In addition, DES consumes more electricity and less natural gas than the conventional energy system. These features are beneficial to the optimization of China’s energy consumption structure. Moreover, the operation of seasonal thermal storage for the ground soil is effective in maintaining the balance of soil annual heat. The control strategy combining geothermal and solar energies is recommended due to its good performance and high flexibility.

Each country is expected to ensure international cooperation toward minimizing risk. To evaluate the countermeasures, many researchers have developed integrated assessment models (IAMs). Then, how can each country achieve its emission quota? This study proposes models that analyze the economic impact of global warming in a region based on the results obtained by the global model. By using these suggested models, we perform a comparative analysis on three policy cases: a different regulations case, a unified regulation case, and an output redistribution case. Results: We analyzed Japan as one of the case studies and found that more developed areas should implement stricter regulations in all scenarios. In addition, the case of applying different regulations by area (in a region) is not always preferable to using unified regulations in the region. Alternatively, the output gap between the output redistribution case and the different regulations case is much higher than the gap between the unified regulation case and the different regulations case. In all scenarios, the present values of the output of the output redistribution case are also higher than the other cases. Conclusions: The different regulations case and the unified regulation case are based on the model without capital transfer between areas, whereas the output redistribution case is based on the model with free capital transfer between areas. Although both models are extreme situations, the regions close to the without capital transfer situation possibly have an incentive to use the different regulations policy, depending on the emission target. The regions close to the situation with free capital transfer would probably prefer unified regulation. © 2019 The Author(s).","$\text {CO}_2$ CO 2 emission reduction; 2.5° limit; Climate policy; The RICE model","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic impact; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental modeling; environmental policy; global warming; integrated approach; international cooperation; standard (regulation); Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077435059

We analyzed the current distributions of the eleven major tree species using an ensemble approach involving five different species distribution models (generalized linear model, generalized additive model, generalized boosting model, classification tree analysis, and random forests) and generated the ensemble maps of the current and future distribution of each species. For the future, we used five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Finally, we mapped beta-diversity and changes in alpha-diversity of the tree species under climate change. Our analyses showed that generally, the climatically suitable habitats for most of the species tend to shift and shrink in the future. A shift in major trees boundaries will be expected both along an east-west gradient and along an altitudinal gradient under climate change scenarios. The results demonstrated that climate change is likely to exert a strong influence on beta-diversity and richness of the major tree species in northern forests of Iran. In total, beta-diversity of tree species will be higher in the central and eastern parts compared with the western areas under the climate change scenarios and the mid-elevations of the western Hyrcanian forests will likely experience the lowest beta-diversity through time, meaning that the impacts of climate change on these regions are minimal. The impacts of climate change on the distribution of major tree species in the Hyrcanian forests can be considered very severe and pose a high risk of loss in forest functions and services. Forest managers will encounter several uncertainties in the wood productions, plantation, restoration, and conservation plans due to climate change in the Hyrcanian forests. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beta-diversity; Ensemble models; Hyrcanian forests; Species distribution models; True turnover; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076116854

BC has a strong positive radiative forcing in the atmosphere, as indicated in many previous studies. Here, we show that the decline in surface air temperatures with reduced BC emissions is weaker than would be expected from the magnitude of its instantaneous radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Climate simulations show that the global mean change in surface air temperature per unit of instantaneous radiative forcing of BC at the TOA is about one-eighth that of sulphate aerosols, which cool the climate through scattering solar radiation, without absorption. This is attributed to the positive radiation budget of BC being largely compensated for by rapid atmospheric adjustment, whereas the radiative imbalance due to sulphate aerosols drives a slow response of climate over a long timescale. Regional climate responses to short-lived species are shown to exhibit even more complex characteristics due to their heterogeneous spatial distributions, requiring further analysis in future studies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062947057

Two scenarios were compared that diverged after reaching the 2 °C level: One stayed at the 2 °C level, and the other cooled to the 1.5 °C level. Unlike the internationally coordinated model intercomparison projects, the scenarios were developed for a specific climatic model with emissions and land use scenarios consistent with socioeconomic projections from an integrated assessment model. The ESM output resulted in delayed realization of the 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets expected for 2100. The cumulative CO2 emissions for 2010-2100 (2300) were 358 (-53) GtCO2 in the 2 °C scenario and-337 (-936) GtCO2 in the 1.5 °C scenario. We examined the effect of overshooting on commonly used indicators related to surface air temperature, sea surface temperature and total ocean heat uptake. Global vegetation productivity at 2100 showed around a 5% increase in the 2 °C scenario without overshooting compared with the 1.5 °C scenario with overshooting, considered to be caused by more precipitation and stronger CO2 fertilization. A considerable difference was found between the two scenarios in terms of Arctic sea ice, whereas both scenarios indicated few corals would survive past the 21st century. The difference in steric sea level rise, reflecting total cumulative ocean heat uptake, between the two scenarios was &lt;2 cm in 2100, and around 9 cm in 2300 in the Pacific Island region. A large overshoot may reduce the eventual difference between targets (i.e. 1.5 °C in contrast to 2 °C), particularly in terms of the indicators related to total ocean heat uptake, and to sensitive biological thresholds. © 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, research conducted on this continent is important due to the possibility of investigating the type of pollution and their way of transport. This work considers presence of organic contaminants in Maritime Antarctica in unexplored until now, Lions Rump headland. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples were carried out in order to determine the content of analytes such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Among all determined PAHs in water samples the highest concentrations was observed for naphthalene and anthracene, which is the result of their higher volatility in comparison to the High Molecular Weight PAHs. The presence of PAHs in the water environment may constitute potential negative effect on Antarctic ecosystem and it should be investigated in detail. Moreover, possibility of undertaking various actions reducing contaminants emission are also very important. We hope that improved fossil fuel economy, and not only on the local scale, would help reduce PAH levels in Maritime Antarctica. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076731916

The Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica comprises roughly 10% of the global ocean and plays a crucial role in regulating global climate and marine ecosystems. Although the Antarctic marine environment currently remains one of the most intact on Earth, it is threatened by fishery expansion and a rapidly changing climate. In response, CCAMLR has been developing a representative network of MPAs to sustain ecosystem structure and function, protect areas vulnerable to human activities, and conserve biodiversity. Whereas significant research has focused on the role of formal mechanisms and state power in international environmental regimes, very little is known about the role of non-state actors and informal approaches, particularly in the negotiation of agreements to establish large-scale networks of MPAs. Case analysis of the 2016 Ross Sea Region MPA agreement reveals that CCAMLR is undergoing a significant period of learning and institutional evolution, as actors seek novel ways to negotiate a network of Southern Ocean MPAs. Key drivers of consensus include external political dynamics, internal leadership and group dynamics, and shared concern for the future of CCAMLR and Antarctic MPAs. Actors also rely on informal principles of negotiation (such as increasing transparency, developing trust, and engaging in dialogue) to fill institutional gaps in both CCAMLR's formal structure and the current process for developing and negotiating MPAs. As environmental threats grow in complexity and scale, non-state actors and informal negotiations will become increasingly critical to support the ongoing success of formal international institutions dedicated to protecting the ecological integrity and function of the global environment. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Antarctica; CCAMLR; collaborative governance; high seas; international environmental politics; international institutions; marine conservation; marine protected areas","biodiversity; complexity; decision making; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; environmental factor; environmental issue; human activity; institutional framework; international agreement; marine park; negotiation process; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071927335

The review of the publications confirmed the necessity to conduct research to determine the coefficients of the impact of green roofs on the environment in the city centers of Central and Eastern Europe. The results presented by different authors (most often based on a single case study) differ significantly from each other, which does not allow us to choose universal coefficients for all the parameters of the green roof's impact on the environment.

More than half of this reduction was originated from the forestry/peatlands sector. Avoiding peat fires is therefore crucial for Indonesia to meet its targets. However, the efforts have been hampered by the fact that a large area of peatland has been burnt. The estimated extent of peatland and mangrove burnt was 2,124,000 Ha during the forest fire in Indonesia in 1997/1998. In 1997-1998, high carbon emissions made Indonesia as one of the largest global polluters. The peat fire occurrence in Indonesia has caused severe problems from environmental, economic, health also mortality. Indonesia has the largest peatland area in the region, which is 20.6 million ha or 10.8% of the land area. These lands are spread across various islands, 7.2 million ha (35%) in the Sumatera island, 6.6 million ha (32%) in Kalimantan island, 0.6 million ha (3%) in Sulawesi island and around 6.2 million ha (30%) in Papua island. Peatland in the Sumatera island has suffered severe damage due to land clearing and burning. The objective of this research is to determine the characteristics of peatland in various land conditions, namely primary forest, ex-peatland fire, and community mix plantation as well as to learn the dynamics of peat groundwater level in each study location. Rainfall and groundwater level sensors installed in the primary forest, ex-peatland fire, and community mix plantation. Rainfall-groundwater level analysis conducted to understand the hydrological response in various peatland characteristics. The results showed that in the ex-peatland fire and mix plantation have changed the peat soil characteristics with an increase of soil bulk density. This indicates decreasing the infiltration capacity, soil porosity and increase the surface water in the peatland area. Increasing the groundwater level response to rainfall is stable in the natural peatland forest. This indicates the function of forest cover as rainfall interception and reduces the volume and lag time of rainwater before reaching the forest floor. Community plantation with low canopy diversity has lower forest cover function than in the natural peatland forest. This will increase the volume of rainwater in the peat soil and increase the rainfall-groundwater level response much higher than in the natural forest. Maintain the diversity of canopy cover and reduce the open peatland by fire will control the hydrological response in groundwater level dynamics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Fires; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Peat; Porosity; Rain; Soils; Surface waters; Sustainable development; Tropical engineering; Fire occurrences; Hydrological response; Infiltration capacity; Land condition; Natural forests; Primary forest; Rainfall interception; Soil bulk density; Wetlands",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077342912

Current systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) mostly focused on some specific health outcomes or some specific air pollution. Design This evidence gap map (EGM) is to identify existing gaps from SRs and MAs and report them in broad topic areas. Data sources PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from their inception until June 2018. Citations and reference lists were traced. Eligibility criteria SRs and MAs that investigated the impact of outdoor air pollution on human health outcomes were collected. This study excluded original articles and qualitative review articles. Data extraction and synthesis Characteristics of the included SRs and MAs were extracted and summarised. Extracted data included authors, publication year, location of the corresponding author(s), publication journal discipline, study design, study duration, sample size, study region, target population, types of air pollution and health outcomes. Results Asia and North America published 93% of SRs and MAs included in this EGM. 31% of the SRs and MAs (27/86) included primary studies conducted in 5-10 countries. Their publication trends have increased during the last 10 years. A total of 2864 primary studies was included. The median number of included primary studies was 20 (range, 7-167). Cohort studies, case cross-over studies and time-series studies were the top three most used study designs. The mostly researched population was the group of all ages (46/86, 53%). Cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and health service records were mostly reported. A lack of definite diagnostic criteria, unclear reporting of air pollution exposure and time period of primary studies were the main research gaps. Conclusions This EGM provided a visual overview of health outcomes affected by outdoor air pollution exposure.

Care is needed in the experimental setup in order to achieve the desired constraint on the simulated atmospheric processes without introducing undue intervention. In this study, sensitivity experiments are conducted with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model Version 1 (EAMv1) to identify setups that can give results representative of the model's long-term climate and meanwhile reasonably capture characteristics of the observed meteorological conditions to facilitate the comparison of model results with measurements. We show that when the prescribed meteorological conditions are temporally interpolated to the model time to constrain EAM's horizontal winds at each time step, a nudged simulation can reproduce the characteristic evolution of the observed weather events (especially in middle and high latitudes) as well as the model's long-term climatology, although nudging also leads to nonnegligible regional changes in wind-driven aerosol emissions, low-level clouds in the stratocumulus regime, and cloud and precipitation near the maritime continent. Compared to its predecessor model used in an earlier study, EAMv1 is less sensitive to temperature nudging, although significant impacts on the cloud radiative effects still exist. EAMv1 remains very sensitive to humidity nudging.

In this study, VOC samples were collected in-situ from chimneys in 10 typical heating scenarios in rural areas of the Guanzhong Plain. A modified SUMA canister approach was then employed, followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Emission factors (EFs) (as received basis) of targeted non-methane VOCs (NMVOCs) varied from 90.3 ± 29.3 to 12300 ± 1510 mg kg−1 in descending order of fuel wood &gt; maize straw &gt; bitumite ≫ anthracite (p &lt; 0.05). Both clean stove and coal briquetting technologies effectively reduced VOC EFs compared with traditional heating methods. The EFs of methane (CH4) had similar characteristics to those of NMVOCs. However, they yielded different correlations with CO because of their differing mechanisms of formation. Coefficient of divergence (CD) values showed that a semi-gasifier has a limited effect on changing VOC profiles compared with a traditional stove using the same fuels. However, different types of fuel produce CD values over 0.50, which should therefore be classified as different sub-categories in source apportionment models. Correlation analysis showed that volatile matter content (V%) and modified combustion efficiency (MCE) were the two primary factors influencing NMVOC and CH4 emissions. A stepwise linear regression analysis showed that V%, MCE, and element nitrogen content (N%) can be used to predict total VOC (TVOCs, including CH4 and NMVOCs) emissions with regression coefficients of 0.23, −72.8 and −6.53, respectively (R2 = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001). Ozone formation potential (OFP) EFs from burning solid fuel ranged from 72 to 18680 mg kg−1, with an approximate 50% contribution from alkenes. VOCs from burning solid fuel were equivalent to 62 to 22200 mg kg−1 secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP), most of which (&gt;95%) were contributed by aromatics. A semi-gasifier and coal briquettes were effective in reducing TVOC emissions, even when used in conjunction with a traditional stove and fuels. It is estimated that over 15,000 ton year−1 emissions can be reduced in Guanzhong Plain by adopting a semi-gasifier and coal briquettes, resulting in a 57,000 and 65,000 ton year−1 reduction of OFP and SOAP emissions, respectively. These results demonstrate that the use of clean heating technologies in Guanzhong Plain has considerable potential in relation to emissions reduction and thus provides a feasible solution to mitigate VOCs and related secondary pollutants emitted by residential solid fuel burning. © 2019 The Authors","Clean heating technology; Ozone formation potential; Secondary organic aerosol formation potential; Solid fuel; VOCs","Aerosols; Air quality; Briquets; Briquetting; Coal; Coal combustion; Domestic appliances; Emission control; Gas chromatography; Heating; Housing; Methane; Ozone; Regression analysis; Volatile organic compounds; Combustion efficiencies; Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry; Heating technology; Mechanisms of formation; Ozone formation potentials; Secondary organic aerosols; Solid fuels; Stepwise linear regression; Fuels; alkene; methane; nitrogen; ozone; volatile organic compound; coal; domestic chemical; ozone; volatile organic compound; aerosol formation; air quality; cooking appliance; emission; fuel; heating; ozone; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air and air related phenomena; air quality; Article; chemical analysis; China; combustion; correlational study; heating; mass fragmentography; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); rural area; wood; air pollutant; biomass; chemistry; devices; environmental monitoring; human; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi; Zea mays; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Biomass; China; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Household Products; Humans; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074203759

Different lipopeptides have their own unique chemical structures, properties and biological activities. Quantitative analysis of the lipopeptides iturin and surfactin and their homologues produced by Bacillus natto NT–6 subjected to different culture media, shaking speed of rotary shaker, and liquid and solid fermentation methods was conducted using LC–MS. For iturins, liquid-state fermentation in Landy medium at a shaking speed of 160 r min−1 was the most suitable for maximal homologue production. Addition of 0.4% attapulgite powder increased production by 1.92-fold; activated carbon significantly reduced production. For surfactin homologues, solid-state fermentation in potato dextrose broth medium at shaking speed &gt; 160 r min−1 was the best. Addition of 0.4% attapulgite powder increased production by 1.96-fold; activated carbon had no effect.

Wall wetting is predominant effect occurs in idle and part load conditions due to impingement or condensing of un-vaporized fuel droplets around the intake wall, combustion chamber liners and top of the piston. These deposits can cause incomplete combustion which will impact on increase in total hydrocarbon emissions. In this study, wall wetting parameters like fuel density, intake duct geometry, wall film thickness, wall film height, mixture preparation, fuel vaporization has been investigated theoretically by considering droplet evaporation and temperature model for cylinder wall film through mathematical equations. The main objective is to control equivalence ratio and to maintain surface temperature is the most effective way to reduce unburnt hydrocarbon emissions due to cold start wall wetting during steady state and transient conditions. This methodology was carried out on four stroke single cylinder Spark Ignition engine, where additives were used with gasoline fuel of different proportions which could intern reduce the intake and combustion chamber deposits during steady state and transient conditions. This experimental analysis was analyzed at different speed and load conditions. Based on these experimental results, Hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by nearly 40% in steady state and 30% in transient state. It is observed that, bi-fuel injection strategy can be implemented for injecting an ample amount of additive in to cylinder before compression stroke at 110 deg of crack angle during cold start, which it enhances the performance and emission characteristics furthermore. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Combustion chambers; Deposits; Drops; Film preparation; Hydrocarbons; Ignition; Internal combustion engines; Wetting; Combustion chamber deposits; Combustion chamber liners; Experimental analysis; Experimental investigations; Mathematical equations; Performance and emissions; Single-cylinder spark-ignition; Steady state and transients; Fuel additives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077906264

In addition to the previously identified seven sources, we propose three new ones. As an empirical application, this study applies the proposed approach to examine ten sources of CO2 emission across Chinese provinces from 2008 to 2015. In the empirical study, we overcome methodological difficulties related to (a) what methodological merits of technology change indexes are and how to measure them in a separated manner and (b) how to separate effects of various sources and how to identify the annual shift of those sources of CO2 emission changes. This study finds three empirical implications. First, three sources may increase the amount of CO2 emission. They include an economic activity, a technology change on a desirable output and a potential energy intensity change. Second, two sources are important in reducing the amount of CO2 emission. They are an operational efficiency change on a desirable output and a change in energy saving technology. Finally, conflicting results exist in some sources in the manner that they increase CO2 emission in some provinces but decrease it in the other provinces. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emission; Data envelopment analysis; Index decomposition analysis; Production-theoretical decomposition analysis; Provincial imbalance","Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Energy conservation; Global warming; Potential energy; Carbon dioxide emissions; Decomposition analysis; Decomposition approach; Economic activities; Energy-saving technologies; Index decomposition analysis; Operational efficiencies; Provincial imbalance; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068448974

Highly crystalline [Ni0.67Co0.33(OH)2]Cl0.29·0.53H2O (Ni-Co LDH) particles with an exceptionally high anion-exchange capacity of 58.8 mg g-1 and a distribution coefficient (Kd) of 2396 mL g-1 for NO3 - ions were successfully prepared by the flux method and a topochemical strategy. Layered Na0.97Ni0.67Co0.33O2 (NNCO) was prepared using a high-temperature flux and used as a starting material for topotactic transformation consisting of oxidative hydrolysis with KOH and NaClO and subsequent reduction with H2O2 and NaCl. During the transformation from NNCO to Ni-Co LDH, a drastic change in the valences of the Ni and Co belonging to the host layer and in the cationic and anionic species occurs in interlayer space; the valences of the Ni and Co in NNCO were increased from Ni2+,3+ and Co2+,3+ to Ni3+ and Co2+,3+,4+ by an oxidative hydrolysis reaction with simultaneous intercalation of K+ ions and deintercalation of Na+ ions, and subsequently decreased from Ni3+ and Co2+,3+,4+ to Ni2+ and Co2+,3+ by a reduction reaction with simultaneous intercalation of anionic species such as CO3 2- and Cl- ions and deintercalation of Na+ and K+ ions. Through synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction analysis and Rietveld refinement, the resultant Ni-Co LDH was clearly shown to exhibit high crystallinity with less compositional deviation even after topochemical transformation in comparison with the one prepared by traditional coprecipitation and solid-state methods. Furthermore, the adsorption isotherm for NO3 - ions elucidated that homogeneous adsorption sites are consistently constructed in the crystal structure, which could be found from the fitting to a Langmuir curve, with the R2 value being 0.98. This work opens up a new route for the fabrication of excellent not only ion-exchangeable but also ion-conductive inorganic materials for direct utilization in environmental and energy-storage processes.

To this end, we report here a new catalyst that is based on imidazolinium functionality and is synthesized from an unprecedented, one-pot reaction of the widely available monomers terephthalaldehyde and ammonium chloride. We show that this covalent organic polymer (COP)-222 exhibits quantitative conversion and selectivity for a range of substrates under ambient conditions and without the need for co-catalysts, metals, solvent, or pressure. COP-222 is recyclable and has been demonstrated to retain complete retention of activity for over 15 cycles. Moreover, it is scalable to at least a kilogram scale. We determined the reaction mechanism by using quantum mechanics (density functional theory), showing that it involves nucleophilic-attack-driven epoxide ring opening (ND-ERO). This contrasts with the commonly assumed mechanism involving the concerted addition of chemisorbed CO2. To stop global warming, we must introduce a variety of CO2 reuse pathways. Redox chemistry is not trivial; reduction of CO2 back to methane requires up to 8 electrons per molecule, leading to heavy energy demand. Non-redox paths have low energy needs and could provide a quick relief. A promising non-redox CO2 product, cyclic carbonate is a versatile building block for green plastics and solvents. Although studies date back as early as 1969, no industrially viable process has since been introduced, mainly because of the lack of an effective catalyst for direct addition of CO2 to the epoxides. Conceptually, the ideal catalyst should (1) be free of metals; (2) be free of co-catalysts; (3) be free of high pressure requirements; (4) provide quantitative selectivity to cyclic carbonate (5) provide a wide substrate scope, including very hard substrates; (6) provide reusability; and (7) be inexpensive. The imidazolinium catalyst that we developed herein addresses all 7 qualities and offers rapid implementation for CO2 reclamation. Yavuz and colleagues introduced a highly active catalyst for non-redox fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates, a versatile product family with potential use in green polymers and solvents. The metal-free, heterogeneous imidazolinium network structure is easily made, scaled up, recycled, and inexpensive and provides quantitative selectivity and conversion yields over a wide substrate scope of epoxides. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 utilization; cyclic carbonate; density functional theory; heterogeneous catalysis; imidazolinium chloride; non-redox carbon fixation; porous polymer; SDG11: Sustainable cities and communities; SDG13: Climate action; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076004362

The quality of the producer gas used can, however, significantly impact the SOFC durability and reliability. The great challenge is to ensure undisturbed operation of such system and to find a trade-off between optimal SOFC operating temperature and system thermal integration, which may limit the overall efficiency. Thus, this study focuses on experimental investigation of commercial SOFC single cells of industrial size fueled with different representative producer gas compositions of industrial relevance at two relevant operating temperatures. The extensive experimental and numerical analyses performed showed that feeding SOFC with a producer gas from a downdraft gasifier, with hot gas cleaning, at an operating temperature of 750 °C represents the most favorable setting, considering system integration and the highest fuel utilization. Additionally, a 120 h long-term test was carried out, showing that a long-term operation is possible under stated operating conditions. Local degradation took place, which can be detected at an early stage using appropriate online-monitoring tools. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass gasification; Electrochemical analysis; Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC); System integration","Biomass; Economic and social effects; Gas fuel analysis; Gas fuel purification; Gasification; Nuclear fuels; Temperature; Biomass Gasification; Degradation behaviours; Electrochemical analysis; Experimental and numerical analysis; Experimental investigations; Operating temperature; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs); System integration; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); biomass; chemical reaction; detection method; electrochemical method; electrochemistry; experimental study; fuel cell; high temperature; operations technology; performance assessment; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072576494

Dietary data from a 64-item food frequency questionnaire collected during 1996-2016 were used. Energy-adjusted greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) for all participants, expressed as kg carbon dioxide equivalents/day and 4184 kJ (1000 kcal), were estimated using data from life cycle analyses. Differences in background and sociodemographic characteristics were examined between participants with low and high GHGE from diet, respectively. The variables evaluated were age, BMI, physical activity, marital status, level of education, smoking, and residence.Setting: Västerbotten county in northern Sweden.Participants: In total, 46 893 women and 45 766 men aged 29-65 years.Results: Differences in GHGE from diet were found across the majority of examined variables. The strongest associations were found between GHGE from diet and age, BMI, education, and residence (all P < 0·001), with the highest GHGE from diet found among women and men who were younger, had a higher BMI, higher educational level, and lived in urban areas.Conclusions: This study is one of the first to examine climate impact from diet across background and sociodemographic characteristics. The results show that climate impact from diet is associated with age, BMI, residence and educational level amongst men and women in Västerbotten, Sweden. These results define potential target populations where public health interventions addressing a move towards more climate-friendly food choices and reduced climate impact from diet could be most effective. © The Authors 2019.","Carbon dioxide equivalents; Climate impact; Diet; Food; Sociodemographic factors","adult; aged; body mass; caloric intake; climate; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; diet; exercise; female; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; human; male; middle aged; nutrition; socioeconomics; Sweden; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Climate; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Energy Intake; Exercise; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Socioeconomic Factors; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072911901

However, researchers and managers are concerned because climate warming has led to increased fire activity in recent decades. More area burned will result in larger land areas in early successional stages and will potentially limit tree establishment; therefore, evaluating long-term forest understory response to fire is important. We evaluate the impact of burn severity, overstory canopy cover, topography, and climate on understory plant community diversity and composition in seven wildfires, 9 to 12 years post fire, along a broad climate gradient from dry to moist mixed conifer forests in Idaho, Montana, and Washington, USA. Results: Climate was the most important driver for species diversity and composition, but a burn severity gradient was detectable in the species data one decade post fire. A strong overlap in species composition between burn severity levels was documented, but dispersion was lower for high burn severity sites, indicating that those sites are still recovering. Local species richness and diversity had a nonlinear relationship with the burn severity index dNBR, with a maximum at low to moderate burn severity; the relationship was stronger in moist climates. Functional trait analysis revealed higher grass and forb cover in high-severity burns, higher cover of tree seedlings, residual and off-site colonizers in burned areas, and more shade-tolerant species in unburned areas. Of the 270 species recorded, 10% were introduced; however, only three were of noxious status and two were invasive annual grasses, generally occurring on dry sites. Conclusions: The understory plant community was not fundamentally altered by these fires and fire contributed to increased species diversity both locally and regionally, suggesting that low to moderate burn severity fire is a treatment that contributes to long-term maintenance of a diverse and productive understory. Individual species traits were significant drivers of understory species assemblages and, as future change in climate and fire regimes leads to shifts in species composition, anticipation of consequences will be important. Although invasive species occurred at low cover levels, noxious weeds and invasive annual grasses will continue to be management challenges, particularly in dry regions of mixed conifer forests. © 2019, The Author(s).","beta diversity; dispersion; disturbance hypothesis; functional traits; intermediate; invasive species; species diversity; understory","community composition; dispersion; environmental disturbance; functional group; invasive species; mixed forest; species diversity; understory; wildfire; Intermountain West; Coniferophyta; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069720775

In the heavily decentralized Swedish urban planning process, developer dialogues are used to enhance collaboration and thereby increase the climate-proofing of new housing districts. In practice, municipalities struggle with identifying what types of collaborative arrangements best support the realization of climate goals, in light of strong property developer interests and bargaining. Based on qualitative interviews with coordinating planners, this paper illustrates lessons from repeated collaborative practices in six Swedish municipalities. We analytically characterize a shift between firstand second-generation developer dialogues. In first-generation dialogues, coordinators attempted to ensure jointly agreed upon principles, priorities and commitments, which instead resulted in troublesome negotiations. In second-generation dialogues, coordinators used mixed approaches to ensure more competitive and climate-proof urban development by mechanisms of indirect command and control. Principles of collaborative interaction were abandoned to regain control over urban planning. This documented shift contrasts heavily with theoretical assumptions from the climate governance literature, where enhanced collaboration assumedly increase effectiveness of climate policy implementation. Acknowledging the practical implications of using developer dialogues to climate-proof urban planning in different settings is critical for improved policy implementation. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Collaborative ideals; Developer dialogues; Policy implementation; Urban planning","climate change; environmental policy; participatory approach; policy implementation; residential location; urban development; urban planning; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076693946

On this perspective, the Brazilian government had implemented a renewable energy program based on the use of ethanol in the transport sector. This work evaluates the scenario of pollutant gas emissions and particulate material that comes from the biomass burning process involved in ethanol production cycle, in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil. The gases and particulate material emitted by sugarcane and bagasse burning processes—the last one in energy co-generation mills—were analyzed. A laboratory-controlled burning of both samples was realized in an oven with temperature ramp from 250 to 400 °C, at a regular rate of 50 °C. The gas samples were collected directly from the oven’s exhaust pipe. The particulates obtained were the residual material taken out of the burned samples: a powder with the aspect of soot. A photoacoustic spectroscopy system coupled with quantum cascade laser and electrochemical analyzers was used to measure the emission of polluting gases such as N2O, CO2, CO, NOx (NO, NO2), and SO2 in ppmv range. Fluorescent X-ray spectrometry was applied to evaluate the chemical composition of particulate material, enabling the identification of elements such as Si, Al, Ca, K, Fe, S, P, Ti, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sc, V, Cu, and Sr. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental policies; Ethanol; Particulates; Pollutant gas; Social impact","alternative energy; biomass burning; chemical composition; environmental impact; ethanol; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; instrumentation; social impact; temperature effect; Brazil; Campos dos Goytacazes; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; alcohol; biofuel; carbon; fossil fuel; air pollutant; biomass; Brazil; dust; environment; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; gas; soot; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Biomass; Brazil; Carbon; Dust; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Ethanol; Fossil Fuels; Gases; Soot; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074709240

In the European Union (EU), natural and seminatural forests are protected by the Habitats Directive and the Natura 2000 network. This study aimed to assess the exposure of three legally defined forest habitat types to climate change, namely (a) Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes, and ravines (9180*), (b) bog woodlands (91D0*), and (c) alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior (91E0*). We analyzed possible changes in their Bavarian distribution, including their potential future coverage by Natura 2000 sites. We hypothesized that protected areas (PAs) with larger elevational ranges will remain suitable for the forests as they allow for altitudinal distribution shifts. Methods: To estimate changes in range size and coverage by PAs, we combined correlative species distribution models (SDMs) with spatial analyses. Ensembles of SDM-algorithms were applied to two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of the HadGEM2-ES model for the period 2061–2080. Results: Our results revealed that bog woodlands experience the highest range losses (>2/3) and lowest PA coverage (max. 15% of sites with suitable conditions). Tilio-Acerion forests exhibit opposing trends depending on the scenario, while alluvial forests are less exposed to climatic changes. As expected, the impacts of climate change are more pronounced under the “business as usual” scenario (RCP8.5). Additionally, PAs in flat landscapes are more likely to lose environmental suitability for currently established forest habitat types. Main conclusions: Based on these findings, we advocate the expansion of the Natura 2000 network particularly in consideration of elevational gradients, connectivity, and projected climatic suitability. Nonclimatic stressors on forest ecosystems, especially bog woodlands, should be decreased and climate change mitigation efforts enhanced. We recommend transferring the approach to other habitat types and regions. © 2019 The Authors.

Consequently, regulation of manganese flux at the blood- brain barrier (BBB) is critical to brain homeostasis. However, the molecular pathways supporting the transcellular trafficking of divalent manganese ions within the microvascular capillary endothelial cells (BMVECs) that constitute the BBB have not been examined. In this study, we have determined that ZIP8 and ZIP14 (Zrt- and Irt-like proteins 8 and 14) support Mn2+ uptake by BMVECs and that neither DMT1 nor an endocytosis-dependent pathway play any significant role in Mn2+ uptake. Specifically, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZIP8 and ZIP14 coincided with a decrease in manganese uptake, and kinetic analyses revealed that manganese uptake depends on pH and bicarbonate and is up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide, all biochemical markers of ZIP8 or ZIP14 activity. Mn2+ uptake also was associated with cell-surface membrane presentation of ZIP8 and ZIP14, as indicated by membrane protein biotinylation. Importantly, surface ZIP8 and ZIP14 biotinylation and Mn2+-uptake experiments together revealed that these transporters support manganese uptake at both the apical, blood and basal, brain sides of BMVECs. This indicated that in the BMVECs of the BBB, these two transporters support a bidirectional Mn2+ flux. We conclude that BMVECs play a critical role in controlling manganese homeostasis in the brain. © 2019 Steimle et al.

By taking into account possible trends of economic development and environmental awareness, we assess effects of global warming on water availability and quality in the catchments of four European lagoons: Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), Mar Menor (Spain), Vistula Lagoon (Poland and Russia), and Tyligulskyi Liman (Ukraine). Different setups of the process-based soil and water integrated model (SWIM), representing one reference and four socio-economic scenarios for each study area: the “business as usual”, “crisis”, “managed horizons”, and “set-aside” scenarios are driven by sets of 15 climate scenarios for a reference (1971–2000) and near future (2011–2040) scenario period. Modeling results suggest a large spatial variability of potential impacts across the study areas, due to differences in the projected precipitation trends and the current environmental and socio-economic conditions. While climate change may reduce water and nutrients input to the Ria de Aveiro and Tyligulsyi Liman and increase water inflow to the Vistula Lagoon the socio-economic scenarios and their implications may balance out or reverse these trends. In the intensely managed Mar Menor catchment, climate change has no notable direct impact on water resources, but changes in land use and water management may certainly aggravate the current environmental problems. The great heterogeneity among results does not allow formulating adaptation or mitigation measures at pan-European level, as initially intended by this study. It rather implies the need of a regional approach in coastal zone management. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; Eco-hydrological modeling; European lagoons catchments; Land use and water management; Socio-economic changes","Catchments; Climate change; Economic analysis; Global warming; Lakes; Land use; Regional planning; Runoff; Water management; Climate impact researches; Coastal zone management; Eco-hydrological models; Environmental awareness; Environmental problems; Land use and managements; Socio-economic change; Socio-economic conditions; Climate models; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone management; ecohydrology; environmental assessment; hydrological modeling; land use planning; socioeconomic conditions; socioeconomic impact; water management; water resource; agricultural land; Article; catchment; climate change; coastal waters; controlled study; environmental impact; fluid balance; greenhouse effect; hydrological model; lagoon; socioeconomics; water availability; water quality; water supply; Poland; Portugal; socioeconomics; Spain; Aveiro [Portugal]; Mar Menor; Murcia [Spain]; Poland [Central Europe]; Portugal; Ria de Aveiro; Russian Federation; Spain; Spain; Ukraine; Vistula Lagoon; Climate Change; Poland; Portugal; Socioeconomic Factors; Spain; Water Resources; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075044775

I find an evasive strategy—avoiding any type of rhetoric—ensures faster regulatory approval under extremely favorable conditions, but is ineffective when community need is low, and there is either sustained community opposition or an adverse political climate. Conversely, an exuberance strategy, involving all three rhetorical types, ensures regulatory approval under adverse social conditions when supply conditions are favorable, but approval speed is slower.

Using a pollen paleocommunity dataset from southern Lithuania (Čepkeliai bog) and applying spectral analysis techniques, we tested this record for the presence of statistically significant cyclicities, which can be observed in past solar activity. The time series of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) scores, which in our case are assumed to reflect temperature variations, and Tsallis entropy-related community compositional diversity estimates q* revealed the presence of cycles on several time scales. The most consistent periodicities are characterized by periods lasting between 201 and 240 years, which is very close to the DeVries solar cycles (208 years). A shorter-term periodicity of 176 years was detected in the NMDS scores that can be putatively linked to the subharmonics of the Gleissberg solar cycle. In addition, periodicities of ≈3,760 and ≈1,880 years were found in both parameters. These periodic patterns could be explained either as originating as a harmonic nonlinear response to precession forcing, or as resulting from the long-term solar activity quasicycles that were reported in previous studies of solar activity proxies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; entropy; Holocene; Lithuania; multidimensional scaling; periodicity; solar cycle; solar energy; spectroscopy; time series analysis; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073154351

Determining the efficacy of mangroves in achieving climate goals can be complicated by difficulty in quantifying C inputs (i.e., differentiating newer inputs from younger trees from older residual C pools), and mitigation assessments rarely consider potential offsets to CO2 storage by methane (CH4) production in mangrove sediments. The establishment of non-native Rhizophora mangle along Hawaiian coastlines over the last century offers an opportunity to examine the role mangroves play in climate mitigation and adaptation both globally and locally as novel ecosystems. We quantified total ecosystem C storage, sedimentation, accretion, sediment organic C burial and CH4 emissions from ~70 year old R. mangle stands and adjacent uninvaded mudflats. Ecosystem C stocks of mangrove stands exceeded mudflats by 434 ± 33 Mg C/ha, and mangrove establishment increased average coastal accretion by 460%. Sediment organic C burial increased 10-fold (to 4.5 Mg C ha−1 year−1), double the global mean for old growth mangrove forests, suggesting that C accumulation from younger trees may occur faster than previously thought, with implications for mangrove restoration. Simulations indicate that increased CH4 emissions from sediments offset ecosystem CO2 storage by only 2%–4%, equivalent to 30–60 Mg CO2-eq/ha over mangrove lifetime (100 year sustained global warming potential). Results highlight the importance of mangroves as novel systems that can rapidly accumulate C, have a net positive atmospheric greenhouse gas removal effect, and support shoreline accretion rates that outpace current sea level rise. Sequestration potential of novel mangrove forests should be taken into account when considering their removal or management, especially in the context of climate mitigation goals. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","210Pb; methane; Moloka‘i; non-native species; restoration; Rhizophora mangle; sediment","carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; geoaccumulation; global change; lead isotope; mangrove; methane; native species; restoration ecology; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae; carbon; burial; ecosystem; environmental protection; Hawaii; wetland; Burial; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Hawaii; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073950102

Continuing CO2 rise will devastate ecosystems, and ice dependent species like polar bears ultimately will disappear. Commercial aviation is presently a relatively small CO2 contributor, but this CO2 intensive mode of transportation is projected to increase greatly. Scientists and conservationists are often among the most frequent of flyers, despite their recognition that emissions must be reduced. Here we illustrate the carbon footprint of air travel in terms of its impact on the sea ice habitat necessary for polar bear persistence, and suggest our colleagues reduce their air travel where-ever possible. Each metric ton of CO2 emitted melts ~3 m2 of arctic summer sea ice, and current air travel melts over 5000 m2 each year. Each scientist making the short flight from Copenhagen to Oslo to join an IUCN polar bear meeting will melt ~1 m2 of Arctic summer sea-ice. Annually hundreds of scientists and conservationists make frequent flights of much greater distances for AMAP, CAFF, IUCN, and other conservation related meetings. Much of this travel could be avoided with better planning and employing internet linkages for remote participation. When air travel, such as for necessary fieldwork, cannot be easily substituted by Web linkage, we all should search for routes and carriers allowing the lowest CO2 emissions. We encourage all of our colleagues to join ‘No Fly Climate Sci’ to show their commitment to CO2 reduction and learn more about doing so. As scientists, if we are serious about preserving polar bears and their Arctic sea ice habitat, we need to walk the talk and show an example for the rest of society by significantly reducing our air travel. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon dioxide; Climate; Extinction; Legislation; Mercury; Pollution","Air transportation; Arctic vehicles; Carbon footprint; Civil aviation; Ecosystems; Laws and legislation; Light extinction; Mammals; Mercury (metal); Pollution; Research laboratories; Sea ice; Arctic sea ice; Climate; CO2 concentration; CO2 emissions; CO2 reduction; Earth systems; Internet linkage; Remote participation; Carbon dioxide; arctic climate; aviation; carbon footprint; deglaciation; environmental impact; field work; habitat quality; human; Letter; nonhuman; polar bear; preservation; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); sea ice; web browser; air pollutant; animal; Arctic; bear; climate change; ecosystem; ice cover; toxicity; Ursus maritimus; carbon dioxide; Air Pollutants; Animals; Arctic Regions; Aviation; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Ice Cover; Ursidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074161578

But it is unclear whether aerosol water content and acidity respond to these changes. The two parameters have been shown to affect heterogeneous production of winter haze aerosols. Here, we performed thermodynamic equilibrium modeling using chemical and meteorological data observed in urban Beijing for four recent winter seasons and quantified the changes in the mass growth factor and pH of inorganic aerosols. We focused on high relative humidity (>60%) conditions when submicron particles have been shown to be in the liquid state. From 2014/2015 to 2018/2019, the modeled mass growth factor decreased by about 9%-17% due to changes in aerosol compositions (more nitrate and less sulfate and chloride), and the modeled pH increased by about 0.3-0.4 unit mainly due to rising ammonia. A buffer equation is derived from semivolatile ammonia partitioning, which helps understand the sensitivity of pH to meteorological and chemical variables. The findings provide implications for evaluating the potential chemical feedback in secondary aerosol production and the effectiveness of ammonia control as a measure to alleviate winter haze. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosols; Ammonia; Chlorine compounds; Meteorology; pH; Sulfur compounds; Urban growth; Aerosol chemical composition; Aerosol composition; High relative humidities; Meteorological data; Pollution mitigation; Sub-micron particles; Thermodynamic equilibrium model; Thermodynamic model; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075004104

Understanding how the U.S. household consumption on specific goods or services drives global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is important to guide consumption-side strategies for climate mitigation. Here we examined global GHG emissions driven by the U.S. household consumption from 1995 to 2014 using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model and detailed U.S. consumer expenditure survey data. The results show that the annual carbon footprint of the U.S. households ranged from 17.7 to 20.6 tCO2eq/capita with an expanding proportion occurring overseas. Housing and transportation contributed 53–66% of the domestic carbon footprint. Overseas carbon footprint shows an overall increasing trajectory, from 16.4% of the total carbon footprint in 1995 to the peak of 20.4% in 2006.

Many countries have been striving to develop and deploy low carbon emission technologies for power generation through efficiency improvement and use of renewable energy. For the regions that gain sufficient amount of solar to make solar power attractive overall, the challenge of intermittency still poses an issue for the electricity grid. The complementary role of natural gas power for the incoming renewables will be reinforced in the near future, but emission of CO2 needs to be avoided through means such as carbon capture and storage. A novel solution of integrating the s-CO2 oxy-combustion system with the concentrated solar power (CSP) is devised. The suggested concept will provide direction to satisfy the growing electricity demand, yet with environmental sustainability. The evaluation of this system in several regions possible for CSP installation shows reduction of fuel consumption by 17–38% compared to conventionally separated systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CSP; Fuel Reduction; Oxy-combustion; Supercritical CO2","Carbon capture; Combustion; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Concentrated solar power; Efficiency improvement; Environmental sustainability; Fuel reduction; Low-carbon emissions; Oxy combustions; Supercritical CO2; Use of renewable energies; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073233529

The oxygen transfer capacities of the particles were compared when conducting redox reactions under H2/air or CH4-CO2/air systems. As a result, the oxygen transfer capacity increased as the amount of Cu ions added increased. In particular, in the CH4-CO2/air system, Cu0.75Mg0.25MnAlO4 particle showed an excellent oxygen transfer capacity of 7.62%. The XPS result confirms that the Cu2+ (also partially Mn3+ ions) in the Cu0.75Mg0.25MnAlO4 particle oxidize CH4, and then they are restored to their original state by receiving oxygen from the Al3+ and Mg2+ ions in the support. The oxygen vacancies in the lattice due to the Cu2+ could easily induce oxygen delivery, and the reversible oxygen loss recovery by re-oxidation in the air reactor could be achieved. This is the most important factor in increasing oxygen transfer capacity. Ultimately, in this study, oxygen defects in the crystal lattices induced during the reaction seem to have a positive effect on the CH4 combustion reaction. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Methane Combustion; Oxygen Carrier; Oxygen Transfer Capacity; Oxygen Vacancy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076096088

These regulations appear in different forms and designs and address air and water pollution as well as climate change. The paper devotes particular attention to how various regulations have affected sustainable technological change and the prospects for inducing deep emission reductions without jeopardizing industrial competitiveness and future investments. Recent Findings: Experiences from key pulp and paper regions, not least the Nordic countries, suggest that gradually tightening performance standards have contributed to radical reductions in emissions, e.g., chlorine compounds and biological oxygen demanding agents, and without imposing excessive compliance costs. This outcome can largely be attributed to how the regulations have been designed—and implemented—in practice, as well as to the presence of efficient and legitimate institutions. Long-term emission reduction targets, in combination with extended compliance periods and trustful firm-regulator relationships, contributed to radical technological innovation and permitted radical emission reductions without excessive compliance costs. The development of alternative bleaching technologies is an apt example. In contrast, the impact of carbon pricing schemes, including the EU emissions trading scheme, on carbon dioxide emissions reductions and related technological change in the pulp and paper industry has however been modest. Self-regulation, certification, and community pressure have exerted relatively modest influences on the environmental performance of the industry. Summary: Important avenues for future research are identified. These include the following: (a) comparative research on how policy mixes in various countries have influenced environmental compliance and innovation; processes; (b) future studies of environmental regulations, their design and implementation, in emerging pulp and paper producing countries, not least China; and (c) research on how environmental regulations can affect ongoing restructurings in the industry towards a broader palette of products in biorefineries. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; Competitiveness; Environmental regulation; Innovation; Pollution; Pulp and paper industry",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074703255

Under the applied conditions, mole fractions were obtained in the range of 1.11 × 10−5 to 9.10 × 10−4. For correlating the drug solubility, six semi-empirical models and two equations of state (EoSs), with different modeling plans, were utilized. Furthermore, sublimation pressure of the solute was calculated by two different approaches: a predictive model and data fitting. Results showed high accuracy of Soave-Redlich-Kwong EoS combined with Renon mixing rule using the second approach.

In order to maximise N use efficiency (NUE), growers attempt to match N fertiliser to seasonal water limited yield potential, which in the southern grain growing region is largely determined by in-crop rainfall. Australia's variable rainfall makes water limited yield potential very difficult to predict, and growers tend to under fertilise, fearing economic and environmental losses of N if crops are over-fertilised. However, environmental losses of excess N are low in the semi-arid, winter dominant rainfall environments with high water holding capacity soils that comprise much of the wheat producing regions of south eastern Australia. This is particularly the case when high carbon (C) to N ratio crop residues are retained which facilitate rapid immobilisation of any mineral N surplus to crop requirements. We therefore propose that the exploitable yield gap in wheat could be closed if a longer-term strategy of N fertiliser application was adopted. In this strategy, growers would simply use N fertiliser to maintain an environmentally appropriate base level of inorganic N (N bank) rather than attempting to match fertiliser inputs to seasonal conditions. We used field studies with 15N labelled fertiliser and cropping systems simulations to demonstrate that fertiliser N applied at rates calculated to maintain fixed thresholds of inorganic N (N bank criteria) and top-dressed immediately prior to the period of rapid crop uptake can substantially increase yields and profit in comparison to current practice, even when applications exceed crop demand in some years. A further benefit of this strategy is an increase in soil organic matter. Both field and simulation studies indicate that the environmental cost of such a strategy would be minimal, with only a small increase in leaching and denitrification despite higher overall rates of N application. This strategy needs to be compared with current practices in longer term field experiments to confirm production increases and lack of environmental impacts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Farm profit; N fertilisers; Soil organic C; Wheat yields","cost analysis; crop production; crop yield; dryland farming; fertilizer application; inorganic nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; profitability; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070861022

An important knowledge gap that needs to be addressed before tackling these challenges is how and to which extent street/drainage grid density and spatial land use configuration influence the amount of runoff. Therefore, a virtual experiment was conducted to assess the influence of grid density and spatial land use configuration on the functional runoff connectivity (Fc), which is a measure of the easiness by which water flows through the landscape. Through the use of a design of experiments approach in combination with the SCS-Curve Number runoff model, a wide variety of neutral landscape models with a fixed percentage of pervious-and impervious cover were generated that maximized the variance of Fc. Correlations between landscape metrics and neutral landscape models were calculated. Our results indicated that, out of the 17 landscape metrics tested, the average impervious cluster area, the number of impervious clusters, the standard deviation of the cluster size, two proximity indexes and the effective impervious area were strongly correlated with Fc throughout all grid scenarios. The relationship between Fc on the one hand and the average impervious cluster area and the effective impervious area on the other hand, was modelled. The average impervious cluster area models showed a relationship with Fc that closely approximated a logarithmic function (R2: 0.49-0.73), while the effective impervious area models were found to have a linear relationship with Fc (R2: 0.63-0.99). A dense grid was shown to cause a strong increase in Fc, demonstrating the effectiveness of an urban grid in channeling and removing runoff. Our results further indicate that fine-grained landscapes with a lot of small impervious clusters are preferred over course-grained landscapes when the goal is to reduce Fc. In highly urbanized landscapes, where the percentage of impervious area is high, small changes in landscape pattern could significantly reduce Fc. By using a downward hydrological modeling approach this research aims to bring more clarity to the underlying variables influencing Fc, rather than trying to generate realistic prediction values. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, we analyzed the TWS and groundwater storage (GWS) variations of the main Polish basins, the Vistula and the Odra, using GRACE observations, in-situ data, GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) hydrological models, and CMIP5 (theWorld Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) climate data. The research was conducted for the period between September 2006 and October 2015. The TWS data were taken directly from GRACE measurements and also computed from four GLDAS (VIC, CLM, MOSAIC, and NOAH) and six CMIP5 (FGOALS-g2, GFDL-ESM2G, GISS-E2-H, inmcm4, MIROC5, and MPI-ESM-LR) models. The GWS data were obtained by subtracting the model TWS from the GRACE TWS. The resulting GWS values were compared with in-situ well measurements calibrated using porosity coefficients. For each time series, the trends, spectra, amplitudes, and seasonal components were computed and analyzed. The results suggest that in Poland there has been generally no major TWS or GWS depletion. Our results indicate that when comparing TWS values, better compliance with GRACE data was obtained for GLDAS than for CMIP5 models. However, the GWS analysis showed better consistency of climate models with the well results. The results can contribute toward selection of an appropriate model that, in combination with global GRACE observations, would provide information on groundwater changes in regions with limited or inaccurate ground measurements. © 2019 by the authors.","CMIP5; GLDAS; GRACE; Groundwater storage (GWS); Total water storage (TWS)","Climate change; Digital storage; Groundwater; Water conservation; CMIP5; GLDAS; GRACE; Groundwater storage; Water storage; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077868432

This article suggests that from the perspective of local distributive justice if taxes are used to guide people to behavioural changes the taxes should be sensitive to people’s ability to pay. This is because flat taxes tend to hit the less well-off harder than the prosperous. Furthermore, according to the “ability to pay” principle when people are bound to contribute to a common project we should not make those who are already worst-off more worse off. Following this, three further arguments are considered for why taxes aimed to diminish personal emissions should be sensitive to people’s ability to pay. First, in the case of flat carbon taxes, the burdens are not distributed equally because the relevant burden in question is not the price paid but the act or effort of changing behaviour. Second, a carbon tax that directs all to emission reductions is more effective in achieving these reductions precisely because it directs all and not just certain income groups to mitigate personal emissions. Finally, it is argued that reflecting external costs and discouraging consumption are different things. Further on, because of the nature of climate change, a carbon tax should be designed to discourage consumption and not merely to reflect external costs. A carbon tax that is sensitive to different abilities to pay is better in achieving this than a flat carbon tax. © 2019, Editura Academiei Romane.

However, the time taken for rubber trees to become fully productive (approximately 6 years) can cause significant impacts on shorter-term rubber supplies. In addition, replanting can have environmental impacts, such as reduction of carbon stocks because immature trees convert less CO2 than mature ones, and social impacts, such as reduced need for tappers, the highly skilled employees who harvest latex from rubber trees, during the immature phase of trees’ lives. Early discussions with Indonesian natural rubber stakeholders highlighted a demand for methods and tools that allow the consideration of these impacts when formulating replanting policies. This paper proposes an approach to support the formulation of sustainable replanting policies in the Indonesian natural rubber supply network that allows users to consider trade-offs between three factors: economic, social and environmental. The approach uses the composite indicators method to represent the impacts of replanting on the sustainability of the supply network.

The associated global warming and humidification, increases in the severity and frequency of extreme climate events, extension of the ranges of vector-borne diseases, and the consequent social and economic stresses and disruption will have major negative consequences on many aspects of health care. People whose resilience to change is already impaired may suffer disproportionately from these environmental changes, which are of unprecedented reach and magnitude. There has been little connection made so far between climate change and epilepsy. We briefly review the history of climate change science and the subsequent response of the global scientific community. We consider how climate change effects might in general affect health and disease. We consider some of the underlying complex interactions that, for example, favor the spread of vector-borne diseases and how climate models operate and may help plan for global and local changes. We then speculate specifically on how these generic ideas may apply specifically to epilepsy. We consider these impacts at levels from molecular to the epidemiological. Data are sparse, and there is undoubtedly a need for more information to enable better estimation of possible effects of climate change on care in epilepsy. We also consider how the professional activities of those involved in epilepsy health care might contribute to global carbon emissions, for example, through flying for conference attendance. Healthcare organizations across the world are already considering, and responding to, many of these issues. We argue for more research in this area, but also for action today. Actions today are likely to generate cobenefits for health care, including care in epilepsy, resulting from efforts to decarbonize, mitigate effects of climate change that has already happened, and plan for adaptation to climate change. © 2019 The Authors.

We examine the impact of changes in land use and land management for six combinations of socioeconomic pathways and climate outcomes, and find that societal choices will substantially impact riverine total nitrogen loading (+54% to −7%) for the continental United States by the end of the century. Regional impacts will be even larger. Increased loading is possible for both high emission and low emission pathways, due to increased food and biofuel demand, respectively. Some pathways, however, suggest that limiting climate change and eutrophication can be achieved concurrently. Precipitation changes will further exacerbate loading, resulting in a net increase of 1 to 68%. Globally, increases in cropland area and agricultural intensification will likely impact vast portions of Asia.

A nitrate-based mechanism is used to predict the reduction of NO2 by CO, for which a kinetic model for the adsorption of NO2 is first developed and is then incorporated into another model to include the effect of CO on NO2 adsorption and reaction. The interaction of C3H6 with NO2 is explained by global reactions leading to the formation of NO, N2 and CO. The kinetic models for CO-NO2 and C3H6-NO2 when combined with the NH3-SCR model are able to explain the experimental trends reported in the literature. Under NO2-SCR reaction conditions, the promotional effect of C3H6 on NOx conversions at low temperatures is explained by the generation of local fast SCR conditions. CO shows a more pronounced promotional effect on NOx conversion than C3H6 at low temperatures. This is explained by the synergistic role of CO and NH3 in enhancing the formation of nitrites and nitrates by NO2 adsorption. The increased formation of NO at high temperatures is used to explain the negative effect of C3H6 on the conversion of NOx during fast SCR and NO2-SCR reaction conditions. The negligible effect of CO during fast SCR reaction conditions is explained by the consumption of nitrites by NH3 instead of their reaction with NO2 to form additional NO. The insights gained in this work can also be used for the analysis of SDPF systems, wherein CO produced during the regeneration of a DPF can affect the NOx reduction performance of the SCR catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Chabazite; Cu-SSZ-13; Global kinetics; Hydrocarbon selective catalytic reduction (HC-SCR); NH3-SCR; NO2 adsorption kinetics","Adsorption; Ammonia; Catalysts; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; Zeolites; Adsorption and reactions; Adsorption kinetics; Chabazite; Global kinetics; Low temperatures; Monolithic catalysts; Promotional effect; Reaction conditions; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056573872

This paper contributes to that literature by: (i) studying per capita GHG emissions in the United States (US) adopting STIRPAT modeling framework; (ii) employing new explanatory factors like cattle population density, political willingness to address environmental problems, and educational attainment; and (iii) investigating whether emissions elasticities of various factors vary within the US or not. State-level panel data over the period 1990–2014 are used, and partitioning of the sample is done with respect to two controlling factors: an indicator of political support to environmentalism and educational attainment. Results of heterogeneous slope parameters panel data models indicate that cattle density and affluence are major drivers of per capita GHG emissions in the continental US. We find strong evidence of heterogeneity in emissions elasticities across partitioned samples. Our grouping analysis suggests that in a diverse country like US, policymakers should not focus on the average relationships dictated by a single STIRPAT equation, but should account for regional differences if they want accuracy and higher effectiveness in climate policymaking. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Augmented mean group estimator; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Livestock; Population aging; Renewable energy","educational attainment; emission control; environmental modeling; environmental policy; environmentalism; greenhouse gas; panel data; policy making; United States; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048695462

By the later part of the century, current estimates indicate that a >50% increase in the yield of most of the important food crops including wheat, rice and barley will be needed to maintain food supplies and improve nutritional quality to tackle what has become known as ‘hidden hunger’. Improving the nutritional quality of crops has become a target for providing the micronutrients required in remote communities where dietary variation is often limited. A number of methods to achieve this have been investigated over recent years, from improving photosynthesis through genetic engineering, to breeding new higher yielding varieties. Recent research has shown that growing plants under elevated [CO2] can lead to an increase in Vitamin C due to changes in gene expression, demonstrating one potential route for plant biofortification.

Using the 3-D large-eddy simulation technique coupled with a CO2-sensitive dynamic plant physiological submodel, we aimed to spatially and temporally understand the surface and vegetation forcing on the coupled land-atmosphere interactions in future scenarios. Four simulations were designed: a control simulation for current conditions, an enhanced carbon dioxide simulation (current +200 ppm), an elevated temperature simulation (current +2 K), and a simulation covering the combination of both elevations in temperature and CO2. With elevations in carbon dioxide, plant transpiration is reduced due to stomatal closure, resulting in reduced latent- and increased sensible heat fluxes. Although no effects on cloud cover were found in this simulation, the in-cloud moisture flux was enhanced. Elevations in temperature yielded opposite results with reduced sensible and increased latent heat fluxes, which reduced the turbulent kinetic energy and buoyancy rates, thereby negatively impacting cloud formation. Our future climate mimicking simulation shows minimal changes in the regional energy balance due to offsetting effects between increased temperature and [CO2], while plant photosynthesis increased and transpiration decreased. The atmospheric boundary layer was drier, even though surface fluxes were very similar current conditions, thereby hampering cloud formation and development. Our results highlight the necessity of small scales and interactions, which require a bottom-up approach to be able to accurately capture the nonlinear plant-atmosphere interactions. ©2019.

These pollutants had declined year by year since 2011, in the 10-year period, AOD and SO2 respectively decreased by 17.14% and 10.57%, and only NO2 rose from 8.69 × 1015 molecules/cm2 in 2006 to 9.10 × 1015 molecules/cm2 in 2015 with the increase rate of 4.79%. Integrated with MODIS-released fire products and the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), high AOD values in summer were usually accompanied by frequent biomass burning, and heavy heating demand of coal burning led to largest NO2 and SO2 levels in winter. Both inter-annual variations of MEIC NOx and OMI-observed NO2 responded to emission reductions of vehicle exhaustions positively, but vehicle population in Henan and Shandong provinces need to be further controlled. The significant decline of SO2 is mainly attributed to the enforcement of de-sulfurization devices in power plants. Our study found that in the treatment of complex atmospheric pollution, in addition to strict control of common sources of emissions from AOD, NO2 and SO2, it is also necessary to consider their individual characteristics. © 2019","AOD; MODIS; NO2; North China Plain; OMI; SO2; Variation","Coal industry; Emission control; Molecules; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Aerosol optical thickness; Atmospheric pollutants; Atmospheric pollution; Distribution characteristics; Individual characteristics; MODIS; North China Plain; Variation; Nitrogen oxides; nitric oxide; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; coal; aerosol property; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; MODIS; nitrogen dioxide; remote sensing; spatial distribution; sulfur dioxide; absorption spectroscopy; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; atmospheric dispersion; biomass; burn; China; controlled study; desulfurization; electric power plant; remote sensing; seasonal variation; aerosol; city; environmental monitoring; fire; procedures; season; China; North China Plain; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Power Plants; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073006869

This paper explores the impact of energy policy in curbing the effect of carbon emission in the United States, China and Nigeria. It offers an empirical insight into the effect of energy policy on carbon emission disclosure of the selected countries' economies. Since understanding future decisions on energy use is uncertain, the study develops, interacts and simulates a simple model for analysing the nexus between the energy sector and environmental policy within the uncertain business environment. The omission in the majority of available literature is that it is unclear if the precise reduction in carbon emission is consistent with the carbon tax levied on economic agents. At best, the evidence gathered points to a fresh impetus on energy policy to accommodate business cycles, even if carbon emission must be mitigated. This study, therefore, analyses the subjective behaviour of an economic agent in the context of carbon emission and the depreciating quality of life. The empirical evidence is based on the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. The paper submits that policy direction towards a carbon-free environment, when properly channelled, would impact positively on decarbonisation. Simulation conducted shows that pollution is highly connected with macroeconomic fluctuation, and environmental policy can only be effective when both variables are considered in the context of the DSGE framework. Thus, the study strongly recommends broader carbon tax reform and a proactive monetary stance to mitigate carbon emission and motivate new renewable energy investors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon policy; Fiscal redesign; Monetary stances; Resource and conservation","Carbon; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy policy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Taxation; Business environments; Carbon policy; Environmental policy; Fiscal redesign; General equilibrium; General equilibrium models; Macroeconomic fluctuations; Monetary stances; Environmental protection; carbon emission; emission control; energy policy; environmental policy; fiscal policy; general equilibrium analysis; monetary policy; stochasticity; Article; calculation; carbon footprint; China; dynamics; economics; environmental policy; mathematical computing; Nigeria; pollution; priority journal; renewable energy; simulation; stochastic model; United States; China; Nigeria; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071848779

In this paper, PM2.5 samples were collected for 24 h twice or thrice a week during December 2016–December 2017 at three sites [Delhi (IG), Modinagar (MN) and Mahendragarh (HR)] over NCR to analyse the carbonaceous aerosols. Source apportionment of PM2.5 was attempted using Principal Component analysis (PCA) and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) based on the analysed carbonaceous fractions [Organic carbon, Elemental carbon, Secondary organic carbon (SOC)]. Organic compounds: alkanes, hopanes, steranes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, levoglucosan and n-alkanoic acids were analysed to distinguish the emission sources. Total Carbonaceous Aerosols (TCA) contributed significantly (∼26%) to PM2.5 which revealed their importance in source apportionment. Estimated SOC contributed 43.2%, 42.2% and 58.2% to OC and 5.4%, 5.3% and 7.8% to PM2.5 at IG, MN and HR sites respectively. PCA and PMF apportion five emission sources i.e., vehicular emissions (34.6%), biomass burning (26.8%), cooking emissions (15.7%), plastic and waste burning (13.5%) and secondary organic carbon (9.5%) for PM2.5. Source attributed health risk has also been calculated in terms of Lung cancer risk (LCR) associated with PAHs exposure and concluded that vehicular emissions (40.3%), biomass burning (38.1%), secondary organic carbon (12.8%) contributed higher to LCR (503.2 × 10−5; ∼503 cases in 1,00,000).

Combined with uncertainties concerning the cost, lifetime, and effectiveness of adaptation measures, this implies that the net benefits of alternative adaptation strategies are ambiguous. On one hand, a simple analysis that disregards uncertainty might lead to near-term choices that are later regretted if future circumstances differ from those assumed. On the other hand, careful uncertainty-based decision analyses can be costly in personnel and time and might not make a difference. This paper considers two questions adaptation managers might ask. First, what type of analysis is most appropriate for a particular adaptation decision? We answer this question by proposing a six-step screening procedure to compare the usefulness of predict-then-act analysis, multi-scenario analysis without adaptive options, and multi-scenario analysis incorporating adaptive options. A tutorial application is presented using decision trees. However, this procedure may be cumbersome if managers face several adaptation problems simultaneously. Hence, a second question is how can managers quickly identify problems that would benefit most from thorough decision analysis? To address this question, we propose a procedure that ranks multiple adaptation problems in terms of the necessity and value of comprehensive analysis. Analysis can then emphasize the highest-ranking problems. This procedure is illustrated by a ranking of adaptation problems in the Chesapeake Bay region. The two complementary procedures proposed here can help managers focus analytical efforts where they will be most useful. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Chesapeake Bay; Climate change adaptation; Climate uncertainty; Cost-benefit analysis; Type of decision analysis","Climate change; Decision making; Decision theory; Decision trees; Managers; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptation decisions; Adaptation strategies; Chesapeake Bay; Climate change adaptation; Climate uncertainty; Comprehensive analysis; Multiple adaptation; Screening procedures; Cost benefit analysis; adaptive management; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; questionnaire survey; ranking; Chesapeake Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075360147

While the UHI’ energy impact has been rather intensively studied recently, the UMI effect on latent energy is still underexplored, especially for humid subtropical climate like Hong Kong. This study investigated the intensity of UHI and UMI in Hong Kong, and its impacts on the sensible and latent cooling demand of residential buildings in summer. Firstly, a ten-year weather dataset from 2004–2013 for the six stations selected based on the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme was analysed. The results show that the urban area of Hong Kong appears as both a heat and moisture island during summer nights but as cooling and dry islands during daytime, and the nocturnal UHI and UMI intensity vary significantly with different LCZs. Furthermore, the energy performance of a typical residential building in Hong Kong was simulated with measured weather data for the selected stations as an input. The urban building shows a higher sensible cooling demand, approximately twice that of the comparative rural one, and the latent cooling demand could be up to 96% higher. Both sensible and latent cooling energy demand decrease with increasing LCZ grades. Our study highlights that both UHI and UMI effect should be considered in the estimation of building energy in Hong Kong due to their significant impacts on the cooling energy demand. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Latent cooling demand; Residential building; Sensible cooling demand; Urban heat island; Urban moisture island","Atmospheric temperature; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Housing; Moisture; Latent cooling; Residential building; Sensible cooling demand; Urban heat island; Urban moisture island; Landforms; cooling; demand analysis; energy efficiency; environmental impact assessment; microclimate; residential energy; summer; urban climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072957831

Thus, the purpose of this study was to quantify the relationships between urban forms and PM2.5 concentration change seasonally in 279 Chinese cities, with the explicit consideration of a comparative analysis between national and urban agglomeration scales. A comprehensive evaluation index system of urban forms was calculated based on six urban form metrics (total urban area (CA), number of patches (NP), landscape shape index (LSI), percentage of like adjacencies (PLADJ), patch cohesion index (COHESION), and aggregation index (AI)) by integrating three control variables (temperature, NDVI, and nighttime light). The spatial regression model was subsequently adopted to quantify the effects of urban forms on PM2.5 concentrations. The results revealed that, during the summer and autumn, only urban form compactness was significantly correlated with the PM2.5 concentrations, but more urban form metrics were significantly associated with the PM2.5 concentrations during the spring and winter in Chinese cities. The scattered urban form could effectively reduce the PM2.5 concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing but not in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei during the winter. The effects of urban forms on PM2.5 concentrations become increasingly noticeable from the national scale to the urban agglomeration scale with seasonal change. This study suggests that the urban form-PM2.5 concentration relationships are sensitive to seasonal variations across different regions. Thus, it is an important approach to solve PM2.5 pollution problem to construct an ideal urban form through flexible urban planning strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese cities; Nighttime light; PM2.5 concentrations; Seasonal variation; Urban forms","Regression analysis; River pollution; Urban growth; Chinese cities; Night-time lights; PM2.5 concentration; Seasonal variation; Urban form; Agglomeration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071267290

This research aims to predict the impacts of psychological factors (i.e., subjective norm, attitude, self-efficacy and controllability) and policy factors (i.e., command and control policy, economic incentive policy and education guidance policy) on individual's PM2.5 reduction behavior using a comprehensive research model on the basis of planned behavior theory and attitude-behavior-context. The research model is empirically examined employing questionnaire survey data of 1007 urban residents who reside in severe smog regions in China. The research findings indicate that individual's subjective norm, attitude and self-efficacy are all important internal affecting factors of individual's PM2.5 reduction intention, and further influence actual behavior. However, controllability can significantly moderate the relationship between individual's intention and actual behavior towards reducing PM2.5. Furthermore, three types of policy measures all show significant moderating effects on the transformation from intention to actual behavior. In addition, the results highlight that controllability and three types of policy measures all activate the transformation from intention to behavior, whether at low or high levels but to different extent, which implies that controllability and policy factors play a critical role in narrowing the gap between individual's intention and actual behavior.

The geologic sequestration of CO2 is considered as an effective method for reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Carbon-dioxide enhanced coalbed methane (CO2-ECBM) recovery is extremely attractive owing to its ability to store CO2 in coal seams while simultaneously enhancing the production of methane. However, the injection of CO2 can induce a deformation of the coal matrix, which has a significant effect on the fluid flow and stability of the coal seams. In this study, the sorption kinetics experiments indicated the high anisotropy and heterogeneity of local sorption deformation in coal samples and a unique kinetic behavior of sorption deformation which was rarely reported and analyzed in detail in previous studies. This kinetic behavior demonstrated a rapid increase of sorption strain followed by a slight or significant falloff until the equilibrium state reached. The characteristics of component distribution in coal samples were investigated using CT scanning and micro-lithotype and EDS analysis. An extensive analysis of the experiment results indicated the following: 1) Carbon dioxide dissolved during the first sorption process induced a rearrangement of the coal structure, leading to a drastic variation of deformation behavior between the first and subsequent sorption process. 2) The unique kinetic behavior of sorption deformation could be induced by either the loss of moisture in coal or the interaction of different coal components. The mechanism of these two factors induced coal shrinkage was different and had a distinct effect on the global behavior of sorption deformation. 3) The quantitative relationship between compressional and dilative components directly verified the significant compression of inertinite-rich regions by the slow swelling of vitrinite-rich regions. 4) The kinetic behavior of sorption deformation was affected by the combination of the macroscopic bedding structure and the heterogeneous component distribution in coal. © 2019","Anisotropic and heterogeneous sorption deformation; CO2-ECBM; Heterogeneous component distribution; Micro-lithotype","Anisotropy; Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Computerized tomography; Deformation; Flow of fluids; Greenhouse effect; Kinetics; Metal recovery; Methane; Sorption; CO2-ECBM; Component distributions; Deformation behavior; Equilibrium state; Geologic sequestrations; Heterogeneous component; Micro-lithotype; Sorption kinetics; Coal; anisotropic medium; carbon dioxide; coal; coal seam; coalbed methane; deformation; heterogeneous medium; kinetics; lithotype; sorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074636872

This study uses an explicit regulation, the air pollution ranking in Chinese cities as an example to illustrate how such informational governance policy instrument has an impact on local air pollution governance. Empirical evidence is based on monthly comprehensive air quality index ranking data of 74 key monitoring cities in China from 2013 to 2018. And a regression discontinuity design is applied to explore the relationship between air pollution ranking and air quality improvement in localities. The results show that (1) air quality of the bottom ten cities in the ranking will improve in the coming month compared with their counterparts; (2) such improvement happens upon the releasing of the ranking, but would not last for more than a month; (3) while top ten cities in the ranking do not experience such change in air quality. Therefore, we argue that the air pollution ranking system in China can be a useful informational governance instrument in providing negative incentives for environmental administrations in bottom cities to strengthen air pollution control. However, as a top-down environmental information disclosure program, such ranking institution could only mobilize local air quality governance temporarily. And new institutions ought to be established to further internalized local governments’ environmental externalities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cadre evaluation; Environmental information; Incentives; Informational governance; Policy instrument; Public disclosure","air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental policy; governance approach; incentive; local government; pollution control; urban area; urban pollution; air pollution control; air quality; article; China; city; government; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental policy; environmental protection; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072709236

In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) incorporated Z-scheme assembly of AgBr/TiO2 was developed for photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiations. Synthesized photocatalysts were characterized through transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), photoluminescence spectra (PL), Brunauer Emmet-Teller(BET), and UV-vis spectroscopy analysis techniques. The composite photocatalysts exhibited a H2 production of 477 ppm which was three-folds higher than that produced by TiO2. The good performance was attributed to the strong interaction of three components and the reduced charge recombination, which was 89 and 56.3 times lower than the TiO2 and AgBr/TiO2. Furthermore, the role of surface acidic and basic groups was assessed and the photocatalytic results demonstrated the importance of surface functional groups. In addition, the composites exhibited stability and reusability for five consecutive cycles of reaction. Thus, improved performance of the photocatalyst was credited to the CNTs as an electron mediator, surface functional groups, higher surface area, enhanced charge separation and extended visible light absorption edge.

Criminal behaviors typically included murder, assault, and theft. The majority of the research reviewed involved quantitative methods (e.g., comparison of green space area to crime data). We extracted multiple mechanisms from the literature that may account for the impact of green space on crime including social interaction and recreation, community perception, biophilic stress reduction, climate modulation, and spaces expressing territorial definition.

Understanding land use change impact on soil carbon stock is crucial for implementing land use management to increase carbon stock and reducing carbon emission. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine land use change and to assess its effect on soil carbon stock in semi-arid part of Rajasthan, India. Landsat temporal satellite data of Pushkar valley region of Rajasthan acquired on 1993, 2003, and 2014 were analyzed to assess land use change. Internal trading of land use was depicted through matrices. Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock was calculated for soil to a depth of 30 cm in each land use type in 2014 using field data collection. The SOC stock for previous years was estimated using stock change factor. The effect of land use change on SOC stock was determined by calculating change in SOC stock (t/ha) by deducting the base-year SOC stock from the final year stock of a particular land use conversion. Results: The total area under agricultural lands was increased by 32.14% while that under forest was decreased by 23.14% during the time period of 1993–2014. Overall land use change shows that in both the periods (1993–2003 and 2003–2014), 7% of forest area was converted to agricultural land and about 15% changes occurred among agricultural land. In 1993–2003, changes among agricultural land led to maximum loss of soil carbon, i.e., 4.88 Mt C and during 2003–2014, conversion of forest to agricultural land led to loss in 3.16 Mt C. Conclusion: There was a continuous decrease in forest area and increase in cultivated area in each time period. Land use change led to alteration in carbon equity in soil due to change or loss in vegetation. Overall, we can conclude that the internal trading of land use area during the 10-year period (1993–2003) led to net loss of SOC stock by 8.29 Mt C. Similarly, land use change during 11-year period (2003–2014) caused net loss of SOC by 2.76 Mt C. Efforts should be made to implement proper land use management practices to enhance the SOC content. © 2019, The Author(s).","Change in SOC pool; Internal trading of land use; Land use change dynamics; Land use management; Multitemporal satellite data; SOC stock; Stock change factor","Arid regions; Commerce; Forestry; Organic carbon; Satellites; Soils; Change in SOC pool; Land-use change dynamics; Land-use management; Multitemporal satellites; Stock change factor; Land use; carbon emission; land use change; Landsat; satellite data; semiarid region; soil carbon; India; Rajasthan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074811111

A three-dimensional dynamic mesh model coupled with a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism of n-butanol oxidation were established to investigate the engine combustion process in CFD software CONVERGE. And the numerical model was validated through experiments. The performance of pressure and temperature inside cylinder, HC and CO emissions and formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions with four hydrogen fractions were simulated and analyzed. The simulation results showed that in comparison with pure n-butanol, the peak cylinder pressure increased 18.62%, 22.86% and 25.41% at φH2 = 5%, φH2 = 10% and φH2 = 15%, respectively. Meanwhile, the process of heat release can be accelerated and concentrated by hydrogen blending. The HC and CO emissions decreased gradually with the increase of hydrogen fraction. The largest magnitude of reduced HC and CO emissions was at φH2 = 5% as 31.31% and 19.05%, respectively. In terms of unregulated emissions, the acetaldehyde emissions remained a higher level than formaldehyde emissions for all hydrogen fractions at idle condition, and both decreased with the increase of hydrogen fraction. The distribution of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentration were closely related to the temperature field inside cylinder. The improvement of acetaldehyde emissions affected by adding hydrogen was more significant than that of formaldehyde emissions. Through hydrogen direct injection, a local hydrogen-enriched area near the spark plug can be formed, which contributed to better combustion performance of n-butanol engine at idle condition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde; Hydrogen direct injection; Idling condition; N-butanol engine; Numerical simulation","Acetaldehyde; Blending; Combustion; Computer simulation; Direct injection; Engines; Formaldehyde; Numerical models; Combustion performance; Detailed chemical kinetic; Engine combustion process; Idling condition; N-butanol; Peak cylinder pressures; Pressure and temperature; Three-dimensional dynamics; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071887639

After entering the karst area, the chemical weathering of carbonate rocks would be accelerated and the karst carbon sink flux would be increased. Yufuhe River Basin, located in Ji’nan, Northern China, was selected to clarify the mechanism of the karst carbon sink and its flux under the influence of AW; both the surface water and groundwater were detected in situ and their hydrochemical characteristics were analyzed in the laboratory. To estimate the influence of AW on the karst carbon sink exactly, a modified Galy model was adopted. The results showed that the hydrochemical type of Yufuhe River Basin is HCO3·SO4–Ca, and its ions were derived mainly from carbonate rock and less from silicate rock. Water saturation model demonstrated that AW became saturated after they mixed with the karst water (KW) as indicated by dolomite saturation index (SId) and calcite saturation index (SIc). The dissolution capacity of KW and karst carbon sink flux was then enhanced. The estimation showed that the weathering rate of silicate rocks is 8.06 mm/ka, and the weathering rate of carbonate rocks is 18.51 mm/ka. When AW mixed with KW, the dissolution rate of carbonate erosion rate increased to 20.12 mm/ka. There was also a significant promoting effect of AW on the karst carbon sink. The CO2 sink rate of metamorphic rock (gneiss-dominated area) in the upper reaches of the basin is 3.87 t/km2a. In the karst area, the average CO2 sink rate of the KW is 7.51 t/km2a, while the value became 13.03 t/km2a when it mixed with AW, nearly doubled compared with KW. Based on the above analysis, the annual CO2 consumption of Yufuhe River Basin is 5500 t, contributing to an important approach of the regional CO2 sink. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Allogenic water; CO2 consumption; Karst carbon sink; Karst water","calcite; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; chemical weathering; groundwater; karst; surface water; water chemistry; China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073787580

In this study, we used a mobile monitoring approach to study the spatial-temporal variability of air and noise pollution in urban neighborhoods of Philadelphia. During summer 2017, we used portable instruments to measure PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and noise levels along 5 km paths in four residential neighborhoods (Tioga, Mill Creek, Chestnut Hill, and Northern Liberties) and one commercial district (Center City) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. A total of 62 sets of measurements were made at three different times of day (during morning rush hour, mid-afternoon, and during afternoon rush hour) from June 5 to July 7, 2017. Spatially, there was a significant difference in PM2.5 concentrations among the four residential neighborhoods. Overall, the Chestnut Hill neighborhood had the highest PM2.5 concentrations (13.25 ± 6.89 μg/m3), followed by Tioga (9.58 ± 4.83 μg/m3), Northern Liberties (7.02 ± 4.17 μg/m3), and Mill Creek (3.9 ± 4.5 μg/m3). There was temporal variability of pollutants depending on the neighborhood; Northern Liberties demonstrated the highest temporal variability in these data. The highest PM2.5 (18.86 ± 3.17 μg/m3) was measured in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood during morning rush hour. Mean PM2.5, BC, and noise levels based on mobile measurements at Philadelphia during summer 2017 were 8.41 ± 4.31 μg/m3, 0.99 ± 0.44 μg C/m3, and 62.01 ± 3.20 dBA, respectively. Environmental noise showed the highest temporal variation of the monitored components for 3 time periods.

A bi-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is represented for modeling the behavior of each producer. The upper level deals with profit maximization of each strategic unit and the lower level encompasses social welfare maximization. This is the first objective of the presented model. Power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs) are employed to model transmission constraints. The proposed bi-level problem is converted to a traceable mixed integer linear programming problem using duality theory and Karush-Kahn-Tucker (KKT) optimization conditions. Simultaneous solution of all MPECs forms an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). Solving the resulting EPEC using diagonalization algorithm and game theory, a market Nash equilibrium is obtained. Another goal is to solve the bi-level problem in a bi-objective way using the augmented epsilon constraint method, which maximizes the profit and minimizes the emissions of virtual power plant units. The proposed model is tested on a standard IEEE-24 bus system and the results indicate that, at the equilibrium point, the profit of a virtual power plant and GenCo will be less than in the initial state. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy market; Market equilibrium; Optimal bidding; Regulation; Virtual power plant","Commerce; Energy transfer; Integer programming; Power markets; Profitability; Energy markets; Market equilibria; Optimal bidding; Regulation; Virtual power plants; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065865792

Recently, it has become a crucial issue due to the rapid increasing amount of waste, along with the increasingly national population in Indonesia. The goal of waste management is as a material recovery (MR), as an energy recovery (ER) and minimizing the environment impact. The plasma gasification modeling was developed based on plasma torch technology to estimate the syngas composition and energy potential. The process simulation is optimized for mixed steam and air as a gasifying agent. This study is to obtain the essential parameter to have the better content of H2 in the syngas, better plant efficiency and lowest CO2 emission for developing urban built environment with lesser greenhouse gases (GHG).

Here, we present organic carbon (C) storage in VCE across Australian climate regions and estimate potential annual CO2 emission benefits of VCE conservation and restoration. Australia contributes 5–11% of the C stored in VCE globally (70–185 Tg C in aboveground biomass, and 1,055–1,540 Tg C in the upper 1 m of soils). Potential CO2 emissions from current VCE losses are estimated at 2.1–3.1 Tg CO2-e yr-1, increasing annual CO2 emissions from land use change in Australia by 12–21%. This assessment, the most comprehensive for any nation to-date, demonstrates the potential of conservation and restoration of VCE to underpin national policy development for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon; Australia; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; wetland; Australia; Carbon; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072847917

However, GHG savings are not realised until the avoided fossil emissions offset the loss of atmospheric carbon (C) that would have been sequestered if the biomass was not used for bioenergy (i.e. time to C sequestration parity). We estimated the potential for mitigating GHG emissions and the timing of these atmospheric benefits when substituting conventional natural gas (NG) with renewable natural gas (RNG) produced from different forestry feedstocks within three Canadian provinces, and assessed the uncertainty among these estimates. We calculated the GHG balance of RNG using the alternative fate of biomass and the use of NG as base-case scenarios. Immediate to long-term time to C sequestration parity was typically in the order of residues burned &lt; mill residues &lt; harvest residues decaying on site &lt; salvaged trees. The potential GHG savings from using harvest and mill residues to produce RNG within the three provinces ranged from 52.4 to 77.8 Mt CO2eq a−1. Sensitivity analyses suggest that time to C sequestration parity in the best-case scenarios relative to the baseline can be reduced up to 17 years by using harvest residues that decay rapidly (based on feedstock species, size and geographic region), and reduced up to 8 years by improving the efficiency of the thermochemical conversion process. These two considerations are key for ensuring significant GHG reductions from RNG use within a timescale that helps Canada meet its GHG mitigation targets. © 2019","Bioenergy; Carbon sequestration parity time; GHG mitigation; Renewable natural gas; Thermochemical conversion; Wood residues","Biomass; Climate change; Feedstocks; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Harvesting; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Bio-energy; Carbon sequestration; GHG mitigation; Thermochemical Conversion; Wood residues; Greenhouse gases; bioenergy; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission control; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; liquefied natural gas; natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074133106

Food-provisioning can alter the natural behavior of an animal, encouraging adverse behavior (e.g. begging for food handouts), and affect the reproductive success and the viability of a population. Studies linking food-provisioning to reproductive success are limited due to the lack of long-term datasets available, especially for long-lived species such as marine mammals. In Bunbury, Western Australia, a state-licensed food-provisioning program offers fish handouts to a limited number of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). Coupled with long-term historical data, this small (&lt;200 individuals), resident dolphin population has been extensively studied for over ten years, offering an opportunity to examine the effect of food-provisioning on the reproductive success of females (ntotal = 63; nprovisioned females = 8). Female reproductive success was estimated as the number of weaned calves produced per reproductive years and calf survival at year one and three years old was investigated. The mean reproductive success of provisioned and non-provisioned females was compared using Bayes factor. We also used generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine female reproductive success in relation to the occurrence of food-provisioning, begging behavior and location (within the study area). Furthermore, we examined the influence of these variables and birth order and climatic fluctuations (e.g. El Niño Southern Oscillation) on calf survival. Bayes factor analyses (Bayes factor = 6.12) and results from the best fitting GLMs showed that female reproductive success and calf survival were negatively influenced by food-provisioning. The negative effects of food-provisioning, although only affecting a small proportion of the adult females’ population (13.2%), are of concern, especially given previous work showing that this population is declining. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; birth order; bottlenose dolphin; calf (mammal); controlled study; El Nino; factor analysis; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; nonhuman; reproductive success; resident; Western Australia; animal; animal food; leisure; male; reproduction; sex factor; survival rate; wild animal; Animal Feed; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bottle-Nosed Dolphin; Female; Humans; Leisure Activities; Male; Reproduction; Sex Factors; Survival Rate; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067628311

Although engines have become significantly cleaner and more efficient over the last few decades, human health and environmental concerns have led several governments around the world to propose bans on diesel and gasoline cars. The electrification of transportation, while often touted as the only way to mitigate vehicle emissions, comes with its own set of concerns and challenges that must be considered when developing future transportation technologies. Furthermore, there is still significant untapped potential in both ICE concepts and the fuels they use. This paper argues that hybrid systems are the fastest way to reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles and that, when judged on a life-cycle basis, the vehicle technology with the least environmental and health impact is highly region dependent. Therefore, a mixture of transportation technologies is necessary in the future fleet. It is hoped that the recommendations provided in this paper will prompt policymakers to set targets for emission reduction instead of implementing bans on specific technologies, so industry can focus on developing the best solutions for each situation. © 2019 The Author(s)",,"Artificial life; Emission control; Environmental technology; Hybrid systems; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Vehicles; Emission reduction; Environmental concerns; Health impact; Policy makers; Propulsion technology; Transportation technology; Vehicle emission; Vehicle technology; Fleet operations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075198691

One of the most recent trends in global development is the transition to ""green"" growth. Morocco is keeping pace with its growth by promising to increase renewable energy capacity to 42% of total installed capacity by 2020 and to 52% by 2030. This study develops a framework that aims to determine the optimal areas for deploying photovoltaic (PV) installation in two stages. The first stage aims at excluding the undesirable areas such as forests, rivers and agricultural land. The second stage consists in defining the suitability of sites based on seven criteria; solar irradiation, land surface temperature, slopes, slope orientation, distance from power lines, distance from main roads, distance of urban area. In this study we are using fuzzy logic and fuzzy membership functions in order to create criteria layers in the environment of Geographic Information System (GIS) that allowing the integration of a Multi-Criterion Decision Analysis (MCDA) to identify the best sites to deploy PV solar power plants in north-western Morocco. Also, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique is used to determine weights for each one of the criteria. Results obtained from the spatial approach shows that the major portion of the studied area was judged inappropriate for solar farms installations. Also, it shows that only 5.11% (8500 Ha) of the territory demonstrate high suitability for PV solar installations located in the southern part of our studied area with a potential of electricity generation, from the areas with high suitability level, assuming a PV system efficiency of 6.48%; equivalent to 5.39 Twh/year with an installed capacity of 4.02 GW and an annual carbon emission reduction of 3 697.54 Kt-CO2/year. The resulting suitability map can be used as a decision support tool to help the public policy makers to integrate green energy into their policies. © 2020 Authors.","Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process; Geographic information system; Installation capacity; Multi-Criterion Decision Analysis; Northwestern Morocco; Photovoltaic potential; Renewable energy; Solar photovoltaic power plants","Analytic hierarchy process; Atmospheric temperature; Decision making; Decision support systems; Emission control; Energy policy; Fuzzy logic; Information systems; Information use; Installation; Land surface temperature; Membership functions; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Urban growth; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Installation capacities; Multi-Criterion; Northwestern Morocco; Photovoltaic potentials; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaic power plants; Geographic information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081600290

While traditional strategies for dealing with coastal hazards have often involved the hardening or armoring of shorelines, more recent research and practice have demonstrated the value and cost-effectiveness of ""living shorelines"" and other ecosystem-based strategies for coastal protection. To explore potential relationships among geographic exposure (waterfront vs. inland), shoreline condition (armored vs. natural), and hazard concerns, we surveyed 583 waterfront and inland residents in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We found that overall concern for coastal hazards was similar across waterfront and inland residents, as well as among residents with both armored and natural shorelines. However, concern for specific hazards differed across these groups. Waterfront residents were significantly more concerned about major hurricanes and erosion than inland residents. Conversely, inland residents were more concerned with drought and flooding than waterfront residents. Among waterfront residents, specific hazard concerns were similar between residents with natural and armored shorelines with two key exceptions. Residents with armored shorelines reported higher concern for erosion and sea level rise than residents with natural shorelines. Our results suggest that armored shorelines do not necessarily alleviate concerns about coastal hazards. In the context of balancing social and ecological objectives in addressing coastal hazards or adapting to climate change, understanding the perceptions and behaviors of coastal residents is essential for conserving and protecting coastal ecosystems along residential shorelines. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate adaptation; Coastal hazards; Coastal management; Hurricanes; Stakeholder decision-making","climate change; coastal erosion; drought stress; flooding; hazard management; perception; sea level change; shoreline; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076704784

The argument rests on the observation that mitigation is a public good while adaptation is a private one. We show that the more one teases out the public good nature of mitigation, the lower will be the incentives to invest in the private good adaptation while it increases a policy maker’s incentives to invest in the public good mitigation.

It is a critical input to greenhouse gas accounting, estimation of carbon losses and forest degradation, assessment of renewable energy potential, and for developing climate change mitigation policies such as REDD+, among others. Wall-to-wall mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB) is now possible with satellite remote sensing (RS). However, RS methods require extant, up-to-date, reliable, representative and comparable in situ data for calibration and validation. Here, we present the Forest Observation System (FOS) initiative, an international cooperation to establish and maintain a global in situ forest biomass database. AGB and canopy height estimates with their associated uncertainties are derived at a 0.25 ha scale from field measurements made in permanent research plots across the world’s forests. All plot estimates are geolocated and have a size that allows for direct comparison with many RS measurements. The FOS offers the potential to improve the accuracy of RS-based biomass products while developing new synergies between the RS and ground-based ecosystem research communities. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"biomass; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; procedures; remote sensing; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Remote Sensing Technology",Data Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073114444

The present study examined the effects of the structural characteristics of NC, such as electrical conductivity and surface area, more precisely without altering the other structural features of NC. A carbothermal reduction of ZCC allowed the production of hierarchically porous NC with a low sheet resistance of 0.432 kΩ □−1 without any post-treatment with Zn nanorods as a valuable byproduct. The resulting NC exhibited ultra-high stability and rate capability, i.e., 100% stability after 200,000 cycles up to 300 A g−1 with a high capacitance of 229 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The 288% increase in surface area with a similar % contribution from micro and mesopores and similar electrical conductivity increased the electrochemical charge storage capacity of NC by 266%. Similarly, NC materials possessing a similar surface area but a large difference in electrical conductivity resulted in a 1539% difference in charge storage capacity. Enhancement of both the surface area and electrical conductivity improved the capacitance of NC drastically to 4098% higher than the base product. A prototype flexible solid-state supercapacitor fabricated from the obtained NC delivered a very high areal capacitance of 363.6 mF cm−2 (at 0.5 mA cm−2) with ultra-high stability (82%) even after 70,000 cycles (at 25 mA cm−2). © 2019","Areal capacitance; Carbothermal reduction; Flexible supercapacitor; Solid-state device; Symmetric supercapacitor; Zinc aniline nitrate complex","Aniline; Capacitance; Carbon; Doping (additives); Electric conductivity; II-VI semiconductors; Nanorods; Nitrates; Oxide minerals; Scalability; Solid state devices; Storage (materials); Supercapacitor; Zinc oxide; Carbothermal process; Charge storage capacity; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical charge; Hierarchically porous; Nitrate complexes; Structural characteristics; Structural feature; Carbothermal reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068527247

As a result, finding management practices to restore the sustainable ecological status of Urmia Lake, the world’s second largest hyper-saline lake, is imperative. In this study, the sustainability of different plans under climate change was assessed using system dynamics. The plans were evaluated with respect to sustainability criteria including reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability measures. According to the results due to different management practices, on average, water consumption should be reduced by at least 30% to restore the lake. The results revealed that only hybrid plans which incorporate multiple management practices, instead of focusing on just one approach, can be influential. Among the hybrid plans, that of increasing irrigation efficiency, reducing cultivated area, changing crop pattern, and inter-basin water transfer was identified as the most sustainable plan. About eight years after applying this plan, the lake will achieve its ecological level and will remain sustainable. Considering comprehensive factors, the proposed model can help watershed managers to take the necessary measures to restore this vital ecosystem. The results of this study can be applied to water resources systems with the same problem, especially those in semi-arid regions with multidisciplinary aspects. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Climate change; Environmental management; Modeling; System dynamics; Urmia Lake","Ecology; Environmental management; Lakes; Models; Restoration; Sustainable development; System theory; Water management; Inter-basin water transfer; Irrigation efficiency; Management practices; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability criteria; System Dynamics; Water resources systems; Watershed managers; Climate change; climate change; environmental restoration; management practice; modeling; sustainability; Iran; Lake Urmia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078062897

Existing regulations have not been able to increase the participation of Public Health Centers (PHCs) as first-level services to reduce problems that will arise due to the climate. The purpose of this paper is to see the extent of adaptation by PHCs to deal with climate change. This research was carried out by observing the indicators of the adaptation of the PHCs, in-depth interviews and review of related documents in three PHCs. The finding indicates that adaptation activities that need to be improved by PHCs are early warning systems about drought risk, collaboration with institutions concerned with climate change, and participation in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by using a pro-environment transportation system. In conclusion, the adaptation systems of PHCs have begun to be good, but there is no special attention to the risk of climate change that will be increasing in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public health; Adaptation systems; Drought risks; Early Warning System; Health centers; Health systems; In-depth interviews; Public health services; Transportation system; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078313628

In order to encourage innovative adaptation practices, it is critical to understand the farmers’ perspectives on the possibility of adopting climate-smart agriculture (CSA) measures and the obstacles they face. However, limited studies have considered how farmers respond to climate change impacts, and concerning to this, the opportunities in the relevance of resilience via adaptive capacity (AC) were addressed. This study investigates the adoption of climate-smart agriculture in Punjab, Pakistan by using a survey of 420 farmers, with a view to understanding the farmers’ practices, adaptive capacity to respond, and willingness for the adoption of climate-smart agriculture measures to mitigate the climate change impact. Driving factors of the farm households’ intended to the adoption of climate-smart agriculture were examined using a logistic model. The results of the study showed that the drivers of adaptive capacity such as the human, physical, natural, financial and social capacity of the farm households were significantly determinant to the possibility of adopting climate-smart agriculture measures. Further, we also identified lack of institutional support and a lack of information were the major obstacles for adopting these innovative measures. This study suggested that climate-policy should be designed in a regional context specifically focusing on the institutional services and access to the resources. It is the best way to increase the acceptance for the adoption of these innovative measures by increasing the farmers’ adaptive capacity endowment. © 2019, Centenary University.

To date, up to 50% of the world’s saltmarshes have been lost or severely degraded primarily due to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F(1,14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F(1,42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F(1,20) = 27.3, p &lt; 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p &lt; 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes. Our restored and natural saltmarsh soils store at 30 cm depth similar levels of organic carbon: 47.9 Mg OC ha−1 to 64.6 Mg OC ha−1. Conservation of urban saltmarshes could be important for ‘blue carbon’ programmes aimed at mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","210Pb dating; blue carbon; carbon sequestration; microbial communities; rehabilitation; Sarcocornia quinqueflora; Sydney Olympic Park","anthropogenic effect; bacterium; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; habitat type; microbial activity; microbial community; national park; restoration ecology; rhizosphere; saltmarsh; shrub; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]; Desulfuromonas; Geobacter; Proteobacteria; Sarcocornia quinqueflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072024527

This study evaluated landscape capacity of providing multiple key ESs in a tropical coastal ecosystem (Sundarbans Biodiversity Region (SBR)India). Multiple supervised machine learning algorithms were utilized to classify the regions into several landscape zones. The provisioning capacities of ESs for each landscape type were derived separately from an expert opinion survey and the remote sensing based methods, and the association of the outcomes between these two approaches was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient test. A total of nine ESs were selected to quantify their economic values for several reference years. The benefit transfer and equivalent value coefficient approaches were used to aggregate the economic values for each ES. Research results indicated that the water bodies are the most important landscape units in the SBR region. This ecosystem has the highest relevant capacity to provide the necessary regulatory, supporting, provisioning, and cultural ESs. Water regulation (WR), waste treatment (WT), aesthetic, recreation, and cultural (ARC), and climate regulation (CR) are the main ESs of the SBR. These services are immensely important not only for upgrading the livelihood status of coastal communities but also for the climatic and environmental suitability of the Kolkata urban region. The correlation results between the remote sensing and expert-based capacity estimates have suggested that the proposed remote sensing approach could be an alternative to evaluate the landscape capacity of providing multiple ESs in any given ecosystem. Except for the mangrove region, a very high (>0.7) correlation was observed between the model and expert-derived capacity values. The outcome of this study could be an important reference to the land administrators, planners, decision makers for adopting suitable land resource management plans for sustainable uses of natural resources in coastal region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Climate regulation; Coastal management; Ecosystem services; Gas regulation; Landscape","Biodiversity; Correlation methods; Decision making; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural resources management; Remote sensing; Resource allocation; Supervised learning; Waste treatment; Climate regulation; Coastal management; Ecosystem services; Gas regulations; Landscape; Ecosystems; biodiversity; coastal zone management; ecosystem service; landscape; livelihood; machine learning; regulatory framework; remote sensing; service provision; sustainability; waste treatment; India; Sundarbans National Park; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070930058

Although latitudinal and thermal gradients in growth patterns have been widely investigated, changes in these patterns along longitudinal gradients due to the different timing and severity of regional droughts are less studied. Here, we investigated these responses in Mediterranean Black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.). We built a tree-ring width dataset comprising 77 forests (1202 trees) across the Mediterranean Basin. The biogeographical patterns in growth patterns and the relationships between growth and mean temperature, precipitation, drought and atmospheric circulations patterns (NAO -North Atlantic Oscillation-, SOI -Southern Oscillation Index- and MOI -Mediterranean Oscillation index-) were analyzed. Then, we evaluated the spatial and temporal growth synchrony between and within east and west populations. We found different growth and climate patterns in west vs. east Black pine populations, although in both regions growth was driven by similar temperature and precipitation variables. MOI significantly influenced tree growth, whilst NAO and SOI showed weaker effects. Growth of east and west Black pine populations desynchronized after the 1970s when several and uncoupled regional droughts occurred across the Mediterranean Basin. We detected a climate shift from the 1970s to the 1980s affecting growth patterns, changing growth-climate relationships, and reducing forest growth from west to east Black pine forests. Afterwards, climate and growth of east and west populations became increasingly more divergent. Our findings imply that integral bioclimatic and biogeographical analyses across the species distribution area must be considered to adequately assess the impact of climate change on tree growth under warming and more arid conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeography; Dendroecology; Pinus nigra; Species distribution; Tree rings","Atmospheric pressure; Drought; Ecology; Forestry; Population distribution; Population statistics; Biogeography; Dendroecology; Pinus nigra; Species distributions; Tree rings; Climate change; biogeography; climate change; climate effect; coniferous tree; dendroecology; drought; evergreen tree; growth rate; spatial distribution; tree ring; warming; article; biogeography; climate warming; dendrochronology; drought; El Nino; forest; nonhuman; North Atlantic oscillation; pine; precipitation; species distribution; tree growth; cellular, subcellular and molecular biological phenomena and functions; climate change; physiology; pine; Southern Europe; Mediterranean Region; Pinus nigra; Biological Phenomena; Climate Change; Droughts; Forests; Mediterranean Region; Pinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071492504

This objective is premised on the arguments that: (1) there is a general lack of analysis of energy-related CO2 emissions growth across ASEAN countries; and (2) such an analysis is critical, because it could enable an assessment to be made of the efficacy of existing energy policies for reducing emissions. Decomposition analysis is the main approach adopted in this paper. The findings of this paper suggest that the growth of energy-related CO2 emissions has slowed in some major emitters in the region, due to energy efficiency improvement, and, to a lesser extent, a gradual switch in energy fuel mix towards lower emission sources (gas and renewables). However, this improvement is unlikely to drive a major transformation in the energy sectors of the region to the extent considered adequate for redressing the challenge of rising emissions, as indicated by a steady emissions growth in most ASEAN countries over the entire study period (1971–2016). By implication, this suggests that a significant scale-up of existing policy effort is needed to rectify the situations. © 2019 by the authors.","ASEAN countries; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; Indonesia; Malaysia; Thailand","Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Public policy; ASEAN countries; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; Indonesia; Malaysia; Thailand; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076811096

Wind and photovoltaic power generation is intermittent due to weather conditions. Therefore, remarkable centrality is given to the storage of the electric excess of production, and Power-to-Gas (P2G) systems seem to be one of the most promising technologies to achieve this purpose. In the case analysed in this research, a high temperature electrolyser based on solid oxide cells technology was considered, coupled to catalytic reactors for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into methane. The product is a synthetic natural gas (SNG) which could by directly injected into the natural gas distribution network. This work investigates the coupling between a completely RES-based electric profile in a future scenario and a P2G plant to perform a comprehensive technical, managemental and economic assessment of the system. A P2G model was built on MATLAB environment to examine the P2G plant behaviour when it was coupled with the RES-based intermittent electric profile. Firstly, the P2G plant arrangement has been discussed by varying the P2G plant capacity which has been coupled to the electric profile; the P2G capacity was then selected based on the levelized cost of product (LCOP). Secondly, the electrochemical storage has been introduced to perform a continuing operation also when excess of electricity is not available, thanks to the storage of electric energy. Finally, chemical storage tanks of hydrogen (feed for the methanation) and steam (feed for the electrolyser) were considered to reduce the number of shutdowns of the P2G plant. An assessment of the long-term gas storage in the gas distribution network was additionally performed. An optimal plant capacity with respect to the investigated scenario of local electric residual profile was sized, being equal to 7 MW, with a recovery equal to 70% of the total available electric energy from the grid. Moreover, the P2G system could be economically competitive, because the LCOP varies between 60.2 €/MWh and 224.9 €/MWh (LHV basis), which suits with current levelized natural gas prices. The overall efficiency of the plant reached around 77%, with a plant utilization factor of about 30%. The accumulators and the electrolyser are the most expensive technologies, and the LCOP strongly depends on their size (if the batteries are considered). For this scenario, the SNG yearly productivity reached a value of 18.5 GWh/y (LHV basis): in the hypothesis of using SNG to repower the electric grid (efficiency 45%), such a P2G plant could compensate the 29.6% of the amount of deficit energy, with a consequent reduction in CO2 associated emissions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 methanation; Electrochemical storage; Hydrogen storage; Power-to-Gas; RES-based intermittent scenario; SNG cost; Solid oxide cells","Carbon dioxide; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Gases; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Natural gas; Natural gas substitutes; Natural gasoline plants; Photovoltaic cells; Plant shutdowns; Regenerative fuel cells; Solar energy; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Chemical storage tanks; Electrochemical storage; Gas distribution network; Photovoltaic power generation; Plant utilization factors; Renewable energy source; Solid-oxide cells; Synthetic natural gas; Electric power system economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055744483

Among them, the Mississippi-Valley type deposits and related oil fields often comprise large-scale hydrothermal systems where regional host rocks are stained with disseminated liquid petroleum (crude oil) and other organic compounds. Current models for the formation of those epigenetic Pb-Zn sulphide deposits consider that metals are mostly leached from basement rocks and their detrital erosional products, and transported by oxidized basinal hydrothermal fluids as chloride complexes. Sulphide precipitation mainly occurs when these basinal brines interact with fluids rich in reduced sulphur species produced mostly by thermochemical sulphate reduction (TSR) mediated by hydrocarbons. Here, using organic geochemistry and Pb isotopes, we provide evidence that petroleum and associated water were key for the formation of sulphide mineralization in the world-class sandstone-hosted ore deposit at Laisvall, not only by supplying reduced sulphur but also by contributing metals in significant amounts. The lead originally found in bitumen of the Alum Shale Formation was transported —during an arc-continent collisional event— by liquid petroleum and associated water to the site of sulphide mineralization. The alteration of petroleum by TSR made lead available for precipitation as sulphide. The petroleum-associated lead represents 40 to 60% of the metal budget in the deposit, the remainder being sourced by leaching of basement rocks. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066605437

Kilimanjaro and its implications on water, food and energy production (WFE nexus). While there exist divided scholarly opinions on the impacts of climate change on the Mt. Kilimanjaro glacier, consistent decreases in precipitation amounts are evident throughout the existing literature. The 2050 projections indicate increases in the precipitation amounts by approximately 16–18%. However, it is also stated that there will be a concomitant increase in water deficit of about 71%, 27% and 1% in agriculture, hydropower and livestock production respectively. Despite a large number of researches on impacts of climate and anthropogenic pressure on WFE along Mt. Kilimanjaro slopes, there are still limited long-term, good-quality and high-resolution altitudinal precipitation, temperature records and observation network. Moreover, there is limited information on groundwater recharge areas and their stability under changing environment. It is not clear how the interdependence and interaction between climate change, irrigation, vegetation and river discharges affect groundwater recharge process. Also, there is scarce information on future land use/cover changes. Very limited studies focused on fog water deposition for Mt. Kilimanjaro forest and East Africa, despite its relevance as the water tower of the mountain streams. The review further highlights how both climate and anthropogenic impacts may affect ecosystem services in the region. There is a need for developing adaptive strategies for responding to climate change and anthropogenic impacts on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro now and into the future. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anthropogenic activities; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Kilimanjaro; Land use change",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074839113

This trend raised sustainable consumption issues because of inefficient and wasteful use of resources, especially in resource-rich countries with high purchasing power and subsidized tariffs offered to residents. It is also well-known that resources abundance tends to lower financial development and limit productivity growth and social development. On the other hand, there is a growing acceptance that supply-side policies need to be complemented by demand-side management to support sustainable cleaner production and remedy aforementioned adverse impacts. In this study, we present the results of an investigation on demand-side management (DSM) opportunities and a framework developed for Qatar as a representative of an emerging resource-rich countries and discuss implications for cleaner production. The rationale behind is that Qatar is a commodity-dependent developing country, who, during the last five years, has experienced a population growth of 35%, and an increase in electricity and water demand of 46% and 35%, respectively. Similarly, during the same period, the national vehicle fleet has grown by more than twofold. These figures have ranked Qatar at the top of the per-capita energy, carbon, and water consumption list in the world and increased environmental vulnerability and reduced climate resilience. To that end, the objectives of this study are to: (1) construct a DSM framework tailored to the needs of resource-rich country like Qatar from economic, social, environmental, and technical aspects; (2) present, analyze, and discuss the results of a survey that reveals the perceptions, attitudes, and responses of local residents towards the applicability of DSM policies; and (3) discuss methods and solutions to achieve cleaner energy consumption. The conducted survey covered electricity, water, and transportation sectors and showed that residents have low awareness about their consumption habits, but they have high willingness to reduce their consumption levels. In the last section, we present the survey results and discussions as a reference for policy-makers to promote the most promising DSM options in Qatar. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first survey-based study conducted in the Gulf Cooperation Council region where a significant portion of world's oil and natural gas resources are extracted. Therefore, the results could provide insights to other resource-rich countries with similar characteristics to devise more efficient policies for promoting welfare-enhancing and sustainable consumption behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Demand side management framework; Resource-rich countries; Survey; Sustainable consumption behaviors","Commerce; Demand side management; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Natural gas; Petroleum deposits; Pollution control; Population statistics; Productivity; Surveying; Surveys; Sustainable development; Cleaner production; Environmental resources; Environmental vulnerability; Financial development; Gulf Cooperation Council; Production and transportations; Resource-Rich; Sustainable consumption; Natural gas deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072155081

To execute HMR management by risk assessment, many models and tools, ranging from conceptual to sophisticated/numerical methods are currently in use. However, there is still a gap in systematically classifying and documenting them in the field of disaster risk management. This paper discusses various methods used for HMR assessment and its management via potential nature-based solutions (NBS), which are actually lessons learnt from nature. We focused on three hydro-meteorological hazards (HMHs), floods, droughts and heatwaves, and their management by relevant NBS. Different methodologies related to the chosen HMHs are considered with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation interaction of the elements at risk. Two widely used methods for flood risk assessment are fuzzy logic (e.g. fuzzy analytic hierarchy process) and probabilistic methodology (e.g. univariate and multivariate probability distributions). Different kinds of indices have been described in the literature to define drought risk, depending upon the type of drought and the purpose of evaluation. For heatwave risk estimation, mapping of the vulnerable property and population-based on geographical information system is a widely used methodology in addition to a number of computational, mathematical and statistical methods, such as principal component analysis, extreme value theorem, functional data analysis, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and meta-analysis. NBS (blue, green and hybrid infrastructures) are promoted for HMR management. For example, marshes and wetlands in place of dams for flood and drought risk reduction, and green infrastructure for urban cooling and combating heatwaves, are potential NBS. More research is needed into risk assessment and management through NBS, to enhance its wider significance for sustainable living, building adaptations and resilience. © 2019 The Authors","Disaster; Drought; Exposure; Flood; Hazard; Heatwaves; Vulnerability","Disasters; Drought; Floods; Fuzzy logic; Hazards; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Probability distributions; Risk management; Risk perception; Wetlands; Exposure; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Heatwaves; Multivariate probability distributions; Probabilistic methodology; Risk assessment and managements; Technical countermeasures; Vulnerability; Risk assessment; disaster management; drought; flooding; hazard management; heat wave; hydrometeorology; natural hazard; risk assessment; vulnerability; controlled study; cooling; data analysis; disaster; drought; flooding; fuzzy logic; geographic information system; human; marsh; meta analysis; principal component analysis; probability; review; risk assessment; risk management; risk reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071398561

In young women treated for breast cancer, these treatments include tamoxifen, anti-aromatase and LH-RH analogues, with even more side effects when these treatments are combined, especially for younger patients with more aggressive disease. The management of the potential side effects requires first of all detailed and precise information at initiation of treatment, and preventive measures including patient education. Once the treatment has been initiated, clinicians should be able to propose to their patients appropriate measures to alleviate the potential of the side effects, which can be of various types: biological (dyslipidemia), physical (weight gain, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, sexual disorders with low libido, musculoskeletal symptoms…) or psychosocial (anxio-depressive disorders, poor body image, difficulties of professional reintegration). Management of these effects can combine various modalities: drugs (switching hormone therapy, anti-depressants, hormonal treatments of vaginal dryness in some cases, gabapentin), physical treatments (CO2 laser for vulvovaginal atrophy) or psycho-physical techniques (physical activity, mindfulness, acupuncture…). Eventually, the lenghth of these adjuvant hormonal treatments requires supportive measures to help young patients engage in new lifestyle measures, in particular in term of physical activity and diet.

Previously, we have demonstrated that these processes are affected by the gene products of the cidABC operon, the expression of which is controlled by the LysR-type transcriptional regulator, CidR. In this study, we characterized cis- and trans-acting elements essential for the induction of the cidABC operon. In addition to a CidR-binding site located within the cidABC promoter region, sequence analysis revealed the presence of a putative catabolite responsive element (cre box), suggestive of the involvement of the catabolite control protein A (CcpA) in the regulation of cidABC expression. This was confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR analysis demonstrating the direct positive control of cidABC transcription by the master regulator of carbon metabolism. Furthermore, the importance of CcpA and the identified cre site for the induction of the cidABC operon was demonstrated by examining the expression of PcidABC-lacZ reporter fusions in various mutant strains in which the genes involved in carbon metabolism and carbon catabolite repression were disrupted.

Compressed air-electrical hybrid system is a promising technology which can be used to reduce the environmental impact of the automotive industry. In cities and urban areas, vehicle's kinetic energy through braking can be converted to pressurized air which can be stored in a storage tank for reuse to operate the vehicle during starting, cruising, and acceleration. In this study, an efficient expander and compressor are developed using a Wankel device for the compressed air-electric hybrid vehicle. Volumetric Wankel rotary expander and compressor are essential devices for power generation in compressed air energy storage (CAES) system and compressed air hybrid engine powered by the braking energy system leading to a significant decrease in GHG emissions. Compared with conventional expanders and compressors, Wankel expander and compressor have significant advantages due to its compactness, lower vibration, noise, and cost. Different parametric studies have been carried out with different vehicle initial speeds (80, 60, 40) km/h and weights (500, 750, 1000) kg, various braking times (2, 3, 5, 7) s, and finally three different tank sizes (20, 35, 50) l using mathematical modelling MATLAB software. The maximum system energy-saving efficiency achieved was around 77% and instantaneous system efficiency of about 85% at an initial vehicle speed of 80 km/h, braking time of 3 s, and vehicle weight of 750 kg and compressed air tank of 35 l. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CAES; Hybrid vehicles; Thermal analysis; Wankel compressor and expander","Automotive industry; Compressed air; Compressed air energy storage; Compressors; Computer aided engineering; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; MATLAB; Pressure vessels; Tanks (containers); Thermoanalysis; Wankel engines; Air hybrid engines; Automotive applications; Compressed air energy storages (CAES); Electric hybrid vehicles; Matlab- software; Parametric study; System efficiency; Wankel compressor and expander; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074249109

This system is studied energetically, exergetically, economically and environmentally. The results show that the proposed system removes the supply problem of the chiller heat demand during the summer.

Here we investigate the effect of host star spectral energy distribution (SED) on the albedo of these surfaces using a one-dimensional energy balance model. Incorporating spectra of M-, K-, G-, and F-dwarf stars, we determined the effect of varying fractional and latitudinal distribution of land and ocean surfaces as a function of host star SED on the overall planetary albedo, climate, and ice-albedo feedback response. While noting that the spatial distribution of land masses on a given planet will have an effect on the overall planetary energy balance, we find that terrestrial planets with higher average land/ocean fractions are relatively cooler and have higher albedo regardless of star type. For Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, the increased absorption of water ice in the near-infrared, where M-dwarf stars emit much of their energy, resulted in warmer global mean surface temperatures, ice lines at higher latitudes, and increased climate stability as the ice-albedo feedback became negative at high land fractions. Conversely, planets covered largely by ocean, and especially those orbiting bright stars, had a considerably different energy balance due to the contrast between the reflective land and the absorptive ocean surface, which in turn resulted in warmer average surface temperatures than land-covered planets and a stronger potential ice-albedo feedback. While dependent on the properties of individual planetary systems, our results place some constraints on a range of climate states of terrestrial exoplanets based on albedo and incident flux. © 2019.

Allometric relationships between above-ground plant biomass and non-destructive measures of plant size, such as cover, volume or stem density are widely used in plant ecology. Such size-biomass allometry is often assumed to be invariant for a given plant species, plant functional group or ecosystem type. Allometric adjustment may be an important component of the short- or long-term response of plants to abiotic conditions. We used 18 years of size-biomass data describing of 85 plant species to investigate the sensitivity of allometry to precipitation, temperature or drought across two seasons and four ecosystems in central New Mexico, USA. Size-biomass allometry varied with climate in 65%–70% of plant species. Closely related plant species had similar sensitivities of allometry to natural spatiotemporal variation in precipitation, temperature or drought. Annuals were less sensitive than perennials, and forbs were less sensitive than grasses or shrubs. However, the differences associated with plant life history or functional group were not independent of plant evolutionary history, as supported by the application of phylogenetically independent contrasts. Our results demonstrate that many plant species adjust patterns in the partitioning of above-ground biomass under different climates and highlight the importance of long-term data for understanding functional differences among plant species.

Iran is one of the areas of the planet that has climate variability due to its geographical characteristics; therefore, consequently, its different regions are not immune to heat and cold waves. On the other hand, Iran's climate variability is the factor causing the difference between thresholds of heat and cold wave occurrence for its different regions. Therefore, in this study, based on three different thresholds, spatial analysis of the frequency of occurrence of heat and cold waves has been done. Thus in this work, using average daily data from 1960 to 2014, PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature) was used to monitor heat and cold waves of four stations in Iran. Results of this study showed that in the context of global warming, although significant differences in the frequency of cold waves cannot be seen, these changes are significant and increasing for the frequency of occurrence of heat waves of selected station. © 2019 Institute of Geophysics.

However, it also has tremendous challenges, which it must encounter in the medium term to promote pollution emission reduction and support strategies contributing to sustainable development. Therefore, in this study, we verified the state-of-the-art implementation of an interconnected photovoltaic system network and reviewed the current legislation for photovoltaic energy in Mexico. Besides, we performed an energy savings analysis for solar photovoltaic technology implementation on a large scale in urban and rural homes in Mexico by using the Geographic Information System. The results showed potential for energy savings with the use of an interconnected photovoltaic system network at a large-scale. Based on the information processed through 187,719 urban and 4,525 rural locations, it could be inferred that in Mexico, each household needs four photovoltaic panels on average to satisfy its energy requirements. Thus, even with implementation in homes alone, the country could achieve energy savings of an estimated 39,750 GWh, equivalent to 20.27 Tg of CO2 avoided emissions, i.e., 3% of the annual national emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Geographic information system; Households; Mexico; Photovoltaic systems; Solar potential","Developing countries; Emission control; Energy conservation; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Photovoltaic cells; Planning; Potential energy; Solar concentrators; Energy requirements; Households; Me-xico; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaic technology; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar photovoltaic technology; Solar potential; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072782348

In 2009, the countries of Norway and Guyana entered into one of the first bilateral REDD+ programs, with Norway offering to pay US$250 million to Guyana if annual deforestation rates remained below 0.056% from 2010 to 2015. To quantify the impact of this national REDD+ program, we construct a counterfactual times-series trajectory of annual tree cover loss using synthetic matching. This analytical approach allows us to quantify tree cover loss that would have occurred in the absence of the Norway-Guyana REDD+ program. We found that the Norway-Guyana REDD+ program reduced tree cover loss by 35% during the implementation period (2010 to 2015), equivalent to 12.8 million tons of avoided CO2 emissions. Our analysis indicates that national REDD+ payments attenuated the effect of increases in gold prices, an internationally traded commodity that is the primary deforestation driver in Guyana. Overall, we found strong evidence that the program met the additionality criteria of REDD+. However, we found that tree cover loss increased after the payments ended, and therefore, our results suggest that without continued payments, forest protection is not guaranteed. On the issue of leakage, which is complex and difficult to quantify, a multinational REDD+ program for a region could address leakage that results from differences in forest policies between neighboring countries. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

One of the complementary practices to sequester carbon in soils on decadal time scales is amending it with biochar, a carbon rich byproduct of biomass gasification. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is a widespread and close interplay of agrarian-based economies and the use of biomass for fuel, which makes the co-benefits of biochar production for agriculture and energy supply explicitly different from the rest of the world. To date, the quantities of residues available from staple crops for biochar production, and their potential for carbon sequestration in farming systems of SSA have not been comprehensively investigated. We assessed the productivity and usage of biomass waste from maize, sorghum, rice, millet, and groundnut crops; specifically quantifying straw, shanks, chaff, and shells, based on measurements from multiple farmer fields and household surveys in eastern Uganda. Moreover, allometric models were tested, using grain productivity, plant height, and density as predictors. These models enable rapid and low-cost assessment of the potential availability of feedstocks at various spatial scales: individual cropland, farm enterprise, region, and country. Ultimately, we modeled the carbon balance in soils of major cropping systems when amended with biochar from biomass residues, and up-scaled this for basic scenario analysis. This interdisciplinary approach showcases that there is significant biophysical potential for soil carbon sequestration in farming systems of Uganda through amendment of biochar derived from unused residues of cereals and legume crops. Furthermore, information about these biomass waste flows is used for estimating the rates of biochar input that could be made to farmlands, as well as the amounts of energy that could be produced with gasifier appliances. © 2019 The Authors.

Like many other European cities, Madrid fails to fulfill repeatedly the legal limits on pollutant concentrations established by the European Commission. Accordingly, in order to comply with acceptable air quality levels, Madrid City Council passed a protocol to address high NO2 pollution episodes. This paper aims at gaining deeper insight into how emission abatement plans foster a more sustainable mobility in suburban trips. To that end, a discrete choice analysis is conducted to explore the influence of the different restriction stages on modal share in a commuting corridor. Based on traffic counts and transit entrances, two multinomial grouped logit models are calibrated. Moreover, differences across trip frequencies are studied in order to determine to what extent a modal shift from private vehicles to more environmentally-friendly modes of transport occurs. The paper concludes that modal choice in suburban trips is influenced by the mobility restrictions adopted. Nevertheless, this effect shows to be fairly limited in the case of the Madrid NO2 Protocol. Therefore, more severe measures should be implemented to achieve a greater modal shift towards more sustainable transport modes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Metropolitan areas; Modal shift; NO2 Protocol; Parking restrictions; Speed limit","Air pollution; Air quality; Discrete choice analysis; Environmental problems; Metropolitan area; Mobility restrictions; Modal shifts; Pollutant concentration; Speed limit; Sustainable transport; Nitrogen oxides; air quality; atmospheric pollution; commuting; metropolitan area; nitrogen dioxide; policy making; traffic emission; urban pollution; Madrid [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074358076

The most cost-effective solution for limiting the release of VOC to the environment is their adsorption by activated carbon through an evaporative canister device that is integrated in the vehicle fuel system. Analysis and development of these systems requires an in-depth study of the evaporation and the adsorption/desorption processes. Many theoretical and experimental studies have been performed during the years, and several physical models have been developed. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of these studies, specifically focusing on the mathematical modeling of the evaporation phenomena and its application for describing real conditions, along with several fuel adsorption and desorption (purging) models of carbon canisters. A knowledge of the evaporation phenomena and adsorption/desorption process can lead to a better canister design and purging strategies, in order to match the vehicle emission regulations that are being adopted worldwide, in a view of sustainable mobility. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Canister; Evaporative emissions; Fuel tank; Physical models; Venting system","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Automobile fuel tanks; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Evaporation; Fuel tanks; Man machine systems; Volatile organic compounds; Adsorption and desorptions; Adsorption by activated carbon; Canister; Evaporative emission; International regulations; Physical model; Venting system; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Fuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073215350

Decades of research have shown that vulnerability is a crucial determinant of heat-related risk and mortality in cities, yet assessments of future urban heat-related challenges have largely overlooked the contribution of changes in socioeconomic conditions to future heat-related risk and mortality. The scenario framework for climate change research, made up of socioeconomic scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways – SSPs) combined with climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways – RCPs), facilitates the integration of socioeconomic scenarios into climate risks assessments. In this study, we used Greater Houston (Texas) as a case study to implement the scenario framework at the intra-urban scale. Integrating locally extended SSPs along with a range of sectoral modelling approaches, we combined projections of urban extreme heat – which account for SSP-specific urban heat islands – with projections of future population and vulnerability. We then produced estimates of future heat-related risk and mortality for 2041–2060 (2050s) summers at Census tract level, for multiple combinations of climate and socioeconomic scenarios. Using a scenario matrix, we showed that the projected ~15,738—24,521 future summer excess mortalities compared to 1991–2010 are essentially driven by population growth and changes in vulnerability, with changes in climatic conditions alone being of little influence. We outline methods to apply the new scenario framework at intra-urban scale and to better characterize the contribution of socioeconomic pathways to future urban climate risks. This socio-climatic approach provides comprehensive estimates of future climate risks in urban areas, which are essential for adaptation planning under climatic and socioeconomic uncertainty. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Heat stress; Houston; Integrated assessment; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Urban vulnerability","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Population statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Urban planning; Heat stress; Houston; Integrated assessment; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Urban vulnerability; Risk perception; assessment method; extreme event; future prospect; integrated approach; seasonal variation; socioeconomic conditions; temperature effect; urban development; vulnerability; article; climate; heat stress; mortality; population growth; risk assessment; summer; Texas; uncertainty; urban area; Houston; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070691056

There is a significant ciecreasing trend in proportion to the overall extreme cold temperature-attributable mortality due to CSD in the future periods (2045-2065 and 2081-2099) in LMA,-0.63% and-0.73%, respectively, and in PMA,-0.62% for 2045-2065 and-0.69% for 2081-2099, compared to the historical period.

Study focus: DOC leaching has important environmental consequences for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This paper measures leached dissolved organic carbon (LDOC) and the factors controlling its variation in the RRW, a mixed agriculture and forest watershed in Rwanda. The study describes the relationship of LDOC with land use/land cover (LULC), soil properties, rainfall characteristics, and stream DOC using linear regression and linear mixed effects models. New hydrological insights: The annual LDOC flux from topsoil to deeper soil horizons was 13.62 tonnes of carbon for the study area. This annual LDOC flux represents approximately 2% of the net primary productivity and 0.02% of the soil carbon stock. The plantation forest and natural forest sites showed higher LDOC fluxes than other LULC classes. Soil TOC, TN, rainfall intensity and amount positively affected LDOC flux (7 ≤ R2 ≤ 30%) in the RRW. Cation exchange capacity, runoff, and rainfall storage negatively affected the RRW (7 ≤ R2 ≤ 23%). LDOC flux explained 14% of the variation of stream DOC in the RRW. Our results imply that, under ongoing climate and LULC changes, an increase of the proportion of plantation forest and rainfall intensity throughout the watershed will increase LDOC flux, and will have a weak positive effect on stream DOC. © 2019 The Authors","Dissolved organic carbon; Land cover; Leaching; Linear models; Rainfall characteristics; Soil properties; Watershed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074513625

Expression of crp increases during pneumonic plague as the pathogen depletes glucose and forms large biofilms within lungs. To better understand control of Y. pestis Crp, we determined a 1.8-Å crystal structure of the protein-cAMP complex. We found that compared to Escherichia coli Crp, C helix amino acid substitutions in Y. pestis Crp did not impact the cAMP dependency of Crp to bind DNA promoters. To investigate Y. pestis Crp-regulated genes during plague pneumonia, we performed RNA sequencing on both wild-type and Δcrp mutant bacteria growing in planktonic and biofilm states in minimal media with glucose or glycerol. Y. pestis Crp was found to dramatically alter expression of hundreds of genes in a manner dependent upon carbon source and growth state. Gel shift assays confirmed direct regulation of the malT and ptsG promoters, and Crp was then linked to Y. pestis growth on maltose as a sole carbon source. Iron regulation genes ybtA and fyuA were found to be indirectly regulated by Crp. A new connection between carbon source and quorum sensing was revealed as Crp was found to regulate production of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) through direct and indirect regulation of genes for AHL synthetases and receptors. AHLs were subsequently identified in the lungs of Y. pestisinfected mice when crp expression was highest in Y. pestis biofilms. Thus, in addition to the well-studied pla gene, other Crp-regulated genes likely have important functions during plague infection. IMPORTANCE Bacterial pathogens have evolved extensive signaling pathways to translate environmental signals into changes in gene expression. While Crp has long been appreciated for its role in regulating metabolism of carbon sources in many bacterial species, transcriptional profiling has revealed that this protein regulates many other aspects of bacterial physiology. The plague pathogen Y. pestis requires this global regulator to survive in blood, skin, and lungs. During disease progression, this organism adapts to changes within these niches. In addition to regulating genes for metabolism of nonglucose sugars, we found that Crp regulates genes for virulence, metal acquisition, and quorum sensing by direct or indirect mechanisms. Thus, this single transcriptional regulator, which responds to changes in available carbon sources, can regulate multiple critical behaviors for causing disease. © 2019 Ritzert et al.","Biofilms; Catabolite repression; Crp; Cyclic AMP; Plague; Quorum sensing; Regulation of gene expression; RNA-seq; Structure; Threedimensional structure; Yersinia pestis","bacterial protein; carbohydrate; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP binding protein; glucose; glycerol; iron; maltose; n acylhomoserine lactone; siderophore; synthetase; bacterial protein; cyclic AMP binding protein; amino acid substitution; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; bacterium mutant; biofilm; biosynthesis; carbohydrate metabolism; carbon source; controlled study; crystal structure; Escherichia coli; fyuA gene; gel mobility shift assay; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene repression; malT gene; mouse; nonhuman; pla gene; plague; plankton; priority journal; promoter region; protein DNA binding; protein function; protein protein interaction; ptsG gene; quorum sensing; RNA sequence; species comparison; ybtA gene; Yersinia pestis; biofilm; biological model; biology; chemistry; gene ontology; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; metabolism; microbiology; molecular model; physiology; plankton; procedures; protein conformation; Yersinia pestis; Bacterial Proteins; Biofilms; Computational Biology; Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Ontology; Humans; Models, Biological; Models, Molecular; Plague; Plankton; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Conformation; Quorum Sensing; Yersinia pestis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075324621

For CCS to be effective, it must be deployed globally on both existing and emerging energy systems. For nations with large-scale emissions, offshore geologic CO2 storage provides an attractive and efficient long-term strategy. While some nations are already developing CCS projects using offshore CO2 storage resources, most geographic regions have yet to begin. This paper demonstrates the geologic significance of global continental margins for providing broadly-equitable, geographically-relevant, and high-quality CO2 storage resources. We then use principles of pore-space utilization and subsurface pressure constraints together with analogs of historic industry well deployment rates to demonstrate how the required storage capacity can be developed as a function of time and technical maturity to enable the global deployment of offshore storage for facilitating 2DS.

Natural plant and microbial metabolic processes play a major role in the global atmospheric budget of each. We have been studying ecosystem-atmosphere trace gas exchange at a sub-boreal forest in the northeastern United States for over two decades. Historically our emphasis was on turbulent fluxes of CO2 and water vapor. In 2012 we embarked on an expanded campaign to also measure CH4 and N2O. Here we present continuous tower-based measurements of the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and CH4, recorded over the period 2012–2018 and reported at a 30-minute time step. Additionally, we describe a five-year (2012–2016) dataset of chamber-based measurements of soil fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O (2013–2016 only), conducted each year from May to November. These data can be used for process studies, for biogeochemical and land surface model validation and benchmarking, and for regional-to-global upscaling and budgeting analyses. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; atmosphere; chemistry; climate change; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; Maine; season; soil; taiga; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Gases; Maine; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Seasons; Soil; Taiga",Data Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069269093

This study describes a combined nutrient and carbonate chemistry monitoring program in five embayments of Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts to quantify the effects of nutrient loading and freshwater discharge on aragonite saturation state (Ω). Monitoring occurred monthly from June 2015 to September 2017 with higher frequency at two embayments (Quissett and West Falmouth Harbors) and across nitrogen loading and freshwater discharge gradients. The more eutrophic stations experienced seasonal aragonite undersaturation, and at one site, nearly every measurement collected was undersaturated. We present an analytical framework to decompose variability in aragonite Ω into components driven by temperature, salinity, freshwater endmember mixing, and biogeochemical processes. We observed strong correlations between apparent oxygen utilization and the portion of aragonite Ω variation that we attribute to biogeochemistry. The regression slopes were consistent with Redfield ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity to dissolved oxygen. Total nitrogen and the contribution of biogeochemical processes to aragonite Ω were highly correlated, and this relationship was used to estimate the likely effects of nitrogen loading improvements on aragonite Ω. Under nitrogen loading reduction scenarios, aragonite Ω in the most eutrophic estuaries could be raised by nearly 0.6 units, potentially increasing several stations above the critical threshold of 1. This analysis provides a quantitative framework for incorporating ocean and coastal acidification impacts into regulatory and management discussions. ©2019.

Two different metrics; the net present cost (NPC) and energy cost (EC) are used to identify the optimal size. The optimization process is performed using a HOMER package. Results confirmed that PV system (75 kW), BS (32 units Trojan L16P), and converter (28 KW) are the optimum size. The NPC and EC costs are $109,856 and $0.059 respectively. The obtained cost of energy is lower compared to the previously reported ones, because of the proper selection of the PV size and type and the proper selection of the location.

Biology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA  92182, United States","The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the global mean. This warming could further stimulate methane (CH4) emissions from northern wetlands and enhance the greenhouse impact of this region. Arctic wetlands are extremely heterogeneous in terms of geochemistry, vegetation, microtopography, and hydrology, and therefore CH4 fluxes can differ dramatically within the metre scale. Eddy covariance (EC) is one of the most useful methods for estimating CH4 fluxes in remote areas over long periods of time. However, when the areas sampled by these EC towers (i.e. tower footprints) are by definition very heterogeneous, due to encompassing a variety of environmental conditions and vegetation types, modelling environmental controls of CH4 emissions becomes even more challenging, confounding efforts to reduce uncertainty in baseline CH4 emissions from these landscapes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of footprint variability on CH4 fluxes from two EC towers located in wetlands on the North Slope of Alaska. The local domain of each of these sites contains well developed polygonal tundra as well as a drained thermokarst lake basin. We found that the spatiotemporal variability of the footprint, has a significant influence on the observed CH4 fluxes, contributing between 3% and 33% of the variance, depending on site, time period, and modelling method. Multiple indices were used to define spatial heterogeneity, and their explanatory power varied depending on site and season. Overall, the normalised difference water index had the most consistent explanatory power on CH4 fluxes, though generally only when used in concert with at least one other spatial index. The spatial bias (defined here as the difference between the mean for the 0.36 km2 domain around the tower and the footprint-weighted mean) was between |51|% and |18|% depending on the index. This study highlights the need for footprint modelling to infer the representativeness of the carbon fluxes measured by EC towers in these highly heterogeneous tundra ecosystems, and the need to evaluate spatial variability when upscaling EC site-level data to a larger domain. © 2019 The Author(s).

Brownfields are non-utilizable barren lands due to the presence or potential presence of hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. In present study, brownfield of Chak Naurang, Punjab, Pakistan contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon was analyzed in order to evaluate the possibility of bioremediation. Physicochemical analysis of composite soil sample demonstrated that contaminated soil was slightly alkaline clay-loam with TPH of 22.2 g/kg. The concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was found to be quite low i.e. 644 mg/kg, 12.46 mg/kg and, 20 mg/kg, respectively. Electrical conductivity (E.C) i.e., 4.3 dS/m and 18% water content showed the deteriorated condition of affected soil. The crude oil degrading and biosurfactants producing microorganisms were isolated from the contaminated soil using soil enrichment technique. The isolated microorganisms were tested for biosurfactants production on the basis of qualitative and quantitative assays. Our results showed that efficient biosurfactants producing microorganisms belong to the genera of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Achromobacter, Meyerozyma and Aspergillus. Statistical analyses exhibited significant differences (p<0.05) amongst the biosurfactants production capabilities of the characterized strains. These findings revealed that contamination of petroleum hydrocarbons has adversely effected soil composition and agriculture properties. The affected soil harbors diverse microbial communities that can produce biosurfactants and use crude oil as sole carbon substrate. Moreover, nutrients amendments could be an effective strategy to stimulate bioremediation process and for improving soil productivity. © 2019, University of Agriculture.

Here, we describe the FFPE properties that negatively impact RNA integrity, an alternative tissue preservation technique that prevents RNA loss, and the steps necessary to optimize slide preparation for single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH) and imaging by confocal microscopy. This strategy retains RNA quality and eliminates formalin-induced artifacts, thereby producing high-resolution, diffraction-limited confocal images of even rare RNA transcripts in tissues.

This research developed a new DHM, the Water and Energy Budget-based Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (WEB-RRI) model, by integrating the RRI model's diffusive wave flow equations into a land surface model (hydro-SiB2) to incorporate water and energy budget processes, land-vegetation-atmosphere interactions, soil moisture dynamics, and 2-D lateral water flows to improve interception, evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, runoff, and inundation processes. The performance of the new model was assessed using river discharge data, MODIS and GLEAM ET data, and ground as well as satellite inundation extents in the Kalu (wet) and Mundeni (dry) River basins in Sri Lanka. The model was well calibrated and validated (Nash > 0.9) and confirmed to be highly capable of reproducing the long-term (~20 years) observed river discharges (Nash > 0.89) and hydrological flow regime properties for both basins. Particularly, the simulated low flow just before the flood and the peak discharges during the flood, as well as their timings, coincided well with the observed discharges in both basins, which indicates that the model is capable of reproducing soil and vegetation water storages reasonably well, and therefore it can be used for real-time and forecasting applications with the re-starting capability. The model-simulated basin averaged ET fluxes and their trends agreed better with GLEAM (RMSE: ~0.7–0.95 mm/day, correlation: ~0.35–0.39) than with MODIS (RMSE: ~0.96–1.04 mm/day, correlation: ~0.14–0.25). The simulated inundation extents were also consistent with the ground- and MODIS-driven inundation extents. The future focus of this research will be on expanding the model applicability for basin-wide IWRM and WDRR, including flood- and drought-related risk assessments, by employing the model to operational applications (e.g., flood forecasting and seasonal flow prediction) and long-term applications (e.g., catchment responses to past and future climatology, water cycle variability, hydrological extremes, and land-use changes). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Catchment hydrology; Evapotranspiration; Inundation; Rainfall-runoff-inundation processes; River discharges; Water and energy budget","Budget control; Catchments; Climate models; Evapotranspiration; Flood control; Floods; Forecasting; Land use; Radiometers; Rain; Risk assessment; Rivers; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Catchment hydrology; Inundation; Rainfall runoff; River discharge; Water and energies; Runoff; catchment; energy budget; evapotranspiration; flood forecasting; land surface; low flow; MODIS; rainfall-runoff modeling; river discharge; soil moisture; water budget; Eastern Province [Sri Lanka]; Kalu River; Mundeni Aru Basin; Sri Lanka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072866871

The centerpiece of the IMS is the Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ (FEST-C), which includes a Java-based interface and EPIC adapted to regional applications along with built-in database and tools. The SWAT integration capability is a key enhanced feature in the current release of FEST-C v1.4. For integrated modeling demonstration and evaluation, FEST-C EPIC is simulated over three individual years with WRF/CMAQ weather and N deposition. Simulated yearly changes in water and N budgets along with yields for two major crops (corn grain and soybean) match those inferred from intuitive physical reasoning and survey data given different-year weather conditions. Yearlong air quality simulations with an improved bidirectional ammonia flux modeling approach directly using EPIC-simulated soil properties including NH3 content helps reduce biases of simulated gas-phase NH3 and NH4 + wet deposition over the growing season. Integrated hydrology and water quality simulations applied to the Mississippi River Basin show that estimated monthly streamflow and dissolved N near the outlet to the Gulf of Mexico display similar seasonal patterns as observed.

Different structures have been localized for each molecule by the CBS-QB3 composite method: all the isomers show superalkali properties and strong tendency to donate an electron to carbon dioxide forming stable Lik+1Fk … CO2 complexes. With the aim to find molecular systems able to stabilize superalkalis, geometries of complexes between superalkalis and pyridine and superalkalis and graphene surfaces doped with a pyridinic vacancy were calculated. The pyridinic graphene sheets were modeled with two finite molecular systems C69H21N3 and C117H27N3. The interaction with one pyridine molecule is quite weak and the superalkali maintains its structure and electron properties. The affinity for graphene sheets is instead stronger and the superalkalis tend to deform their geometry to better interact with the graphene surface. However, the superalkalis continue to show the tendency to transfer electrons to carbon dioxide reducing CO2, as found in graphene absence. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Consequently, electric vehicles (EVs) have become a favourable solution in the transportation sector due to their green technology attributes. This paper aims to apply the Carbon Emission Pinch Analysis (CEPA) method to the transportation sector in Iskandar Malaysia. The modified CEPA method is applied by constructing a composite curve for transportation modes and the total carbon emission was plotted in order to study the minimum electricity requirement that needs to be generated to implement the use of EVs. Road and rail transportation were considered in the transport composite curve based on the current policies available and to achieve the new carbon emission target by the year 2025. The alternatives available to reduce carbon emission in Iskandar Malaysia include increasing public transport modal share; fuel switching from petrol and diesel to natural gas and biofuels; and increasing transport efficiency via plug-in hybrid and EVs. Four scenarios were established and evaluated based on economic and environmental aspects. As a result, Scenario 4 which considered all policies available (transport management, fuel switching and fuel efficiency) have showed the most promising fuel mix for future transportation demands. An estimated total amount of 0.25 TJ of electricity is needed for EV implementation with a total estimated cost of RM 1.3 billion. The total carbon emission for this scenario is 1101.96 kt-CO2.

In line with the Paris Agreement, the European Union has set an agenda to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by means of energy efficiency in buildings. It is estimated that by the year 2050, 80% of Europe's population will be living in buildings that already exist. This means it is important for the European Union to renovate buildings to improve energy efficiency. In this study, eight renovation scenarios, using six different Northern European electricity mixes, were analyzed using the standard of the European Committee for Standardization for life cycle assessment of buildings. This study covers all life cycle steps from cradle to grave. The renovation scenarios include combinations of photovoltaics, geothermal heat pumps, heat recovery ventilation, and improvement of the building envelope. The results show that while in some electricity mixes a reduction in the global warming potential can be achieved, it can be at the expense of an increase in radioactive waste production, and, in mixes with a high share of fossil fuels, the global warming potential of the scenarios increases with time, compared with that of the original building. It also shows that in most electricity mixes, scenarios that reduce the active heat demand of the building end up in reducing both the global warming potential and radioactive waste, making them less sensitive to changes in the energy system. © 2019 by the authors.

The effects of CO2 pressure (up to 50 bar), bipolar membranes, and electrolyte (K2SO4) concentration on the current density (CD) and the Faraday efficiency (FE) of formic acid were investigated. The highest FE (â80%) of FA was achieved at a pressure of around 50 bar at a cell potential of 3.5 V and a CD of â30 mA/cm2. To suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in aqueous media is typically performed at alkaline conditions. The consequence of this is that products like formic acid, which has a pKa of 3.75, will almost completely dissociate into the formate form. The pH of the electrolyte solution has a strong influence not only on the electrochemical reduction process of CO2 but also on the downstream separation of (dilute) acid products like formic acid. The selection of separation processes depends on the dissociation state of the acids. A review of separation technologies for formic acid/formate removal from aqueous dilute streams is provided. By applying common separation heuristics, we have selected liquid-liquid extraction and electrodialysis for formic acid and formate separation, respectively. An economic evaluation of both separation processes shows that the formic acid route is more attractive than the formate one. These results urge for a better design of (1) CO2 electrocatalysts that can operate at low pH without affecting the selectivity of the desired products and (2) technologies for efficient separation of dilute products from (photo)electrochemical reactors.

In this article, we compare the performance of current state of the art AAEM fuel cells to proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and elucidate the sources of various overpotentials. While the continued development of highly conductive and thermally stable anion-exchange membranes is unambiguously a principal requirement, we attempt to put the focus on the challenges in electrocatalysis and interfacial charge transfer at an alkaline electrode/electrolyte interface. Specifically, a critical analysis presented here details the (i) fundamental causes for higher overpotential in hydrogen oxidation reaction, (ii) mechanistic aspects of oxygen reduction reaction, (iii) carbonate anion poisoning, (iv) unique challenges arising from the specific adsorption of alkaline ionomer cation-exchange head groups on electrocatalysts surfaces, and (v) the potential of alternative small molecule fuel oxidation. This review and analysis encompasses both the precious and nonprecious group metal based electrocatalysts from the perspective of various interfacial charge-transfer phenomena and reaction mechanisms.

Plants have a critical role in ecological functions, such as carbon storage, water and air purification, and mitigation of climate change. They also provide an opportunity to develop a green economy for increasing the livelihoods of local people. Green economy consists of the efficient use of natural resources, low-carbon economic activities, and social inclusion. This paper aims to formulate a green economy strategy for Flores by evaluating the natural capital assets, which include plants and its associated local wisdom, as a recommendation for government authorities, local community, and other stakeholders. There are at least 6 published ethnobotanical research of Flores, particularly in Ruteng Mountains, Manggarai Barat, and Ngada. These studies uncover the rich local wisdom in utilizing plants. We envisage strategic approach to leverage this potential, which involves on the development of utilization of local plants for textile industry.

Therefore, European regulations require member states to progressively restrict the amount of landfill waste. The article presents the current shape of waste management in Poland, and also introduces the dominant form of RDF management in the cement industry. Nevertheless, the capacity of cement plants is limited, and the energy use of fuels from waste encounters difficulties related to a significant reduction in pollutant emissions, which is why the use of modern installations for the thermal conversion of waste such as pyrolysis and gasification is increasingly considered. Taking into account the promising energy properties of secondary fuels obtained during the pyrolysis process, the chemical composition of gas from RDF pyrolysis was modeled for a pilot installation operating in Poland. Determination of the combustible components allowed the calorific value of pyrolysis gas to be estimated, ranging from 28.2 - 28.7 MJ/m3. The obtained calorific encourages wider use of the waste pyrolysis process in order to obtain secondary fuels with promising energy parameters. It will contribute to a further reduction in the amount of deposited waste, and thus to creating environmentally-friendly closed-loop waste management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Alternative fuels; Cement industry; Cements; Energy utilization; Pyrolysis; Refuse derived fuels; Chemical compositions; Energy parameters; European regulation; Pollutant emission; Pyrolysis and gasification; Pyrolysis process; Thermal conversion; Waste pyrolysis; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078145881

Recent studies on temperature-related mortality burden generally found higher cold-related deaths than heat-related deaths. In the future, it is anticipated that global warming will, on one hand result in larger heat-related mortality but on the other hand lead to less cold-related mortality. Thus, it remains unclear whether the net change in temperature-related mortality burden will increase in the future under climate change. Objectives. We aimed to quantify the impact of climate change on heat-, cold-, and the total temperature-related (net change) mortality burden taking into account the future demographic changes across five districts in Bavaria, Germany by the end of the 21st century. Methods. We applied location-specific age-specific exposure-response functions (ERFs) to project the net change in temperature-related mortality burden during the future period 2083-2099 as compared to the baseline period 1990-2006. The projections were under different combinations of five climate change scenarios (assuming a constant climate, Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) and six population projection scenarios (assuming a constant population, Shared Socio-economic Pathway [SSP] 1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, and SSP5). Our projections were under the assumption of a constant vulnerability of the future population. We furthered compared the results with projections using location-specific overall all-age ERFs, i.e. not considering the age-effect and population aging. Results. The net temperature-related mortality for the total population was found to increase significantly under all scenarios of climate and population change with the highest total increments under SSP5-RCP8.5 by 19.61% (95% empirical CI (eCI): 11.78, 30.91). Under the same scenario for age ≥ 75, the increment was by 30.46% (95% eCI: 18.60, 47.74) and for age <75, the increment was by 0.28% (95% eCI:-2.84, 3.24). Considering the combination SSP2-RCP2.6, the middle-of-the road population and the lowest climate change scenario, the net temperature-related mortality for the total population was found to still increase by 9.33% (95% eCI: 5.94, 12.76). Contrastingly, the mortality projection without consideration of an age-effect and population aging under the same scenario resulted in a decrease of temperature-related deaths by-0.23% (95% eCI-0.64, 0.14), thus showing an underestimation of temperature-related mortality. Furthermore, the results of climate-only effect showed no considerable changes, whereas, the population-only effect showed a high, up to 17.35% (95% eCI: 11.46, 22.70), increment in the net temperature-related deaths. Conclusion. The elderly population (age ≥ 75), highly vulnerable to both heat and cold, is projected to be about four folds the younger population (age < 75) in the future. Thus, the combined effect of global warming and population aging results in an increase in both the heat- A nd the cold-related deaths. The population-effect dominates the climate-effect. Mitigation and age-specific adaptation strategies might greatly reduce the temperature-related mortality burden in the future. © 2019 The Author(s).

This makes electricity generation sector of Alberta an intensive source of CO2 emissions and a good candidate for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon renewable energy sources. Wind and geothermal energy are two low-carbon energy sources that can be considered for electricity generation in Alberta. However, the relatively high cost of geothermal energy and intermittent nature of wind energy hinder their widespread use in the province. To address these challenges, in this study we develop a model to simulate the performance of conventional geothermal and Compressed Air Energy System (CAES)-geothermal power plants with or without wind energy in a typical hot dry rock (HDR) reservoir using CMG STARS, and Visual Basic Applications (VBA) platform in Excel. Our findings show that wind/CAES-geothermal scenario with McIntosh technology has the lowest LCOE (7.8–11.8 ¢/kWh) with the emission intensity of 88–126 gCO2/kWh. Furthermore, this scenario could reach the 10% IRR value, which results in total GDP impacts of $1,020 to $1,386 million and creation of 4,489 to 6,842 jobs in Alberta and Canada over a 10-year period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CAES; CO2 emission; Geothermal energy; LCOE; Wind energy","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Compressed air; Computer aided engineering; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Geothermal power plants; Greenhouse gases; Hot dry rock systems; Pressure vessels; Wind power; CO2 emissions; Electric power production; Electricity generation sectors; Geothermal energy systems; Hot dry rock reservoirs; LCOE; Renewable energy source; Visual basic application; Compressed air energy storage; alternative energy; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; compressed air; economic conditions; electrical power; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy resource; energy storage; fossil fuel; geothermal energy; simulation; wind power; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066122837

In addition to the risks associated with high population density and unplanned infrastructures, temperature and precipitation changes are two environmental factors which have the greatest potential to negatively impact the residential population, both now and into the future. This study uses historical climate data recorded in the Dhaka area for the 1995–2014 period, as well as a multi-model dataset, to understand existing climate variability and possible future climate change scenarios. Future climate scenarios and predictions for this area have been carried out with CMIP5 40 GCMs using the three new representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5) adopted by the IPCC. Climate model projections suggest that the average temperature would increase approximately 2.56 °C by the end of the twenty-first century and future monsoonal rainfall events would also substantially increase in frequency, particularly in the month of July. The results indicate that the long, hot and humid (pre-monsoon) and humid and wet (monsoon) season will persist over Dhaka for an increased length of time. A multi-model ensemble projection clearly showed that the risks associated with the modeled climate change parameters could increase Dhaka’s vulnerability to climate change by the end of the twenty-first century. It also indicated that issues associated with waterlogging, public health, transport system, and water supply would impact many areas within the Dhaka megacity.

The search for global solutions to the effects of climate change on agriculture has led to the proposal of GMCs as a tool to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural practices and to improve their efficiency of production. At least 27 countries, all over the world, have cultivated GMCs. The purpose of the present paper is to provide insights about the possible linkages between the cultivated areas and the CO2 emissions in these countries. In addition, the study intends to establish meaningful relationships between attributes related to the particular socio-economic situations and the environmental impacts of GMCs. Some examples are the connection between acreages of GMCs and the status of each country with respect to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, as well as their classification according to the mean income per capita and their CO2 emissions. In order to give the mathematical support to these links, the methodology known as Order Theory was employed. The results show that Paraguay, India, Burkina Faso, Brazil and Pakistan could be the best contributors to the mitigation of the climate change by the reduction of their CO2 emission levels through GMCs. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Formal concept analysis; Genetically modified crops; Hasse diagram technique; Local partial order methods","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Environmental impact; Formal concept analysis; Agricultural practices; Cartagena protocol; CO2 emissions; Genetically modified crops; Global solutions; Hasse diagram techniques; Partial-order methods; Socio-economics; Climate change; agricultural practice; agricultural production; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; crop; environmental impact; genetically modified organism; Brazil; Burkina Faso; India; Pakistan; Paraguay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064672330

The main goal of this study is to evaluate how future climate will affect green water scarcity resources, by calculating green water scarcity characterisation factors (CFs) under a reference (period 1986 to 2005) and a medium-term future (period 2046 to 2065) climate, based on the principles established by Quinteiro et al. (2018). This study considers a higher spatial resolution (9 × 9 km) than Quinteiro et al. (2018), improving the knowledge of green water scarcity conditions in mainland Portugal. The CFs were calculated considering two different interfaces: (1) interface green freshwater – topsoil (ws), and; (2) interface green freshwater – atmosphere (wa). At the interface ws, the relation between the changes on green freshwater flows and the surface blue freshwater recharge is considered, while at the interface wa the relation between the evapotranspiration (ET) recycled to the atmosphere and the precipitation levels at the same watershed level are considered. The green freshwater scarcity CFs were developed based on ET values, which in turn were calculated based on meteorological variables obtained with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Some regions of Portugal are currently suffering of pressure on green freshwater resources (mainly in Central littoral and Western coastal areas). In general, green freshwater scarcity CFs is projected to increase in Portugal under future climate in comparison to the CFs obtained for reference conditions. Green freshwater scarcity CFs at the interface ws increase from 101 to 150%, while CFs at the interface wa increase from 301 to 800%. These results show that strategies and policies to support the management of green freshwater resources and land use planning, ensuring the highest level of freshwater productivity of crops and forests, should be developed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Green water scarcity; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Water footprint","Land use; Life cycle; Water; Weather forecasting; Fresh water resources; Freshwater scarcity; Green water; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Meteorological variables; Precipitation level; Water footprint; Weather research and forecasting models; Climate change; fresh water; climate change; climate effect; evapotranspiration; life cycle analysis; mapping; topsoil; water footprint; water supply; weather forecasting; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric pressure; case study; climate change; crop production; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; evapotranspiration; geographic distribution; geographic mapping; green chemistry; land use; meteorological phenomena; Portugal; priority journal; seashore; soil analysis; water flow; water supply; watershed management; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071288414

A local climate zone (LCZ) scheme has therefore been developed to classify urban and natural landscapes in a standardized and universal manner. Despite LCZ mapping efforts in worldwide cities, this study attempts to propose an enhanced geographic information system-based workflow to enable the hierarchical classification of LCZs with fewer indicators but higher accuracies while considering supplementary classes and subclasses. Specifically, five morphological and coverage indicators that were easily obtained and well differentiated among LCZs were derived from a city street map and satellite images, and 25 LCZs (including 16 standard, 3 supplementary, and 6 sub-classified zones) were determined at a block-level according to the indicator hierarchy and criteria. The method was performed over Beijing, China, and evaluations by field surveys and google earth images showed a high accuracy with little noise and sharp boundaries, outperforming the widely-used remote sensing-based method of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools, particularly in terms of building height and heavy industry. Results also demonstrate that the Beijing core was dominated by open (including extremely open) mid-rise buildings (28.7%) and open low-rise buildings (12.8%), forming an inner-low-middle-high-outer-low annular building-height pattern. Significant land surface temperature differences were detected among the LCZs, where the low-rise and compact LCZs had higher temperatures than the mid-/high-rise and open LCZs during daytime, and subclasses LCZ XB/C/D (LCZ XE/F) generated lower (higher) temperatures than their parent classes in May. This method was proposed to augment the LCZ mapping system and further support applications (e.g., urban planning/management and climate/weather modeling) in high-density cities similar to Beijing. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","geographic information system (GIS); land surface temperature; local climate zone (LCZ); remote sensing; urban morphology","Classification (of information); Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Land surface temperature; Mapping; Morphology; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban planning; Heavy industries; Hierarchical classification; High-density cities; Local climate; Low-rise buildings; Natural landscapes; Urban heat island; Urban morphology; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068458941

Changes in climate may affect pavement rutting, roughness, and cracking and lead to consequent changes in maintenance decision-making and life cycle costs. This study develops a methodology to incorporate the effects of climate variability into flexible pavement LCCA and to derive the additional life cycle costs incurred due to changes in climate. Case studies were performed for three road sections in Virginia (US) to demonstrate the methodology, using approximate mean climate change trends predicted for the investigated regions. It is estimated that climate change will incur additional vehicle operating costs ranging between US$2.30 and $4.40 on average per vehicle/annum if roads are used under a 2050 high greenhouse gas emission scenario and without being maintained. Assuming responsive maintenance, the budget demand for maintenance will arrive much earlier in the pavements’ life cycles (7–11 years earlier under the 2050 high-emission scenario). This is found to add up to 64% of agency costs (net present value) to repair each kilometre of the investigated roads in a 40-year design life.

The absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra and decay curves of co-doped Yb3+/Ho3+ Na5Y9F32 single crystals with different concentrations of Ce3+ ions were measured. The intensity parameters of Ho3+ ions were calculated according to Judd–Ofelt theory and measured absorption spectra. The emission spectra showed the up-conversion (UC) emission intensity at 545, 657, and 755 nm reduced significantly as the addition of Ce3+. When the concentration of Ce3+ reached about 0.25 mol%, the maximum fluorescence intensity of ~2.0 μm was obtained, and the emission cross section reached 2.29 × 10−20 cm2. The mechanism of up-conversion reduction and ~2.0 μm emission enhancement in Ce3+/Yb3+/Ho3+ tri-doped Na5Y9F32 crystals was discussed from their energy level diagrams and optical spectra.

While Indian authorities implemented several measures to reduce emissions from the power, industry and transportation sectors over the last years, such strategies appear to be insufficient to reduce the ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration below the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 40 μg/m3 across the country. This study explores pathways towards achieving the NAAQS in India in the context of the dynamics of social and economic development. In addition, to inform action at the subnational levels in India, we estimate the exposure to ambient air pollution in the current legislations and alternative policy scenarios based on simulations with the GAINS integrated assessment model. The analysis reveals that in many of the Indian States emission sources that are outside of their immediate jurisdictions make the dominating contributions to (population-weighted) ambient pollution levels of PM2.5. Consequently, most of the States cannot achieve significant improvements in their air quality and population exposure on their own without emission reductions in the surrounding regions, and any cost-effective strategy requires regionally coordinated approaches. Advanced technical emission control measures could provide NAAQS-compliant air quality for 60% of the Indian population. However, if combined with national sustainable development strategies, an additional 25% population will be provided with clean air, which appears to be a significant co-benefit on air quality (totaling 85%). © 2019 The Authors","Air quality; Co-benefits; Emission control costs; Fine particulate matter; Population exposure; Source-apportionment","Air quality; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Planning; Quality control; Sustainable development; Co benefits; Emission control costs; Fine particulate matter; Population exposure; Source apportionment; Air quality standards; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; mitigation; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; risk factor; source apportionment; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; article; human; India; law; particulate matter; population exposure; simulation; sustainable development; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; environmental monitoring; India; legislation and jurisprudence; particulate matter; procedures; public health; India; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Particulate Matter; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071956523

Thermal diodicity has significant potential to improve the efficacy of a wide variety of heating and cooling devices. This paper presents pioneering work to experimentally measure the heat transfer characteristics of a 0.15 m2 passive Planar Liquid-Vapour Thermal Diode (PLVTD). Prior work has typically examined much smaller devices aimed at micro-electronics cooling applications whereas the present work aims to improve understanding of larger scale devices for incorporation in solar collectors and multi-function climate control building envelopes. Such applications can facilitate local renewable energy generation (solar and ambient heat collection) and improve cooling system energy efficiency (passive heat rejection) in order to address the climate crisis by decarbonising built environment energy use. Experimental work involved a horizontally oriented PLVTD formed of two parallel isothermal plates with integral serpentine heat exchangers and external insulation. Plate, fluid, and ambient temperatures were controlled and measured to determine heat transfer coefficients under various temperature difference and heat flux operating scenarios in order to validate a simple one-dimensional lumped parameter model. Measured forward mode heat transfer 150 &lt; Uf &lt; 500 W·m−2 K−1 combined with reverse mode insulation Ur = 10 W·m−2 K−1 corresponds ς ≈ 88% diodicity at low condenser temperatures and fluxes (T2 ≈ 15 °C and q/A ≈ 120 W∙m−2) and ς ≈ 96% at high condenser temperatures and heat fluxes (T2 ≈ 60 °C and q/A ≈ 2800 W∙m−2). Forward mode performance increases with increasing heat flux and (to a lesser extent) with increasing operating temperature but is largely independent of PLVTD dimensions. Reverse mode performance is largely independent of heat flux and temperature but reduces (improves thermal insulation) with increasing cavity depth. The model has been used to show that a stainless steel PLVTD with x = 70 mm cavity can achieve Ur = 2 W·m−2 K−1 with similar forward mode performance to the experimental prototype. Such a device would achieve diodicity of ς &gt; 97% and be suitable for application in solar collectors and climate control building envelopes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Heat rejection; One-way heat flow; Phase change; Solar collector; Thermal diode","Climate control; Diodes; Electronic cooling; Energy efficiency; Heat flux; Heat resistance; Heat sinks; Renewable energy resources; Serpentine; Solar buildings; Solar collectors; Temperature; Experimental prototype; Heat rejection; Heat transfer characteristics; Lumped parameter modeling; Micro electronics cooling; Phase Change; Temperature differences; Thermal diodes; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071763734

However, high and vastly variable water requirements of these systems are preventing their further widespread. Only a small number of studies have investigated water needs of green walls, even though this can help to design more optimal systems with increased benefits. Additionally, the knowledge on interactions between plant uptake and climate conditions (temperature and humidity) is lacking. The aim of this study was to understand daily water requirements of five plant species (C. appressa, N. obliterata, L. muscari, M. parvifolium and O. japonicus) used in greywater treating green walls, across different seasons, temperature, and humidity conditions of temperate-oceanic climate (common in parts of Australia, US and Europe). The results showed that during summer, dominant water uptake processes were plant uptake and transpiration, resulting in three to four times higher water needs than during winter, when evaporation is a major effect. Top levels of the multi-level green wall exhibited significantly higher plant activity compared to bottom levels, showing four times greater water uptake. Temperature and humidity changes during winter caused the change in water uptake of plants, pointing to different growing and activity patterns of tested plants. During summer only N. obliterata showed temperature and humidity dependence. Annual plant water uptake and other practical recommendations are given based on the results. Even though this study focused on water requirements of greywater treating green walls, its findings can also inform traditional green wall designs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Humidity; Irrigation; Seasonal variation; Temperate climate; Temperature; Watering","Atmospheric humidity; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Temperature; Transpiration; Walls (structural partitions); Humidity conditions; Practical recommendation; Seasonal variation; Temperate climate; Temperature and humidities; Urban environments; Water requirements; Watering; Water treatment; air temperature; climate conditions; climate effect; correlation; evaporation; fern; greenspace; humidity; irrigation; seasonal variation; wastewater treatment; water retention; water uptake; watering point; Article; Carex appressa; climate; correlation analysis; evaporation; humidity; irrigation (agriculture); Liriope muscari; Myoporum parvifolium; Nephrolepis obliterata; nonhuman; Ophiopogon japonicus; plant; priority journal; temperature; water absorption; water retention; water transport; winter; Australia; Europe; season; Australia; Europe; United States; Embryophyta; water; Australia; Climate; Europe; Humidity; Plants; Seasons; Temperature; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072408212

Nations world-wide recognise that learning from the indigenous knowledge of communities residing in harmony with nature can provide immense impetus to national conservation strategies and help research dedicated towards mitigation of climate change impacts. India, comprising of 8.6% tribal population, has access to an enormous aggregate of indigenous knowledge which through proper recognition, adoption and mainstreaming has the potential to provide sustainable solutions to concerns related to falling agricultural productivity and soil quality, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, pollution as well as many other social challenges. The present work therefore, attempts to collate the traditional practices of Indian tribes in these sectors as well as their socio-economic status with specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), targets and national indicators. For this, an in-depth analysis of available datasets related to the scheduled tribes of India was conducted and interpretations and extrapolations were done accordingly. Bubble plot analysis was performed to understand the relationship between poverty and education among the tribal communities of various Indian States. The results indicate that establishment of functional links between traditional practices and SDG 2, 6 and 15 in particular would significantly aid the climate action policy of India. Simultaneously, improvement in the income, women and child health and education of these communities through dedicated interventions would directly have a positive effect on national indicators of SDG 1, 2, 3, and 4. Besides, effectual policy interventions directed towards tribal welfare would greatly reduce the damaging effects of climate change in the long term. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biocultural diversity; Climate change; Indigenous knowledge; Scheduled tribes; SDGs; Social indicators",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073033967

New analytical tools supported by revised conceptual frameworks are needed to assist identification and assessment of future development options. This article is based on a book published earlier this year. It presents and discusses the current patterns of change and their implications for policy. Three major policy challenges are identified: integration of agricultural and environmental policies; pro-active approaches to landscape change to cope with non-agricultural demands including recreation and nature conservation; and stakeholder involvement in policy design and implementation including farmers and other primary managers, public agencies at all levels and local communities in various forms.

The growth order needs to be yellow InGaN quantum wells first and then a blue InGaN quantum well after the growth of n-type GaN. The fundamental reason is due to the poor hole concentration distribution across the whole InGaN quantum well region. In order to effectively capture holes in both the yellow InGaN quantum wells and the blue InGaN quantum well, a thin GaN spacer has been introduced prior to the blue InGaN quantum well. The detailed simulations of the band diagram and the hole concentration distribution across the yellow and the blue quantum wells have been conducted, showing that the thin GaN spacer can effectively balance the hole concentration between the yellow and the blue InGaN quantum wells, eventually determining their relative intensity between the yellow and the blue emissions.

In regional Queensland, where irrigated sugarcane is grown, both the retailer and distribution network service providers are government owned and highly regulated. This study investigates options for on-farm embedded generation from a range of commercially available components, to reduce energy costs of furrow, centre pivot, and Big Gun® irrigation. This study confirms that demand-side management crucially affects the economic feasibility of embedded generation. Connection rules, such as feed-in tariffs and export limits affecting renewable embedded generation can also influence emissions abatement costs and investment returns. When export limits are allowed on larger sites (solar PV systems &gt;40 kW), abatement costs fall from $109/t CO2e to $18/t CO2e and the present value of the investment improves substantially. The analysis reveals economically feasible opportunities exist for small-scale solar PV system installations (under 40 kW), reducing NPC of pumping from 12 to 25% and emission reductions ranging from 1245 t CO2e to 1314 t CO2e per installation over 25 years. Where a site is not eligible for a feed-in tariff, high renewable energy utilisation rates are required to make the site feasible. Batteries did not feature as an optimal component, even when battery storage and replacement values were discounted by 60%, indicating that seasonal load profiles under-use a battery investment.

The surface properties of a polar semiconductor such as GaN are dominated by interface phonons, and thus the optical properties of the vertical heterostructure are influenced by the coupling of these carriers with phonons. The activation of different Raman modes in the heterostructure caused by the coupling between interfacial phonons and optically generated carriers in a monolayer MoS2–GaN (0001) heterostructure is observed. Different excitonic states in MoS2 are close to the interband energy state of intraband defect state of GaN. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to determine the band alignment of the interface and revealed a type-I heterostructure. The close proximity of the energy levels and the excitonic states in the semiconductors and the coupling of the electronic states with phonons result in the modification of carrier relaxation rates. Modulation of the excitonic absorption states in MoS2 is measured by transient optical pump-probe spectroscopy and the change in emission properties of both semiconductors is measured by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy. There is significant red-shift of the C excitonic band and faster dephasing of carriers in MoS2. However, optical excitation at energy higher than the bandgap of both semiconductors slows down the dephasing of carriers and energy exchange at the interface. Enhanced and blue-shifted PL emission is observed in MoS2. GaN band-edge emission is reduced in intensity at room temperature due to increased phonon-induced scattering of carriers in the GaN layer.

The electrode material NCMHC exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 4635 F g−1 (1854 C g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor, which consisted of a NCMHC positive electrode and an activated carbon negative electrode, exhibited a good specific capacitance of 144.4 F g−1, high energy of 51.4 Wh kg−1, and high power density of 8000 W kg−1 as well as remarkable charge-discharge cycling stability (capacity retention) of 96% after 10,000 cycles, outperforming previously reported nickel-cobalt-manganese-based electrode materials. This exceptional capacitive performance of NCMHC was attributed to the synergistic combination of ternary metal ions with the optimal oxidation states to obtain ideal electrical conductivity and highly exposed active sites due to the array of a unique flower petal-like morphology with short ion-diffusion paths for efficient energy storage.

The Brazilian cities Manaus (Amazon) and Curitiba (South region) have different geographical locations, climates, and urban development strategies. Manaus drives its industrialization using the free trade zone policy and Curitiba adopted a services centered economy driven by sustainability. Therefore, these two cities were used to illustrate the influence that these different models have on PM2.5in vitro profile. We compared PM2.5 mass concentrations and the average total elemental and bioaccessible profiles for Cu, Cr, Mn, and Pb. The total average elemental concentrations followed Mn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; Cr in Manaus and Pb &gt; Mn &gt; Cu &gt; Cr in Curitiba. Mn had the lowest solubility while Cu showed the highest bioaccessibility (100%) and was significantly higher in Curitiba than Manaus. Cr and Pb had higher bioaccessibility in Manaus than Curitiba. Despite similar mass concentrations, the public health risk in Manaus was higher than in Curitiba indicating that the free trade zone had a profound effect on the emission levels and sources of airborne PM.

Exposure to mercury compounds resulting in various toxic effects for living organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of granular sulphur (S) soil amendment and cultivation of Dactylis glomerata to decrease gaseous mercury emission to the atmosphere and mercury mobility in soils affected by CAP activity in the past. The effect of this approach on D. glomerata physiological status was also assessed (Hg concentration in biomass, chlorophyll a fluorescence, pigment contents and oxidative stress). Stabilization of mercury in soil and reduction of root and shoot concentration did not influence biomass production. Despite similar yields, photosynthetic efficiency was higher for plants grown in sulphur amended soil compared to unamended soil, particularly observed in phenomenological energy fluxes. Relative chlorophyll content was 30% lower for amended soil plants, however based on chlorophyll fluorescence data those were in high portion ineffective. Oxidative stress products and catalase activity did not differ significantly between experimental treatments. Sulphur amendment was a key factor for reduction of Hg mobility in soil (reduced by about 30%) while plant cover was significant for the reduction of Hg atmospheric emission (emissions were 2-times higher in sulphur amended soil without plant cover). Due to the very high concentration of Hg in soil (798.2 ± 7.3 mg kg−1), growth inhibition was consistent regardless of treatment, demonstrated in the overload Reactive Oxygen Species scavenging mechanism and similar biomass yields. This leads to the conclusion that Hg may have greater impact on Calvin-Benson cycle associated enzymes than on the light-dependent photosynthesis phase. Despite these limitations this approach may still decrease environmental risks by reducing Hg emission to the atmosphere and reducing groundwater contamination. © 2019 Elsevier LtdSimultaneous sulphur application and D. glomerata cultivation decrease mercury atmospheric emission and mobility in extremely contaminated soil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Cock's-foot; Hg; Oxidative stress","Atmospheric spectra; Biomass; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Oxidative stress; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Physiology; Plants (botany); Soils; Stabilization; Sulfur; Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Cock's-foot; Groundwater contamination; Impact on the environment; Photosynthetic efficiency; Physiological response; Reactive oxygen species; Soil pollution; catalase; chlorophyll a; mercury; pigment; reactive oxygen metabolite; sulfur; chlorophyll; mercury; mercury derivative; sulfur; chlorophyll a; cultivation; environmental risk; grass; mercury (element); oxidative stress; physiological response; soil pollution; soil quality; Article; atmosphere; biomass; chemical phenomena; controlled study; Dactylis glomerata; fluorescence analysis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; phytostabilization; plant growth; pollution transport; soil pollution; animal; bioremediation; Dactylis; metabolism; physiology; soil; soil pollutant; Dactylis glomerata; Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Dactylis; Mercury; Mercury Compounds; Photosynthesis; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Sulfur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072343196

With this in mind, a global online survey was conducted to understand northern agriculture and farmers' perspective on environmental change north of 60° N. In the obtained dataset with 67 valid answers, Alaska and the Canadian territories were dominated by small-scale vegetable, herbs, hay, and flower farms; the Atlantic Islands were dominated by sheep farms; and Fennoscandia was dominated by cereal farming. In Alaska and Canada, farmers hadmostly immigrated with hardly any background in farming, while farmers in Fennoscandia and on the Atlantic Islands mostly continued family traditions. Accordingly, the average time since conversion from native land was 28 ± 28 and 25 ± 12 years in Alaska and Canada, respectively, but 301 ± 291 and 255 ± 155 years on the Atlantic Islands and in Fennoscandia, respectively, revealing that American northern agriculture is expanding. Climate change was observed by 84% of all farmers, of which 67% have already started adapting their farming practices, by introducing new varieties or altering timings. Fourteen farmers reported permafrost on their land, with 50% observing more shallow permafrost on uncultivated land than on cultivated land. Cultivation might thus accelerate permafrost thawing, potentially with associated consequences for biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse gas emissions. About 87% of the surveyed farmers produced for the local market, reducing emissions of food transport. The dynamics of northern land-use change and agriculture with associated environmental changes should be closely monitored.

Methods: Two core concepts to climate change policy response, “resilience” and “adaptation,” are seen as critical in disaster recovery strategies and practice. As ideal types, these concepts are coalescing in theory and gaining acceptance in the professional community, but not necessarily in practice. These concepts are explored through a study of disaster recovery efforts following the West Virginia floods of 2016. Results: Disaster recovery strategies based on ideal forms of resilience and adaptation face significant barriers to adoption and practice. Disjunction between theory and practice constitutes one form of inertia. Other contributing factors include individual and collective behavior that resists change through social justification and insular forms of social capital. Institutional drag, in the form of waning political will and limited administrative capacity, also impedes adoption and use. Conclusion: Sociocultural and socioeconomic inertia challenge the development of effective policies and practices to address climate change; social science can contribute to our understanding of these sources of constraint. © 2019 by the Southwestern Social Science Association",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065254211

One of the methods widely and most often used for this purpose is dynamical downscaling. In the present paper we examine the ability of a specific global (HadGEM2-ES) and a specific regional climate model (RegCM) to describe present climatic conditions in different geographical areas within the Med-CORDEX domain. Our main goal with this validation is to inform researchers, who are planning to complete climate change impact studies about the major characteristics of the simulation outputs, serving as important input in such studies. So we analyzed annual and seasonal mean fields, mean error fields relative to the reference measurements, and selected climate indices. On the basis of the results, dynamical downscaling generally cools the HadGEM results, which depends on the distance from the ocean, and orography. A clear improvement can be recognized in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of temperature indices when using finer resolution. Moreover, dynamical downscaling with higher resolution often increases the precipitation in mountains. Furthermore, in order to quantify the potential added value of RegCM simulations, a complex measure was introduced to take into account both the magnitude and spatial extent of bias. The analysis shows a general improvement in the cold-related indices in Central Europe and all temperature-related climate indices in Western Europe.

Learning to shift towards sustainable development to successfully adapt to climate change is essential. The VACB (V-garden/orchard; A-fishing farm; C-livestock farm; B-biogas) model is considered one of the best approaches and methods to adapt to climate change in the VMD. This paper aims to explore the transformative social learning and sustainable development associated with this model in terms of agricultural transformation for sustainability to climate change adaptation in the VMD. The mixed methods approach that guided the data collection included focus group discussions, in-depth interviews with key informants and household surveys. Our findings show that there are three learning processes associated with transformative social learning linked to the VACB model: instrumental, communicative and emancipatory learning. Farmers reported increased knowledge and improved relationships and efficiency when applying the VACB model using several learning channels, both formal and informal. Farmers highlighted six factors that influenced transformative social learning during the adoption and development of the VACB model and several barriers to implementing adaptation strategies to climate change in an attempt to upscale the VACB model. © 2019 by the authors.

Power-to-methane is one option for sector coupling in a future energy system. Here, a techno-economic analysis is presented that investigated different pathways with eight different scenarios. The first four use renewable hydrogen via electrolysis from wind combined with different CO2 sources, i.e., from biogas production, tail gas from power plants, provided by a supplier and from direct air capture. The remaining four scenarios based on conventional hydrogen and carbon dioxide sources are considered for the sake of comprehensive coverage. For all scenarios, a process analysis provides important insights. The economic analysis shows methane costs in the range of €3.51-€3.88 per kg for all optimized process schemes on the power to gas route. Therefore, no economic benefit can be achieved for a gas provider using power-to-methane in his gas grid. Nevertheless, with regard to the GHG reduction target of 80-95% through 2050, green solutions are of special interest. The results of the ecological analysis show a highly promising pathway that makes use of liquid manure. The avoidance of fertilizing soil by dispensing large amounts of liquid manure achieves improvements in acidification and eutrophication of soil and ground water. A switch from fossil diesel to fossil natural gas only yields a reduction of between 7%-22%. Good results were already achieved by applying municipal waste or dry manure offering an 87% GHG reduction. Liquid manure offers a credit of-78.1 g CO2,eq/MJf CH4 instead of GHG emissions on the order of 70.4 g CO2,eq/MJf CH4 using fossil CNG on a well-to-wheel basis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Methanation; Power to gas; Sector coupling; Techno economic analysis","Carbon dioxide; Electric power system economics; Energy resources; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Liquids; Manures; Methanation; Methane; Natural gasoline plants; Biogas production; Carbon dioxide sources; Ecological analysis; Economic benefits; Energy transitions; Renewable energies; Renewable hydrogens; Techno-Economic analysis; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072059377

However, how traits and their plasticity in response to contrasting environments connect with the mechanisms determining species coexistence remains poorly understood. Here, we couple field experiments under two contrasting climatic conditions to a plant population model describing competitive dynamics between 10 annual plant species in order to evaluate how 19 functional traits, covering physiological, morphological and reproductive characteristics, are associated with species’ niche and fitness differences. We find a rich diversity of univariate and multidimensional associations, which highlight the primary role of traits related to water- and light-use-efficiency for modulating the determinants of competitive outcomes. Importantly, such traits and their plasticity promote species coexistence across climatic conditions by enhancing stabilizing niche differences and by generating competitive trade-offs between species.

To this aim, a modeling chain is set up, based on the combined use of regional climate models (RCMs) and water supply system simulation models. The methodology is applied to the Pozzillo reservoir, located in Sicily (Italy), which has experienced several droughts in the past. We use an RCM model that, based on a previous study, has proved to be the most reliable in the area, among those of the EURO-CORDEX initiative. RCM precipitation and temperature monthly time series are used to generate future reservoir inflow data, according to two representative concentration pathways, RCP4.5 (intermediate emissions scenario) and RCP8.5 (high emissions scenario) and a two-step bias correction procedure. Simulation of the reservoir indicated that, due to reservoir inflow reduction induced by climate change, performances of the Pozzillo reservoir are predicted to decrease significantly in the future, with impacts of RCP8.5 generally higher than RCP4.5. © 2019 by the authors.","EURO-CORDEX; Irrigation; Mediterranean climate; RCM; RCP; Reliability; Vulnerability; Water supply systems","Climate models; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Irrigation; Reliability; Water supply; Water supply systems; Emissions scenarios; EURO-CORDEX; Mediterranean climates; Performance curve; Possible futures; Regional climate models; Reservoir inflow; Vulnerability; Climate change; climate change; greenhouse gas; irrigation; Mediterranean environment; performance assessment; reliability analysis; vulnerability; water supply; Italy; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076642370

However, most of the security proofs of QKD today make unrealistic assumptions and neglect many relevant device imperfections. As a result, they cannot guarantee the security of the practical implementations. Recently, the loss-tolerant protocol (K. Tamaki et al., Phys. Rev. A, 90, 052314, 2014) was proposed to make QKD robust against state preparation flaws. This protocol relies on the emission of qubit systems, which, unfortunately, is difficult to achieve in practice. In this work, we remove such qubit assumption and generalise the loss-tolerant protocol to accommodate multiple optical modes in the emitted signals. These multiple optical modes could arise, e.g., from Trojan horse attacks and/or device imperfections. Our security proof determines some dominant device parameter regimes needed for achieving secure communication and, therefore, it can serve as a guideline to characterise QKD transmitters. Furthermore, we compare our approach with that of H.-K. Lo et al. (Quantum Inf. Comput., 7, 431–458, 2007) and identify which method provides the highest secret key generation rate as a function of the device imperfections. Our work constitutes an important step towards the best practical and secure implementation for QKD. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Malware; Qubits; Secure communication; Device parameters; Optical modes; Physical laws; Secret key generations; Secure implementation; Security proofs; State preparation; Trojan Horse attacks; Quantum cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069672456

Chicken manure was mixed with F, G, FL, or FGL and subjected to windrow composting for 46 days. Results showed that global warming potential (GWP) was reduced by 21.9% (F), 22.8% (FL), 36.1% (G), and 39.3% (FGL). Further, the nitrogen content in the final composting product increased by 27.25%, 9.45%, and 21.86% in G, FL, and FGL amendments, respectively. The fertilizer efficiency of the compost product was assessed by measuring the biomass of plants grown in it, and it was consistent with the nitrogen content. N2O emission was negligible during composting, and 98% of the released GHGs comprised CO2 and CH4. Reduction in GHG emission was mainly achieved by reducing CH4 emission. The addition of FL, G, and FGL caused a clear shift in the abundance of dominant methanogens; particularly, the abundance of Methanobrevibacter decreased and that of Methanobacterium and Methanocella increased, which was correlated with CH4 emissions. Meanwhile, the changes in moisture content, NH4 +-N content, and pH level also played an important role in the reduction of GHG emission. Based on the effects of nitrogen conservation, fertilizer efficiency improvement, and GHG emission reduction, we conclude that G and FGL are more beneficial than F or FL and suggest these additives for efficient chicken manure composting. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chicken manure; Composting; Methanogens community; Superphosphate; Zeolite","composting; fertilizer; greenhouse gas; manure; methanogenic bacterium; poultry; superphosphate; zeolite; Methanobacterium; Methanobrevibacter; fertilizer; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; pyrophosphoric acid derivative; superphosphate; zeolite; animal; chemistry; chicken; composting; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; manure; soil; Animals; Chickens; Composting; Diphosphates; Fertilizers; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Zeolites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075378759

However, the degree to which recent Arctic warming is unprecedented remains debated. Ages of entombed plants in growth position preserved by now receding ice caps in Arctic Canada help to address this issue by placing recent conditions in a multi-millennial context. Here we show that pre-Holocene radiocarbon dates on plants collected at the margins of 30 ice caps in Arctic Canada suggest those locations were continuously ice covered for &gt; 40 kyr, but are now ice-free. We use in situ 14 C inventories in rocks from nine locations to explore the possibility of brief exposure during the warm early Holocene. Modeling the evolution of in situ 14 C confirms that Holocene exposure is unlikely at all but one of the sites.

From this motivation, nearly 500 stars including some with planets discovered around them are investigated. The relation between the C/O ratio and fractions of icy and refractory species is traced for planetesimals expected to form in their protostellar disks. It is found that low C/O ratios lead to planets rich in ice, but poor in organic and other refractory materials. With increasing C/O ratios, the ice fraction diminishes, where organics increase and other refractory materials dominate. Apart from that, the carbon portion incorporated in the solid phase and the redox state of the environment are altered to analyze their influence on bulk formation for generated planets. Under zero solid carbon contribution, ice formation decreases and refractory formation increases with increasing C/O ratio. When the carbon contribution is considered to be entirely in the solid phase, refractory materials are not significantly affected by the increasing C/O ratio while ice may even disappear. For reducing conditions, the C/O ratio is not an obstacle for ice formation no matter how high it is. Under oxidizing conditions, however, water is not found where the C/O ratio is greater than 0.8. Bulk densities are also calculated according to alternative scenarios along with compositional distributions, and results are compared to solar system objects.

These exciton complexes are found to be bound states of excitons residing in opposite valleys in momentum space, a promising feature that could be employed in valleytronics or other novel optoelectronic devices. However, electrically-driven light emission from such exciton species is still lacking. Here we report electroluminescence from bright and dark excitons, negatively charged trions and neutral and negatively charged biexcitons, generated by a pulsed gate voltage, in hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated monolayer WSe 2 and WS 2 with graphene as electrode. By tailoring the pulse parameters we are able to tune the emission intensity of the different exciton species in both materials.

It has been a matter of widespread debate whether nature of livelihood has any role to play in regulating the vulnerabilities of an individual. To find an answer, in a first ever attempt, this study tested three different approaches viz. Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), LVI IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) models and Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) to estimate climate change vulnerability of urban communities from various livelihoods in Guwahati city, Assam, India. Guwahati is considered to be the gateway to the seven North Eastern states of India and therefore strategically very important for this region. A structured survey was conducted involving 200 stakeholders from various livelihood sectors viz. construction workers, perishable item sellers, farmers, taxi/auto driver/rickshaw puller/coolie, tea stall/fast food seller, gas cylinder deliverymen, street vendors/salespersons, traffic police/police, doctors and boatmen. Data was systematically aggregated and examined using the above-mentioned composite indices. The differential vulnerabilities were compared and results suggested that the farmers were the most vulnerable community by virtue of their high sensitivity towards health, economic losses, exacerbated by their poor adaptive capacity toward unpredictable climatic variations. Doctors were the least vulnerable owing to their higher levels of awareness and adaptive capacity. These results reiterated the importance of awareness and access to resources in regulating vulnerability. The vulnerability scores also revealed that LVI and Model II (M II) of LVI IPCC approaches were the two most suitable indices and could be used for comparative vulnerability analysis. These pragmatic approaches can be used to assess the community vulnerabilities and could stimulate robust Climate Smart Urban Planning (CSUP). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate smart; Community; Livelihood; Urban planning; Vulnerability","climate change; community development; environmental policy; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; livelihood; urban area; urban planning; urban population; vulnerability; agricultural worker; article; Assam; awareness; city planning; climate change; construction worker; fast food; human; police; tea; urban population; city; India; Assam; Assam; Gauhati; India; Cities; City Planning; Climate Change; Farmers; Humans; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072599226

Moreover, the expected environmental damages such as the global warming, acid rain and urban smog due to the production of emissions from these sources have forced the world to try to reduce carbon emissions by 80% and shift towards utilizing a variety of renewable energy resources which are less environmentally harmful such as solar, wind, biomass etc. in a sustainable way. Biomass is one of the earliest sources of energy with very specific properties and abundantly available. The sources of biomass are forestry, agricultural and municipal waste and residues. The agriculture waste as biomass is either destroyed or burnt inefficiently causing air pollution. The use of agriculture waste for making briquettes to generate power can be an alternative solution to the problems related to their disposal & pollution.

It can produce a myriad of health benefits including reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, as well as reduced obesity. As a result, this will also mean lower healthcare costs and other societal and economic benefits. Active mobility also substitutes to vehicle use. Promoting active mobility amongst the elderly, therefore, can also help reduce gas emissions, pollution and climate change. In order to encourage elderly people to engage in active mobility, we can make use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). We propose the development of a smartphone app that makes use of a Smart Pedestrian Network (SPN) navigation system. The proposed system provides elderly people with relevant information, such as safe and suitable walking routes and events for social activity. As noted, by successfully implementing SPN, a plethora of benefits can be achieved. However, if stakeholders are to be convinced that investing in the proposed system is worthwhile, the benefits that accrue from active mobility must be quantified. This paper proposes a framework in order to quantify such benefits, and show that the system will indeed create value and it is a worthwhile investment. © 2019 IEEE.","Active Mobility; Elderly Market; Information and Communication Technology (ICT); Navigation System; Smart Pedestrian Network (SPN); Sustainable Mobility; Urban Development","Climate change; Economics; Gas emissions; mHealth; Navigation systems; Ageing population; Cardio-vascular disease; Economic benefits; Health care costs; Information and Communication Technologies; Mobility systems; Pedestrian network; Social activities; Health risks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097952931

To reinforce the links between such climate actions and sustainable development, adaptation responses should be aligned with goals of environmental conservation, economic development and societal wellbeing. This paper uses a multi-sectoral integrated modelling platform to evaluate the impacts of a + 1.5 °C world to the end of the 21st century under alternative Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for Europe. It evaluates the ability of adaptation strategies to concurrently improve a range of indicators, relating to sustainable development, under the constraints imposed by the contrasting SSPs. The spatial synergies and trade-offs between sustainable development indicators (SDIs) are also evaluated across Europe. We find that considerable impacts are present even under low-end climate change, affecting especially biodiversity. Even when the SDIs improve with adaptation, residual impacts of climate change affect all the SDIs, apart from sustainable production. All but one of the adaptation strategies have unintended consequences on one or multiple SDIs, although these differ substantially between strategies, regions and socio-economic scenarios. The exception was the strategy to increase social and human capital. Other strategies that lead to successful adaptation with limited unintended consequences are those aiming at adoption of sustainable behaviours and implementation of sustainable water management. This work stresses the continuing importance of adaptation even under 1.5 °C or 2 °C of global warming. Further, it demonstrates the need for policy-makers to develop holistic adaptation strategies that take account of the synergies and trade-offs between sectoral adaptation strategies, sectors and regions, and are also constrained by scenario context to avoid over-optimistic assessments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Paris Agreement; SDG; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Sustainable development; Trade-off","Biodiversity; Constrained optimization; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental protection; Global warming; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Adaptation; Environmental conservation; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Sustainable behaviours; Sustainable development indicators; Sustainable water management; Trade off; Unintended consequences; Planning; adaptive management; economic development; environmental protection; international agreement; socioeconomic impact; sustainable development; trade-off; adoption; article; biodiversity; climate change; France; greenhouse effect; human; human experiment; job stress; sustainable development; water management; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071313143

This definitely underplays species conservation at several places significant for optimisation of preserving natural ecosystems. Here we explore influences of climate, physiography and disturbance on plant species richness of the Eastern Ghats. We focus on the implications of water-energy dynamics and climatic heterogeneity on community distribution. Initially, 26-environmental variables were considered for the study, but eight least correlated variables viz., aspect, human appropriation of net primary productivity, global human footprint, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, precipitation of driest quarter, terrain ruggedness index and temperature seasonality were utilised for further analysis. A total of 1670 species from 2274 sampling locations of 22564 records were examined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and decision trees. Water-energy dynamics broadly regulates plant richness, with significant influence of mean annual precipitation and temperature. Precipitation of the driest quarter is the most significant factor in describing plant richness, indicating the availability of water during the dry period is crucial. The rise in temperature is likely to deteriorate further, where temperature seasonality is significant. Temperature seasonality determines thermal variability and assesses the intensity of climate change impacts on plant richness. The study offers ecological insights for successful conservation and management planning for the sustenance of the Eastern Ghats’ rich biodiversity. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Canonical correspondence analysis; Climate change; Community distribution; Precipitation of driest quarter; Temperature seasonality","Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Canonical Correspondence Analysis; Climate change impact; Community distribution; Mean annual precipitation; Mean annual temperatures; Net primary productivity; Plant species richness; Seasonality; Climate change; canonical analysis; climate change; community dynamics; conservation management; conservation planning; precipitation (climatology); seasonality; species richness; temperature effect; Article; climate change; conservation biology; controlled study; correspondence analysis; decision tree; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental temperature; hydropower; India; nonhuman; plant community; precipitation; seasonal variation; species richness; water availability; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; plant; Eastern Ghats; India; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; India; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078348697

A new indicator – the carbon Palma ratio, extended from the income Palma ratio and defined as the ratio of the total emissions of the top 10% emitters to those of the bottom 40% – is proposed, which provides a new perspective to inform the international community and the public of the distribution inequality of carbon emissions among individuals. The ratio is quantified within and across countries, by applying an elastic relationship between individual emissions and income. Results show that the carbon Palma ratios within most developing countries are overall high, suggesting them to focus more on coordinating regional and income differences and mainly guide high emitters to mitigate, so as to improve emissions and income equity simultaneously. The carbon Palma ratios within developed countries are comparatively smaller; however, the greater historical responsibilities to warming suggest them to substantially reduce emissions of all citizens, so as to enhance national mitigation contributions systematically. At a global scope, the current carbon Palma ratio is observably higher than within any country, reflecting an extremely severe inequality when looking at individual emissions beyond territorial limitations. The regional decomposition of emitters further suggests developed countries to take the lead in the post-Paris era in ratcheting up mitigation and climate finance ambition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon Palma ratio; Climate change; Distribution inequality; Equity principle; Individual emissions","Carbon; Developing countries; Carbon emissions; Developed countries; Distribution inequality; Emissions reduction; Equity principle; Global climate changes; Guiding principles; International community; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072246820

Zero-carbon building has emerged as an advanced model with policy support, but high-rise remains a knowledge gap. This paper aims to contribute a better understanding of the opportunities and risks of formulating and implementing a zero-carbon building policy, and identify recommendations for maximising the opportunities and minimising the risks. Hong Kong as a typical high-rise high-density city was considered as the case for study. The research was conducted through the combination of a policy review, a questionnaire survey, interviews and focus group meetings with several hundred professionals and stakeholders carefully selected using stratified sampling. Wide opportunities were identified, with most important ones including raising public awareness of sustainable living, reducing buildings’ energy use and carbon emissions, and promoting strategic urban planning. However, risks were found to co-exist, with most significant ones including geographical obstacles to domestic renewable energy generation, heavy reliance on fossil fuels, and resistance of practitioners to the policy. Nevertheless, the opportunities were considered to outweigh the risks. Recommendations were identified to mitigate the risks, which are centred on policy guidance, business strategy, stakeholder partnership, and government and client leadership. The findings reveal the complex, interactive, interchangeable and context-specific features of the opportunities and risks, which alert to reconstruct a dialectical system framework of implementing zero-carbon building policy for Hong Kong. The yielding policy implications and recommendations should shape the reconstruction of that framework for high-rise high-density cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy and carbon policy; Carbon emission; High-rise building; Hong Kong; Zero-carbon building","Carbon; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Surveys; Tall buildings; Carbon emissions; Carbon policy; High rise building; Hong-kong; Zero carbons; Zero energy buildings; alternative energy; building; carbon emission; energy use; fossil fuel; policy implementation; stakeholder; urban area; urban planning; urban policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072565163

We integrated seismic data and well logs to investigate the external morphology, internal architecture and deformation and reservoir distribution of the sublacustrine landslides in the Cretaceous Nengjiang Formation of the Songliao Basin (SLB). A large-scale sublacustrine landslide, named the Qi-Jia sublacustrine landslide (QJSL), has been identified in the Nengjiang Formation of the SLB. The QJSL is currently the largest known sublacustrine landslide in the world. This landslide covers an area that exceeds 300 km2, with an estimated volume of 30 km3. Seismic imaging and mapping reveal that the QJSL can be recognized by several distinguishing seismic characteristics: discontinuous and internal chaotic seismic facies, compressional structures in the downslope region, irregular top and basal surfaces and erosional grooves in basal shear surfaces. The QJSL is 20–200 m thick, and is composed of a succession of fine-grained deposits. Sandy layers are present but sparse and thinner than 16 m, and form reservoirs of the petroleum discoveries in this area. Our analyses show that the mechanism that triggered the collapse of the QJSL is attributed to rapid deposition and deltaic progradation. This study demonstrates that sand-rich sublacustrine landslides formed at delta front slope can serve as conventional reservoirs in the lake centre, and provide a new target for subaqueous hydrocarbon exploration and development. © 2019 The Authors.

Several types of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) were proved to be effective in mitigating methane emission from landfills. Nevertheless, more MOB species and their technical parameters for best mitigating methane still need to be explored. In landfills, methane is simultaneously generated with ammonia, which may impede the CH4 bio-oxidizing process of MOB. However, very limited studies examined the enhancement of methane reduction by introducing ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in landfills. In this study, two enriched MOB cultures were gained from a typical municipal solid waste landfill, and then were cultured with three strains of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The MOB enrichment culture used in this work includes Methylocaldum, Methylocystaceae, and Methyloversatilis, with a methane oxidation capacity of 43.6–65.0%, and the AOB includes Candida ethanolica, Bacillus cereus, and Alcaligenes faecalis. The effects on the emission reduction of both NH3 and CH4 were measured using self-made landfill-simulating equipment, as MOB, AOB, and a MOB–AOB mixture were added to the soil cover of the simulation equipment. The concentrations of CH4 and NH3 in the MOB–AOB mixture group decreased sharply, and the CH4 and NH3 concentration was 76.4% and 83.7% of the control group level. We also found that addition of AOB can help MOB oxidize CH4 and improve the emission reduction effect. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ammonia (NH3); Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB); Landfill; Methane (CH4); Methane-oxidizing bacteria; Reduction","ammonia; bacterium; concentration (composition); greenhouse gas; hydrogen sulfide; landfill; methane; mitigation; municipal solid waste; odor; oxidation; parameterization; reduction; Alcaligenes faecalis; Bacillus cereus; Candida ethanolica; Methylocaldum; Methylocystaceae; Nitrosomonadales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075375674

The main scope of this work is to develop a method for identifying areas potentially suitable for DHS, taking heat need density as the main metric. The method is tested for the case study of Canton Ticino (Switzerland) and allows analysis of the total and public building stock. This implies the collection and elaboration of energy data about public buildings, providing a dataset formerly unavailable. Because these buildings are managed by a few owners who are generally asked to be exemplary in terms of sustainability, they could have a pivotal role for the development of DHS. By using a multi-criteria and GIS- supported method, the study ensures the mapping of areas potentially suitable for DHS and renewable sources available for thermal purposes toward low carbon targets. Based on the results of the research, it is estimated that potentially 17% of the global heat needs in Canton Ticino could be satisfied by DHS, by also exploiting thermal renewable energy sources locally available. The consistency of the method was tested through a validation on the existing DHS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Buildings; Heating equipment; Mapping; Renewable energy resources; District heating system; European context; Multi-criteria; Public buildings; Renewable energy source; Renewable sources; Strategic role; Technical literature; District heating; alternative energy; data set; energy resource; GIS; heating; sustainability; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074115910

The electrification of energy use is growing, while the electricity sector is at the same time undergoing major changes through energy transition, climate change mitigation and sustainable development dynamics. The evolution of the role and the increasing influence of these networks calls for a renewed analysis of their exposure to risks. This paper explores the recent developments of these risks, brought by new hazards and vulnerabilities stemming from recent changes in the environment of the networks. The point here is not to suggest technical resilience prospects, but to explore how the US and the EU have comparatively built a culture around these risks and how they manage them. The paper first analyses the recent evolution of the status of these networks that serve as a base for the entire economy and lifestyles of Western societies. From military objectives in the twentieth century, they have become in the last ten years targets for physical sabotage (at the Metcalf substation powering Silicon Valley in 2013) or cyberattacks (in the Ukraine and Baltic states). This analysis is, secondly, confronted with the new vulnerabilities induced both by the integration of networks on a European scale which produces cascading effects (as in the case of the European blackout of 2006), and by the energy transition that opens networks to digital controls and makes them more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Thirdly, a comparative analysis of the American, European and French responses to these new risks for the networks is proposed. The analysis draws on various field and technical collaborations in the EU and in the US, while most of the technical data stem from incident reports, security guidelines, stress test feedbacks and risk assessments from the network operators. © 2019 Cairn France.

The results showed that cold briquetting of CDRI decreases its specific surface area by 51%, which has a significant effect on its oxidation resistance and mechanical strength. Microscopic observations revealed that the oxidation products are formed in near-surface porosities during aging, which protects the fresh material underneath from environmental oxidants, resulting in retarding further oxidation. The oxidation behavior of the samples showed that after about 2 months, the metallization degree-loss rate undergoes a big change because of the transition of the oxidation mechanism from reaction-control to diffusion-control condition. Comparing the oxidation behaviors of samples demonstrated that cold briquetting of CDRI with molasses and sodium silicate binders improves its oxidation resistance by 55% and 65%, respectively. The crushing strength of CBIC with sodium silicate binder in the humid medium reached a steady-state condition after 7 days from beginning of aging. But, the crushing strength of CBIC with molasses was significantly affected by the environmental humidity, so that after 7 days its strength decreased. © 2019, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Aging; Cold-briquetted iron and carbon; Environmental condition; Oxidation resistance","Aging of materials; Binders; Briquetting; Carbon; Compressive strength; Crushing; Iron; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Silicates; Sodium compounds; Briquetted iron; Chemical and physical properties; Environmental conditions; Environmental humidities; Microscopic observations; Physical and chemical properties; Sodium silicate binders; Steady-state condition; Briquets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071472068

Their heavy metals content were comparatively investigated with the previous results obtained when it was burning wastes. The bulk heavy metals deposition showed a clear distance-related attenuation both in burning and crushing periods, indicating that the plant was the main emissions source in either case. High concentrations of heavy metals in suspended particles, soil, and groundwater during the crushing period indicated their diffusion to water environment over time. The bulk atmospheric heavy metals deposition decreased significantly, 0.20~ 0.49 times for Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb and 0.69~0.94 times for Cr, during the crushing period than burning period. However, change of their enrichment factors was not significant.

This paper analyzed the effect of exposure to climate-related hazards on tree planting among smallholder farmers in nine selected African countries. The data were from baseline surveys which were conducted by the CGIAR's research programme on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). The included countries were Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda. Data were analyzed with Endogenous Switching regression considering the endogeneity potentials of climate-hazard exposure. The results showed that Uganda and Ethiopia had the highest average numbers of tree planting with 1.082 and 1.000 respectively, while Senegal (89.86%), Kenya (87.77%), Burkina Faso (82.86%) and Ethiopia (82.86%) had the highest exposure to climate-related hazards. Endogenous Switching regression results showed that climate hazard exposure was truly endogenous going by statistical significance of the Wald Chi Square test (p<0.05) and it was significantly influenced by female household headship, perception of more droughts, floods and low ground water. The number of tree that were planted increased significantly (p<0.05) with climate hazard exposure, degraded land areas, asset indices and residence in East Africa, while it reduced with female household headship. In addition, Average Treatment Effect (ATE) result indicated that an average household will plant 0.745 trees more when it had been previously exposed to climate shocks while Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATET) revealed that an average household that was exposed to climate hazards would plant 0.54 more trees than it would if it had not been exposed to hazards. It was concluded that many farmers had been affected by climate-related shocks and efforts to safeguard future climate through tree planting should be gender sensitive and concentrated among previously affected farmers. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Climate Hazards; Deforestation; Endogenous Switching Regression; Tree Planting","Deforestation; Food supply; Groundwater; Hazards; Reforestation; Regression analysis; Statistical tests; Switching; Average treatment effects; Climate hazards; Economic development; Endogenous switching; Research programmes; Smallholder farmers; Statistical significance; Tree plantings; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077770706

To ensure that outdoor recreation remains sustainable in the face of these challenges, natural resource managers may need to adapt their recreation management. One of the major challenges of adapting recreation to climate change is translating broad concepts into specific, tangible actions. Using a combination of in-depth interviews of recreational managers and a review of peer-reviewed literature and government reports, we developed a synthesis of impacts, strategies, and approaches, and a tiered structure that organizes this information. Six broad climate adaptation strategies and 25 more specific approaches were identified and organized into a ""recreation menu"". The recreation menu was tested with two national forests in the US in multi-day workshops designed to integrate these concepts into real-world projects that were at the beginning stages of the planning process. We found that the recreation menu was broad yet specific enough to be applied to recreation-focused projects with different objectives and climate change impacts. These strategies and approaches serve as stepping stones to enable natural resource and recreation managers to translate broad concepts into targeted and prescriptive actions for implementing adaptation. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Facility management; Infrastructure; Outdoor recreation; Recreation management; Tourism management; Visitation management","adaptive management; climate change; climate conditions; literature review; natural resource; outdoor recreation; perception; questionnaire survey; strategic approach; sustainability; winter; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083837088

The media comprises expanded shale aggregate, aluminum-based water treatment residual (WTR), and a psyllium-based binder. A 5-cm layer of media was installed as a permeable pavement base layer in a laboratory mesocosm and subjected to rainfall simulations using synthetic stormwater. At rainfall intensity of 0.66 cm/h, effluent DP event mean concentration (EMC) fell from an average of 0.22 mg/L P to below the EPA water quality criterion of 0.037 mg/L in 8 of 9 storms. DP retention increased at lower rainfall intensity and lower pH. Effluent EMC was lowered to less than 30 μg/L for total Cu and less than 92 μg/L for total Zn, on average, relative to average influent EMCs above 61 and 255 μg/L for total Cu and Zn, respectively. Effluent total Al EMCs were below the 25 μg/L detection limit for all storm simulations, indicating Al leaching from the WTR-containing media not to be an issue. Inclusion of an internal water storage (IWS) zone resulted in a 33% total nitrogen (TN) load reduction when adequate carbon was present to advance denitrification.

Global and regional organizations and governments have started to design and implement measures to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in the healthcare sector, e.g. by green public procurement policies and inclusion of ecological considerations in the decision-making process for purchasing and funding of healthcare technologies. The objective of this study was to perform budget impact analysis of adopting RESPIMAT re-usable in the Nordics and Benelux that considered both the traditional healthcare costs as well as the environmental impact. Methods: Inhaler costs and environmental impact over 5 years in the Nordics and Benelux in a scenario with RESPIMAT re-usable compared to a scenario without RESPIMAT re-usable were estimated using an budget impact model. RESPIMAT re-usable enables patients to re-use the inhaler device and its availability therefore reduces the number of inhalers and associated wastage. The carbon emissions were derived for each treatment pattern considering the whole life cycle (cradle-to-grave) of the inhaler product. The cost of carbon emissions was estimated using a societal cost per ton of carbon emission. Results: Progressively introducing RESPIMAT re-usable in the Nordics and Benelux was estimated to decrease the number of inhalers used by 2023 by 7,466,621 compared to a scenario without RESPIMAT re-usable, which would result in a reduction of the environmental burden of inhaler use of 4717 tCO2e and a decrease in societal cost of €205,888. Conclusions: Adopting RESPIMAT re-usable would lead to a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions, leading to savings from a societal perspective.

The distortion was achieved by applying a pulsed AC electric field, perpendicular to the helix axis. If the pulse is in the millisecond range, the helix is deformed but keeps its original pitch even for electric fields higher than the theoretical critical field for helix unwinding. In this field regime, very pronounced high-order photonic band gaps are observed, in agreement with our calculations. We theoretically explore the possibility of obtaining viable laser emission at the second-order photonic band gap, and experimentally find that lasing is not only possible but has a figure of merit similar to that of the usual laser at the main-gap region.

Here I directly link large-scale climate variability with fishery employment by studying the effects of sea-surface pressure changes in the North Atlantic region, whose waters are among the world's fastest warming. I find that climate shocks reduce not only regional catch and revenue in the New England fishing sector, but also ultimately county-level wages and employment among commercial harvesters. Each SD increase from the climatic mean decreases county-level fishing employment by 13%, on average. The South Atlantic region serves as a control due to its different ecological response to climate. Overall, I estimate that climate variability from 1996 to 2017 is responsible for a 16% (95% CI: 10% to 22%) decline in county-level fishing employment in New England, beyond the changes in employment attributable to management or other factors. This quantitative evidence linking climate variability and fishing labor has important implications for management in New England, which employs 20% of US commercial harvesters. Because the results are mediated by the local biology and institutions, they cannot be directly extrapolated to other regions. But they show that climate can impact fishing outcomes in ways unaccounted by management and offer a template for study of this relationship in fisheries around the world. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Construction of BG is listed in the second National Medium-Term Development Plan 2010-2014 which is stipulated through the Presidential Regulation No. 5 of 2010, as one of the 9th National Priority activities concerning Environment and Disaster Management. These provisions have positioned BG in an effort to rescue, study and use Indonesian plants as increasingly strategic. The target of Indonesian BG in 2020 is to be able to collect 75% of Indonesian plants. Botanical Garden not only have important roles in the fields of conservation, research, environmental education and tourism, but also made significant contributions to environmental services. The construction of BGs in various regions in Indonesia has an important role in assisting to realise the government's commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 26%, conserving and utilising local potential flora, providing natural laboratories for research, education and tourism purposes, and supporting the implementation of green open space programmes. Based on the Presidential Regulation No. 93 of 2011 concerning BG, BG was stated as ex-situ plant conservation areas that played roles in reducing the rate of degradation of plant diversity, so that it was crucial to develop BG. Botanical garden must be built in a planned, coordinated manner and meet the standards of building of a BG. Management of BG involved the maintenance and utilisation of BG, plant collections and supporting infrastructures.[1] Botanical garden served to help reforest the city with various types of species as the lungs of cities that produced oxygen, prevented erosion, and drought, as well as educative recreational sites. Disaster mitigation associated with BG denotes that the construction of BG in various parts of Indonesia is an effort to reduce the risk of disasters such as floods, droughts, air pollution, and loss of diversity of germplasm, and public awareness in the face of disaster threats. Stakeholders involved in the construction of BG are Indonesia Institute of Sciences/LIPI, local government, schools, universities, and non-governmental organisations. Public awareness in facing the threat of disasters through BG could be done through developing and implementing an environmental education of BG. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air quality; Disaster prevention; Drought; Disaster management; Disaster mitigation; Environmental education; Environmental services; Natural laboratories; Non-governmental organisations; Plant conservation; Recreational sites; Disasters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077439787

The methodology follows two steps. First, we econometrically estimate the marginal product of key production inputs (e.g., labor and land), through the estimation of production functions. Then, we predict future agricultural sector performance, by assuming a future with climate-induced changes in the land use and in agricultural labor use, under different IPCC scenarios. We also assume that no dramatic technological change in agriculture production will occur in the near future, so that the selected inputs will present the same marginal product. We assume that the agricultural sector might develop differently under different climate change-induced scenarios and that the use of land and labor will change accordingly. In this way, we are able to compute predictions on the agricultural sector performance in the future, under very different circumstances. We apply the methodology for predicting the sector performance of the Veneto region in 2030. Results differ according to the selected IPCC scenario and consequent input use variations. In the selected case study, for instance, land presents a very high productivity and climate-induced changes in the land use might dramatically (positively and negatively) affect agricultural yields under different IPCC scenarios. In this perspective, the climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and options should primarily aim at the preservation of land productivity in Veneto. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; Cobb-Douglas/translog production function estimation; IPCC; Production inputs marginal productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069661943

Objectives of the study were (1) to extract LULC status and its change between 2006 and 2016; (2) to predict two different LULC scenarios in 2026 and; (3) to assess LULCC impact on ESVs. Herein, Landsat imageries in 2006, 2011 and 2016 were used to classify LULC types by object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the derived results were applied to predict LULC in 2026 of two scenarios by CLUE-S model and to assess the impact of LULCC on ESVs. Results revealed that paddy field and field crop notably decreased while urban and built-up areas and rangeland dramatically increased over the study periods whereas total ESVs declined from about 145 MM USD in 2006 to 132 MM USD in 2026 of Scenario II and the ESVs of three dominant ecosystem service functions (waste treatment, water supply, and climate regulation) continuously decreased. The impact of LULCC on ESVs remarkably differed among the LULC types. In conclusion, land use and city planners should try to minimize the effect of LULCC on ESVs during the planning process. © 2019, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University.

To maximize storage capacity, various types of saline aquifers should be considered including dynamic storage options with open or semi-open boundaries. In sloping aquifers, assessment of the immobilization potential for CO2 through dissolution and mineralization along the flow path is a crucial part of risk evaluations. The Gassum Formation in the Skagerrak is considered a nearshore CO2 storage option with sloping layers, facilitating buoyant migration of CO2 northwards along depositional and structural dip. In this study, petrographic data and provenance analysis provide the basis for estimating reactivity of the sandstones. Immobilization of CO2 in the reservoir through fluid dissolution and mineral reactions reduces risk of leakage. Petrographic analyses are integrated with seismic and well-log interpretation to identify sedimentary facies and to estimate mineral distribution with corresponding reactivity in the proposed injection area. Here the Gassum Formation comprises south-prograding, shoreface-fluvial para-sequences, sourced from northern hinterlands. Pronounced differences in the mineralogical maturity in the studied area are identified and explained by the sediment transport distances and the type of sediment source. This is possible because the U-Pb ages of zircon grains in the sediments can be used to pinpoint the areas where they originate from in the Fennoscandian Shield, such as the Telemarkia or Idefjorden terranes. Albite and Fe-rich chlorite are identified as the most reactive mineral phases in the Gassum sand, of which feldspar comprises the largest weight fraction and the grain-coating chlorite has largest surface area. Their distribution is partly controlled by provenance, so their abundance decreases basinwards with increasing sediment maturity. The abundance of fluvial sandstones presumably increases northwards in basal parts of para-sequences, while shoreface sandstones comprise the top part of sandy units. CO2 injected in the proposed area will migrate upwards within the reservoir, toward higher proportions of Telemarkian-derived sediment and up-dip along the seal, toward more immature sediments. Thus, the reactivity of sediments increases in younger deposits and up depositional dip, while kinetic reaction rates will decrease in shallower, lower temperature regions. Identifying these parameters is important to estimate the CO2 mineral sequestration potential as a function of sedimentary facies and ensure safe storage of CO2. This approach can advantageously be applied to all reservoirs considered for CO2 injection to improve the estimation of the possible CO2 storage volume by taking the provenance dependence of the mineralization potential into account. © Copyright © 2019 Olivarius, Sundal, Weibel, Gregersen, Baig, Thomsen, Kristensen, Hellevang and Nielsen.","CO2 storage; depositional environments; diagenesis; petrography; reactive minerals; reservoir quality; source to sink; zircon geochronology","Aquifers; Binary alloys; Deposition; Digital storage; Dissolution; Feldspar; Geochronology; Hydrogeology; Lead alloys; Mineralogy; Petrography; Reaction rates; Risk assessment; Sandstone; Sediment transport; Sedimentology; Uranium alloys; Well logging; Zircon; CO2 storage; Depositional environment; diagenesis; Reactive minerals; Reservoir quality; Source to sinks; Carbon dioxide; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; dissolution; facies analysis; fluvial deposit; petrography; provenance; sandstone; sediment transport; uranium-lead dating; zircon; Baltic Shield; East European Craton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074405682

By so doing, the increase observed in energy demand of buildings constitutes a major challenge to the protection of and reduction of greenhouse gases produced by buildings. This constitutes a critical element in the movement towards a more sustainable future. This study examines the indispensable relevance of carrying-out energy performance analysis on a building design blueprints prior to construction. The study employs the use of Autodesk Revit 2014 as a Building Information Modeling (BIM) tool and Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) for energy performance analysis of an existing student housing at Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo state, Nigeria in order to recommend energy efficient strategies that could be implemented at the design phase of the student housing. The energy-saving effects of the different building envelope were investigated and results were analyzed. The annual energy use revealed approximately 60 percent of electricity consumed from the national grid with the left-over 40 percent expelled on fuel. This result was, however, based on an assumption of a 20 hours minimum daily power supply from the national grid. The monthly heating load chart shows that heat is lost from the walls of the building. The walling material has a considerable impact on energy consumption. The simulation results of the existing student housing were compared with eight alternative designs that alter the building envelope and incorporate shading devices to reduce the carbon footprint and energy use. The best alternative design runs reduced the energy consumed yearly from 402, 168 kWh/year to 385, 318kWh/year. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","BIM; Building Envelope; Energy consumption; Energy Efficiency; Sustainability","Architectural design; Carbon footprint; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Solar buildings; Students; Sustainable development; Alternative designs; Building envelopes; Building Information Model - BIM; Design of buildings; Energy efficient building; Energy efficient strategies; Energy-saving effect; Sustainable principles; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077770963

Results: Average mass of litter remaining after exposure ranged from 96.15 g, (V. doniana) to 78.11 g, (S. lafolius) in dry (November to March) and wet (April to October) seasons. Decomposition rate was averagely faster in the wet season (0.0030) than in the dry season (0.0022) with P. curatellifolius (0.0028) and T. avecinioides (0.0039) having the fastest decomposition rates in dry and wet seasons. Mean residence time (days) ranged from 929 to 356, while the time (days) for half the original mass to decompose ranged from 622 to 201 (dry and wet seasons). ANOVA revealed highly significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) in decomposition rates and exposure time (days) and a significant interaction (p &lt; 0.05) between species and exposure time in both seasons. Conclusion: Slow decomposition in the plant leaves implied carbon retention in the ecosystem and slow release of CO2 back to the atmosphere, while nitrogen was mineralized in both seasons. The plants therefore showed effectiveness in nutrient cycling and support productivity in the ecosystem. © 2019 The Author(s).","Decay coefficient; Litter decomposition; Nutrient accumulation index; Nutrient dynamics; Turnover rate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076904886

This has triggered various conflicts in destinations and sparked debates as to how to deal with what is increasingly referred to as ‘overtourism’. Most Destination Marketing Organisations (DMOs) pursue strategies to stimulate arrivals even further. Pro-growth discourses are reinforced by lead bodies such as the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). However, maximisation strategies based on higher numbers of tourists increasingly cause conflicts with local residents, whereas simultaneously undermining climate change mitigation pledges as negotiated in the Paris Agreement. New approaches to destination management based on optimisation are therefore warranted. Drawing on a survey of international tourists (n = 5,249) in south-western Norway, this article discusses whether ‘activities’, i.e. the development of local, small-scale and ideally more sustainable experiences, can contribute to economic growth without necessarily increasing numbers of arrivals. Results confirm that destinations should seek to better understand their markets, including length of stay, spending, and/or activity intention, to identify profitable markets. Ultimately, such knowledge may help addressing overtourism conflicts while building tourism systems that are more economically, socially, and environmentally resilient. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, some strategies to mitigate GHG emission involve greater land-based mitigation efforts, which may cause biodiversity loss from land-use changes. Here we estimate how climate and land-based mitigation efforts interact with global biodiversity by using an integrated assessment model framework to project potential habitat for five major taxonomic groups. We find that stringent GHG mitigation can generally bring a net benefit to global biodiversity even if land-based mitigation is adopted. This trend is strengthened in the latter half of this century. In contrast, some regions projected to experience much growth in land-based mitigation efforts (i.e., Europe and Oceania) are expected to suffer biodiversity loss. Our results support the enactment of stringent GHG mitigation policies in terms of biodiversity. To conserve local biodiversity, however, these policies must be carefully designed in conjunction with land-use regulations and societal transformation in order to minimize the conversion of natural habitats. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"biodiversity; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; land use change; mitigation; strategic approach; article; biodiversity; climate; Europe; greenhouse gas; habitat; land use; Pacific islands; Amphibia; animal; bird; climate; climate change; ecosystem; ecosystem restoration; greenhouse gas; mammal; procedures; reptile; vascular plant; Europe; Amphibians; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Climate Change; Climatic Processes; Ecosystem; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Greenhouse Gases; Mammals; Reptiles; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075458234

The aim of this study was to survey high-volume thoracic surgeons who perform robot-assisted lobectomy to understand and consolidate common themes of port placement. Methods: An electronic online survey was created, and the link was emailed to the 100 highest volume robotic thoracic surgeons in the United States. The survey included an interactive graphical interface, which allowed each respondent to mark the preferential robotic port placement in the chest wall for each of the 5 pulmonary lobectomies. Results were analyzed individually and in aggregate. A heat map was generated to show trends. Results: One hundred surgeons were surveyed (response rate: 62%). Most (90%) respondents utilized a 4-arm approach and 79% used a completely 4-arm portal approach with CO2 insufflation. Exact locations for each robotic port were reported by 60% of the surveyed surgeons and the results varied; however, most surgeons generally used the seventh to ninth interspaces for the camera and instruments. The use of multiple different interspace levels was common. Ninety-four percent of respondents used an additional nonrobotic assistant port. Conclusions: There is not a universal port strategy for robot-assisted lobectomy. However, placement of the camera and robotic ports low in the seventh to ninth interspaces is the most common approach. There are some nuances of stapling port strategies and sequence of port placement, which are identified. © The Author(s) 2019.","lobectomy; port strategies; robot-assisted lobectomy","anatomical concepts; Article; body position; clinical practice; human; lung lobe; lung lobectomy; port placement; priority journal; robot assisted surgery; thoracic surgeon; thorax surgery; thorax wall; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; aeration; anatomy and histology; devices; epidemiology; lung; lung resection; procedures; questionnaire; robotic surgical procedure; self report; surgeon; surgery; surgical equipment; thorax surgery; United States; carbon dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Humans; Insufflation; Lung; Pneumonectomy; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Self Report; Surgeons; Surgical Instruments; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thoracic Surgical Procedures; Thoracic Wall; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075366581

Industrial Scientific ITX 6 multi-gas analyzer, Land Duo Emission Analyzer, Handheld Aerosol Monitor Model 1055 and Quest Sound Level Meter, Model 2400 were used in the analysis. Also, empirical investigation, as well as reconnaissance surveys were carried out by the administration of well-structured residential and industrial question forms. The result of the analysis showed that there was a 3.1% reduction in the level of SPM measured with lower value than the required limit for 8 hours exposure. Reduced levels of CO and CO2 were observed from the average readings taken from 2014 and 2015 with 24.81% and 31.4% reduction in the average reading respectively for two consecutive years. Noise level detected at the several locations varied from 49.8 to 69.6 dβ.The outcome of the research showed that appropriate measures must be put in place by industries to reduce air pollution now and in the foreseeable future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Cement Industry; Industrial Scientific multi-gas analyzer; noise level; Pollution; Suspected Particulate Matter","Air pollution; Cement industry; Cements; Industrial emissions; Pollution; Reduction; Sulfur compounds; Empirical investigation; Gas analyzers; Industrial cluster; Lower explosive limits; Noise levels; Oxides of nitrogen; Particulate Matter; Reconnaissance surveys; Particles (particulate matter)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077782642

It does so by following the work of a community artist, working as a kindergarten teacher, over 1 year. Design/Approach/Methods: Through a narrative inquiry approach, which also includes studies of archival data and field notes, we analyze how local and personally experienced weather events imply what we call “cultures of exploration” in institutional practices. The epistemologies cross the specter of cultural–historical, pragmatic, and deep ecological philosophy. Findings: Through this study, we exemplify how experiencing weather is intertwined into pedagogical practices like habituating the body to cope with cold and wet weather, learning about danger in a wild natural landscape, and valuing species as a powerful practice. The descriptions exemplify “cultures of exploration” as a pedagogical approach. Originality/Value: In this time of an increasing climate crisis on our planet, the value of our findings is to foreground new insights, awareness, and knowledge relevant to children; to early-childhood education; and to life and societies at large. We can thus develop methods to better care for, protect, and educate children. This article has the potential to show how weather events are intertwined with everyday institutional practices—as well as how children, through exploration, learn to cope with seasonal weather landscapes and local cultural adaptations. © The Author(s) 2019.","Cultures of exploration; narrative inquiry; pedagogical practice; weather events; weather landscapes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098274088

This is lacking in a country like Nigeria without a functional cardiac hospital.Objective: To review and compare the various models being adopted towards establishing a sustainable open heart surgery programme in Nigeria.Materials and Methods: For ethnic and cultural reasons, Nigeria is divided into six geopolitical regions. Each region has one or more Federal Teaching Hospitals including medical centres. The hospitals have trained cardiothoracic surgeons and cardiologists as well as other auxiliary staff. After attainment of democratic rule in 1999, individual hospitals have devised various models to establish sustainable open heart surgery programme. The number of hospitals in each region, the models devised, and the limitations including the outcome were studied and analysed.Results: Each geopolitical zone has about three to four centres, either public or private, trying to establish the programme. There are six different models. Each centre has been trying the different models since the year 2000. The oldest of the model is cardiac mission and the newest is employment of highly skilled retired expatriate consultant cardiac surgeon to help develop the local team.

Environmental and health concerns are the major motivation for combustion engines research, especially finding sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels and reducing diesel PM emissions. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), including RME, are renewable fuels commonly used from low level blends with diesel to full substitution. They strongly reduce the net carbon dioxide emissions. It is largely unknown how the emissions and characteristics of PM get altered by the combined effect of adding biodiesel to diesel and implementing modern engine concepts that reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Therefore, the exhaust from a single-cylinder Scania D13 heavy-duty (HD) diesel engine fuelled with petroleum-based MK1 diesel, RME, and a 20% RME blend (B20), was sampled while the inlet oxygen concentration was stepped from ambient to very low by varying EGR. Regulated gaseous emissions, mass of total black carbon (BC) and organic aerosol (OA), particle size distributions and the soot nanostructure by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were studied. For all EGR levels, RME showed reduced BC emissions (factor 2 for low and 3-4 for higher EGR) and total particulate number count (TPNC) compared with diesel and B20. B20 was closer to diesel than RME in emission levels. RME opens a significant possibility to utilise higher levels of EGR and stay in the region of low NOx, while not producing more soot than with diesel and B20. Adding EGR to 15% inlet O2 did not affect the nanostructure of PM. A difference between the fuels was noticeable: Branched agglomerates of diesel and RME were composed of many primary particles, whereas those of B20 were more often ""melted"" together (necking). © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Digital television; Esters; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fatty acids; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Nanostructures; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Powertrains; Soot; Carbon dioxide emissions; Combustion engines; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Fatty acid methyl ester; Oxygen concentrations; Rapeseed oil methyl ester; Regulated emissions; Soot nanostructures; Biodiesel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093900743

However, concessions are typically incompletely planted to varying degrees, leaving much land unused. The remaining forests within such concessions are at high risk of deforestation, as there are normally no legal hurdles to their clearance, therefore making them excellent targets for conservation. We investigated the location of oil palm plantations and the other major crop – rubber plantations in southern Myanmar, and compared them to concession boundaries. Our results show that rubber plantations cover much larger areas than oil palm in the region, indicating that rubber is the region’s preferred crop. Furthermore, only 15% of the total concession area is currently planted with oil palm (49,000 ha), while 25,000 ha is planted outside concession boundaries. While this may in part be due to uncertain and/or changing boundaries, this leaves most of the concession area available for other land uses, including forest conservation and communities’ livelihood needs. Reconsidering the remaining concession areas can also significantly reduce future emission risks from the region. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"palm oil; agriculture; Arecaceae; chemistry; environmental protection; forest; geography; Myanmar; physiology; Agriculture; Arecaceae; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Geography; Myanmar; Palm Oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070737750

Due to the complexity of the combustion process inside the engine, the use of renewable fuels can have a disadvantageous effect on the other emissions of the engine. Most of the researchers have focused on the use of renewable fuel in the internal combustion engine to study their effect on the engine emission but these studies are based on steady-state test and these tests can never correlate with the emission generated by the vehicle in a real-world scenario. The study has been performed to observe the effect of the use of biodiesel, ethanol and diesel blend while running the compression ignition engine in transient condition. Carbon monoxide CO, carbon dioxide CO2, and oxides of nitrogen NOx were analyzed on a 2.289L diesel engine. The results showed that the use of ethanol in a fraction of 15% produce less amount of CO2, and NOx but a higher amount of CO in the exhaust. Use of biodiesel slightly decreases the CO emission in the exhaust while being operated at low and medium speed condition. While NOx and CO2 emission increases due to the higher oxygen content in the biodiesel as well as due to a higher temperature in the exhaust. The study has also observed that ternary blends have helped in emission reduction while running the engine in transient condition. © 2019 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Binary blends; Diesel engine; Emissions; Ternary blends",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084263136

Also, a battery bank was utilized as a backup system to increase system reliability in autonomy days. The idea of using PVWPS during non-irrigation months of the year in order to earn money through the sale of electricity generation from solar panels to the grid is one of the main objectives of this research which has not been considered in the previous works. Also, in this research, economic and environmental aspects about PVWPS have been performed and the system performance has been compared with conventional diesel pumping systems (CPS). The results show that although the initial cost of PVWPS in off-grid mode is 2.14 times of the CPS initial cost, its operating and maintenance costs and total life cycle cost (LCC) are respectively 8.7 times and 29.9% lower than that of costs of CPS. Also, the initial cost of PVWPS in the on-grid mode is slightly more than about 2.41 times of the cost of the initial CPS, but its O &amp; M and LCC costs are 7.25 times and 16% lower than those for CPS, while in the case of selling electricity to the grid, it could generate income of $ 8212 in project lifetime, which is equivalent to 59.9% of LCC of the system and results in reducing the costs by 189.2% compared with the final cost of the CPS. Additionally, from environmental viewpoint, the results showed that CO2 production for off-grid PVWPS during the lifetime of the project is 190–201 times lower than that for the CPS and compared with the supply of power to the motor pump from the grid, CO2 emissions reduced 16.96 times. Also, by replacing the CPS with PVWPS during irrigation period, it can save about 1820–1722 L of diesel fuel and 85 L of engine oil. Additionally, in on-grid operation, the PVWPS leads to about 71% reduction in noise production than CPS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Charge controller; CO2 gas emissions; Noise emission; Power purchase agreement; Solar water pump","Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Electric power transmission networks; Gas emissions; Irrigation; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Pumping plants; Pumps; Water management; Battery; Charge controllers; Noise emissions; Power purchase agreement; Solar water pumps; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070605101

The goal of this study was to identify the prevalence, distribution and types of hearing loss among children aged 2-5 in a sample of kindergartens in Hai Duong Province, Vietnam, in 2018. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged 2-5 years old at 4 kindergartens in Hai Duong Province, Vietnam. This study included the following three steps: a two-step otoacoustic emission (OAE) program, completed by an auditory brainstem response (ABR) for the positive diagnosis of hearing impairment. Results: The subjects of the study were 1,090 children aged 2-5 years old who underwent hearing screening at kindergartens in Hai Duong Province, Vietnam. The percentage of children with true hearing loss was 4.7%, confirmed by ABR. The majority of the hearing loss in the children was conductive hearing loss (74.5%). Mild hearing loss (21-40 dB) accounted for nearly half of the children with hearing loss (49.0%). Conclusion: The study found that hearing loss is common among preschool children in Vietnam. Routine hearing screening of school-aged children should be included in annual school health programs in Vietnam. © Advanced Scientific Research.

As a result, individual nations who are signatory to the Paris Agreement have developed ambitious carbon reduction targets in order to restrict temperature rises to two degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve these ambitious goals, nations have a variety of policy approaches at their disposal including feed in tariffs, fossil fuel restrictions, carbon capture and storage, renewable portfolio standards and carbon trading regimes. This study investigates carbon trading, and, using Japan as a case study assesses the economic feasibility and environmental efficiency of a carbon trading scheme underpinned by renewable energy deployment. The model employed uses an optimization approach, cognizant of technological, geographic and economic constraints. Findings identify that such an approach incorporating the 47 prefectures of Japan could engender a 42% reduction in emissions without resilience constraints and 34% incorporating a best-mix, resilient approach. Both approaches prove feasible at moderate carbon prices, considering international norms.

The existence of incipient granulite-facies metamorphism (charnockite formation) and closely associated migmatization (melting) in 2.5 Ga-old gneisses in a quarry exposure in southern India and elsewhere, with structural, chemical and mineral-inclusion evidence of fluid action, has encouraged a wetter approach, in consideration of aqueous fluids for rock melting which maintain sufficiently low H2O activity for granulite-facies metamorphism. Existing experimental data at elevated T and P are sufficient to demonstrate that, at mid-crust pressures of 0.5–0.6 GPa and metamorphic temperatures above 700 °C, ascending immiscible CO2-rich and concentrated alkali chloride aqueous fluids in equilibrium with charnockitic (orthopyroxene-bearing) gneiss will inevitably begin to melt granitic rocks. The experimental data show that H2O activity is much higher (0.5–0.6) than previously portrayed for beginning granulite facies metamorphism (0.15–0.3). Possibilities for metasomatism of the deep crust are greatly enhanced over the ultra-dry models traditionally espoused. Streaming of ultrasaline fluids through continental crust could be a mechanism for the generation of the discrete mid-crust layer of migmatites suggested to characterize younger tectonometamorphic regions. The action of CO2-rich and hypersaline fluids in Late Archean metamorphism and magmatism could record the beginning of large-scale subduction of volatile-rich surficial materials. © 2019","Archean crust; Charnockite; Closepet Granite; Continental evolution; Granite; Metasomatism; Saline fluids; Southern India","Archean; charnockite; continental crust; granite; granulite facies; metasomatism; migmatization; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072797519

Its treatment represents a worldwide challenge since landfilling is still a major treatment method and the respective emissions of greenhouse gases are significant. Approximately 126 Mt of municipal solid waste were landfilled or incinerated within the EU-28 in 2017, while the waste management sector produced 3% of the overall greenhouse gases emissions. Regarding mixed municipal waste, Waste-to-Energy plants seem to be a suitable disposal option as they substitute both landfills and energy production from fossil fuels in combined heat and power plants. However, new treatment facilities of this type need to take into account also the heat and electricity demands in their vicinity to ensure economic stability. This paper therefore analyses the relationship between greenhouse gases emissions and the cost of mixed municipal waste treatment, while considering environmental impact of different treatment options. A reverse logistic (mixed integer programming) model has been developed to optimise future strategies of mixed municipal waste treatment in a large geographical area. The model is nonlinear because of the nonlinear nature of the cost of mixed municipal waste treatment as well as the economic incentive associated with the avoided greenhouse gases emissions. These, in turn, are influenced by plant capacities, locations, and other location-specific parameters (such as the yearly heat demand profile) that must be considered during the integration of a future plant into the existing district heating systems. The results are presented through a case study for the Czech Republic, with 206 micro-regions (waste producers), 148 landfills, 113 potential mechanical-biological treatment plants, 24 potential locations for plants utilising refuse-derived fuels, 4 existing Waste-to-Energy plants, and 32 candidate locations for new Waste-to-Energy plants have been considered. The proposed future concepts involving various processing chains (small Waste-to-Energy plant, large Waste-to-Energy plant with the necessary complex logistics, mechanical biological treatment prior to incineration), are compared with the current (2016) waste treatment strategy, in which 73% of mixed municipal waste is landfilled. The trade-off between economically viable and environmentally acceptable solution is also targeted. The obtained data suggest a possible reduction in greenhouse gases emissions by almost 150% with the cost of waste treatment being increased only by approx. 2.5 EUR/t. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission cost; Facility location; Greenhouse gas; Greenhouse gas reduction; Optimisation; Waste treatment","Biochemical engineering; Cogeneration plants; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; District heating; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Land fill; Location; Municipal solid waste; Refuse derived fuels; Waste incineration; Emission costs; Environmentally acceptable; Facility locations; Greenhouse gas reductions; Greenhouse gases emissions; Mechanical-biological treatment; Mixed integer programming; Optimisations; Waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071101356

We evaluate the various options for correcting this by introducing a stable, long-term climate change policy that integrates efficiently with electricity policy objectives.

A promising intervention is through restoring tidal exchange to impounded coastal wetlands for reduced methane (CH 4 ) emissions. We monitored an impounded wetland’s GHG flux (CO 2 and CH 4 ) prior to and following tidal reinstatement. We found that biogeochemical responses varied across an elevation gradient. The low elevation zone experienced a greater increase in water level and an associated greater marine transition in the sediment microbial community (16 S rRNA) than the high elevation zone. The low elevation zone’s GHG emissions had a reduced sustained global warming potential of 264 g m −2 yr −1 CO 2 -e over 100 years, and it increased to 351 g m −2 yr −1 with the removal of extreme rain events. However, emission benefits were achieved through a reduction in CO 2 emissions, not CH 4 emissions. Overall, the wetland shifted from a prior CH 4 sink (−0.07 to −1.74 g C m −2 yr −1 ) to a variable sink or source depending on the elevation site and rainfall. This highlights the need to consider a wetland’s initial GHG emissions, elevation and future rainfall trends when assessing the efficacy of tidal reinstatement for GHG emission control. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062837817

The pricing procedure is modeled in the form of the optimization problem. The objectives of this problem are total emission and network loss. The feasible region of the problem is determined with the aforementioned objectives, locational marginal prices and power factors of DERs as decision variables. In the recommended method, the loss/emission reduction is implemented by the generation of the DERs. furthermore, the profits of loss/emission reduction are allocated between DERs. In this way, more contribution consequent to more production leads to a higher price for DERs in comparison to the predefined market price. Given the nature of the problem, which has two objectives, a Group Search Optimization is employed with Chaotic search and Covariance matrix as a Multi-Objective problem (MGSOACC) to solve the pricing problem. Due to the validation of the proposed algorithm, a comparison between MOPSO, MOPSO-DFR, Moga, and NSGA-II is applied consequently. In addition, the proposed method allows the decision-makers to apply their preferences among loss/emission reduction and IDSO's benefit.

This is aggravated by climate change. In order to reduce this vulnerability, governments have invested heavily in developing coastal infrastructures. One type of infrastructure development regards polders (i.e., pieces of land previously subject to permanent or temporal overflow that are now surrounded by embankments that prevent inundation). The impact of polderization on livelihood vulnerability is not straightforward and is therefore still poorly understood. In order to analyze such impacts, we present a comparative case study of four polders in Bangladesh that are characterized by varying societal circumstances, hydrological conditions, hydrological interventions, and different levels of community response to polderization. How does livelihood vulnerability vary temporally and spatially in polders, and what explains such variation? We use data collected via 162 surveys, 40 semi-structured interviews, and secondary research to analyze trends in the scores of the livelihood vulnerability index. Based on our analysis, we argue that after accounting for interactions amongst variables like hydrological conditions, hydrological interventions, community response, and other societal factors, livelihood vulnerability is lower in polders characterized by higher community involvement in using hydrological interventions to control the flow of saline water. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Community governance; Drainage congestion; Land-water dynamics; Livelihood vulnerability index; Salinity intrusion; Vulnerability","climate change; comparative study; drainage basin; governance approach; index method; livelihood; questionnaire survey; saline intrusion; vulnerability; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082325161

In a Dual Fuel (DF) NG/Diesel configuration, NG offers interesting possibilities in terms of nitrogen oxides and soot emissions abatement, with reduced CO2 levels. Despite a proven feasibility of the DF concept for heavy duty engines, its applicability to light duty engines still clashes with several issues, especially the high unburned hydrocarbons emission. The present activity was devoted to assess the potentiality of an optimized DF engine calibration, to minimize GHGs emissions. A first experimental campaign on an automotive Diesel engine, equipped with an advanced combustion control, illustrated the effects of crucial control parameters on DF combustion. Hence, an optimization procedure permitted to identify the optimal set of control parameters. Finally, experiments in steady state and transient conditions allowed quantifying the THC and CO2 emissions reductions achievable moving from a starting DF engine map to the optimized calibration. The investigations highlighted that an adequate engine recalibration can offer a CO2 saving of about 12%, compared to the standard Diesel configuration, whereas the detrimental effect in terms of THC emissions could not be fully eliminated. Nevertheless, compared to a non-recalibrated DF map, the engine parameters optimization allowed achieving a THCs reduction of roughly 50%. Reported results could provide valuable information on behavior tendencies of a DF engine, useful for the development of dedicated engine technologies for DF combustion systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Calibration optimization; Control parameters; Dual Fuel engines; GHG; Natural gas; RCCI engines","Calibration; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Proven reserves; Behavior tendencies; Control parameters; Experimental campaign; Heavy duty engines; Light duty engines; Optimization procedures; Steady state and transients; Unburned hydrocarbons; Automobile engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072174289

Natural gas is regarded as an effective alternative energy to tackle exacerbated air pollution. In this study, we investigated the impacts of natural gas infrastructures and consumption on the annual average PM2.5 concentrations covering 204 of China's prefecture-level cities during the period from 2008 to 2016. To take the potential spatial spillovers and dynamics of PM2.5 concentrations into consideration, the appropriate dynamic spatial econometric models were mainly utilized. The main findings of the study are that the deployment of natural gas pipelines and gas consumption can effectively mitigate the PM2.5 concentrations. The existence of a significant spatial correlation of PM2.5 concentrations at the city level implies that PM2.5 concentrations in different regions influence each other, especially PM2.5 hot-spots can disperse to the surrounding areas. Our results also emphasize that the environmental effect exhibits obvious heterogeneity in the user and regional aspects, and, since the results are relatively robust in various model specifications and subsamples, our findings hold significant implications for the Chinese PM2.5 alleviation policy. © 2019","Energy consumption; Energy infrastructure; PM2.5 concentrations; Prefecture-level cities; Route dependence; Spillover effect","Energy utilization; Gas industry; Gases; Natural gas; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Energy infrastructures; PM2.5 concentration; Prefecture-level cities; Route dependence; Spillover effects; Natural gas pipelines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070712740

In this study, N2O emission was measured in the aerobic and Aerobic-Anaerobic Landfill Method (AALM) with or without leachate recirculation at two aeration rates in synthetic MSW. The experiment was carried out for six Plexiglass® landfill simulation reactors. Low aeration (1.6 l/kg-DM/h) was supplied in RLA, RLAA (Recirculatory) and LAA (non-recirculatory) reactors, while an aeration rate three times higher (4.8 l/kg-DM/h) was performed for RHA, RHAA, and HAA reactors. Based on the supplied leachate quantity, leachate recirculation was performed in five different phases. The results showed that a significant amount of N2O was produced in all reactors. The largest N2O emission of 0.11 and 0.13 g/kg-DM were observed in the RHA and RHAA reactors, respectively. Higher N2O and cumulative GHG was produced in high aeration reactors compared to the low aeration reactors. Recirculated leachate promoted waste stabilization, as reflected in the diminishing CH4 production and other leachate pollutant parameters, especially NH4 +-N. It has been evaluated that in the operative or newly placed waste landfill, in-situ aeration with leachate recirculation exhibits the significant N2O production. However, lower amount of leachate in the later stage beneficial to inhibit the N2O production. It is recommended that in-situ aeration will become more effective after the recovery of CH4 from newly placed waste in an operative landfill for net GHG reduction, especially N2O reduction and early stabilization of landfills. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aerobic-anaerobic landfill method; Intermittent aeration; Leachate recirculation; Municipal solid waste; N2O emission, bioreactor","Greenhouse gases; Leachate treatment; Nitrogen oxides; Stabilization; Aerobic-anaerobic; Intermittent aeration; Leachate quantities; Leachate recirculation; Municipal solid waste landfills; Nitrous oxide production; Pollutant parameters; Waste stabilization; Municipal solid waste; ammonia; methane; nitrous oxide; aeration; anoxic conditions; bioreactor; degradation; landfill; leachate; municipal solid waste; nitrous oxide; numerical model; optimization; oxic conditions; aeration; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; landfill; landfill leachate; municipal solid waste; priority journal; process optimization; solid waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071340061

This review briefly summarizes the largest opportunities and discusses barriers to electrification and policy experience to date. Recent Findings: Recent developments include new rate structures for electric vehicle chargers, growing programs to target electric vehicles for disadvantaged communities and to promote heat pumps for buildings, and interest in mandates including zero emission vehicle sales-share requirements and prohibiting use of natural gas in new building construction. Summary: The opportunity for carbon reductions and increased electricity sales from electrification is highest in the transportation sector. Electrification challenges include economics, consumer acceptance, electric grid impacts, and limited product availability and dealer/contractor acceptance for some market segments. Current policies to promote electrification emphasize incentives and mandates. In the transportation sector, evaluations find that a combination of policies working together can have a substantial impact on EV sales. In the residential sector, upstream incentives paid to wholesalers and midstream incentives paid to contractors have worked well.

Our vulnerability study uses a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate climate change vulnerability of an urbanized coastal community that could serve as a model approach for communities worldwide, particularly in similar Mediterranean climates. We synthesize projected changes in climate, coastal erosion and flooding, watershed runoff and impacts to two important coastal ecosystems, sandy beaches and coastal salt marshes. Using downscaled climate models along with other regional models, we find that temperature, extreme heat events, and sea level are expected to increase in the future, along with more intense rainfall events, despite a negligible change in annual rainfall. Consequently, more droughts are expected but the magnitude of larger flood events will increase. Associated with the continuing rise of mean sea level, extreme coastal water levels will occur with increasingly greater magnitudes and frequency. Severe flooding will occur for both natural (wetlands, beaches) and built environments (airport, harbor, freeway, and residential areas). Adaptation actions can reduce the impact of rising sea level, which will cause losses of sandy beach zones and salt marsh habitats that support the highest biodiversity in these ecosystems, including regionally rare and endangered species, with substantial impacts occurring by 2050. Providing for inland transgression of coastal habitats, effective sediment management, reduced beach grooming and removal of shoreline armoring are adaptations that would help maintain coastal ecosystems and the beneficial services they provide. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coastal ecosystems; Local government; Santa Barbara; Vulnerability assessment","Beaches; Biodiversity; Climate change; Climate models; Conservation; Floods; Rain; Sea level; Water levels; Wetlands; Coastal communities; Coastal ecosystems; Local government; Mediterranean climates; Multi-disciplinary approach; Rare and endangered species; Santa Barbara; Vulnerability assessments; Ecosystems; adaptive management; beach nourishment; biodiversity; climate change; coastal water; coastal zone; ecological impact; environmental assessment; interdisciplinary approach; local government; marine ecosystem; Mediterranean environment; saltmarsh; vulnerability; California; Santa Barbara [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072262589

At the same time, data for planning are scarce for many places in Europe. In this study, we developed an open source dataset of gross floor area and energy demand for space heating and hot water in residential and tertiary buildings at the hectare level for EU28 + Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland. This methodology is based on a top-down approach, starting from a consistent dataset at the country level (NUTS 0), breaking this down to the NUTS 3 level and further to the hectare level by means of a series of regional indicators. We compare this dataset with data from other sources for 20 places in Europe. This process shows that the data for some places fit well, while for others, large differences up to 45% occur. The discussion of these results shows that the other data sources used for this comparison are also subject to considerable uncertainties. A comparison of the developed data with maps based on municipal building stock data for three cities shows that the developed dataset systematically overestimates the gross floor area and heat demand in low density areas and vice versa. We conclude that these data are useful for strategic purposes on aggregated level of larger regions and municipalities. It is especially valuable in locations where no detailed data is available. For detailed planning of heating and cooling infrastructure, local data should be used instead. We believe our work contributes towards a transparent, open source dataset for heating and cooling planning that can be regularly updated and is easily accessible and usable for further research and planning activities. © 2019 by the authors.","Building stock; Heat density map; Heat map; Heating; Open data; Spatial analysis","Economics; Floors; Heating; Building stocks; Detailed planning; Heat density; Heat maps; Heating and cooling; Municipal buildings; Spatial analysis; Top down approaches; Open Data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077239908

In this paper, role of Andaman and Nicobar islands (ANIs) in the formation of eddies along the WBoB is studied using an ocean general circulation model. Our analysis shows that, in the absence of ANIs, there is a significant reduction in the total number of mesoscale eddies in this region. The impact is particularly evident for the cyclonic eddies as a reduction of ~50% can be noticed in the absence of the islands. In contrast, influence of ANIs on anticyclonic eddies is not homogeneous in the WBoB; while absence of ANIs significantly increases anticyclonic eddies in the central part of the WBoB, a decrease can be noticed in the southern part.

The Southern Ocean currently takes up more CO2 than any other and it is likely to have played a crucial role in regulating past atmospheric CO2. However, the physical, biological and chemical variables that control ocean–atmosphere CO2 exchange during glacial–interglacial cycles are not completely understood. Here we use boron isotopes and carbon isotopes in planktonic foraminifera and an alkenone-based proxy of temperature to reconstruct seawater pH and CO2 partial pressure in sub-Antarctic surface waters south of Tasmania over the past 25,000 years, and investigate the mechanisms that regulate seawater CO2. The new record shows that surface waters in this region were a sink for atmospheric CO2 during the Last Glacial Maximum. Our reconstruction suggests changes in the strength of the biological pump and the release of deep-ocean CO2 to surface waters contributed to the last deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2. These findings demonstrate that variations in upwelling intensity and the distribution of Southern Ocean water masses in this sector played a key role in regulating atmospheric CO2 during the last glacial–interglacial cycle. © 2019, Crown.",,"alkenone; biogeochemistry; biological pump; carbon cycle; deep sea; deglaciation; Last Glacial Maximum; partial pressure; planktonic foraminifera; reconstruction; seawater; Australia; Southern Ocean; Tasmania; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074784748

We first show that LEAP is able to simulate historical observations of energy generation and consumption from 2001 to 2018. We then simulate future electricity generation through 2060 under the same demand projections and different energy mix solutions. Results of our simulations are as follows. (i) Water heating accounts for 71% of the total water-related uses and its energy needs are projected to double in 2060, due to population growth; the energy required to treat and move water is instead expected to decrease by 9%, mainly because of declining agricultural water demands. (ii) Energy mix solutions that transition faster to renewable sources are more sustainable than a business as usual scenario that relies more on fossil fuels, because renewable technologies require less water for electricity generation (−35%) and reduce CO2 emissions (−57%). (iii) The aggressive transition to renewable energy is projected to have higher structural costs than the business as usual scenario, but comparable total expenses because of the lower operational cost of renewable technologies.

A key factor affecting range-shifts is the interaction with predators. Small mammals, being primary seed predators and dispersers in forest ecosystems, may play a major role in determining which plant species will successfully expand and the rate at which range-shifts will occur. Plants dispersing seeds beyond the species’ current range limits will encounter seed predators to which these seeds are novel; however, empirical studies of seed predator–novel seed interactions are lacking. The aims of our study were to: 1) quantify seed selection by small mammals presented with ‘novel’ seeds; 2) quantify the post-selection fate of ‘novel’ seeds; and 3) identify seed traits that affect seed selection and post-selection seed fate. We designed a field experiment exposing small mammal communities to novel seeds produced by plants expected to shift their ranges in response to climate change. We matched novel seeds with reference ‘familiar’ seeds and studied key steps defining interactions between small mammals and novel seeds. We found that the probability of selection of a novel seed varied among species and was, at times, higher than the selection probability of familiar seeds. Key traits that affected seed selection and the distance a seed was dispersed for caching were shell hardness and seed mass. We also found that 33% of dispersed seeds were cached in optimal germination sites (e.g. within fallen logs and buried under the leaf litter mat). Through seed emergence trials we found that emergence was higher for larger seeds, suggesting that the role of small mammals may be modulated by emergence rates. Our results suggest that the interaction between small mammals and novel seeds may have cascading effects on climate-induced plant range shifts and community composition. © 2019 The Authors.

In contrast to private electric vehicles, electric taxis need to recharge in a short time due to their constant operation and different driving patterns. Therefore, fast charging stations are required to meet the demand for recharging electric taxis and should be located at strategic places. To improve the sustainable planning of urban infrastructures, this paper presents a methodology to help in decision making for installing fast charging stations, considering the criteria of all urban planners involved in the installation process. The result of the proposal is a spatial database that identifies locations for charging stations that meet the predefined criteria. Such database can be visualized in geographic information systems of the urban planning department or the electrical service concessionaire. The proposed methodology is tested in a Brazilian medium-sized city showing the importance of this information in decision making. The proposal is compared with another spatial methodology, showing that the proposed method creates a better spatial distribution of charging stations giving better options for the main agents interested in the city. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Charging stations; Electric taxis; Geospatial analysis; Sustainable planning policies; Transportation networks; Urban infrastructures","Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Decision making; Electric vehicles; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Charging station; Geo-spatial analysis; Sustainable planning; Transportation network; Urban infrastructure; Urban transportation; atmospheric pollution; decision making; electric vehicle; infrastructure; methodology; planning process; pollution control; spatial analysis; strategic approach; transportation planning; urban area; urban planning; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071857747

However, the policy faces acceptance problems from the majority of the public. In the framework of the project Role of technologies in an energy effcient economy-model-based analysis of policy measures and transformation pathways to a sustainable energy system (REEEM), financed by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 program, we investigate the effects of such a policy in order to understand its challenges and opportunities. To that end, we use a recursive-dynamic multi-regional Computable General Equilibrium model to represent carbon pricing as a cap-and-trade system and calculate its impacts on consumption of energy goods, incidence of carbon prices, and gross income growth for different income groups. We compare one reference scenario and four scenario variations with distinct CO2 reduction targets inside and outside of the EU. The results demonstrate that higher emission reductions, compared to the reference scenario, lead to slower Gross Domestic Product growth, but also produce a more equitable increase of gross income and can help reduce income inequalities. In this case, considering that the revenues of carbon pricing are paid back to the households, the gross income of the poorest quintile grows as much as, or even more in some cases, than the gross income of the richest quintile. © 2019 by the authors.","Cap-and-trade; Carbon market; Carbon pricing; CGE; Energy Economics; Energy Modeling; Energy Policy; Income distribution; Scenario analysis","carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; emission control; energy policy; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Commission; European Union; Gross Domestic Product; income distribution; long-term change; scenario analysis; sustainability; sustainable development; trade-environment relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076712537

Implementation of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) allows for development of designs targeting desired habitats or species groups. This study investigated short-term changes in a plant community following implementation of a SUDS designed to enhance nature quality of a 4.8 ha urban grassland in Lynge, Denmark. Dry basins allowed for water detention with construction entailing terrain modifications, seeding of target species and changes to water dynamics, resulting in four treatments differing in soil conditions and water regimes. Plant species richness and composition were documented before (2012) and two years after (2015 and 2016) implementation of the SUDS. A floral resources index was composed to assess the quality of the flora as foraging resource for four groups of bees. Plant species richness, alpha- and beta-diversity as well as frequency of target plant species significantly increased after SUDS construction, as did floral resources for bees. Increased alpha diversity was primarily seen in areas around dry basins, while the increase in overall beta-diversity related to a shift in plant community composition within dry basins.

This is due to their remarkable properties, which among others include high surface areas, high porosity, tunability, high thermal, and chemical stability. However, despite their extraordinary properties, their lack of processability due to their inherent powdery nature presents a constraining factor for their full potential for applications in hydrogen storage systems. Additionally, the poor thermal conductivity in some of these materials also contributes to the limitations for their use in this type of application. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies for producing functional porous composites that are easy-to-handle and with enhanced heat transfer properties while still retaining their high hydrogen adsorption capacities. Herein, we present a simple shaping approach for ZTCs and their MOFs composite using a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1). The intrinsic characteristics of the individual porous materials are transferred to the resulting composites leading to improved processability without adversely altering their porous nature. The surface area and hydrogen uptake capacity for the obtained shaped composites were found to be within the range of 1,054–2,433 m2g−1 and 1.22–1.87 H2 wt. %, respectively at 1 bar and 77 K. In summary, the synergistic performance of the obtained materials is comparative to their powder counterparts with additional complementing properties. © Copyright © 2019 Molefe, Musyoka, Ren, Langmi, Mathe and Ndungu.","hydrogen storage; metal organic frameworks; physisorption; polymers of intrinsic microporosity; zeolite templated carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077303562

In addition to the common threats associated with the decline of these species, climate change is a rapidly emerging threat. Climate predictions for Illinois have estimated that summer temperatures will resemble present-day summers in Texas by mid- to late-century, while precipitation patterns are less predictable. Using NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) tool we evaluated the climate change vulnerability for all 331 of Illinois T & E plant species. Overall, we found that over 80% are vulnerable to climate change. Barriers to migration are a leading factor associated with vulnerability in Illinois, where 97% of listed species are affected by anthropogenic barriers and 24% are affected by natural barriers. The sensitivity of species to changes in temperature, precipitation, and hydrology are also associated with vulnerability. The CCVI score was associated with most of the dozen or so other factors incorporated in the tool, though to a lesser degree. This study provides insights into the most vulnerable plant species in Illinois and provides much needed information to land managers, policy makers, and researchers. By highlighting which T & E species are most vulnerable to climate change, and what factors are most responsible for their vulnerability, this work will aid in prioritizing limited resources and developing adaptation strategies for them. © 2019 Southern Appalachian Botanical Society.","climate change vulnerability; conservation planning; migration barriers; rare plants","climate change; conservation planning; policy making; rare species; vulnerability; Illinois; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076722287

Coastal freshwater forested wetlands are likely to experience increased hydroperiod with rising sea level, as well as saltwater intrusion. These potential changes to wetland hydrology may also alter forested wetland structure and lead to a transition from forest to shrub/marsh wetland ecosystems. Loss of forested wetlands is already evident by dying trees and dead standing trees (""ghost"" forests) along the Atlantic coast of the US, which will result in significant alterations to plant carbon (C) inputs, particularly that of coarse woody debris, to soils. We investigated the effects of salinity and wood C inputs on soils collected from a coastal freshwater forested wetland in North Carolina, USA, and incubated in the laboratory with either freshwater or saltwater (2.5 or 5.0 ppt) and with or without the additions of wood. Saltwater additions at 2.5 and 5.0 ppt reduced CO2 production by 41% and 37 %, respectively, compared to freshwater. Methane production was reduced by 98% (wood-free incubations) and by 75 %-87% (wood-amended incubations) in saltwater treatments compared to the freshwater plus wood treatment. Additions of wood also resulted in lower CH4 production from the freshwater treatment and higher CH4 production from saltwater treatments compared to wood-free incubations. The δ13CH4-C isotopic signature suggested that, in wood-free incubations, CH4 produced from the freshwater treatment originated primarily from the acetoclastic pathway, while CH4 produced from the saltwater treatments originated primarily from the hydrogenotrophic pathway. These results suggest that saltwater intrusion into coastal freshwater forested wetlands will reduce CH4 production, but long-term changes in C dynamics will likely depend on how changes in wetland vegetation and microbial function influence C cycling in peat soils. © Author(s) 2019.",,"carbon dioxide; coastal wetland; freshwater ecosystem; gas production; greenhouse gas; hydroperiod; methane; peat soil; saline intrusion; salt water; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Atlantic Coast [United States]; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076511585

Yet, typical electricity capacity expansion planning does not consider climate-water constraints. We project four alternative U.S. power system configurations using an iterative modeling and data exchange platform that integrates climate-driven hydrological, thermal power plant, and capacity expansion models. Through a comparison with traditional modeling approaches, we show that this novel approach provides greater confidence in electricity capacity projections by incorporating feasibility checks that adjust infrastructure development to reach grid reliability thresholds under climate-water constraints. Initial projections without climate-water impacts on electricity generation show future power systems become less vulnerable, independent of climate-water adaptation, as economic drivers increase renewable and natural gas-based capacity, while water-intensive coal and nuclear plants retire. However, power systems may face reliability challenges without climate-water adaptation, revealing the significance of incorporating climate-water impacts into power system planning. Climate-adjusted (Iterative approach) projections require a 5.3-12.0% increase in national-level capacity, relative to Initial projections, leading to an additional $125-143 billion (5.0-7.0%) in infrastructure costs. Variable renewable and natural gas technologies account for nearly all the additional capacity and, together with regional trade-offs in electricity generation, enhance grid performance to reach reliability thresholds. These adaptation transitions also lower water use and emissions, contributing to climate change mitigation, and highlight the trade-offs and impacts of both near and long-term electricity generation planning decisions.

This inland-water “browning” has profound physical, chemical and biological repercussions for aquatic ecosystems affecting water quality, biological community structures and aquatic productivity. Potential drivers of this “browning” trend are complex and include reductions in atmospheric acid deposition, changes in land use/cover, increased nitrogen deposition and climate change. However, because of the overlapping impacts of these stressors, their relative contributions to DOC dynamics remain unclear, and without appropriate long-term monitoring data, it has not been possible to determine whether the ongoing “browning” is unprecedented or simply a “re-browning” to pre-industrial DOC levels. Here, we demonstrate the long-term impacts of acid deposition and climate change on lake-water DOC concentrations in low and high acid-deposition areas using infrared spectroscopic techniques on ~200-year-long lake-sediment records from central Canada. We show that acid deposition suppressed naturally higher DOC concentrations during the 20th century, but that a “re-browning” of lakes is now occurring with emissions reductions in formerly high deposition areas. In contrast, in low deposition areas, climate change is forcing lakes towards new ecological states, as lake-water DOC concentrations now often exceed pre-industrial levels. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074960570

Field data from an enhanced observation period carried out in May–July 2013 helped estimate the emissions and flow conditions over the dune field. Emissions are based on a comprehensive emissions grid developed from in-situ measurements using the Portable In-Situ Wind ERosion Lab (PI-SWERL). PI-SWERL estimates the potential for a soil surface to produce PM10 dust emissions for a range of wind speeds. This approach provided a well-determined PM10 emissions field as a function of time and space. Wind and turbulence fields were estimated using the CALMET diagnostic meteorological model constrained with surface stations, upper air soundings, buoys, and the North American Reanalysis data. Hourly, three-dimensional wind flow and instability objective analysis fields were developed at 20 m resolution in order to consider the complex flow over realistic dune morphology, land use/land cover and terrain characteristics over and around the Oceano Dunes. The dust dispersion simulations were performed using a computationally efficient and vectorized Lagrangian Stochastic Particle Dispersion Model driven by the CALMET output and the PI-SWERL time-space variable emissions. The dispersion model is based on the Langevin formulation and includes the turbulent diffusion and stochastic particle motion (of millions of particles) in the inertial sub-range, and assuming particles as discrete units neglecting deposition. The model estimates diffusion of particles from an initial particle releases that scale according to the PI-SWERL time-variable emissions estimates. Results were then tested at two independent-downwind locations, with positive correlations for flow conditions (R2 = 0.89) and similar receptor PM10 concentrations (R2 = 0.85). Evaluations against those observations during mean flow conditions as well as for elevated dust events suggest that the model framework can capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of mean day-to-day and diurnal PM10 variability. In this study we describe the details of the model framework and its performance as well as its implementation to locate the dust sources that have the strongest impact in the receptor sites and to evaluate the impact of different dust reduction strategies used at the ODSVRA to mitigate PM10 at downwind receptors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CALMET; Dust control; Lagrangian dispersion model; Oceano dunes; PI-SWERL; PM10","Dispersions; Dust control; Lagrange multipliers; Land use; Morphology; Stochastic systems; CALMET; Computationally efficient; Lagrangian dispersion model; Meteorological modeling; Oceano dunes; Particle dispersion model; PM10; Temporal characteristics; Stochastic models; dust; emission; model; modeling; particulate matter; turbulent diffusion; article; California; diffusion; dust control; land use; motion; recreation; simulation; soil; stochastic model; wind erosion; wind speed; California; San Luis Obispo County; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072540547

These extreme values are the result of isotope fractionation during microbial carbon metabolism, but the combined effect of all factors controlling the isotope distributions is still not completely understood. We used a model approach to evaluate the effects of reaction and transport on carbon isotope distributions in modern sediment porewater under steady state. Simulated δ13CDIC profiles typically show negative values in the sulphate reduction zone and more positive values in the methanogenic zone. With increasing depth in the methanogenic zone, δ13C values approach a distribution where the offset of δ13CDIC from δ13C of total organic carbon (TOC) to more positive values is similar to the offset of δ13CCH4 to more negative values (δ13CDIC and δ13CCH4 approach a symmetric distribution relative to δ13CTOC). The model never exceeds this symmetry of the DIC-CH4 couple towards more positive values under steady-state conditions in a purely diffusive system. Our model shows that to reach an offset in δ13C between DIC and CH4 in the order of 70‰, as frequently observed in methanogenic zones, a larger fractionation than reported from culture experiments with acetoclastic or autotrophic methanogens would be required. In fact, the observed isotope offset in natural systems would be consistent with the known inorganic equilibrium fractionation factor at in-situ temperature, which may suggest isotope exchange via a microbial pathway, during methanogenesis. Furthermore, the model reproduces strongly negative δ13CCH4 values at the sulphate methane transition (SMT) as result of a reverse flux of carbon from DIC to CH4 during AOM. Such a reverse AOM has no influence on the δ13CDIC at the SMT as methane is almost completely consumed. Only at high sedimentation rate combined with low porosity, δ13CDIC values significantly more negative than δ13CTOC occur at the SMT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic methane oxidation; Carbon isotopes; Marine porewater; Methane; Methanogenesis; Reaction-transport model","Isotopes; Methane; Submarine geology; Sulfur compounds; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Carbon isotopes; Methanogenesis; Pore waters; Reaction-transport model; Organic carbon; anoxic conditions; autotrophy; carbon isotope; chemical composition; dissolved inorganic carbon; fractionation; methane; methanogenesis; microbial ecology; oxidation; porewater; reaction kinetics; reduction; seafloor; total organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072256419

This study, therefore, aims to assess the above- and belowground carbon storage potential of a semi-arid forest ecosystem of Delhi. Methods: For the study, two forest sites were selected, i.e., north ridge (NRF) and central ridge (CRF). Aboveground tree biomass was estimated by using growing stock volume equations developed by Forest Survey of India and specific wood density. Understory biomass was determined by harvest sampling method. Belowground (root) biomass was determined by using a developed equation. For soil organic carbon (SOC), soil samples were collected at 0–10-cm and 10–20-cm depth and carbon content was estimated. Results: The present study estimated 90.51 Mg ha−1 biomass and 63.49 Mg C ha−1 carbon in the semi-arid forest of Delhi, India. The lower diameter classes showed highest tree density, i.e., 240 and 328 individuals ha−1 (11–20 cm), basal area, i.e., 8.7 (31–40 cm) and 6.08 m2 ha−1 (11–20 cm), and biomass, i.e., 24.25 and 23.57 Mg ha−1 (11–20 cm) in NRF and CRF, respectively. Furthermore, a significant contribution of biomass (7.8 Mg ha−1) in DBH class 81–90 cm in NRF suggested the importance of mature trees in biomass and carbon storage. The forests were predominantly occupied by Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC which also showed the highest contribution to the (approximately 40%) tree biomass. Carbon allocation was maximum in aboveground (40–49%), followed by soil (29.93–37.7%), belowground or root (20–22%), and litter (0.27–0.59%). Conclusion: Our study suggested plant biomass and soils are the potential pools of carbon storage in these forests. Furthermore, carbon storage in tree biomass was found to be mainly influenced by tree density, basal area, and species diversity. Trees belonging to lower DBH classes are the major carbon sinks in these forests. In the study, native trees contributed to the significant amount of carbon stored in their biomass and soils. The estimated data is important in framing forest management plans and strategies aimed at enhancing carbon sequestration potential of semi-arid forest ecosystems of India. © 2019, The Author(s).","Basal area; Carbon allocation pattern; Carbon pool; Forest management; Semi-arid forest; Species composition","Biomass; Climate change; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Lakes; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Soils; Basal area; Carbon allocation; Carbon pool; Semi arid; Species composition; Forestry; assessment method; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest ecosystem; forest management; organic carbon; semiarid region; urbanization; Delhi; India; Prosopis juliflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064902802

The Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) project is a warming and elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2) experiment designed to test how the carbon sequestration and storage capacity of peatland ecosystems will respond to climate change. Here, we report changes in the vascular plant community that have occurred during the first five years of SPRUCE. We tracked species composition, diversity, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in chambers warmed at a wide range of temperatures (+0, +2.25, +4.5, +6.75, +9 °C), and two CO2 levels (∼400 [ambient] and 900 parts per million). We observed an increase in aboveground vascular plant biomass accumulation, due primarily to an increase in shrub abundance. Overall species diversity decreased substantially, likely due in part to shading by increases in shrub density. The main driver of change in the vascular plant community was temperature, with minimal effects of CO2 evident. These results indicate an overall increase in ANPP with warming, but highlight the importance of interactions between direct (warming) and indirect (competition) effects in determining how boreal peatlands will respond to climate change. © 2020 The Author(s).

The literature tells us that most pollution is being driven by anthropogenic activities used to sustain our species, our economies, and our consumption-based lifestyles. These activities and their subsequent pollution are driving at least eight of the nine planetary boundaries and are having profound impacts on both human and planetary health to the peril of the survival of many species including our own. Given that the two core planetary boundaries, climate change and biodiversity loss, have been crossed, and that the IPCC 2018 report calls for emissions reductions of 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, it would seem that avoiding catastrophe and meeting the basic needs of the global populace will require nothing less than a rapid reduction of fossil hydrocarbon use in addition to a drastic reduction in ruminant meat consumption.

The core of the study is an analysis of the emissions associated with the start-up of steady-state utilization of previously unutilized forest areas. Example forest growth curves are employed to demonstrate the dependence of the start-up emissions on the forest characteristics. In the case of fiber production, the start-up leads to an effective step-like increase in cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. In the case of biofuel production, a significant level of CO2 removal is attainable in the longer term, but, because of the start-up emission, there is usually an initial period of effective CO2 emission. The duration of this initial period has a strong dependence on the growth rate of the forest and the type of fossil fuel replaced. The results of the analysis were exploited in the compilation of a proposal for a global scheme aimed at mitigating climate change without unduly constraining forest utilization. In the scheme, increased forest utilization for the production of solid-wood products and fiber products would be penalized on the basis of the consumption of such products, while, in certain cases, increased forest utilization for biofuel production would be rewarded. Acceptable biofuel options were identified in the study. An example is the replacement of coal by wood chips originating from forest which has a growth rate at least as great as that of a typical boreal forest. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Biofuel; Climate change; Forest utilization; Mitigation; Pulp","biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; climate change; coal; environmental economics; fossil fuel; global perspective; growth rate; land use change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062692796

However, the limited capacity of municipal Governments to respond to the scale and pace of change is leading to a growth of informal settlements in peri-urban locations. Factors of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity combine to make these informal settlements the most vulnerable areas to natural hazards. In response to this critical urban resilience agenda, this paper looks at how participatory action research is providing inter-disciplinary scientific support for the implementation of urban resilience and climate actions in Honiara, Solomon Islands. Adaptation measures involve a combination of hard and soft actions; as well as activities designed to strengthen local capacity to respond to contemporary resilience challenges. Addressing the adaptive capacity component, this paper also highlights the opportunities for Australian universities to integrate teaching and learning with action research to achieve a substantive real-world impact in the Pacific region, as well as illustrating the capacity strengthening benefits that can be achieved through sustained engagement and collaborative partnerships with local organisations. © 2019 by the authors.",,"climate effect; employment; health care; interdisciplinary approach; resilience; teaching; urban development; urbanization; Guadalcanal; Honiara; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]; Solomon Islands [Solomon Islands (ISG)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076694465

There is an urgent need to restore forests across the western United States. To address this need, the U.S. Forest Service began the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) to restore four national forests in Arizona. The objective of this study was to evaluate how restoration of ~400,000 ha under the 4FRI program and projected climate change would influence carbon dynamics and wildfire severity from 2010 to 2099. Specifically, we estimated forest carbon fluxes, carbon pools and wildfire severity under a moderate and fast 4FRI implementation schedule and compared those to status quo and no-harvest scenarios using the LANDIS-II simulation model and climate change projections. We found that the fast-4FRI scenario showed early decreases in ecosystem carbon due to initial thinning/prescribed fire treatments, but total ecosystem carbon increased by 9–18% over no harvest by the end of the simulation. This increased carbon storage by 6.3–12.7 million metric tons, depending on the climate model, equating to removal of carbon emissions from 55,000 to 110,000 passenger vehicles per year until the end of the century. Nearly half of the additional carbon was stored in more stable soil pools. However, climate models with the largest predicted temperature increases showed declines by late century in ecosystem carbon despite restoration.

The aim of this literature review was to find empirical data illustrating the ways in which conservation land and conservation management activities affect ecosystem services. The widely-held belief that natural ecosystems—such as those found on conservation land in New Zealand—provide a range of ecosystem services is generally supported by the literature. International studies show that natural vegetation can decrease air pollution, regulate local air temperatures, improve water quality, reduce shallow soil erosion, and retain natural nutrient cycles. It can also be beneficial for pest control and pollination on agricultural land. Wetlands can improve water quality and can play a role in drought and flood mitigation. Seagrasses, saltmarsh vegetation, and mangroves can reduce the height and force of waves and play a role in flood protection. In addition, maintaining biodiversity preserves genetic libraries and future options for discoveries of valuable biological compounds. The few studies investigating the effects of conservation management activities on ecosystem services indicate that restoring vegetation can improve water quality and water storage functions, can reverse soil degradation on a local scale, and can restore plant-insect interactions. Additionally, removing some invasive plant species can increase water yield. Unfortunately, very few studies of ecosystem services have been conducted in New Zealand to date, and only some of the international results are likely to be applicable under New Zealand conditions. Accordingly, while conservation is probably beneficial for a range of ecosystem services in New Zealand, the scarcity of local data makes it difficult to ascertain where and when, and to what extent, the majority of those benefits transpire. © June 2009, Department of Conservation.","Air; Biodiversity; Climate; Conservation management; Disease regulation; Ecosystem services; Fish stocks; Natural habitat; Natural hazard protection; Nutrient cycling; Pest control; Pollination; Restoration; Soil; Water","conservation management; ecosystem service; invasive species; literature review; vegetation; water quality; water storage; New Zealand; Hexapoda; Matthiola; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118858375

In particular, the possibilities for the specific production of C1–C4 hydrocarbons utilising a good quality syngas produced by two-stage plasma assisted gasification method are investigated. A number of catalytic tests were prepared with modified chemistry to evaluate the preliminary component activities on real waste-derived syngas.

CO2 was the main byproduct with outlet concentrations ranging from 10 to 50% in volume. When increasing H2:CO in the syngas by external addition of hydrogen, CO conversion increases, as well as paraffin selectivity and hydrocarbons yield.

Climate models have been instrumental in completing the big picture. It is generally accepted that observations feed the development of climate models: parameterizations are designed based on empirically observed relationships, climate model predictions are initialized using observational products, and numerical simulations are evaluated given matching observational datasets. Recent findings: Recent research suggests that the opposite also holds: climate models can feed the development of polar observational networks by indicating the type, location, frequency, and timing of measurements that would be most useful for answering a specific scientific question. Summary: Here, we review the foundations of this emerging notion with five cases borrowed from the field of polar prediction with a focus on sea ice (sub-seasonal to centennial time scales). We suggest that climate models, besides their usual purposes, can be used to objectively prioritize future observational needs – if, of course, the limitations of the realism of these models have been recognized. This idea, which has been already extensively exploited in the context of Numerical Weather Prediction, reinforces the notion that observations and models are two sides of the same coin rather than distinct conceptual entities. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","climate modeling; data assimilation; emergent constraints; environmental prediction; observing system design; observing system experiments; polar regions; satellite simulators",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075216577

This article, in contrast, adopts a critical perspective to uncover the everyday life of international climate law. From this viewpoint, international climate law is a purposive endeavour that is grounded in the small places where people create and live out the law. 'International climate lawyers' are among those who produce the law within these sites, and they propagate international climate law across multiple institutions. Using legalethnographic description, the article shows how lawyers operationalize the law in the United Nations climate regime, World Bank, and international human rights system. In each case, lawyers effect some overlapping aspirations for the law as well as legal techniques, but they also adapt their practices to the places where they work. In the process, they simultaneously build and diversify their professional community. Both in their field and community then, lawyers generate heterogeneity and homogeneity through the proliferation of international climate law. They do so on multiple registers, in terms of diverging ethical commitments, multivalent legal forms, and relative authority to speak the law, notably between institutions and the Global North and Global South. If lawyers reproduce sameness and difference in international climate law, moreover, this article suggests they may reify analogous traits in the broader field of international law, including persisting power relations. © Foundation of the Leiden Journal of International Law 2019.","Climate change; International legal theory; Legal professionalism; Practice theory; Scholarly praxis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072274951

Specific case studies have quantified water savings with intelligent irrigation, however, water savings have not yet been quantified for urban agriculture or compared across climates. Before urban agriculture implements intelligent irrigation, requiring an added cost and knowledge requirements of the control system, the effects of the system must first be estimated for a broad range of climatic conditions. We hypothesized that an intelligent irrigation system will decrease water use without reducing crop yield. With CROPWAT, we modeled an urban tomato garden irrigated conventionally to one irrigated intelligently in each of the nine climatic regions of the United States. Tomatoes were selected because they are sensitive to water stress. The intelligent irrigation system included a wireless sensor network and controllable valves. In addition, we created the Conventional-Scenario Intelligent-Scenario Index to compare the overall performance of an intelligent irrigation strategy to a conventional one. Our simulations showed that the intelligent irrigation scenario decreased water use on average by 59% in all sub-humid climates while maintaining yield (0% reduction). All sub-humid climates (7 of 9 total zones) fell within the “fair” to “good” index categories. Based on these results, urban agricultural sites should consider installing intelligent irrigation systems if they are in sub-humid climates. In the two semi-arid climates, our intelligent irrigation scenario eliminated the 6–10% crop yield reductions of the conventional scenario but did not reduce water consumption. Both locations fell within the “fair” index category. The minor improvements in the semi-arid climates may not outweigh the added system costs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Conventional irrigation; Conventional-scenario intelligent-scenario index; CROPWAT; Intelligent irrigation; Urban agriculture; Water savings","Crops; Environmental impact; Fruits; Irrigation; Water resources; Water supply; Wireless sensor networks; Conventional-scenario intelligent-scenario index; CROPWAT; Intelligent irrigations; Urban agricultures; Water - savings; Urban growth; agricultural modeling; cost analysis; crop yield; irrigation system; knowledge based system; scenario analysis; sensor; urban agriculture; water planning; water use efficiency; yield response; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072768295

Several individual strategies can reduce NO3 loading to freshwater ecosystems (i.e. optimize N fertilizer applications, planting cover crops, retention of active cycling N), but the potential for synergistic interactions among N management practices has not been fully examined. We applied portfolio effect (PE) theory, a concept originally developed for financial asset management, to test whether implementing multiple N management practices simultaneously produces more stable NO3 leaching mitigation outcomes than what would be predicted from implementing each practice independently. We analyzed simulated data generated using a validated process-based cropping system model (APSIM) that covers a range of soils, weather conditions, and management practices. Results indicated that individual management practices alone explained little of the variation in drainage NO3 loads but were more influential in the amount of residual soil NO3 at crop harvest. Despite this, we observed a general stabilizing effect from adopting well-designed multi-strategy approaches for both NO3 loads and soil NO3 at harvest, which became more pronounced in years with high spring rainfall. We use the PE principle to design multi-strategy management to reduce and stabilize NO3 leaching, which resulted in 9.6% greater yields, 15% less NO3 load, and 61% less soil NO3 at harvest than the baseline typical management. Our results make the case for applying the PE to adapt NO3 leaching mitigation to increased climate variability and change, and guide policy action and on-the-ground implementation. © 2019 The Author(s).

To garner critical mass, we propose an extended club configuration including sub-national states or provinces, resulting in a multi-level club. This would allow considerable contributions from important emitters like the US to be brought on board, relevant given its intended withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. We elaborate this idea and clarify potential roles of participants at distinct levels. The concept is operationalized by developing a method for identifying suitable entities at each level that uses a set of likelihood-of-involvement indicators capturing existing carbon dependence, public opinion, government policy and climate coalition membership. Application at the national level identifies a subset of seven of the highest emitting countries representing 21% of global emissions. This rises to 51% assuming that China, the dominant global emitter, could be enticed into the group. Given that US involvement remains unlikely for now, we illustrate selection at the sub-national level for US states. Here, an initial group of 21 states appear as potential members, jointly accounting for 36% of national emissions. An additional group, representing a further 34% of emissions, are potentially receptive to enticement via trade dependencies on four key countries identified within the group of national members. Accordingly, some 70% of US emissions, representing 11% of global totals, may be subject to climate club involvement via a combination of these pathways. While the implementation of such a club requires various political and legal hurdles to be overcome, the ongoing threat of climate change and inadequacies of the Paris Agreement suggest that novel solutions of this kind deserve serious attention from scientists and politicians. © 2019 The Author(s).

In the case of the Chaves CO2-rich thermal waters, this approach provided important data to answer the most commonly asked questions so as to enable the elaboration of a robust hydrogeological conceptual model, namely (1) Chaves thermal waters belong to the HCO3/Na/CO2-rich type (with pH ≈7), in that the result of meteoric waters–granitic rocks–gas (CO2) interaction; (2) Padrela Mountain (NE-Chaves), ascribed to high-fractured rocks, is the main recharge area; the stable isotopic composition of the groundwater samples indicate a mean recharge altitude higher than 1150 m a.s.l.; (3) the mean Sr isotopic ratio of the thermomineral waters (87Sr/86Srmean = 0.722419) is similar to that of the Sr isotopic ratios of the plagioclases of the granitic rocks (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr = 0.72087; 87Sr/86Sr = 0.71261), indicating that hydrolysis of plagioclase is the main water–rock interaction process, favoured by the presence of deep-seated (mantle-derived) CO2 (δ13C values in the range of −6 to −1‰ vs. PDB, and the CO2/3He values from 5.1 × 108 to 7.5 × 109, are typical of MORB fluids); (4) the income of carbon-14 free to Chaves CO2-rich thermal waters system does not permit reliable 14C groundwater dating; (5) the geothermometric results (e.g. K2/Mg and silica geothermometers) indicate equilibrium temperatures around 120 °C, and a maximum depth of about 3.5 km reached by the Chaves CO2-rich thermal waters system was estimated.

This study presents the results of research on selected performance parameters of transport by internal combustion engines including: power, torque, the emission of sound generated by the engine, the content of exhaust components (oxygen O2, carbon monoxide CO, carbon dioxide CO2, nitrogen dioxide NO2), and the content of particulate matter (PM) in exhaust emission. Three self-ignition engines were tested. The fuel injection controllers of the tested internal combustion engines were additionally adjusted by increasing the fuel dose and the load of air. The material used in the tests were mixtures of diesel oil and fatty acid methyl esters of dierent concentration. A statistical analysis was performed based of the results. The purpose of the work was to develop a resulting model for assessing the operation of engines fueled with biofuel and diesel mixtures while changing the vehicle's computer software.

Direct Injection in the cylinder, however, promotes fuel spray impingement on the cylinder liner and the piston crown, depending on both the air density (engine load) and velocity (engine speed) and the injector specification and operation. Due to the droplet loss of momentum and the resulting local fuel vaporization, the wall impingement results in formation of rich (λ < 0.5) air-fuel mixture pockets, which might burn according to a diffusive flame resulting in particulate formation. In order to provide useful guidelines to GDI combustion system thermo-fluid design, it is mandatory to investigate the interaction of the fuel droplets with the walls and to predict the liquid film occurrence and its evolution in a wide range of engine-like operating conditions. In the present work, a numerical analysis based on 3D-CFD using the commercial code STAR-CD v.4.28 has been performed. In particular, the Lagrangian spray-wall impingement model, the pool boiling model and the Leidenfrost and Nukiyama temperatures correlations were tested and tuned against experimental data. The aim of the work is to understand the main features and the critical aspects of the wall impingement modelling and to assess the coefficients sensitivity, taking into account the most influencing parameters for the engine application as injection pressure, back-pressure, wall temperature. The final goal is to determine a robust and physically representative methodology. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077886962

During the environment pollution researching and monitoring the special attention should be paid to the construction operations, since during the construction processes many pollutants are released, especially fine dust particles, which are harmful to the health of construction workers and the population living near the construction site. The construction of any object in urban terrain has bad influence not only on the nearby buildings and city infrastructure, but on the existing environment of urban areas. The identification of the important pollution sources that contribute to ambient concentrations of pollutants is essential for developing an effective air quality management plan during building construction. Particular attention should be paid to emissions of fine particles during technological processes of construction with a special degree of dust emission. Control and regulation of the dynamic state of dispersed systems released during technological construction processes using a number of protective measures will reduce emissions of pollutants into the air. The objects of this research were the construction site and residential buildings of a large residential complex Ekaterininskiy; located in Rostov-on-Don. The obtained measurement data as a result of this type of environmental monitoring showed the level of atmospheric air pollution from the construction industry using the example of the construction of the residential complex ""Ekaterininskiy"" in Rostov-onDon. After analyzing the situation with dust pollution the protective measures were suggested. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Air quality; Construction industry; Dust; Environmental technology; Housing; Pollution detection; Quality management; Ambient concentrations; Anthropogenic sources; Atmospheric pollution; Building construction; Construction operations; Environment pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Residential complexes; Construction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076509348

At the same time, climate change increases the incidence of extreme weather events such as drought. While it is expected that plants and soil organisms originating from the south are better able to cope with drought, little is known about the consequences of their range shifts on soil functioning under drought events. Here, we test how range-expanding plant species and soil communities may influence soil functioning under drought. We performed a full-factorial outdoor mesocosm experiment with plant communities of range expanders or related natives, with soil inocula from the novel or the original range, with or without summer drought. We measured litter decomposition, carbon mineralization and enzyme activities, substrate-induced respiration and the relative abundance of soil saprophytic fungi immediately after drought and at 6 and 12 weeks after rewetting. Drought decreased all soil functions regardless of plant and soil origin except one; soil respiration was less reduced in soils of range-expanding plant communities, suggesting stronger resistance to drought. After rewetting, soil functioning responses depended on plant and soil origin. Soils of native plant communities with a history of drought had more litter mass loss and higher relative abundance of saprophytic fungi than soils without drought and soils of range expanders. Functions of soil from range expanders recovered in a more conservative manner than soils of natives, as litter mass loss did not exceed the control rates. At the end of the experiment, after rewetting, most soil functions in mesocosms with drought history did not differ anymore from the control. We conclude that functional consequences of range-expanding plants and soil biota may interact with effects of drought and that these effects are most prominent during the first weeks after rewetting of the soil.

The results of a three-week monitoring campaign on a full-scale partial nitritation reactor were reproduced through a state-of-the-art model including different biological N2O formation pathways. The partial nitritation reactor under study was a SHARON reactor treating the effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant sludge digester. A qualitative and quantitative comparison between experimental data and simulation results was performed to identify N2O formation pathways as well as for model identification. Heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were responsible for N2O formation under anoxic conditions, whereas under aerated conditions the AOB were the most important N2O producers. Relative to previously proposed models, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) had to be included as a state variable in the AOB conversions in order to describe potential N2O formation by AOB under anoxic conditions. An oxygen inhibition term in the corresponding reaction kinetics was required to fairly represent the relative contribution of the different AOB pathways for N2O production. Nevertheless, quantitative prediction of N2O emissions with models remains a challenge, which is discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biological nitrogen removal; Digester effluent; Dynamic simulation; Greenhouse gas emission; Wastewater treatment","Amines; Bacteria; Bioinformatics; Computer simulation; Denitrification; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Reaction kinetics; Wastewater treatment; Ammonium oxidizing bacteria; Biological nitrogen removal; Denitrifying bacteria; Model identification; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Quantitative comparison; Quantitative prediction; Relative contribution; Biological water treatment; nitrous oxide; aeration; anammox bacterium; Article; carbon footprint; chemical reaction kinetics; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; denitrification; denitrifying bacterium; effluent; heterotrophy; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; physicochemical model; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; reactor operation; sludge digestion; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072251902

Communities on fertile sites, with species having fast dynamics, have been found to react more strongly to climate change than communities on infertile sites with slow dynamics. However, it is still unclear whether this generally applies to high-latitude plant communities in natural environments at broad spatial scales. We tested a hypothesis that vegetation of fertile sites experiences greater changes over several decades and thus would be more responsive under contemporary climate change compared to infertile sites that are expected to show more resistance. We resurveyed understorey communities (vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens) of four infertile and four fertile forest sites along a latitudinal bioclimatic gradient. Sites had remained outside direct human disturbance. We analyzed the magnitude of temporal community turnover, changes in the abundances of plant morphological groups and strategy classes, and changes in species diversity. In agreement with our hypothesis, temporal turnover of communities was consistently greater on fertile sites compared to infertile sites. However, our results suggest that the larger turnover of fertile communities is not primarily related to the direct effects of climatic warming. Furthermore, community changes in both fertile and infertile sites showed remarkable variation in terms of shares of plant functional groups and strategy classes and measures of species diversity. This further emphasizes the essential role of baseline environmental conditions and nonclimatic drivers underlying vegetation changes. Our results show that site fertility is a key determinant of the overall rate of high-latitude vegetation changes but the composition of plant communities in different ecological contexts is variously impacted by nonclimatic drivers over time. © 2019 The Authors.

Under its Nationally Determined Contributions, Indonesia has committed to achieving emission reductions of 29% by 2030 as compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. However, as the largest share comes from LUCF, mitigation efforts in this sector will reduce its production. This study assesses the potential impact of the implementation of the mitigation efforts in the LUCF sector on the economy and environment through the use of a computable general equilibrium model. Two main approaches were introduced to reduce emissions: 1) increasing the crop yield (intensification), which is expected to motivate farmers to use less land and thus, lead to a decrease in deforestation; and 2) encouraging land conservation. Our simulation indicated that intensification alone results in less GDP loss but does not significantly reduce deforestation and emissions from LUCF as farmers will still cultivate the land as usual, and land expansion for commercial plantations, especially palm oil, will continue. Therefore, introducing conservation practices, though costly, may help to protect forest areas and reduce emissions from LUCF. Thus, the simultaneous implementation of intensification and conservation efforts is recommended. To this end, cooperation between the central and regional governments is necessary along with an incentive scheme that encourages farmers to adopt mitigation efforts on their lands. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Computable general equilibrium (CGE); Forest management; Intensification; LUCF; Mitigation; Reforestation","Conservation; Deforestation; Economics; Emission control; Environmental protection; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Palm oil; Reforestation; Timber; Commercial plantation; Computable general equilibrium; Computable general equilibrium model; Conservation practices; Intensification; Land use change and forestries; LUCF; Mitigation; Land use; Conservation; Deforestation; Economics; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Reforestation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071851384

Standard techniques for this dimensionality reduction employ statistical methods that identify the modes that account for the largest variance in nuclear positions. However, large-amplitude motion is not necessarily a good proxy for the influence of a mode on the electronic wave function evolution. Hence, we report three analysis techniques aimed at extracting from surface hopping nonadiabatic dynamics simulations the vibrational modes that are most strongly affected by the electronic excitation and that most significantly affect the interaction of the electronic states. The first technique identifies coherent nuclear motion after excitation from the ratio between total variance and variance of the average trajectory. The second strategy employs linear regression to find normal modes that have a statistically significant effect on excitation energies, energy gaps, or wave function overlaps. The third approach uses time-frequency analysis to find normal modes, where the vibrational frequencies change during the dynamics simulation. All three techniques are applied to the case of surface hopping trajectories of [Re(CO)3(Im)(Phen)]+ (Im = imidazole; Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), but we also discuss how these techniques could be extended to other nonadiabatic dynamics methods. For [Re(CO)3(Im)(Phen)]+, it is shown that the nonadiabatic dynamics is dominated by a small number of carbonyl and phenanthroline in-plane stretch modes. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Wave functions; 1 ,10-phenanthroline; Dimensionality reduction; Electronic excitation; Electronic wave functions; Large-amplitude motion; Low-dimensional modeling; Non-adiabatic dynamics; Time frequency analysis; Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077357591

Poor socioeconomic development, rough and highly unstable geography, inadequate institutional capacity to deal with research, development and policy and mostly underdeveloped infrastructures, all have contributed to increasing vulnerability of communities and ecosystems, and have limited their adaptive capacity. Over the past decade, Nepal has made significant progress, particularly in developing and implementing policies and frameworks and establishing institutional mechanisms with the support of donor countries, UN and multilateral agencies. As the global climate politics is getting more complicated, international financing patterns—both climate and development finance—are shifting their ways, forcing the countries like Nepal to diversify the funding base for climate change actions and integrate them within national development plans and strategies. Using the data and information currently available, we analyze the existing financing situations, discuss the future scenarios and suggest policy recommendations to develop a set of long-term adaptation and impact mitigation strategies in specific and environmental change at large. When short-term adaptation strategies funded from existing financial arrangements and other related bilateral and multilateral sources particularly European countries, seem to be encouraging, we stress the need of “public–private partnership-driven full-fledged green economy” focusing on renewable energy and transport, agriculture and forestry, water and water-induced disasters, as well as tourism and hospitality. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Climate finance; Climate investment; European Union; Green economy","adaptive management; climate change; environmental change; European Union; global climate; green economy; policy implementation; strategic approach; vulnerability; Europe; Nepal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069474968

Here, we investigate the dynamics of forest ecosystem carbon stocks in the conterminous United States between 1907 and 2012 at national and regional levels. We build upon timber volume records from historical forest inventories and use a modelling approach to include all relevant pools, e.g. soil carbon, to derive a comprehensive long-term dataset. We find a consistent increase in forest carbon stocks across the country, from 27 PgC in 1907 to 39 PgC in 2012, with persistent regional variations between western and eastern United States, signalling pronounced land use and land management legacy effects. We identify additional potential to increase forest C sinks in both west and east, on diverging levels. Extended forest C stocks stem from forest biomass thickening i.e. increases in biomass C densities, rather than forest area expansion. Our study reflects the first such effort to collectively understand the effects of environmental change and land management on contemporary biomass C stocks at the national level, and critically engages with ongoing initiatives towards assessing the potential for carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems. © 2019 The Author(s).

As the road transport is an important source of pollution, information on fleet composition and its emissions are important to verify emissions control strategies and to guide mitigation measures. In that context, the present study proposes a method to develop and evaluate high resolution inventories for road transport emissions in metropolitan areas. This method was applied to the Florianópolis Metropolitan Area (FLMA), in Santa Catarina, Brazil. A probabilistic bottom-up approach was employed using modeled transportation data to produce a vehicular emissions inventory in high resolution. This approach was developed to account for fleet characteristics in emission factors estimations. The impact of vehicle categories and their emissions distribution was also analyzed. Results showed that light vehicles categories were responsible for 96% of CO, 87% of NMHC, 82% of CH4 and 74% of N2O emissions, well distributed throughout the road network. Heavy-duty vehicles emitted the biggest amount of the NOx and MP (80% and 94%, respectively), mostly concentrated in expressways. An analysis of emissions on each network hierarchy showed that expressways comprehended 45% of CO, 48% of HC, 79% of NOx, and 85% of PM emissions. The residual part of those pollutants is emitted by local, collector, connector and arterial roads. And finally, a hypothetical scenario pointed that replacing the FLMA's fleet for vehicles of model-year from 2017 has a potential to decrease emissions up to 95%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric pollution; Emissions inventory; TransCAD; Vehicular emissions","Fleet operations; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Atmospheric pollution; Automotive technology; Emissions inventory; High resolution inventories; Network hierarchies; Road transport emissions; Trans cads; Vehicular emission; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; computer aided design; emission inventory; methodology; metropolitan area; probability; road transport; traffic emission; Brazil; Santa Catarina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075009810

However, the implementation of the dual-mode dual-fuel (DMDF) strategy allows operating in low-medium load with the RCCI combustion and in high load with dual-fuel diffusive combustion. This allows taking advantage of the benefits of RCCI combustion as the simultaneous reduction of PM and NOx emissions. However, there are still serious challenges that required to solve, such as the high-pressure rise rate and the excessive CO and HC emissions. In this sense, this work shows how the implementation and an adequate adjustment of the cooled LP-EGR rate significantly minimize these problems and also shows how the LP-EGR has a greater impact on the DMDF than on the CDC concept. This work has been performed in a modern medium-duty diesel engine fueled with standard gasoline and diesel fuels, with which a cooled LP-EGR loop has been coupled. A TSI Scanning Particle Sizer (SMPS 3936L75) was used to measure the particles size distribution and the Horiba MEXA-ONE-D1-EGR gas analyzer system to determine gaseous emissions. A parametric variation of the LP-EGR rate was experimentally performed to analyze the effect over each combustion process that encompasses the DMDF concept (fully premixed RCCI, highly premixed RCCI and dual-fuel diffusion) and its consequent impact on gaseous and particle emissions. In addition, results were compared against the CDC concept to state the benefits of the DMDF concept. Among the different results obtained, it can be highlighted that during the RCCI strategy the increase in LP-EGR rate provided a reduction in NOx emissions. Nonetheless, unlike that fully premixed RCCI in highly premixed RCCI combustion, the PM emissions increased with this increment in the LP-EGR rate, shifting the size distribution of particle toward larger sizes, but decreasing the HC and CO emissions. Finally, with the exception of the high HC and CO emissions in fully premixed RCCI, in all the combustion strategies of the DMDF concept, a reduction of the analyzed pollutants was observed when compared with the CDC mode. © 2019","Dual-fuel combustion; Gaseous emissions and particle size distribution; Low-pressure EGR; Reactivity controlled compression ignition","Diesel engines; Fuels; Gas emissions; Ignition; Light transmission; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Size distribution; Temperature; Compression ignition; Dual fuel combustion; Engine operating conditions; Low pressures; Low temperature combustion; Parametric variation; Particles size distribution; Simultaneous reduction; Dual fuel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071650019

Despite an increase in studies focused on snow microorganisms, the ecology of snow inhabitants remains unclear. In this study, we investigated sources and selection of a snowpack-specific microbial community by comparing metagenomes from samples collected in a Greenlandic fjord within a vertical profile including atmosphere, snowpack with four distinct layers of snow, sea ice brine and seawater. Microbial communities in all snow layers derived from mixed sources, both marine and terrestrial, and were more similar to atmospheric communities than to sea ice or seawater communities. The surface snow metagenomes were characterized by the occurrence of genes involved in photochemical stress resistance, primary production and metabolism of diverse carbon sources. The basal saline snow layer that was in direct contact with the sea ice surface harbored a higher abundance of cells than the overlying snow layers, with a predominance of Alteromonadales and a higher relative abundance of marine representatives. However, the overall taxonomic structure of the saline layer was more similar to that of other snow layers and the atmosphere than to underlying sea ice and seawater. The expulsion of relatively nutrient-rich sea ice brine into basal snow might have stimulated the growth of copiotrophic psychro- and halotolerant snow members. Our study indicates that the size, composition and function of snowpack microbial communities over sea ice were influenced primarily by atmospheric deposition and inflow of sea ice brine and that they form a snow-specific assemblage reflecting the particular environmental conditions of the snowpack habitat. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"snow; Alteromonadaceae; Arctic; climate; ecosystem; Greenland; ice cover; microflora; physiology; Alteromonadaceae; Arctic Regions; Climate; Ecosystem; Greenland; Ice Cover; Microbiota; Snow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061797794

Thus, the efficient utilization and conversion of waste biomass are greatly essential in alleviating the burden on already-strained energy and environmental crisis. In this work, we reported a simple, one-step pyrolysis and activation strategy to prepare porous carbons for use as electrode materials of energy storage devices using waste biomass as carbon source. The obtained porous carbons not only exhibited a well-interconnected 3D honeycomb-like microstructure, but also owned a hierarchical porosity with abundant micropores and suitable proportion of mesopore, as well as nitrogen from the biomass being self-doped in the resultant carbon skeleton. The optimal material possessed a large accessible surface area of 3310 m2 g−1 and a high hierarchical porosity of 1.79 cm3 g−1. The obtained materials exhibited a remarkably electrochemical capacitive performance including a high rate capacity, and a high capacitance of 394 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 was delivered in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Importantly, the assembled symmetric flexible all-solid-state capacitor exhibited a high energy density of 18 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 246 W kg−1, as well as a good cycling stability of a 96 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in a PVA/KOH gel electrolyte. Our proposed strategy not only realized the large-scale utilization and conversion of waste biomass to ease environmental issues, but also achieved the possibility of the production of a high-performance supercapacitor electrode in industry, which was a sample to convert the waste biomass into a high-value-added product. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Flexible; Hierarchically porous carbons; Solid-state supercapacitor","Capacitance; Carbon; Electrodes; Environmental protection; Porosity; Porous materials; Potassium hydroxide; Solid electrolytes; Supercapacitor; Accessible surface areas; Capacitive performance; Flexible; Hierarchically porous carbons; High energy densities; Solid-state supercapacitors; Supercapacitor electrodes; Sustainable resources; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073207093

However, much less is known about the patterns of N2-fixing species that are presumed to be independent of climatic factors due to their capacity to fix atmospheric N2. In this study, the foliar and soil δ15N in Caragana microphylla, a leguminous shrub important for its role in controlling soil erosion and land desertification in northern China, were determined from 23 sites along an east–west transect across the species distribution range. The soil δ15N tended to be significantly higher than the foliar δ15N and there was a positive correlation between them (r2 = 0.58, p &lt; 0.0001), though substantial variability was found in foliar and soil δ15N across all sites. Both soil and foliar δ15N were negatively correlated with precipitation, temperature, dry N deposition (DND) and longitude, but positively correlated with foliar N, soil N and altitude. The structural equation modeling further suggested growing season precipitation indirectly influenced foliar δ15N by its direct impact on soil δ15N and by its indirect impact on soil δ15N via DND and total N deposition (TND), whereas growing season temperature affected foliar δ15N indirectly both by its effect on foliar N and by its effect on soil δ15N via WND, TND and foliar N.

The manufacturing industry is one of the biggest contributors to CO2 emission, and determining the drivers of CO2 emissions are essential for effective environmental policy. China is also a vast transition economy with great regional differences. Therefore, based on the data of China’s provincial panel from 2000 to 2013 and the improved STIRPAT model, this paper studies the impact of economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI) and energy intensity on China’s manufacturing carbon emissions through the fixed-effect panel quantile regression model. The results show that the effects of economic growth, FDI and energy intensity on carbon emissions of the manufacturing industry are different in different levels and regions, and they have apparent heterogeneity. In particular, economic growth plays a decisive role in the CO2 emissions of the manufacturing industry. Economic growth has a positive impact on the carbon emissions of the manufacturing industry; specifically, a higher impact on high carbon emission provinces. Besides, FDI has a significant positive effect on the upper emission provinces of the manufacturing industry, which proves that there is a pollution paradise hypothesis in China’s manufacturing industry, but no halo effect hypothesis. The reduction of energy intensity does not have a positive effect on the reduction of carbon emissions. The higher impact of the energy intensity of upper emission provinces on carbon emissions from their manufacturing industry, shows that there is an energy rebound effect in China’s manufacturing industry. Finally, our study confirms that China’s manufacturing industry has considerable space for emission reduction. The results also provide policy recommendations for policymakers. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission; China’s manufacturing industry; Economic growth; Energy intensity; FDI; Panel quantile regression","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Investments; Manufacture; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions; Economic growths; Energy intensity; Manufacturing industries; Quantile regression; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076705268

At the same time, efficient operation of the existing distribution system, which hosts these decentralized generators, is equally important toward achieving a sustainable energy system. In order to keep track of the upcoming changes regarding system efficiency, an accurate determination of grid losses in the distribution system is the fundamental step. However, to evaluate the energy losses of power distribution grids at large scales is a difficult task. Currently, distribution system operators only have limited options for determining grid losses, especially in the low voltage sector. The growing installation rate and the fluctuating nature of distributed generations pose further difficulties and uncertainties for the loss evaluations. For this reason, a comprehensive and accurate evaluation on grid losses, which takes the grid information, the available metering data and the installed distributed generations into account, is highly relevant. In this work, a novel evaluation framework for energy losses for low voltage distribution grids is presented. Our evaluation framework consists of three building blocks: a fully automatic and parallelized generation of grid models, the determination of grid losses based on annual power flow simulations as well as a data-driven reference grid modeling method. We demonstrate and validate this framework based on a data-set of 5000 real distribution grids (including about 31,000 low voltage feeders), located in the service area of one of the largest German distribution system operators. The key contribution of the proposed framework is the automatic approach for grid modeling and feature evaluation at large scales and the implementation of the advanced, comprehensive reference grid modeling method for evaluating relevant grid features and estimating grid losses. This novel reference grid modeling approach and the complete framework are further validated by comparison with both exhaustive simulation results of grid losses and three state-of-the-art regression schemes. Among the case studies, this proposed evaluation framework shows a very good performance in the evaluation of grid losses. Moreover, this evaluation framework provides useful insights concerning the allocation of energy losses as well as the impact of distributed generations on grid losses. Accordingly, this novel evaluation framework gives distribution system operators a powerful tool considering the evaluation and improvement of system efficiency. © 2019","Distributed generation; Energy losses; Low voltage grids; Machine learning; Reference grid modeling; Regression analysis; System efficiency","Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Energy dissipation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Learning systems; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Regression analysis; Voltage distribution measurement; Evaluation and improvement; Low-voltage distributions; Low-voltage grid; Power distribution grids; Power flow simulation; Reference grids; Sustainable energy systems; System efficiency; Energy efficiency; decentralization; distribution system; emission control; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; installation; machine learning; numerical model; smart grid; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072575686

The experimental observations have been made under the climatic conditions of Coimbatore city in India during the year 2017. The system performance was evaluated in four different cooling modes such as: (a) with air cooling over the top surface of the panel; (b) with air cooling over the bottom surface of the panel; (c) with water cooling over the top surface of the panel and (d) with water cooling over the bottom surface of the panel. The performances of a photovoltaic water pumping system working with four different panel cooling modes are compared with the system without panel cooling. The economical and environmental impacts have been assessed for a period of twenty years. The results showed that, the water cooling provided over the bottom surface of the panel has significant performance enhancement when compared to other cooling modes. The economic assessment results showed that, the photovoltaic water pumping systems using water cooling over the bottom surface of the panel has payback period of 7.3 years with 13.7% return on investment and 10.9% internal rate of return.

For a representative summer episode, premature mortality and potential productivity losses (PPLs) of selected crops and trees attributable to ozone exposure have been quantified using ozone fields from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. We applied exposure-response models for the increased risk of premature mortality due to long-term exposure to ozone over a theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and for the reduced accumulation of vegetative biomass for four crop species and eleven tree species using the W126 metric designed to capture impacts on plants. To elucidate which emissions contributed to these disbenefits, we applied adjoint-based sensitivity analysis, which efficiently estimates sensitivities of concentration-based metrics with respect to numerous emissions parameters simultaneously. The adjoint of CMAQ was applied to the continental US to calculate the influence of spatially-resolved ozone precursor emissions on the annual average, domain-wide daily maximum 8 h average over the TMREL (elevated MDA8), premature mortality attributable to exposure to ozone above the TMREL, and PPLs. These quantities provide the impact in terms of the percent reduction in precursor emissions. Additionally, locations where similar percent reductions in ozone precursor emissions would impact one or more endpoints greater than average have been identified. NO x emissions were found to contribute most to the three metrics. The distinct spatial patterns of emissions influences on public welfare disbenefits as compared to the elevated MDA8 and premature mortality suggest that the current regulatory averaging time motivates different emissions control strategies than those that could most directly protect public welfare. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Emissions control strategy; Human health and agricultural impacts; Ozone exposure; Sensitivity analysis","Air quality; Crops; Forestry; Nitrogen oxides; Risk management; Sensitivity analysis; Volatile organic compounds; Community multi-scale air qualities; Ground-level ozone; Long term exposure; Oxides of nitrogen; Potential productivity; Premature mortality; Spatially resolved; Theoretical minimum; Ozone; air quality; biomass; emission control; mortality; ozone; photochemistry; public health; risk assessment; volatile organic compound; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088925482

In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations and empirical potentials, the behaviors of graphene after bombardment by C60 under different initial velocities from 13.7 to 15.7 km/s were investigated. The simulations showed four types of defects: Stone–Wales defects, single vacancy defects, multiple vacancy defects, and out-of-plane carbon adatoms. The self-healing phenomenon of defective graphene was observed. In the low-speed region (< 14.5 km/s), the self-healing ability of graphene is enhanced at higher temperature. However, the effect of temperature is not obvious in the high-speed region, where velocity dominates. To repair vacancy defects in graphene, a physical method was proposed. The initial positions of lost atoms were traced, and then, the atoms were slowly dropped into the vacancy defects to effect repair. The simulations provide a fundamental understanding of bombardment between graphene and C60 and propose a new method for repairing vacancy defects in graphene. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Graphene; Molecular dynamics; Repair; Self-healing materials; Effect of temperature; Empirical potentials; Graphene properties; Initial velocities; Molecular dynamics simulations; Self-healing abilities; Single vacancy defects; Theoretical study; Defects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071157465

Objectives: Our objective was to estimate how wind disturbance shapes landscape-level patterns of engineering resilience, defined as the recovery of total biomass and species composition after a windstorm, under climate change in central Wisconsin. Methods: We used a spatially-explicit, forest simulation model (LANDIS-II) to simulate how windstorms and climate change affect forest succession and used boosted regression tree analysis to isolate the important drivers of resilience. Results: At mid-century, biomass fully recovered to current conditions, but neither biomass nor species composition completely recovered at the end of the century. As expected, resilience was lower in the south, but by the end of the century, resilience was low throughout the landscape. Disturbance and species’ characteristics (e.g., the amount of area disturbed and the number of species) explained half of the variation in resilience, while temperature and soil moisture comprised only 17% collectively. Conclusions: Our results illustrate substantial spatial patterns of resilience at landscape scales, while documenting the potential for overall declines in resilience through time. Species diversity and windstorm size were far more important than temperature and soil moisture in driving long term trends in resilience. Finally, our research highlights the utility of using machine learning (e.g., boosted regression trees) to discern the underlying mechanisms of landscape-scale processes when using complex spatially-interactive and non-deterministic simulation models. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Forest simulation model; LANDIS-II; Resilience; Windstorms","climate change; forest ecosystem; landscape structure; machine learning; moisture content; software; spatial analysis; tree; wind field; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074816326

However, our findings demonstrated that the PHB-containing methanotrophic enrichment does not require methane availability to generate 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV)—when odd-chain fatty acids are presented. The enrichment yielded up to 14 wt% PHA with various mole fractions of 3HV monomer depending on the availability of methane and odd-fatty acids. Overall, the addition of valeric acid resulted in a higher PHA content and a higher 3HV fraction. The highest 3HV fraction (up to 65 mol%) was obtained from the methane–valeric acid experiment, which is higher than those previously reported for PHA-producing methanotrophic mixed microbial cultures.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, The Author(s).","3-Hydroxybutyrate; 3-Hydroxyvalerate; Methane; Methanotrophs; Polyhydroxyalkanoates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076614356

However, how nutrient availability affects the effects of climate and vegetation change on ecosystem processes in these nutrient-poor ecosystems remains unclear. Here we show that although warming promoted higher CH4 emissions, the concurrent addition of N counteracted most (79%) of this effect. The regulation effects of the vegetation functional group, associated with the substrate quality, suggest that CH4 emissions from peatlands under future warming will be less than expected with predicted shrub expansion. In contrast, N2O flux will be enhanced under future warming with predicted shrub expansion. Our study suggests that changes in greenhouse gas emissions in response to future warming and shifts in plant community composition depend on N availability, which reveals the complex interactions that occur when N is not a limiting nutrient. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; Carex (genus); chemistry; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; growth, development and aging; Rhododendron; season; soil; Sphagnopsida; wetland; Carbon Dioxide; Carex Plant; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Rhododendron; Seasons; Soil; Sphagnopsida; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071253027

Due to increasing road coverage in cities and the impervious feature of conventional pavements, the heat island effect is becoming increasingly severe. Many environmental problems have appeared. Permeable pavements have improved the situation. This study intends to achieve a convincing comparison of the environmental impacts of permeable pavements and conventional pavements. A methodological framework of life cycle assessment is used to quantify the environmental impacts in the study. The results indicated that during the use of the road, pavement roughness will increase and greatly impact the vehicle fuel consumption and road GHG emissions. The maintenance needs to be implemented in time. The cold mixing polymer composite based pavement has the best environmental friendly potential among three different pavement surface materials selected in the present research. Porous asphalt pavement does not show significant advantage in reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions comparing to the normal dense asphalt. This may because asphalt production requires heating, and the permeable feature of pavement is not considered. This study presented a basic evaluation of the environmental characteristics of different pavement materials. It provides a basis for the evaluation of environmental factors in pavement design and construction, which promotes a further research on the quantification of environmental factors in the future. © 2019 Tongji University and Tongji University Press","Carbon footprint; Energy consumption; Life cycle assessment; Permeable pavement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075530621

Yet literature, reportage, and public discourse reflect imbalanced risk and opportunity. Climate science often understates changes' speed and nonlinearity, but Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and similar studies often understate realistic mitigation options. Since 2010, global mitigation of fossil CO2 - including by often-uncounted modern renewable heat comparable to solar-plus-wind electricity - has accelerated to about the pace (if sustained) needed for a 2 °C trajectory. Mitigation has uncertainties, emergent properties, feasibility thresholds, and nonlinearities at least comparable to climate's, creating opportunities for aggressive action. Renewable electricity's swift uptake can now be echoed as proven integrative design can make end-use efficiency severalfold larger and cheaper, often with increasing returns (lower cost with rising quantity). Saved energy - the world's largest decarbonizer and energy 'source' (bigger than oil) - can then potentiate renewables and cut supply investments, as a few recent efficiency-centric IAMs confirm. Optimizing choices, combinations, timing, and sequencing of technologies, urban form, behavioral shifts, etc could save still more energy, money, and time. Some rigorous engineering-based national studies outside standard climate literature even imply potential 1.5 °C global trajectories cheaper than business-as-usual. A complementary opportunity - rapidly and durably abating hydrocarbon industries' deliberate upstream CH4 releases from flares and engineered vents, by any large operator's profitably abating its own and others' emissions - could stabilize (or more) the global methane cycle and buy time to abate more CO2. Together, these findings justify sober recalibration of the prospects for a fairer, healthier, cooler, and safer world. Supported by other disciplines, improved IAMs can illuminate this potential and support its refinement. Ambitious policies and aggressive marketplace and societal adoption of profitable new abatement opportunities need not wait for better models, but better models would help them to attract merited attention, scale faster, and turn numbing despair into collectively powerful applied hope. © 2019 The Author(s).

Landscape elements (LEs) which can maintain cooler surface temperatures also reduce night-time re-emission of heat; however, reflected solar radiation (albedo) from these LEs during the day potentially increases heat loads on nearby objects, pedestrians or buildings. Albedo is traditionally measured using two pyranometers, however their expense can be prohibitive for researchers and landscape professionals. A low cost albedometer was developed consisting of a pair of black-and white-painted temperature sensors (Thermochron® iButtons). The albedos of 14 LEs typically found in suburban landscapes in Perth, Western Australia, were measured. Three approaches were tested: The first two used white-painted polystyrene (WPP) as a reference (one taking view factors into account, and one ignoring the albedo of the background material), whilst the third approach used upwards-facing iButtons as a reference, similar to conventional pyranometer methods. The WPP approaches controlled for weather effects, providing a consistent albedo over a longer daytime period than recommended by the standard ASTM-E1918-16. Measured albedos were similar to literature values. This instrument could be used as an alternative to more expensive pyranometers and could assist landscape professionals to design for, and manage, urban heat. © 2019 by the authors.","Albedometer; Pyranometer; Reflected solar radiation; Urban heat; View factors","air temperature; albedo; cooling; cost analysis; design; heat island; instrumentation; polymer; solar radiation; surface temperature; urban area; Australia; Perth [Western Australia]; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079484342

Our calculated results show that CO2 is adsorbed preferably on the bridge O atom of the clusters, forming a ""chemisorption"" carbonate complex, while the CO is adsorbed preferably to the Ti atom of terminal Ti-O. The computed carbonate vibrational frequency values are in good agreement with the results obtained experimentally, which suggests that CO2 in the complex is distorted slightly from its undeviating linear configuration. In addition, the analyses of electronic parameters, electronic density, ionization potential, HOMO-LUMO gap, and density of states (DOS) confirm the charge transfer and interaction between CO2 and the cluster. From the predicted energy profiles, CO2 can be easily adsorbed and activated, while the activation of CO2 on (TiO2)n clusters are structure-dependent and energetically more favorable than that on the bulk TiO2. Overall, this study critically highlights how the small (TiO2)n clusters can influence the CO2 adsorption and activation which are the critical steps for CO2 reduction the surface of a catalyst and subsequent conversion into industrially relevant chemicals and fuels. © 2019 Chinese Physical Society.","(TiO2)n clusters; Activation; Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Reduction","Adsorption; Charge transfer; Chemical activation; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Gas adsorption; Ionization potential; Oxide minerals; Reduction; Titanium dioxide; (TiO2)n clusters; Carbonate complexes; Computational studies; Electronic density; Electronic parameters; Electronic structure calculations; Linear configuration; Structure dependent; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078239575

From the observed build-up of NO2 pollution, we find highest emissions on cold weekdays in February 2018, and lowest emissions on warm weekend days in spring 2018.

The impacts of the climate change on the bean aeration in 11 mesoregions of Minas Gerais State (Brazil) were evaluated. For this, 132 simulation scenarios were analysed, including simulations of three bean harvests using measured climatic conditions, and three possible projections, representing low, intermediate and high radiative forcing levels. Based on the simulation profiles, total aeration time, grain cooling, and electrical energy consumption during bean aeration were calculated. Results were strongly affected by the weather patterns of each mesoregion and by the harvest periods of the crop. Projected climate changes tended to reduce the cooling potential, while increasing fan operation time and electrical energy requirement when aerating common beans in Minas Gerais State. The Jequitinhonha and Mucuri valleys and the North and Northwest mesoregions were predicted as no longer having suitable aeration potential since they were the most impacted by climate changes. Chilling aeration is recommended when aerating bean in these mesoregions even with the present climate and this must be intensified when considering the climate changes. In the other mesoregions, aeration with ambient air is currently suitable and this can remain viable even with the projected climate changes, but this is with the proviso that good storage practices are followed and efficient control strategies are applied. © 2019 IAgrE","Global warming; Grain quality; Stored grain","Atmospheric radiation; Energy utilization; Global warming; Beneficial effects; Climatic conditions; Control strategies; Electrical energy consumption; Grain quality; Radiative forcings; Simulation profiles; Stored grains; Humidity control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074267705

However, it is unknown how rates of successional change in tree plantations compare to secondary forests. In this study, we compared the successional trajectory of tree plantations to that of secondary forests that were between 8 and 23 years old. Censuses of woody plants (≥ 2 cm dbh [diameter at breast height]) in seven tree plantation plots and seven secondary forest plots (30 × 30 m) were conducted over three years (May 2013-July 2016) in a lowland tropical forest. Secondary forests were naturally regenerating from abandoned cattle pastures. Tree plantations were monocultures of two different native species (Vochysia guatemalensis and Hieronyma alchorneoides), planted for carbon sequestration. We measured the change in stem density, basal area, species density, rarefied species richness, and relative abundance of different growth forms and regeneration guilds. We found that differences in stem density and basal area between these two forest types were declining. Nevertheless, we did not find evidence for differences between forest types in the rate of accu­mulation of species richness when accounting for sample size. On the other hand, even though the successional trajectory in tree plantations was very similar to secondary forests, there were differences between forest types in species composition. The rate of change in relative abundance of different growth forms and regeneration guilds was similar in both forest types. Overall, our results suggest that structural-but not compositional differences-between tree plantations and secondary forests are converging during the second decade of succession. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Our proposition can distinguish activities by region, industry, process, or any other, and the product of environmental efficiency factors illustrating key drivers for CE implementation, e.g. GHG/materials and materials/product. CE is often linked to decoupling the economic activity from the degradation of natural capital. Hence, we illustrate our approach through the specific case of decoupling assessment. When combined with the Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA), we can quantify how much a single improvement towards material circularity contributes to an overall decoupling pathway. We tested the results provided in a Material Economics’ report to assess the potential for CE opportunities to reduce GHG emissions in four industries by 2050 in the EU. Our results reveal the progress expected from each CE opportunity in each industry to reach the reported conclusions, e.g., the contribution to reducing GHG emissions by 69 MtCO2 from the steel industry requires the overall environmental efficiency to improve by 67% from the baseline scenario. We also deduce the maximal increase in production for each material that would offset the benefits from implementing CE strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Circularity assessment; Decoupling; Index decomposition analysis; IPAT","Efficiency; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; Steelmaking; Circular economy; Circularity assessment; Decoupling; Index decomposition analysis; IPAT; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071847638

There are great uncertainties concerning impacts on the forest, along with how policy and economic responses will translate effectively between local and macroscales. In particular, planting tree seedlings with improved characteristics following harvesting is one localized response strategy considered essential by policymakers. However, planting costs limit the macroscale adoption of this strategy which may result in trade-offs between profitability and reducing vulnerability. In this study, we developed a decision support tool (called Q3) that links stand-level decision making to the macroscale and applied this model to investigate the financial attractiveness of planting improved stocks under one climate change threat, drought-induced seedling mortality. Using several scenarios describing planting effort, improved yields and risk to drought-induced seedling mortality, we showed that adopting improved planting stock strategies across a macroscale (i.e., the western Boreal forest of Canada) can be financially attractive when considering stand-establishment constraints and drought risk. In particular, a proactive approach can be less costly than a reactive approach to drought-induced seedling mortality. To maximize profits, the forestry industry would need to prioritize younger stands closer to processing mills that had a smaller percentage of conifer growing stocks prior to harvest. This research improves the linkages between macroscale policies and forest management activities critical for recommending future development paths that the forestry industry could follow to decrease climate change vulnerabilities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Forest genomics; Forest industry climate change mitigation; Proactive forest management; Seedling drought mortality","adaptive management; boreal forest; climate change; decision making; drought; forest management; forestry; forestry policy; genomics; mortality; reforestation; seedling; strategic approach; vulnerability; adoption; article; Canada; climate change; conifer; decision support system; drought; forest management; genomics; mortality; nonhuman; profit; reforestation; seedling; taiga; forest; forestry; tree; Coniferophyta; Canada; Climate Change; Forestry; Forests; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072859782

Few studies have examined climate adaptation for livestock with even fewer looking at small animals such as poultry. Heat stress associated with climate change is a severe challenge to poultry farmers due to its negative effect on chicken growth and productivity. As poultry plays an important food security role across Africa (being a source of livelihood and an important source of animal protein), understanding how farmers deal with the realities of poultry production due to climate change is critical. This study explores the level and determinants of the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among poultry farmers in Nigeria. A multivariate probit analysis (which allows for the possibility that the decision to adopt various practices are jointly made) reveals that while poultry farmers are adapting to climate change, there is a clear heterogeneity of adaptation strategies at different production scales. Small farms tend to invest in traditional strategies such as the stocking of local breeds while medium and large farms adopt modern technologies such as air and water ventilation as well as the use of low energy bulbs that emit less heat. Our study finds that farmers who have experienced heat-related losses are more likely to adopt modern practices and more likely to adopt multiple adaptation strategies concurrently. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Nigeria; Poultry farmers","Animals; Crops; Food supply; Multivariant analysis; Adaptation; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Modern technologies; Multiple adaptation; Multivariate probit; Nigeria; Poultry production; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; food security; heat shock; livelihood; livestock farming; poultry; Nigeria; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075249203

This effect has been hypothesized to be the result of the interaction between multiple bioclimatic factors, including environmental energy (i.e. temperature and radiation) and water availability. This is due to the tight coupling between water and carbon cycling in plants and the fact that temperature often drives plant water demand. Using GPP data extracted from 188 sites of FLUXNET2015 and observation-driven terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), we disentangled the confounding effects of temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide on GPP, and examined their long-term effects on productivity across the globe. Based on the FLUXNET2015 data, we observed a decline in the positive effect of temperature on GPP, while the positive effects of precipitation and CO2 were becoming stronger during 2000-2014. Using data derived from TBMs between 1980 and 2010 we found similar effects globally. The modeled data allowed us to investigate these effects more thoroughly over space and time. In arid regions, the modeled response to precipitation increased since 1950, approximately 30 years earlier than in humid regions. We further observed the negative effects of summer temperature on GPP in arid regions, suggesting greater aridity stress on productivity under global warming. Our results imply that aridity stress, triggered by rising temperatures, has reduced the positive influence of temperature on GPP, while increased precipitation and elevated CO2 may alleviate negative aridity impacts. © 2019 The Author(s).

In the present study of a two-factorial experiment, topsoil samples from a rice paddy were laboratory-incubated with and without fresh or aged biochar pyrolyzed of wheat residue and with and without crop residue-derived dissolved organic matter (CRM) for monitoring soil organic matter decomposition under controlled conditions. The six treatments included soil with no biochar, with fresh biochar and with aged biochar treated with CRM, respectively. For fresh biochar treatment, the topsoil of a same rice paddy was amended with wheat biochar directly from a pyrolysis wheat straw, the soil with aged biochar was collected from the same soil 6 years following a single amendment of same biochar. Total CO2 emission from the soil was monitored over a 64 day time span of laboratory incubation, while microbial biomass carbon and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) were determined at the end of incubation period. Without CRM, total organic carbon mineralization was significantly decreased by 38.8% with aged biochar but increased by 28.9% with fresh biochar, compared to no biochar. With CRM, however, the significantly highest net carbon mineralization occurred in the soil without biochar compared to the biochar-amended soil. Compared to aged biochar, fresh biochar addition significantly increased the total PLFA concentration by 20.3%–33.8% and altered the microbial community structure by increasing 17:1ω8c (Gram-negative bacteria) and i17:0 (Gram-positive bacteria) mole percentages and by decreasing the ratio of fungi/bacteria. Furthermore, biochar amendment significantly lowered the metabolic quotient of SOC decomposition, thereby becoming greater with aged biochar than with fresh biochar. The finding here suggests that biochar amendment could improve carbon utilization efficiency by soil microbial community and SOC sequestration potential in paddy soil can be enhanced by the presence of biochar in soil over the long run. © 2019 The Authors.

We used forest inventory geospatial databases, monthly climate data, spatially explicit defoliation sequence data, and the TRIPLEX-Insect model to simulate C dynamics with and without SBW disturbances in stands with different vulnerability to the SBW in the boreal forest of Quebec. Our results showed that SBW defoliation and related mortality decreased the average aboveground biomass and belowground biomass by 5.96% and 6.94% by 2017, respectively. At the same time, 21,046 km2 of forest were converted from a C sink to a source. This study provides the first quantitative analysis of the effect of a SBW outbreak on carbon dynamics for three different boreal stand types (that is, fir, spruce, and mixed fir-spruce) at a regional scale. Our results suggested that younger fir forests lost less C than either fir-spruce or spruce forests during SBW attacks between 2007 and 2017 in Quebec. This highlights the importance of considering species composition when assessing vulnerability or resilience. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","cumulative defoliation; forest carbon; natural disturbance; net ecosystem productivity; tree mortality; TRIPLEX-Insect","air-soil interaction; biomass; boreal forest; carbon sequestration; climate change; coniferous tree; disturbance; forest ecosystem; net ecosystem production; simulation; stand structure; vulnerability; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Abies; Choristoneura fumiferana; Hexapoda; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064637477

The supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle (SCBC) not only predicts remarkable advantages of high efficiency and compact equipment sizes in the moderate temperature range (450–750 °C), but also provides the disadvantages of material problem due to high temperature and pressure. The SCBC can be applied to solar energy, nuclear power, high-temperature fuel cells and waste heat sources. This paper makes a description of the SCBC as well as the properties of its working fluids supercritical CO2. In addition, the paper also summarizes different structural forms of SCBC, applications of SCBC to different heat sources, thermodynamics of SCBC, multi-objective optimization of thermodynamics and economics of SCBC, complete test equipment of SCBC, and main components design of SCBC. Future researches should focus on raising the efficiency of turbomachinery, designing compact heat exchangers, building up large-scale experimental facility, optimizing configurations of SCBC, and improving control strategies, etc. In short, SCBC is promising, but it still requires more researches on commercialization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Brayton cycle; Performance analysis; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Test loop","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Equipment testing; Fuel cells; Multiobjective optimization; Nuclear fuels; Solar energy; Supercritical fluid extraction; Temperature; Waste heat; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Experimental facilities; High temperature and pressure; High temperature fuel cells; Performance analysis; Power generation technology; State-of-the art reviews; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Brayton cycle; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; efficiency measurement; energy conservation; energy resource; equipment; heat source; high temperature; optimization; performance assessment; power generation; technological development; testing method; thermodynamics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072768530

However, vegetation cover is also generally considered to be a cause of a dried soil layer in drylands. The trade-off between soil water storage and soil carbon sequestration along a precipitation gradient in dryland ecosystems is well known, but the contributions of revegetation measures on the variations in the trade-off between carbon sequestration and soil water resource maintenance in soil profiles are often ignored. In this study, the trade-off and synergy between soil moisture content (SMC) maintenance and soil organic carbon (SOC) improvement in soil profiles on a semiarid hillslope are investigated in the context of revegetation choices. Three revegetation choices were selected for the comparative analysis: (a) afforestation using single tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia); (b) mixed tree species (R. pseudoacacia and Hippophae rhamnoides Linn); and (c) a mosaic of single tree bands (R. pseudoacacia, Armeniaca vulgaris, and H. rhamnoides Linn). Our results reveal a shift of synergy to trade-off at a depth of around 10–30 cm and a weakened trade-off between the middle (30–40 cm) and deep soil layers. For afforestation using a single tree species, there is a trade-off between SOC improvement and SMC promotion, as indicated by a negative correlation between the relative benefit of SOC and the relative benefit of SMC. For revegetation using mixed tree species and a mosaic of tree bands, positive correlations appeared. We draw two conclusions from these results: first, a shift in the trade-off and synergy between SMC maintenance and SOC improvement exists in soil profiles after revegetation on this semiarid hillslope; second, revegetation choices matter when reconciling the trade-off between SMC maintenance and SOC improvement. Revegetation with a single tree species (R. pseudoacacia) is not a good choice. When discussing the trade-off between carbon sequestration and soil water resource conservation in water-limited regions, more attention should be paid to site-level mechanisms and revegetation choices. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Semiarid environment; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil moisture; Trade-off and synergy","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Maintenance; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Revegetation; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Water conservation; Water resources; Carbon sequestration; Positive correlations; Precipitation gradients; Robinia pseudo-acacia; Semi-arid environments; Soil carbon sequestration; Trade off; Water-limited regions; Soil conservation; air-soil interaction; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation status; land degradation; moisture content; organic carbon; precipitation (climatology); revegetation; semiannual oscillation; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil profile; soil water; vegetation cover; water budget; Hippophae rhamnoides; Prunus armeniaca; Robinia pseudoacacia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075208667

Microbes in spruce (Picea asperataMast.) and fir (Abies faxonianaRehd.) rather than birch (Betula platyphyllaSuk.) and rhododendron (Rhododendron lapponicum(L.) Wahl.) can more easily adjust their physiological metabolism to acclimate to low N resources. Context: Litter decomposition is the main pathway of nutrient cycling that bridges aboveground and underground material circulation and energy flow. Microorganisms are essential for the regulation of organic carbon decomposition and nutrient cycling. Aims: We sought to reveal whether litter chemical quality predominates forest floor microbial structure and function in different species and how their characteristics vary with litter decomposition stages. Methods: We measured litter substrate quality, microbial community structure, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), extracellular enzyme activities and stoichiometric homeostasis of fresh litter (L), and fermentative (F) and humus (H) layers for these tree species. Results: Overall, the enzyme activities and microbial biomass of birch and rhododendron were greater than those of spruce and fir. The microbial abundances of birch and rhododendron decreased with decomposition. Forest floor microbial nutrient limitation is generally restricted by N in subalpine forests, and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry is affected mainly by dissolved C/N/P stoichiometry. Stronger microbial C:N homeostasis (H′) was observed for spruce (5.56) and fir (4.17) than that for birch (1.82) and rhododendron (1.33). Conclusion: We conclude that litter chemical quality led to the disparity in forest floor microbial groups and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry for different tree species. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Ecoenzymatic stoichiometry; Forest floor layers; Litter chemical quality; Microbial biomass; Tree species","biomass; chemical composition; community structure; coniferous tree; decomposition; dominance; energy flow; enzyme activity; forest floor; humus; litter; metabolism; nitrogen; physiology; stoichiometry; subalpine environment; Abies; Betula; Picea; Rhododendron; Rhododendron lapponicum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074887495

How do abiotic factors and litter quality modulate the effects of soil fauna on carbon release in this context? A field decomposition experiment involving the foliar litter of AF and RL was conducted along an elevation gradient encompassing coniferous forest, alpine shrubland and alpine meadow by using litterbags with different mesh sizes (3 and 0.04 mm). The objective was to determine the influences of soil fauna, litter quality and abiotic factors on species-specific carbon release and their contributions during litter decomposition. Our findings demonstrated that higher soil fauna abundance and diversity facilitated litter carbon release. The contribution rates of soil fauna to carbon release (Cfau) decreased with elevation increasing and decomposition time. Cfau are influenced by soil faunal diversity, dominant fauna groups (Collembola, Oribatida, Mesostigmata), and abiotic factors (temperature). Soil fauna significantly and directly regulated carbon release, abiotic factors indirectly regulated carbon release via altering soil fauna community composition and litter quality.

In order to obtain detailed information concerning the description of household consumption activities, this paper combined consumer lifestyle approach and input-output analysis to estimate indirect carbon emissions of urban household from 2002 to 2012. Besides, we further analysed the driving forces and inequality of indirect carbon emissions. The results showed that the total indirect carbon emissions during the study period increased rapidly, rising from 894.08 MtCO2 to 1957.03 MtCO2. ¬ More than 58% of carbon emissions were from 40% of the high income population. The highest income group, 10% of total urban households, deduced 21% of urban indirect carbon emissions. The per capita carbon emissions of different households showed a remarkable disparity, and the per capita carbon emissions of high income groups decreased from 2011 to 2012. The effective mitigation efforts should focus on reducing carbon intensity and shifting consumption structure. For high inequality consumption activities caused by rich households, rich urban households should consume less goods and services from this consumption activities. For high inequality consumption activities caused by low income households, the redistribution of income from rich to poor and low carbon intensity lifestyles may be better options to reduce carbon emissions and inequalities of urban households. © 2019","Consumer lifestyle approach; Gini coefficient; Indirect carbon emissions; Input-output analysis; LMDI; Urban households","Climate change; Economic analysis; Consumer lifestyle approach; Gini coefficients; Indirect carbon emissions; Input output analysis; LMDI; Urban-household; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072227143

In this study, input-output analysis was adopted to calculate the carbon footprints of urban households in China. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the impact factors on indirect carbon footprints was carried out by using the structural decomposition analysis at both holistic and sectoral levels. The results showed that the carbon footprints of urban households were 941.37 MtCO2 in 2002, 1498.11 MtCO2 in 2007, and 2139.50 MtCO2 in 2012. Electricity was the main contributor to the direct urban household carbon footprints, accounting for over 40%. The category of ""household facilities"" contributed the most to indirect carbon footprints (306.00 MtCO2) in 2012, and the ""transportation"" had the fastest growth rate (395%) during 2002-2012. The industrial sector of ""wearing apparel"" had the largest increments (139.92 MtCO2) in carbon footprints during the past decade. Generally, consumption level and population size presented positive effects on the increments in indirect carbon footprints, while emission intensity decreased indirect carbon footprints. However, the impact of consumption structure and intermediate demand on indirect carbon footprints varied at holistic and sectoral levels. The mitigation efforts should focus on reducing emission intensity, shifting consumption structure and changing intermediate demand. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon footprints; China; Input-output analysis; Structural decomposition analysis; Urban households","carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; decomposition analysis; fuel consumption; growth rate; holistic approach; household survey; input-output analysis; mitigation; national economy; population size; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083844066

However, previous studies have rarely paid attention to the cross-impacts that different forms of public environmental concern (PEC) have simultaneously on energy and environmental efficiency. To investigate how these two types of efficiency change along with PEC variations, this paper employs six extended programming models which are developed based upon the theory of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the directional distance function (DDF). An empirical analysis of data from 239 Chinese prefecture-level cities demonstrates the techniques.

This paper aims to assess the extent to which the market revenues of multiple heat production technologies can cover their fixed costs in a competitive wholesale district heating market. Marginal-cost pricing is applied in a case study of the Netherlands. A linear programming model incorporating heat supply and demand is developed to obtain hourly dispatch and heat market prices. It is concluded that low carbon heat generation technologies tend to have low short-run marginal costs. All examined heat producers have an under-recovery of fixed costs in a range between 60% and 90% except the waste incineration combined heat and power plant. It has an overall return on investment of 44% and 12% within the reference and heat pump scenario respectively. Although marginal-cost pricing may ensure cost-efficient dispatch, the market revenues are far from enough to recoup the investment costs for the majority of the heat producer, let alone the network costs. Significant additional remuneration is required to sustain a competitive heat market and ensure sufficient investment in new generation capacity in the long run. © 2019 The Authors","District heating; Marginal-cost pricing; The Netherlands; Wholesale market","Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Cost accounting; District heating; Global warming; Investments; Linear programming; Waste incineration; Carbon dioxide emissions; Generation technologies; Linear programming models; Marginal-cost pricing; Netherlands; New generation capacity; Short run marginal costs; Wholesale markets; Costs; carbon dioxide; combined heat and power; cost analysis; energy market; heat production; heating; nuclear power plant; power generation; power plant; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074473311

Following the hypothesis of Environmental Kuznets Curve with collecting data from 1985 to 2015, this paper examines the relation between per capita emissions of main pollutants as well as CO2 and per capita GDP deflator in Heilongjiang Province. Empirical results present that different from the traditional inverted U-shaped curve that was proposed by Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, the curves between each type of emission and per capita GDP deflator have different shapes. Specifically, the shape of curves between per capita emissions of waste water, waste gas, solid waste, CO2 and per cap GDP deflator are the upright N-shape, inverted N-shape, upright U-shape, and inverted N-shape, respectively. With respect to the influencing factors for the disparity of their shapes, per capita annual total trade, regional energy intensity, industrial structure, and technology progress significantly affect the relation between each per capita emission and per capita GDP deflator, but government corruption can concurrently hinder and promote the environmental quality. This case reflects that in terms of regional environmental governance, the actual administrative efficiency in Heilongjiang Province is still low, and thus it needs to invest the extra opportunity cost to reverse this unfavorable state. © 2019 ACM.","Autoregressive Moving Average Model; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Heilongjiang Province; Influencing factors; Low-carbon economy","Autoregressive moving average model; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Industrial management; Environmental governances; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Environmental Kuznets curves; Environmental quality; Heilongjiang; Industrial structures; Influencing factors; Low carbon economy; Economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081065321

Here, a novel process, named the one-stage PNAM, that integrates the Partial Nitritation (PN), Anammox and Methane-dependent nitrite/nitrate reduction reactions in a single membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) is developed. With feeding of 1030 mg NH4+-N/L at a hydraulic retention time of 16 h, the proposed one-stage PNAM process achieved an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 98% and a nitrogen removal rate of 1.5 kg N/m3/d (1.4–1.8 g N/m2/d) by using methane as the sole carbon-based electron donor.

In this study, the emissions and impacts of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) were projected into summertime of the 2050s (average for 2048–2052) for China using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) driven by future meteorological fields simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for two future climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Surface temperatures were projected to increase by 0.18 K yr−1 and 0.34 K yr−1 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Such increases in future surface temperatures will increase BVOC emissions, as emissions of isoprene and monoterpene (accounting for 77.73% of all BVOCs in China at the current time) are projected to increase by 11.13% and 25.20% under the two RCP scenarios in the 2050s, respectively. Consequently, such increases in BVOCs will also have considerable impacts on concentrations of O3 and SOA. BVOCs contribute 10.11% of O3 and 62.59% of SOA concentrations in eastern China at current time. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, climate-driven BVOC changes will enhance O3 and SOA concentrations by 0.90% and 7.33% in eastern China from current to the 2050s and account for 31.83% and 52.80% of total O3 and SOA changes, respectively, on average across five typical regions. Such increases in O3 and SOA concentrations resulting from climate-driven BVOC changes decline considerably under the RCP4.5 scenario to less than 0.80% and 6.50%, respectively, implying that climate mitigation can facilitate air pollution control by alleviating an increase in BVOCs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogenic emissions; China; Climate change; Ozone; Secondary organic aerosol; Volatile organic compounds","Aerosols; Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Gas chromatography; Monoterpenes; Ozone; Surface properties; Volatile organic compounds; Weather forecasting; Biogenic emission; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; China; Community multi-scale air quality models; Future climate scenarios; Meteorological fields; Secondary organic aerosols; Weather research and forecasting models; Climate change; isoprene; ozone; terpene; volatile organic compound; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; climate change; concentration (composition); organic compound; ozone; pollutant source; pollution control; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air pollution control; air temperature; Article; China; climate change; concentration (parameter); mathematical model; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; simulation; summer; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072873386

Based on the listed companies of the Chinese heavy pollution industry from 2009 to 2014, using the content analysis method, the paper researches the influence of the spatial heterogeneity regarding government regulation and spatial distance on enterprise carbon information disclosure and puts forward some suggestions. The empirical results show that carbon information disclosure is significantly positively related with the spatial heterogeneity of government regulation. The spatial heterogeneity of government regulation is significantly positively associated to non-financial carbon information disclosure. The relationship between government supervision and financial carbon information disclosure is not significant. Spatial distance and carbon information disclosure are significantly positively related. There is also a significant positive correlation between spatial distance and financial carbon information disclosure. Further study finds that in public enterprises, the spatial heterogeneity of government regulation will promote carbon information disclosure, and the influence of spatial heterogeneity of government regulation on non-financial and financial carbon information disclosure both are significantly positively related. In non-public enterprises, spatial distance and carbon information disclosure are significantly positively related, and spatial distance and non-financial carbon information disclosure are significantly positively related as well. © 2019 by the authors.

We developed a satellite-based PM2.5 retrieval method using optical-mass relationships via aerosol microphysical characteristics. Satellite data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, combined with parameters from meteorological reanalysis, were processed to calculate particle radii and retrieve PM2.5 mass concentrations over China in 2017. Our study is the first to identify the spatial pattern of mean PM2.5 radius over China, which was validated against observations from AERONET (RMSE = 0.11 μm). Mean particle size over eastern China is smaller than in the west, depicting a clear bifurcation across the country, especially in summertime. This finding is attributed to variations in topography, meteorology, land use and population density, which affects the properties of emitted aerosols as well as their fate and transport. A statistically significant correlation (R = 0.82) was observed between estimated and measured annual PM2.5, with RMSE = 9.25 μg/m3, MAE = 6.98 μg/m3, MBE = −1.98 μg/m3 and RPE = 17.69% (N = 1270). The spatiotemporal distributions of resulting PM2.5 are consistent with previous findings, indicating the effectiveness and applicability of our method. Our approach quantifies PM2.5 mass concentrations without introducing regionally-specific fitting parameters, which can be efficiently applied across various spatial and temporal domains. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Although the dual-fuel engines have strong merits on emissions reduction, which can reach the IMO Tier III without aftertreatment, the power output is much lower than that of diesel engines. Therefore, the dual-fuel engine is also needed to improve continuously. However, the mixing and combustion processes in the engine have not been fully understood. In this study, a 3D-CFD model of the dual-fuel engine was established using CONVERGE to explore the mixing and combustion processes. Locally embedding fine grids are considered at scavenging ports, natural gas injection ports, pre-chamber. The model was validated by experimental in-cylinder pressure.

To develop a comprehensive understanding of rainfall modification due to urbanization, a systematic meta-analysis is undertaken. The initial search identified over 2000 papers of which 489 were carefully analyzed. From these papers, 85 studies from 48 papers could be used in a quantitative meta-analysis assessment. Results were analyzed for case studies versus climatological assessments, observational versus modeling studies and for day versus night. Results highlight that urbanization modifies rainfall, such that mean precipitation is enhanced by 18% downwind of the city, 16% over the city, 2% on the left and 4% on the right with respect to the storm direction. The rainfall enhancement occurred approximately 20–50 km from the city center. Study results help develop a more complete picture of the role of urban processes in rainfall modification and highlight that rainfall increases not only downwind of the city but also over the city. These findings have implications for urban flooding as well as hydroclimatological studies. This meta-analysis highlights the need for standardizing how the results are presented in future studies to aid the generalization of findings. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"rain; city; climate change; ecosystem monitoring; flooding; meta analysis; meteorology; methodology; observational study; photoperiodicity; prevention and control; procedures; theoretical model; urbanization; Cities; Climate Change; Ecological Parameter Monitoring; Floods; Meteorology; Models, Theoretical; Observational Studies as Topic; Photoperiod; Rain; Research Design; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065733473

Thus, it is important to study the spatial interactive effects of urbanisation and other factors on carbon emissions. Considering the rapid urbanisation in China, this paper studies the regional disparity and spatial spillover effects of urbanisation and carbon emissions of China. The law of geography is introduced to explain the mechanism of spatial effects of carbon emission theoretically. By combining STIRPAT model with spatial Dubin model, the spatial interactive effects among both independent variables and dependent variables can be clarified empirically. The results show that: (1) Technological limitation, wealth and population are the driving factors of carbon emissions, and are the most influential factors in the East, Middle and West parts of China in turn. (2) As urbanisation improves, its influence on local carbon emissions changes from positive to negative and then the negative influence becomes weaker. (3) Carbon emissions have strong spatial spillover effects among provinces. (4) Urbanisation, technology, wealth and population levels have different spatial interactive effects on carbon emissions in different parts of China. Accordingly, the influences of urbanisation and other factors on carbon emissions vary substantially among regions and have spatial spillover effects among provinces, suggesting different policies for different regions with different surroundings to reduce carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Different regions; Energy consumption intensity; Spatial interactive effect; Urbanisation","Carbon; Energy utilization; Flow of gases; CO2 emissions; Different regions; Energy consumption intensity; Interactive effect; Urbanisation; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072289737

However, traditional PDA mainly focuses on scenarios of decision making units (DMUs) with constant returns to scale, and neglects technology heterogeneity among DMUs. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint approach combined PDA and index decomposition analysis (IDA) based on the variable returns to scale (VRS) and the meta-frontier model, and further decomposed the change of carbon emissions into 9 driving factors. Based on above, we investigated the effects of the nine factors on the change of carbon emissions at national, regional and provincial levels in China during the period of 2007–2016. The results indicated that the increase of carbon emissions in China have slowed down since 2012, but the overall situation is not optimistic, especially in the western region. Economic activity played a dominant role in increasing carbon emissions for each region. Carbon emission efficiency and potential carbon factor were also the two important factors related to increase carbon emissions. Conversely, energy intensity, the catch-up effect of pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency on carbon emissions played a positive role in decreasing CO2 emissions, especially for the eastern region. However, the driving factors related to energy usage, such as the catch-up effect of energy usage scale efficiency and the pure energy usage technical efficiency had trifling and unstable effects on the change of carbon emissions. Based on the above analysis, we propose suggestions to reduce carbon emissions. © 2019","Carbon emissions; Meta-frontier; Production-theoretical decomposition analysis; Scale efficiency","Decision making; Economics; Factor analysis; Carbon emission efficiencies; Carbon emissions; Decision making unit; Decomposition analysis; Index decomposition analyses (IDA); Meta frontier models; Meta-frontier; Pure technical efficiencies; Carbon; carbon emission; decision making; decomposition analysis; economic activity; environmental economics; meta-analysis; scenario analysis; technical efficiency; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073203477

In this study, we designed a new plant-driven SMES (New-PSMES) with a separated sand-filled anode column in order to improve the mass transfer and thereby enhance the microorganism activity, power generation and bioremediation range and efficiency for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Because of the mass flow driven by the plants, the New-PSMESs started up approximately 7 d earlier and produced voltages 30–70 mV higher than the planted SMESs, and had greater enzyme activities and residual organic carbon than the unplanted and planted SMESs. In the New-PSMES, the total mass removal rates of phenanthrene and pyrene were 62.98% and 57.02% after 82 d, and these values were 1.5–2 times higher than those of the unplanted and planted SMESs. The removal of PAHs in the sediment was primarily attributed to nonelectrochemical biodegradation at sites far from the anode and to electrochemical reactions on the anode. The top three most abundant phyla in all samples were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes.

Efficiency is one of the important performance indicators in both supply chain and agribusiness. In this regard, the objectives of the study are to identify the different sources of uncertainty perceived by the different actors in the supply chain, to measure the rice supply chain efficiency, and to study the impact of the environmental uncertainty on the supply chain efficiency. The data of 215 respondents is collected from the Ayeyarwaddy Region by using a purposive and stratified random sampling method, and we analyze this data via descriptive statistics, an exploratory factor analysis, data envelopment analysis (DEA), and Tobit regression analysis. The scores for the technical, pure, and scale efficiency show a very low performance of the rice supply chain in the Ayeyarwaddy Region resulting from the fact that most of the rice businesses are too small and need to expand their operating size. We found that this global rice supply chain performance is significantly impacted by the planning and control uncertainty and the climate uncertainty. Therefore, mitigation initiatives must be developed such as financial insurance mechanisms and extension services should be widespread. Both aim to improve the impact of the climate adverse conditions and to increase the efficiency of resource utilization in the supply chain. Moreover, the actors should organize themselves in cooperatives such that the scale of operations can be increased and information is captured and shared between different parties in the supply chain. This is crucial to operational control and planning because a higher quality of information input will increase the quality of managerial decision making. © 2019, The Author(s).","Efficiency performance; Environmental uncertainty; Myanmar; Rice supply chain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066784868

Yet the resulting impacts on carbon dioxide emissions and ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) related premature mortality are unclear. Here we show that in contrast to a free trade world, with the emission intensity in each sector unchanged, an extremely anti-trade scenario with current tariffs plus an additional 25% tariff on each traded product would reduce the global export volume by 32.5%, gross domestic product by 9.0%, carbon dioxide by 6.3%, and PM2.5-related mortality by 4.1%. The respective impacts would be substantial for the United States, Western Europe and China. A freer trade scenario would increase global carbon dioxide emission and air pollution due to higher levels of production, especially in developing regions with relatively high emission intensities. Global collaborative actions to reduce emission intensities in developing regions could help achieve an economic-environmental win-win state through globalization. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; free trade; mortality; particulate matter; trade-environment relations; Article; carbon footprint; China; environmental impact; gross national product; health impact assessment; human; interdisciplinary education; mathematical model; Pacific islands; particulate matter; premature mortality; public health problem; simulation; South Asia; trade union; war; Western Europe; commercial phenomena; conflict; Europe; international cooperation; particulate matter; premature mortality; tax; United States; China; United States; Western Europe; carbon; carbon dioxide; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Commerce; Dissent and Disputes; Europe; Gross Domestic Product; Humans; Internationality; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter; Taxes; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074286000

Reducing the energy intensity of this crucial sector is of great importance to China's green transition. This paper seeks to determine the drivers of the energy intensity change in China's metallurgical industry during 2000–2016. To serve this purpose, we construct a comprehensive framework which combines Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) and Production Decomposition Analysis (PDA) methods to fully decompose the change of energy intensity, and in this way more complete and in-depth insights can be provided. The results showed that the technological progress effect made the greatest contribution to the decline in energy intensity, with a cumulative reduction of 72.32%, while the labor-energy substitution is the greatest obstacle to the energy intensity reduction. As to the provincial contribution, except for Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, all the other provinces make positive contributions to the energy intensity reduction in China's metallurgical industry. Therein, Hebei, Hunan and Shannxi provinces rank the top one contributor in Eastern, Central, and Western China, respectively. Based on the empirical results, some targeted recommendations to formulate energy-saving policies for China's metallurgical industry are put forward. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China's metallurgical industry; Comprehensive decomposition analysis; Energy intensity","Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Metals; Decomposition analysis; Energy intensity; Energy saving and emission reductions; Energy saving policies; High energy consumption industries; Index decomposition analyses (IDA); Metallurgical industry; Quantitative assessments; Metallurgy; decomposition analysis; electricity industry; energy intensity; energy policy; metallurgy; quantitative analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073975089

Over time, district heating has started to replace local heating systems in urban areas. Different heating systems, based on different kind of combustion materials, have been introduced for heating private houses. Solar, earth and air heating have also been introduced in recent decades. At the same time, wood burning stove heating have still an important role in heating private homes as a traditional way. This, in turn, causes a reduction in air quality in urban areas during the heating season. Due to the decline in air quality, an idea of banning the wood-burning stove heating systems in urban areas rises. In historic buildings of architectural value, as well as heritage sites and buildings seeking of cultural authenticity, the preservation of stoves is required. In order for stoves to remain more than just decorative furnishings, it is wise to find possibilities of using stoves for their intended use using modern and non-polluting options. For example, by installing electric heating elements in furnaces or by supplying heat to the furnaces through preheated water. The aim of this study is that by using smart control element and heating the furnace with an electric heater during periods when electricity is cheap, it ensures the suitability of the indoor climate of the building and reduces the air pollution. At the same time, it balances the demand response ratio in electricity market. © 2019 IEEE.","demand response; heat storage; heating system; historic buildings","Air pollution control; Air quality; Buildings; Electric heating; Electric heating elements; Electric power transmission networks; Furnaces; Heat storage; Historic preservation; Smart power grids; Demand response; Electric heater; Heating season; Heating system; Heritage sites; Historic buildings; Indoor climate; Supplying heat; Stoves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081045503

Central to the entire discipline of climate projections is the use of models. However, model performance varies from one region to another. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the performance of 18 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical simulations of precipitation over Malawi against rain gauge data. The period of study runs from 1982 to 2005. Statistical analyses were extensively carried out at both spatial and temporal scales using the following metrics: correlation coefficient (R), bias, percentage bias (PBias), standard deviation (STDEV), root mean square error (RMSE), and trend. At spatial scales, Hovmoller diagrams (HD) were used to analyse model simulations. Results indicate that the models adequately reproduce the expected annual cycle of rainfall although ~ 77% of them overestimate rain gauge data. Further, only nine of the models analysed correlate positively with rain gauge data. The correlation ranges from − 0.2 to 0.43. Seasonal root mean square errors (RMSEs) are largest during the core of the rainy season (December–February), the beginning (September–October), and the end (March–May), respectively. Rainy gauge data showed that the highest standard deviation was in the north-eastern parts of the country and around the Lake Malawi region. In general, most models poorly simulated the spatial standard deviation. Although there are large variations in model performance, models that generally perform better than others are: CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH, GISS-E2-H, and MPI-ESM-LR. While these models are identified as well performing, their deficiencies have also been extensively discussed in this work, and therefore, caution needs to be exercised by end users when using these models to make decisions pertaining to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CMIP5; Malawi; Precipitation; Spatial distribution; Temporal distribution","atmospheric modeling; climate change; climate prediction; CMIP; computer simulation; error analysis; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; raingauge; spatial distribution; trend analysis; Malawi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086739159

In this study, the CO2 emissions from electricity generation in 30 provinces of China during the period of 2005–2015 are systematically inventoried. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model is used to analyze the driving forces of changes in CO2 emissions of the power sector. In addition, to analyze the impact of the Chinese 11th and 12th Five-Year Plan on carbon emissions, this study divides the studied period into two sub-periods, 2005–2010 and 2010–2015. Finally, based on their CO2 emission characteristics, we divide 30 provinces into 5 clusters using the K-means clustering to further investigate the carbon reduction measures. The results show that for national CO2 emissions of the power sector, the economic activity effect played a key role in raising CO2 emissions in 2005–2015, while the industrial electricity intensity effect and the energy efficiency effect contributed the most to CO2 reduction during the periods of 2005–2010 and 2010–2015, respectively. During the period of 2010–2015, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Xinjiang contributed the most to reducing CO2 emissions. In addition, for most provinces, the industrial electricity intensity effect was the main driver for reducing CO2 emissions of the power sector. Meanwhile, the electricity structure effect played an increasingly decisive role in declining emissions in provinces where renewable energy is blooming, such as in Yunnan and Sichuan; while for the industrial structure optimized provinces like Hebei and Jiangsu, the industry structure effect played a primary role. By investigating the driving forces of changes in CO2 emissions from the power sector, this study aims to provide insights for provincial decarbonization pathways of the power sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering analysis; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; LMDI; Power sector","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Economics; Energy efficiency; K-means clustering; Reduction; Clustering analysis; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; LMDI; Power sector; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071621382

Specifically, the LPJ-GUESS (Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator) model was used to simulate net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) dynamics of two forest ecosystems of different origins between 1951 and 2100, to quantitatively analyze the carbon source and sink functions and potential changes in soil carbon dynamics in arid and humid regions under future climate change, simulate the dynamics of forest net primary productivity (NPP) under different climatic factors, and analyze the sensitivity of forests in arid and humid regions to temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. We found that: (1) in both the historical and future periods, the average NEP of both studied forests in the humid region was larger than that in the arid region, the carbon sink function of the humid region being predicted to become stronger and the arid zone possibly becoming a carbon source; (2) between 1951 and 2100, the forest soil Rh in the arid region was lower than that in the humid region and under future climate change, forest in the humid region may have higher soil carbon loss; (3) increasing temperature had a negative effect and CO2 concentration had a positive effect on the forests in the study area, and forests in arid areas are more sensitive to precipitation change.

Here, we analyze the projected changes in EASM circulation and precipitation under different warming levels from 1.5 to 5 °C above the preindustrial global mean temperature, using large-ensemble simulations conducted with Canadian Earth System Model version 2. We find that the model projects enhanced monsoon circulation and precipitation with global warming. The 850-hPa meridional winds, precipitation, and 500-hPa vertical ascending motion will be enhanced nonlinearly, while the total column precipitable water will increase quasi-linearly. The increase in precipitable water in the wet EASM region is only slightly greater than global average but the increase in precipitation is much greater than global one, with enhanced 500-hPa vertical ascending motion contrary to global mean. The increased low-level land-sea thermal contrast leads to the enhanced EASM meridional circulation and thus bring a large amount of moisture into Eastern China, providing favorable conditions for additional increase in precipitation. A simplified moisture budget analysis shows that the dynamic component related to strengthening monsoon circulation plays dominant role in the increase in EASM precipitation when the global temperature increases by more than approximately 2 °C, while the thermodynamic component caused by increased water vapor is important when the warming is smaller. ©2019.

Studies of peat carbon dynamics have primarily been conducted in monsoon-influenced China. However, data relating to carbon dynamics in peat deposits has not yet been investigated in Westerlies-influenced Northwest China (NWC). In this study, the Holocene carbon accumulation rate (CAR) is explored at the Tuolehaite peat core, with a mean rate of growth of 2.4 yr mm-1, 0.4 mm yr-1, in the high-elevation Altai Mountains within NWC. Its CAR shows a decreasing trend, ranging from 4.8 to 68.8 g C m-2 yr-1, with a mean of 28.0 g C m-2 yr-1 since the Holocene epoch. Comparisons of the CAR in the Westerlies-influenced NWC with that in the monsoon-influenced Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Northeast China, and South China, reveal that the Holocene CAR trend in relatively high-elevation peat deposits (e.g. Tuolehaite Peat and Hongyuan Peat) is opposite to that found in relatively low-elevation peat deposits (e.g. Hani Peat and Dahu Peat). Different driving factors (temperature and precipitation) of CAR could be responsible for these opposing trends. To be specific, temperature is the main driving factor influencing the CAR in relatively high-elevation peat deposits, whereas precipitation is the key driving factor controlling the CAR in relatively low-elevation peat deposits. Our work indicates that comprehensive investigations into peat CARs in both Westerlies-influenced and monsoon-influenced regions contribute to an understanding of the peat CAR pattern in China as a whole. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, bridging modern computer vision with remote sensing data analysis could have critical impact to the way we understand our environment and lead to major breakthroughs in global urban planning or climate change research. Land cover classification is the cornerstone of applications above. It aims at classifying each pixel in a satellite image into a particular land cover category which can be regarded as a multi-class semantic segmentation task. Compared with everyday images, satellite imagery has some different features. Satellite is much bigger than everyday images which means we need more computation resource and a new method to see further. Besides, there are many large well-annotated datasets for everyday images while annotating satellite image is difficult which means we don't have enough well-annotated satellite images. What's more, resolution of satellite images is becoming higher and higher which makes it very difficult to classify the pixel's class. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based on atrous convolution. Atrous convolution means we add null value in convolution kernel. This can increase receptive field (RF) without increasing the compute quantity. Meanwhile, we adopt transfer learning in the network. We use ResNet-101 as backbone network and this works better than initializing the weights randomly. At last, we add graph based fine tuning with BFS in our proposed network for improving the segmentation performance. This operate can reduce the debris caused by high resolution. The evaluation index of the experimental results is mean intersection over union (mIoU).

Belowground carbon input can strongly influence microbial processes (carbon or nitrogen cycling). However, changes in sediment microbial abundance and community structure have not been thoroughly assessed in freshwater ecosystems under rising atmospheric CO2. A pot experiment was conducted using fragments of the submerged macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum L. to study plant and sediment microbial responses to increasing aquatic carbon availability under rising atmospheric CO2. Three DIC levels of overlying water were set up by continuous bubbling with different concentrations of CO2. Higher biomass accumulation, chlorophyll content, nitrate reductase activity, and leaf N content were observed in M. spicatum under high DIC level in CO2 treatment. The increased DIC level in CO2 treatment reduced sediment ammonium nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen content, microbial biomass carbon content and phenol oxidase activity, but not microbial biomass nitrogen content, urease and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activities. NifH abundance significantly decreased with the increasing DIC levels in CO2 treatment, while bacterial 16S rRNA abundance was not affected. Redundancy analysis results indicated a modest but obvious shift in sediment microbial community compositions among different levels of DIC. Variation partitioning revealed a strong interaction between plant traits and sediment properties and their regulation of sediment microbial compositions at different DIC levels. It seemed that an intensified competition for essential resources between M. spicatum and sediment microbes occurred under increased aquatic DIC availability caused by rising atmospheric CO2. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Extracellular enzymes; Nitrate reductase; Photosynthetic properties; Sediment microbial abundance; Submerged macrophytes","aquatic ecosystem; carbon dioxide enrichment; dissolved inorganic carbon; enzyme activity; macrophyte; microbial activity; nitrogen cycle; photosynthesis; sediment chemistry; submerged vegetation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Myriophyllum spicatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074690385

Biomass carbon sequestration is one of the key ecosystem services forests are relied upon for mitigating global climate change. However, planning for large-scale tree planting and managing established forest stands for carbon sequestration require careful consideration of the gain in biomass production and tradeoff for other regulatory services. How a tradeoff between forest production and conservation of water resources is shaped by the condition of forest stand and environmental factors remains a question of broad interest in sustainable forest ecosystem management. Methods: We studied the spatiotemporal patterns of net primary productivity (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE), and their relationships with local climatic and forest stand factors over a temperate forest landscape in Changbai Mountain, Northeast China. The time series of spatial data on NPP and ET were extracted from the global remote sensing datasets for the MOD16A3 and MOD17A3 products for the period 2000–2014. The time series of spatial patterns of annual precipitation and annual mean temperature were obtained as grid maps for regional meteorological variables. Stand patches were categorized into the types of conifers, broadleaves, and mixed-wood, as well as age-classes of young, mid-age, near mature, mature, and old-growth stands, and by establishment into natural and planted. Information on stands and selective site variables were compiled from the Forest Inventory Datasets of China. Analyses were performed with Arc-GIS. Results: Over the study period of 2000–2014, the landscape-level annual NPP varied between 311.7 and 573.6 gC∙m− 2∙a− 1,ET between 559.9 and 603.0 mm∙a− 1, and WUE between 0.54 and 1.01 gC∙m− 2∙mm− 1. Across the forest landscape, the mean annual NPP varied between 205.0 and 639.4 gC∙m− 2∙a− 1, ET between 441.5 and 784.0 mm∙a− 1, and WUE in the range of 0.46–1.10 gC∙m− 2∙mm− 1. The spatial variations in NPP, ET, and WUE were commonly attributable to forest type, stand age class and density, establishment mode, and temperature variables, with some effects of other selective factors on ET and WUE. The three forest types were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) differentiated in the mean annual NPP, ET, and WUE: the coniferous forests were highest in NPP (505.3 ± 1.4 gC∙m− 2∙a− 1; n = 1041) and WUE (0.872 ± 0.004 gC∙m− 2∙mm− 1; n = 1041), and lowest in ET (584.1 ± 1.6 mm∙a− 1; n = 1041), followed by the mixed-wood forests (NPP: 500.5 ± 0.8 gC∙m− 2∙a− 1;WUE:0.856±0.02gC∙m− 2∙mm− 1; ET: 589.3 ± 0.9 mm∙a− 1; n = 2156); whereas the broadleaved forests were lowest in NPP (491.6 ± 0.6 gC∙m− 2∙a− 1; n = 4428) and WUE (0.832 ± 0.02 gC∙m− 2∙mm− 1; n = 4428), and highest in ET (594.7 ± 0.6 mm∙a− 1; n = 4428). The mean annual NPP, ET and WUE increased with stand age typically in coniferous forests, and weakly in mixed-wood forests. The natural stands had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) greater NPP and WUE than planted stands in conifers and mixed-woods. Conclusions: Forest type and stand-age class are factors of key consideration in planning and managing forest landscape for achieving the compromise between regional carbon balance and water usage. Facilitating the establishment of coniferous trees and conservation of mature forest stands, and near-natural management of planted forests, can be favorable options for delivering ecosystem services of carbon sequestration and water conservation in temperate regions. © The Author(s). 2019.","Forest landscape; Forest type; Net primary productivity; Regional water balance; Stand age-class; Temperate region; Water use efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066300642

While the YEATS domain has been found to be a prominent reader of acetylation and other short acyl modifications, whether additional acyl-lysine reader domains exist, particularly for longer carbon chains, is unclear. Here, we employed a quantitative proteomic approach using various modified peptide baits to identify reader proteins of various acyl modifications. We discovered that proteins harboring HEAT and ARM repeats bind to lysine myristoylated peptides. Recombinant HEAT and ARM repeats bind to myristoylated peptides independent of the peptide sequence or the position of the myristoyl group. Indeed, HEAT and ARM repeats bind directly to medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (MCFA and LCFA). Lipidomic experiments suggest that MCFAs and LCFAs interact with HEAT and ARM repeat proteins in mammalian cells. Finally, treatment of cells with exogenous MCFAs and inhibitors of MCFA-CoA synthases increase the transactivation activity of the ARM repeat protein β-catenin.

Although China has achieved successes in the field of clean energy, especially clean power dispatch, power dispatch is still one-sided and incomplete when considering environmental aspects. This paper presents a comprehensive production cleanliness evaluation model to assign a comprehensive environmental value as a reference for clean power dispatch. The model considers all the pollutants currently regulated in China's coal-fired power plants, carbon emissions, and sustainability as three basic environmental constraints. Then, emergy analysis is used to unify the input/output materials with different units of measurement, and the emergy-based environmental value added (EEVA) value is constructed. As an integrated environmental value, the EEVA can provide an environmental reference for clean power dispatch. Finally, we selected a representative coal-fired power plant in China as a case study. By applying the above model, the dispatching sequence for four generating units was arranged from the perspective of cleanliness. © 2019 by the authors.","Coal-fired power generation; Comprehensive production cleanliness evaluation model; Emergy analysis; Environmental constraints; Sustainability","climate change; coal-fired power plant; emergy; environmental assessment; environmental values; input-output analysis; methodology; numerical model; power generation; regulatory approach; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076712362

Understanding the mechanisms of N2O production and quantifying emissions in these lakes is essential for assessing regional and global N2O budgets and for mitigating N2O emissions. Here, we measure isotopic compositions (δ15N-N2O and δ18O-N2O) and site preference (SP) of dissolved N2O in an attempt to differentiate the relative contribution of N2O production processes in the shallow, eutrophic Chaohu Lake, Eastern China. Our results show that the bulk isotope ratios for δ15N-N2O, δ18O-N2O, and SP were 5.8 ± 3.9‰, 29.3 ± 13.4‰, and 18.6 ± 3.2‰, respectively. More than 76.8% of the dissolved N2O was produced via microbial processes. Findings suggest that dissolved N2O is primarily produced via nitrification (between 27.3% and 48.0%) and denitrification (between 31.9% and 49.5%). In addition, isotopic data exhibit significant N2O consumption during denitrification. We estimate the average N2O emission rate (27.5 ± 26.0 μg N m−2 h−1), which is higher than that from rivers in the Changjiang River network (CRN). We scaled-up the regional N2O emission (from 1.98 Gg N yr−1 to 4.58 Gg N yr−1) using a N2O emission factor (0.51 ± 0.63%) for shallow lakes in the middle and lower region of the CRN. We suggest that beneficial circumstances for promoting complete denitrification may be helpful for reducing N2O production and emissions in fresh surface waters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification; Isotopic composition; N2O; Nitrification; Site preference","Budget control; Denitrification; Dissolution; Isotopes; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; River pollution; Isotopic characteristics; Isotopic composition; Nitrification and denitrification; Nitrous oxide production; Production process; Relative contribution; Shallow freshwater; Site preferences; Lakes; nitrogen 15; nitrous oxide; oxygen 18; isotope; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; denitrification; freshwater; isotopic composition; isotopic ratio; nitrification; nitrous oxide; shallow water; air and air related phenomena; Article; chemical composition; China; denitrification; microbiological phenomena and functions; nitrification; river; sediment; chemistry; denitrification; environmental monitoring; lake; nitrification; Anhui; Chaohu Lake; China; China; Denitrification; Environmental Monitoring; Isotopes; Lakes; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072279443

With climate change and variability and land use/land management, ecosystem services have changed globally. Some ecological restoration activities, such as the Grain for Green program (GGP) implemented in the Yellow River basin (YRB) of China, greatly change the flow patterns and affect the flood regulation services provided by ecosystems. Many studies have assessed the peak flow trends in the YRB; however, quantitatively evaluating flood regulation services while also considering the effects of climate, vegetation and dam construction is rare. In this study, the annual flood regulation index (FRI) was calculated from 1958 to 2014 for nine watersheds in the YRB using an index-based ecosystem service approach. Based on the community land model coupled with the geomorphology-based hydrological model (CLM-GBHM) established in the YRB, the annual FRI under two vegetation scenarios, i.e., (1) static leaf area index (LAI) in 1982 and (2) remotely sensed LAI from 1982 to 2014, was calculated. The effects of changes in climate and vegetation on the flood regulation services were then assessed. The Impacts of reservoirs were also discussed based on the FRI calculated using observed data. The results indicate that the annual FRI generally improved in most areas of the YRB over a 57-year period. The annual FRI significantly increased in the upper YRB while being stabilized in the headwater basin, primarily benefitting from the regulations by the Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs. When climate change was considered as a single influencing factor, the flood regulation services were negatively affected by extreme precipitation. Impacted by the increased total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT) and the average rainfall intensity (SDII) in the flood season, the mean annual FRI significantly declined by 6.3%–33.8% among the studied watersheds during 2000–2014 compared to those from 1980 to 1999. Positively impacted by the vegetation restoration after the GGP was implemented in 1999, the mean annual FRI increased 8.6% in the regions above Lanzhou station and 1.6%−5.5% in the five tributaries during 2000–2014. Our results suggest that the negative influences of the FRI from extreme precipitation should be considered under climate change, while improving the flood regulation ecosystem services through implementing vegetation restoration programmes can enhance flood risk management in other river basins. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; CLM-GBHM; Ecosystem services; Flood; Vegetation","Ecosystems; Flood control; Floods; Land use; Precipitation (meteorology); Reservoirs (water); Restoration; Risk management; Vegetation; Watersheds; Climate; CLM-GBHM; Community land models; Ecological restoration; Ecosystem services; Flood risk management; Hydrological modeling; Vegetation restoration; Climate change; climate change; dam construction; ecosystem service; flood; flood control; headwater; index method; leaf area index; peak flow; precipitation (climatology); precipitation intensity; reservoir; vegetation type; watershed; China; Yellow River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070675009

Thus, we studied the effects of four fertilization treatments [chemical fertilizer (NP), manure (M), 50% M plus 50% NP (NPM), and unfertilized control (CK)] and three straw return methods [no straw return (no straw), return of straw mixed with soil (straw mixing), and return of straw to the surface of the soil (straw mulching)] in a mine reclamation region by examining changes in the soil C pool and CO2 emission. The soil C pool was evaluated by acid hydrolysis, considering three pools: (a) labile pool I (LP I), obtained by hydrolysis with 5 N H2SO4 at 105 °C for 30 min; (b) labile pool II (LP II), obtained by hydrolysis with 26 N H2SO4 at room temperature overnight, followed by 2 N H2SO4 at 105 °C for 3 h; and (c) the recalcitrant pool, measured as the unhydrolyzed residue. The CO2 emission/C sequestration and CO2 emission/grain yield ratios were used as indicators of C emission. Compared with the CK, the NPM treatment was the most efficient among the fertilization treatments in increasing grain yield (136%) and C sequestration (311%) and reducing the CO2 emission/C sequestration (62%) and CO2 emission/grain yield (32%) ratios. The straw mixing treatment had more soil organic carbon (SOC), a larger LP I and LP II, and more C sequestration than the other straw return treatments. The addition of manure resulted in a higher distribution rate of new organic C to the labile C pool (73–78%) than the addition of inorganic fertilizer (45%). Soil C emissions were mainly concentrated in the maize growing season, accounting for more than 80% of the total annual C emissions. LP I, LP II and CO2 emission were significantly positive correlated with SOC and yield. Therefore, soil C pools and CO2 emissions are significantly influenced by fertilization regimes and straw return methods, which should be used to important indicators to estimate the C balance in agro-ecosystems during the process of mine spoil reclamation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Reclaimed mine spoil; Restoration measures; Shanxi Province; Soil CO2 emission; Soil organic C pool","Fertilizers; Hydrolysis; Lakes; Land reclamation; Manures; Mixing; Organic carbon; Reclamation; Soils; CO2 emissions; Mine spoil; Restoration measures; Shanxi Province; Soil organic C; Carbon dioxide; agricultural management; ammonium; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; dredge spoil; fertilizer application; growing season; hydrolysis; maize; management practice; reclaimed land; straw; China; Shanxi; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070644802

In this study, nano-prism assembled hierarchical CuO microspheres (Prism-CuO) were designed and used for CO2 electroreduction. The Prism-CuO coated gas diffusion electrode showed high activity for CO2-to-formate conversion with overpotential as low as ∼200 mV, and achieved maximum faradaic efficiency of 65.1% at −1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Moreover, it maintained the stable performance for continuous 20 h of electrolysis. The better performance was mainly attributed to the unique prism feature as it provided abundant corner- and edge-based low-coordinated active reaction sites. These sites could further arouse strong local-electric field to lower the barrier of CO2 adsorption and motivate CO2 activation by accelerating charges transfer process. The result implied designing the nano-prism constructed hierarchical framework would be an efficient strategy to develop the advanced electrocatalyst for efficient CO2 reduction in aqueous solution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 electroreduction; CuO catalyst; Electric field intensity; Formate production; Nano-prism structure","Coordination reactions; Copper oxides; Diffusion in gases; Electric fields; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Greenhouse effect; Microspheres; Prisms; CuO catalyst; Electric field intensities; Electro reduction; Electrochemical reductions; Faradaic efficiencies; Gas diffusion electrodes; Local electric field; Prism structure; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; formic acid; microsphere; silver; silver chloride; carbon dioxide; copper; cupric oxide; formic acid; formic acid derivative; carbon dioxide; catalyst; electric field; electrochemical method; nanoparticle; nanotechnology; reduction; acceleration; adsorption; aqueous solution; Article; catalyst; controlled study; electric field; electrochemical analysis; electrolysis; energy conversion; gas diffusion; catalysis; chemistry; diffusion; electrochemical analysis; electrode; oxidation reduction reaction; Adsorption; Carbon Dioxide; Catalysis; Copper; Diffusion; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Formates; Microspheres; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070371559

C. imicola is also known to transmit Schmallenberg virus experimentally. Environmental and demographic factors may impose rapid changes on the global distribution of C. imicola and aid introduction into new areas. The aim of this study is to predict the global distribution of C. imicola using an ensemble modeling approach by combining climatic, livestock distribution and land cover covariates, together with a comprehensive global dataset of geo-positioned occurrence points for C. imicola. Thirty individual models were generated by ‘biomod2’, with 21 models scoring a true skill statistic (TSS) >0.8. These 21 models incorporated weighted runs from eight of ten algorithms and were used to create a final ensemble model. The ensemble model performed very well (TSS = 0.898 and ROC = 0.991) and indicated high environmental suitability for C. imicola in the tropics and subtropics. The habitat suitability for C. imicola spans from South Africa to southern Europe and from southern USA to southern China. The distribution of C. imicola is mainly constrained by climatic factors. In the ensemble model, mean annual minimum temperature had the highest overall contribution (42.9%), followed by mean annual maximum temperature (21.1%), solar radiation (13.6%), annual precipitation (11%), livestock distribution (6.2%), vapor pressure (3.4%), wind speed (0.8%), and land cover (0.1%). The present study provides the most up-to-date predictive maps of the potential distributions of C. imicola and should be of great value for decision making at global and regional scales. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"African horse sickness; animal; bluetongue; Bluetongue orbivirus; China; climate; Culicomorpha; ecosystem; Europe; genetics; horse; insect vector; livestock; pathogenicity; sheep; South Africa; temperature; virology; virus infection; African Horse Sickness; Animals; Bluetongue; Bluetongue virus; China; Climate; Culicomorpha; Ecosystem; Europe; Horses; Insect Vectors; Livestock; Sheep; South Africa; Temperature; Virus Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072926613

The main effects of climate change on oceans are warming of the ocean water, melting of ice, acidification of ocean water, and change in the ocean currents. The main effects of climate change on coastal regions are change in the coast hydrodynamics, sea level rise, change in wave height, coastal erosion, coastal structure damage, food shortage, and storms. Due to the importance of waves in the coastal zone and its effect on erosion and sedimentation, it is necessary to study wave changes. In this study, the effect of climate change on wave specifications was evaluated in the southern coast of the Caspian Sea in Noshahr Port. To simulate wave parameters, the third generation spectral Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model was used. Wave modeling was carried out using the SWAN numerical model for two 30-yearly periods, including the control period (1984 to 2014) and the future period (2051 to 2080). For wave modeling in the control period, the European Center for Average Weather Forecast wind field was used, and for the future period, a downscaled wind field from Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment projection, which was sponsored by World Climate Research Programme, based on the most recent emission scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, was used. The model results were calibrated and verified with buoy-recorded data. The effect of the climate change on the wave parameters was evaluated by studying the differences between the patterns in three scenarios and the control period. Results showed that the 30-year maximum significant wave height will increase because of climate change, and the wave direction will not change. In addition, the intensity of storms will increase in the future. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Caspian Sea; climate change; CORDEX; Noshahr Port; numerical modeling; SWAN model","Climate models; Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Erosion; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Numerical models; Ocean currents; Sea level; Storms; Water waves; Weather forecasting; Caspian sea; Climate change impact; CORDEX; Erosion and sedimentation; Noshahr Port; Significant wave height; SWAN model; SWAN numerical models; Climate change; buoy system; climate change; coastal structure; hydrological regime; ocean acidification; oceanic current; significant wave height; storm surge; wave action; wave direction; wave modeling; Caspian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074769299

Despite a plethora of scientific evidence to support its existence, some are still skeptical. Although individuals debate whether climate change is real, vulnerable populations are bearing the brunt of the impact as glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes has broken up, plant and animal ranges have shifted, and trees are flowering sooner. As temperatures continue to rise, precipitation patterns change, droughts and heat waves become even more common, hurricanes become more intense, sea levels keep rising, and the Arctic becomes ice-free, poor people and people of color are losing their lives and/or their livelihoods. A number of policies have mandated that countries slow down the climate change process. The United Nations and the profession of social work have made recommendations and set goals related to climate change. However, it seems as if climate change is just a chess piece to be used in the political arena. This article presents an overview of policies related to climate change and examines the response, both domestically and internationally, by organizations and the social work profession. It appears that U.S. social workers are lagging behind the rest of the world with respect to training and preparedness for addressing climate change and its effect even though social workers are uniquely situated to address this issue given the profession's emphasis on advocacy, social justice, and community organizing.

The results showed that PAC remained efficient for membrane fouling control after long-term operation (over 140 d), and it reduced the fouling rate at a hydraulic retention time of 8 h from 3.12 to 0.89 kPa/d. PAC mainly mitigated the membrane fouling by restraining the formation of a cake layer while generating a gel layer on the membrane surface, which was attributed to the PAC-induced microbial community change in mixed liquor and the membrane surface. Microbial community analysis indicated the genera Pseudomonas (26.5%) and Methanothrix (79.21%) were the predominant bacteria and archaea, respectively, in the gel layer, and this result is completely different from the presence of a high abundance of Levilinea (7.1%), Aminivibrio (4.9%) and Methanothrix (90.04%) in the cake layer on the membrane surface without PAC. The significant difference in the predominant microbes in the membrane surface layer was attributed to the reduced enrichment of Levilinea and Methanothrix with PAC addition. © 2019","Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Cake layer; Gel fouling; Membrane fouling; Powdered activated carbon","Activated carbon; Bacteria; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Membrane fouling; Sewage; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Cake layer; Hydraulic retention time; Microbial communities; Microbial community analysis; Powdered activated carbon; Predominant bacteria; Submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactors; Membranes; activated carbon; biopolymer; charcoal; activated carbon; anoxic conditions; bioreactor; fouling; gel; membrane; microbial community; nutrient enrichment; surface layer; Article; biofouling; chemical oxygen demand; fouling control; hydraulic retention time; Levilinea; membrane resistance; Methanosaeta; microbial community; microorganism; molecular weight; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; Pseudomonas; anaerobic growth; artificial membrane; bioreactor; powder; sewage; Methanosaeta; Pseudomonas; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Charcoal; Membranes, Artificial; Powders; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072725273

These contacts were formed by depositing the PTL/n-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline layer (nc-Si:H(n))/c-Si(n) stacks. The results indicated that a higher CO2 plasma treatment pressure was preferred for the formation of oxygen-richer components in the silicon oxide films, with Si2+, Si3+, and Si4+ peaks, and a smoother PTL/c-Si heterointerface. The PTLs with higher oxidation states and lower surface roughness exhibited advantages for the c-Si surface passivation, with a maximum implied open-circuit voltage of approximately 743 mV. The lowest contact resistivity of approximately 60 mω cm2 was obtained using nc-Si:H(n)/PTL/c-Si(n) as the passivated tunneling contact. Most importantly, the in situ process can help prevent the contamination of the heterointerface during device fabrication processes.

Among the cofeeds employed, only C-2 substituted bicyclic aromatic species (i.e., 2-methynaphthalene, 2-ethylnaphthalene, and 2-isopropylnaphthalene) were found to have beneficial effects on the selective formation of propene. The overall experimental results of this study led us to propose a bicyclic aromatic-based mechanism of the zeolite-catalyzed ETP reaction where naphthalene, C-2 substituted bicyclic aromatics, and 2-isopropyl-7-methynaphthalene serve as hydrocarbon pool species. The theoretical results demonstrate that the Gibbs free energy barriers of the transition states for the ethylation of key bicyclic hydrocarbon pool species (naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, and 2-ethylnaphthalene) are significantly lower compared with the transition states for the same elementary step of the corresponding monocyclic ones (benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene). Intuitively, this can be understood given that the transition state for the ethylation of each of the former aromatic species has a larger number (5 vs 3) of resonance structures than that of each of the latter ones and is thus thermodynamically more stable.

Analyses based on comparison among the modeling results from these scenarios reveal the sectors that should be targeted by air pollution mitigation policy. The results reveal that in Southeast Asia, sulfate could be decreased by 25% if coal were to be replaced by natural gas in the power generation and industry sectors. Black carbon concentration would reduce 42% overall if biofuel were replaced by natural gas in the residential sector.

During the period between 27 February and 7 March in 2019 when high PM2.5 concentrations occurred, the PM2.5 concentration in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) in South Korea was approximately 87.3 μg/m3 on average, and a severe PM2.5 concentration level of approximately 113.4 μg/m3 was observed between 3 March and 5 March. The results of the analysis conducted using the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model and meteorological observation data showed that northwesterly wind or westerly winds were formed during the P1 and P3 periods when the PM2.5 concentration markedly increased. When the PM2.5 concentrations in East Asia were simulated using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), it was found that the high PM2.5 concentrations that occurred in the SMA of South Korea were mostly affected by PM2.5 transported over long distances and following atmospheric stagnation.

Knowledge about the trade-offs between these ES is of great importance for grassland management. Yet, the outcome of different management strategies on ES provision is highly uncertain due to spatial variability. We aim to characterize the provision (level and spatial variability) of grassland ES under various management strategies. To do so, we combine empirical data for multiple ES with spatially explicit census data on land use intensities. We analyzed the variations of five ES (forage provision, climate regulation, pollination, biodiversity conservation and outdoor recreation) using data from biodiversity fieldwork, experimental plots for carbon as well as social network data from Flickr. These data were used to calculate the distribution of modelled individual and multiple ES values from different grassland management types in a Swiss case study region using spatial explicit information for 17,383 grassland parcels. Our results show that (1) management regime and intensity levels play an important role in ES provision but their impact depends on the ES. In general, extensive management, especially in pastures, favors all ES but forage provision, whereas intensive management favors only forage provision and outdoor recreation; (2) ES potential provision varies between parcels under the same management due to the influence of environmental drivers, related to topography and landscape structure; (3) there is a trade-offs between forage provision and other ES at the cantonal level but a synergy between forage provision and biodiversity conservation within the grassland categories, due to the negative impact of elevation on both ES. Information about multiple ES provision is key to support effective agri-environmental measures and information about the spatial variability can prevent uncertain outputs of decision-making processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","ES provision; Land use; Management strategies; Modelling; Switzerland; Trade-offs","assessment method; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; decision making; ecosystem service; forage; grassland; land use change; management practice; service provision; spatial variation; trade-off; Article; climate; conservation biology; environmental management; forage; grassland; landscape; pasture; pollination; agriculture; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; Switzerland; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Grassland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072570132

BC related to oil combustion sources increased significantly since the 1990s. AHs were associated with petroleum inputs and revealed a high level of contamination. Multivariate statistical methods (a Principal Component Analysis associated with a linear multiple regression – PCA/LMR) applied to PAHs suggests changes in the sources in recent years. This can be ascribed to a reduction in pyrogenic emissions over the last four decades and to an increase in petrogenic inputs since the 1990s. The sterol dinosterol registered the increased eutrophication over the last three decades, but the sewage marker coprostanol was present at relatively low concentrations (0.40 to 1.16 μg g−1) probably caused by enhanced bacterial activity in the sediment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Guanabara Bay; Hydrocarbons; Sediment core; Sewage; Urban region","Alcohols; Eutrophication; Hydrocarbons; Multivariant analysis; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Sediments; Sewage; Bacterial activity; Guanabara Bay; Linear multiple regression; Multivariate statistical method; Pyrogenic emissions; Sediment core; Sedimentary records; Urban regions; Aliphatic hydrocarbons; aliphatic hydrocarbon; aromatic hydrocarbon; black carbon; coprosterol; dinosterol; hydrocarbon; petroleum; sterol; unclassified drug; hydrocarbon; petroleum; sterol; concentration (composition); environmental impact; hydrocarbon; principal component analysis; sediment core; sediment pollution; sewage; urban area; air and air related phenomena; Article; bacterial metabolism; Botafogo Cove; combustion; concentration (parameter); contamination; controlled study; environmental impact; eutrophication; geographic and geological phenomena; nonhuman; petrogenic emission; population density; pyrogenic emission; Rio de Janeiro (state); sediment; sediment core; sewage; urbanization; bay; Brazil; chemistry; city; environmental monitoring; sediment; sewage; water pollutant; Brazil; Guanabara Bay; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bays; Brazil; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Sewage; Sterols; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071717498

Here we report on photoelectron spectra of the C2− anion, measured at a range of wavelengths using a high-resolution photoelectron imaging spectrometer, which reveal both the ground X1Σg+ and first-excited a3Π u electronic states. These measurements yield electron angular anisotropies that identify the character of two orbitals: the diffuse detachment orbital of the anion and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the neutral. This work indicates that electron detachment occurs from predominantly s-like (3 σg) and p-like (1 πu) orbitals, respectively, which is inconsistent with the predictions required for the high bond-order models of strongly sp-mixed orbitals. This result suggests that the dominant contribution to the dicarbon bonding involves a double-bonded configuration, with 2π bonds and no accompanying σ bond. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"chemical bonding; electron; imaging method; wavelength; anisotropy; Article; chemical bond; computer model; conformational transition; image analysis; mathematical model; normal distribution; photoelectron spectroscopy; polarization; static electricity; time of flight mass spectrometry; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075114748

In this paper, we introduce model developments included in CLM version 5 (CLM5), which is the default land component for CESM2. We assess an ensemble of simulations, including prescribed and prognostic vegetation state, multiple forcing data sets, and CLM4, CLM4.5, and CLM5, against a range of metrics including from the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMBv2) package. CLM5 includes new and updated processes and parameterizations: (1) dynamic land units, (2) updated parameterizations and structure for hydrology and snow (spatially explicit soil depth, dry surface layer, revised groundwater scheme, revised canopy interception and canopy snow processes, updated fresh snow density, simple firn model, and Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport), (3) plant hydraulics and hydraulic redistribution, (4) revised nitrogen cycling (flexible leaf stoichiometry, leaf N optimization for photosynthesis, and carbon costs for plant nitrogen uptake), (5) global crop model with six crop types and time-evolving irrigated areas and fertilization rates, (6) updated urban building energy, (7) carbon isotopes, and (8) updated stomatal physiology. New optional features include demographically structured dynamic vegetation model (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere. Conclusive establishment of improvement or degradation of individual variables or metrics is challenged by forcing uncertainty, parametric uncertainty, and model structural complexity, but the multivariate metrics presented here suggest a general broad improvement from CLM4 to CLM5. ©2019.

After each time, the eyes were enucleated and the corneas were isolated for biochemical analysis. UA-group corneas exhibited a continuous increase in NADPH oxidase-4 levels throughout the exposure time, suggesting an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). After 1 week, an early adaptive response to ROS was observed as an increase in antioxidant enzymes. After 4 weeks, the enzymatic antioxidants were decreased, meanwhile an increase of the glutathione was shown, as a later compensatory antioxidant response. However, redox imbalance took place, evidenced by the increased oxidized proteins, which persisted up to 12 weeks. At this time point, corneal epithelium hyperplasia was also observed. The inflammatory response was modulated by the increase in IL-10 levels after 1 week, which early regulates the release of TNF-α and IL-6. These results suggest that air pollution alters the ocular surface, supported by the observed cellular hyperplasia.

This is an ambitious goal that will require substantial decreases in emission rates of long-lived greenhouse gasses (GHG). This work provides a mathematical framework, based on current state of the art climate models, to calculate the GHG emissions consistent with prescribed GMST pathways that meet the Paris agreement goal. The unique capability of this framework, to start from a GMST timeseries and efficiently calculate the emissions required to meet that temperature pathway, makes it a powerful resource for policymakers. Our results indicate that aerosol emissions play a large role in determining the near-term allowable greenhouse gas emissions that will limit future warming to 2 °C, however in the long term, drastic GHG emissions reductions are required under any reasonable aerosol scenario. With large future aerosol emissions, similar to present day amounts, GHG emissions need to be reduced 8% by 2040 and 74% by 2100 to limit warming to 2 °C. Under a more likely low aerosol scenario, GHG emissions need to be reduced 36% and 80% by 2040 and 2100, respectively.

Besides negative changes in biodiversity, ecosystem water, and carbon budgets, converting forests to plantations often reduced CH4 uptake by soils. The latter process, which might be partly responsible for resumed increase in the growth rate of CH4 atmospheric concentrations since 2006, has not been adequately investigated. We measured soil surface CH4 fluxes during 2014 and 2015 in natural forests and rubber plantations of different age and soil textures in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China—a representative area for this type of land-use change. Natural forest soils were stronger CH4 sinks than rubber soils, with annual CH4 fluxes of −2.41 ± 0.28 and −1.01 ± 0.23 kg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Water-filled pore space was the main factor explaining the differences between natural forests and rubber plantations, even reverting rubber soils temporarily from CH4 sink into a methane source during the rainy season in older plantations. Soil nitrate content was often lower under rubber plantations. Added as a model covariate, this factor improved explanation power of the CH4 flux—water-filled pore space regression. Although soils under rubber plantation were more clayey than soils under natural forest, this was not the decisive factor driving higher soil moisture and lower CH4 uptake in rubber soils. Thus, the conversion of forests into rubber plantations exerts a negative impact on the CH4 balance in the tropics and likely contributes to global climate. © 2019 The Authors.

However, previous LCAs of CLT are static analyses without considering the complex interactions between the CLT manufacturing and forest systems, which are dynamic and largely affected by the variations in forest management, CLT manufacturing, and end-of-life options. This study fills this gap by developing a dynamic life-cycle modeling framework for a cradle-to-grave CLT manufacturing system across 100 years in the Southeastern United States. The framework integrates process-based simulations of CLT manufacturing and forest growth as well as Monte Carlo simulation to address uncertainty. On a 1-ha forest land basis, the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions range from -954 to -1445 metric tonne CO2 eq. for a high forest productivity scenario compared to -609 to -919 metric tonne CO2 eq. for a low forest productivity scenario. All scenarios showed significant GHG emissions from forest residues decay, demonstrating the strong needs to consider forest management and their dynamic impacts in LCAs of CLT or other durable wood products (DWP). The results show that using mill residues for energy recovery has lower fossil-based GHG (59%-61% reduction) than selling residues for producing DWP, but increases the net GHG emissions due to the instantaneous release of biogenic carbon in residues. In addition, the results were converted to a 1 m3 basis with a cradle-to-gate system boundary to be compared with literature. The results, 113-375 kg CO2 eq. m-3 across all scenarios for fossil-based GHG emissions, were consistent with previous studies. Those findings highlight the needs of system-level management to maximize the potential benefits of CLT. This work is an attributional LCA, but the presented results lay a foundation for future consequential LCAs for specific CLT buildings or commercial forest management systems. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this study, we combine meteorological data from 18 local stations, field surveys on agricultural practices and agronomic information on the growth of millet to demonstrate the crop suitability to the present climate and the ability of Senegalese farmers to adapt their practices to climate variability, and to disseminate them. From data collected in both 665 villages and 1061 farmers, our study provides quantitative evidence of the responsive adaptation of farmers in the Sahel where the recent resumption of rainfall has provided new agricultural opportunities. Statistical models and cropping simulations show that these farmers innovate by reintroducing and disseminating a long cycle millet cultivar—more suitable for wet environments. We note that although this adaptation is a clear response to recent changes in quantity and distribution of rainfall, its adoption remains limited (50% of the villages visited and 25% of the surveyed agricultural producers have cultivated the new millet variety) and varies strongly within the same climatic context and by characteristics of farmers (willing and capacity), indicating different agricultural strategies (diversification, market exchanges). If land access and development of cash crops are hindrances to the adoption of sanio, poverty is clearly not a barrier and adaptation is not a lever for wealth creation. Such adaptative capacities, together with government incentives for farmers to sustainably adapt to climate change, can be important in reducing climate risks in the coming years. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069684633

Populations are under selection to respond to climatic changes with respect to phenology of the annual cycle (e.g. breeding, migration) and life-history. As teleconnections can reflect climate on a global scale, the responses of terrestrial animals are often investigated in relation to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation. However, investigation of other teleconnections and local climate is often neglected. In this study, we examined over a 33-year period the relationships between four teleconnections (El Niño-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, East Atlantic Pattern), local weather parameters (temperature and precipitation) and reproduction in great tits Parus major and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus in the Carpathian Basin, Hungary. Furthermore, we explored how annual variations in the timing of food availability were correlated with breeding performance. In both species, annual laying date was negatively associated with the Arctic Oscillation. The date of peak abundance of caterpillars was negatively associated with local temperatures in December–January, while laying date was negatively related to January–March temperature. We found that date of peak abundance of caterpillars and laying date of great tits advanced, while in blue tits clutch size decreased over the decades but laying date did not advance. The results suggest that weather conditions during the months that preceded the breeding season, as well as temporally more distant winter conditions, were connected to breeding date. Our results highlight that phenological synchronization to food availability was different between the two tit species, namely it was disrupted in blue tits only. Additionally, the results suggest that in order to find the climatic drivers of the phenological changes of organisms, we should analyze a broader range of global meteorological parameters. © 2019 The Authors.

The purpose of these scenarios is to inform land use planning toward the protection of ecosystems and derivable ecosystem services in Northwestern Virginia. We held two scenario development workshops with regional experts in conservation, agriculture, land use planning, policy, and economic development to create scenarios of land use in the northern Piedmont and northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. We structured the workshops around a framework that guided stakeholders through several steps eventually resulting in four unique scenarios describing the region in 50 years. Scenario narratives were defined by the intersection of highly influential and uncertain drivers of change relevant to land use planning and ecosystem services. Participants from the northern Shenandoah Valley region selected population growth and climate change adaptation as their scenario defining drivers, while participants from the northern Piedmont region selected planning strategy and climate change impact as their scenario defining drivers. Participants fleshed out scenarios into descriptive narratives that incorporated qualitative and quantitative measures of change. Details from the scenario narratives informed land use change models to further quantify tradeoffs between land use planning decisions and ecosystem services. Individuals interested in using scenario planning to guide research efforts, conservation, or land use planning, or even to broaden perspectives on how to view the future, will find value in this case study. © 2019 by the Regents of the University of California.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074637503

Selectivity is often critical for the practical realization of reactions such as the electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). Previously developed strategies to manipulate the structure and geometry of catalysts for electroreduction of CO2 involve complex processes or fail to efficiently alter the selectivity. Here, using a prestrained polymer, we uniaxially and biaxially compress a 60 nm gold film to form a nano-folded electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. We observe two kinds of folds and can tune the ratio of loose to tight folds by varying the extent of prestrain in the polymer. We characterize the nano-folded catalysts using X-ray diffraction, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. We observe grain reorientation and coarsening in the nano-folded gold catalysts. We measure an enhancement of Faradaic efficiency for carbon monoxide formation with the biaxially compressed nano-folded catalyst by a factor of about nine as compared to the flat catalyst (up to 87.4%). We rationalize this observation by noting that an increase of the local pH in the tight folds of the catalyst outweighs the effects of alterations in grain characteristics. Together, our studies demonstrate that nano-folded geometries can significantly alter grain characteristics, mass transport, and catalytic performance. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Catalysis; electrochemistry; internal diffusion; nanomechanics; self-assembly","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalysis; Catalyst selectivity; Coarsening; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemistry; Electrolytic reduction; Geometry; Gold; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Nanomechanics; Scanning electron microscopy; Self assembly; Carbon monoxide formations; Catalytic performance; Complex Processes; Electroreduction of CO2; Faradaic efficiencies; Grain characteristics; Grain reorientation; Internal diffusion; Nanocatalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075623200

The X-ray phase analysis and the scanning electron microscopy analysis are conducted. It is established that using carbon black or hybrid carbon as an additive to the material of the negative electrode influences its structure causing changes in the processes of its impregnation and formation. Based on the structural analysis, a qualitative description, according to which hybrid carbon increases the dispersity of the negative active mass and impedes the diffusion of sulfate-ions, is proposed. The standard tests were conducted by intensive cycling in the partial state of charge lead–acid starter batteries in the charge–discharge mode. The batteries were manufactured using negative plates with additives of technical or hybrid carbon. The influence of each type of carbon additive on the electrical characteristics of the starter batteries is determined. It is shown that the additive of hybrid carbon increases the service life of starter batteries under operation in the partial state of the charge. This additive increases the charge acceptance on average by 9% and the deep discharge stability of the battery. The capacity loss after deep discharge is less than 4.4% if hybrid carbon is used as an additive and 7.2% in the case of carbon black. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","active mass; carbon black; cycling mode; electrode materials; hybrid carbon; lead-acid battery","Carbon black; Charging (batteries); Electric discharges; Electrodes; Hybrid materials; Lead acid batteries; Scanning electron microscopy; Starters; Sulfur compounds; Accumulator battery; Active mass; Cycling modes; Discharge stability; Electrical characteristic; Electrical performance; Electrode material; X-ray phase analysis; Additives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081542536

Rapid urbanization and the ever-growing need for housing have turned large areas of many cities into concrete landscapes that lack greenery. Green infrastructure can support human health, provide socio-economic and environmental benefits, and bring color to an otherwise grey urban landscape. Sometimes, benefits come with downsides in relation to its impact on air quality and human health, requiring suitable data and guidelines to implement effective greening strategies. Air pollution and human health, as well as green infrastructure and human health, are often studied together. Linking green infrastructure with air quality and human health together is a unique aspect of this article. A holistic understanding of these links is key to enabling policymakers and urban planners to make informed decisions. By critically evaluating the link between green infrastructure and human health via air pollution mitigation, we also discuss if our existing understanding of such interventions is sufficient to inform their uptake in practice. Natural science and epidemiology approach the topic of green infrastructure and human health very differently. The pathways linking health benefits to pollution reduction by urban vegetation remain unclear and the mode of green infrastructure deployment is critical to avoid unintended consequences. Strategic deployment of green infrastructure may reduce downwind pollution exposure. However, the development of bespoke design guidelines is vital to promote and optimize greening benefits, and measuring green infrastructure's socio-economic and health benefits are key for their uptake. Greening cities to mitigate pollution effects is on the rise and these need to be matched by scientific evidence and appropriate guidelines. We conclude that urban vegetation can facilitate broad health benefits, but there is little empirical evidence linking these benefits to air pollution reduction by urban vegetation, and appreciable efforts are needed to establish the underlying policies, design and engineering guidelines governing its deployment. © 2019 The Authors","City greening; Environmental health; Passive control; Physical and mental health; Pollution exposure","Air quality; Economic and social effects; Health; Vegetation; City greening; Engineering guidelines; Environmental health; Green infrastructure; Mental health; Passive control; Pollution mitigation; Unintended consequences; Pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental policy; environmental protection; health impact; health risk; mental health; pollution exposure; air pollution; air quality; city; environmental health; housing; human; mental health; natural science; review; urbanization; vegetation; health; Air Pollution; Health; Humans; Urbanization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074083234

The potential for detecting plumes was studied for satellite images of CO2 alone or in combination with images of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) to investigate the added value of measurements of other gases coemitted with CO2 that have better signal-to-noise ratios. The additional NO2 and CO images were either generated for instruments on the same CO2M satellites (2 km×2 km resolution) or for the Sentinel-5 instrument (7.5 km×7.5 km) assumed to fly 2 h earlier than CO2M. Realistic CO2, CO and NOX.D NOCNO2/ fields were simulated at 1 km×1 km horizontal resolution with the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling model extended with a module for the simulation of greenhouse gases (COSMO-GHG) for the year 2015, and they were used as input for an orbit simulator to generate synthetic observations of columns of CO2, CO and NO2 for constellations of up to six satellites. A simple plume detection algorithm was applied to detect coherent structures in the images of CO2, NO2 or CO against instrument noise and variability in background levels. Although six satellites with an assumed swath of 250 km were sufficient to overpass Berlin on a daily basis, only about 50 out of 365 plumes per year could be observed in conditions suitable for emission estimation due to frequent cloud cover. With the CO2 instrument only 6 and 16 of these 50 plumes could be detected assuming a high-noise (σVEG50 = 1.0 ppm) and low-noise (σVEG50 = 0.5 ppm) scenario, respectively, because the CO2 signals were often too weak. A CO instrument with specifications similar to the Sentinel-5 mission performed worse than the CO2 instrument, while the number of detectable plumes could be significantly increased to about 35 plumes with an NO2 instrument. CO2 and NO2 plumes were found to overlap to a large extent, although NOX had a limited lifetime (assumed to be 4 h) and although CO2 and NOX were emitted with different NOX V CO2 emission ratios by different source types with different temporal and vertical emission profiles. Using NO2 observations from the Sentinel-5 platform instead resulted in a significant spatial mismatch between NO2 and CO2 plumes due to the 2 h time difference between Sentinel-5 and CO2M. The plumes of the coalfired power plant J nschwalde were easier to detect with the CO2 instrument (about 40-45 plumes per year), but, again, an NO2 instrument could detect significantly more plumes (about 70). Auxiliary measurements of NO2 were thus found to greatly enhance the capability of detecting the location of CO2 plumes, which will be invaluable for the quantification of CO2 emissions from large point sources. © 2019 Royal Society of Chemistry.

In this work, we develop and test a quantitative ammonia retrieval algorithm using data from the airborne hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer (HyTES) instrument over diverse targets, including persistent ammonia sources, such as cattle feedlots and a power plant, as well as a small, smoldering wildfire. Although no formal validation was possible due to lack of collocated observations, the HyTES ammonia values over feedlots in the California San Joaquin Valley are shown to be consistent within the estimated retrieval uncertainty of \sim20%-50% with in situ ammonia values collected over the same facilities during the 2013 DISCOVER-AQ field campaign. HyTES also observed meter-scale thermal hot spots associated with a small wildfire in Northern Arizona, which was determined to coincide with the emission of free ammonia, presumed to originate from the fire. This very localized emission source, not visible from satellite sensors, could be resolved in HyTES imagery. The ammonia enhancement immediately downwind from the smoldering fire, before the free ammonia reacted to form aerosols, was found to be distinguishable from the background with values three to ten times smaller than ammonia enhancements from the power plant and cattle feedlots, respectively. High-resolution detection and quantification of ammonia over nonpersistent sources like wildfires from HyTES shows that it is a powerful tool that can be used to improve regional scale fire emission inventories by accounting for the presence of temporally short ammonia processes. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Ammonia; hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer (HyTES); smoldering fires","Fires; Infrared radiation; Power plants; Satellite imagery; Spectrometers; Uncertainty analysis; Airborne instruments; Atmospheric ammonia; High resolution detection; High spatial resolution; Retrieval algorithms; Retrieval uncertainty; Smoldering fires; Thermal emission spectrometers; Ammonia; airborne sensing; ammonia; infrared imagery; numerical model; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; California; San Joaquin Valley; United States; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079325548

The thermodynamic probability assessment of 16 reactions between them under standard conditions, as well as for certain reactions under different standard conditions, was carried out using tabulated thermodynamic data of reactants in the temperature range of 1500–3500 K. The following were considered as standard states for reactants: Cr(ref) (reference state, melting point 2130 K, boiling point 2952 K), Cr(liq), Cr(gas), Cr2O3(cr, liq), Cr2O3(gas), C(ref), and as possible reaction products and standard states for them CO(gas), CO2(gas), Cr23C6(сr), Cr7C3(cr), Cr3C2(cr). The reaction probability was estimated using standard Gibbs energy and was calculated using the Van Goff isotherm equation. The chromium dissolution in metal of surfacing bath or probable partial pressures of CO and CO2 in gas phase was considered and then calculated from the equilibrium of carbon gasification reaction. The carbon presence in flux-cored wire with chromium oxide Cr2O3 as a reducing agent will necessarily lead to the occurrence of reduction reactions with chromium carbide generation, and possibly chromium itself. The generation of Cr7C3(сr) carbide is likely. With a longer life span of chromium oxide and carbon at a temperature above 2500 K, chromium generation as a component of the surfacing bath is more thermodynamically probable than carbide generation. Chromium oxide has the highest reactivity in Cr2O3(liq) state. Direct reduction is preferential. The generation of CO(gas) as a carbon oxidation product is more probable. The chromium dissolution in metal increases the thermodynamic reaction probability with its generation, as well as further reduces the reaction probability in which chromium is the starting material. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.","analysis; arc surfacing; carbon; chromium; chromium carbides; chromium oxide; cored wire; Gibbs energy of reaction; reduction","Carbides; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Gases; Probability; Reduction; Thermodynamics; Carbon gasification; Isotherm equations; Probability assessments; Reaction probability; Reduction reaction; Standard conditions; Standard Gibbs energy; Thermodynamic aspects; Chromium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083220007

The achievement of this agenda crucially depends on whether humankind will be able to maximize synergies and resolve existing trade-offs between the SDGs. We provide the first analysis of future interactions for projected SDG trends until 2030 within and between goals, and we analyze how trade-offs and synergies have evolved in the recent past globally. For certain goals, we find positive developments with notable synergies in our projections, especially for SDGs 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9: Poverty alleviation and strengthening the economy, rooted in innovation, and modern infrastructure, therefore continue to be the basis upon which many of the other SDGs can be achieved. However, especially SDGs 11, 13, 14, 16, and 17 will continue to have notable trade-offs, as well as non-associations with the other goals in the future, which emphasizes the need to foster innovations and policies that can make our cities and communities more sustainable, as well as strengthen institutions and spur climate action. We show examples of a successful transformation of trade-offs into synergies that should be emulated in other areas to create a virtuous cycle of SDG progress. The alarming inability to overcome certain persistent trade-offs we have found, and indeed the deterioration for some SDGs, can seriously threaten the achievement of the Agenda 2030. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075188609

This approach is tested for general application in cold marine regions (freezing to 5 °C). We used amplicon sequencing and qPCR to quantify 16S rRNA and GyrB genes from oleophilic bacteria in seawater samples from two different crude oil enrichments. The first experiment was conducted in a controlled environment using laboratory conditions and natural North Sea fjord seawater (NSC) at a constant temperature of 5 °C. The second was performed in the field with natural Arctic seawater (ARC) and outdoor temperature conditions from −7 °C to around 4 °C. Although the experimental conditions for NSC and ARC differed, the temporal changes in bacterial communities were comparable and reflected oil biotransformation processes. The common bacterial OTUs for NSC and ARC had the highest identity to Colwellia rossensis and Oleispira antarctica rRNA sequences and were enriched within a few days in both conditions. Other typical oil degrading bacteria such as Alcanivorax (n-alkane degrader) and Cycloclasticus (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degrader) were rapidly enriched only in NSC conditions. Both the strong correlation between Oleispira SSU gene copies and oil concentration, and the specificity of the Oleispira assay suggest that this organism is a robust bioindicator for seawater contaminated by petroleum in cold water environments. Further optimization for automation of the Oleispira assay for in situ analysis with a genosensing device is underway. The assay for Colwellia quantification requires more specificity to fewer Colwellia OTUs and a well-established dose-response relationship before those taxa are used for oil tracking purposes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomonitoring; Colwellia; Crude oil; Microbial molecular markers; Oleispira; Pollution; Seawater","Bacteria; Biodegradation; Crude oil; Gasoline; Genes; Paraffins; Petroleum industry; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Biomonitoring; Biotransformation process; Colwellia; Controlled environment; Dose response relationships; Experimental conditions; Molecular marker; Oleispira; Seawater; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sea water; petroleum; biomarker; biomonitoring; biotransformation; crude oil; identification method; marine pollution; microbial community; oil pollution; pollution effect; seawater; Alcanivorax; amplicon; aquatic environment; Article; bacterial gene; biotransformation; Colwellia rossensis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; correlational study; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; freezing; gene sequence; marine bacterium; microbial community; microbial gene; microbial identification; nonhuman; Oleispira antarctica; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; RNA sequence; water contamination; water sampling; Arctic; bioremediation; biotransformation; environmental monitoring; estuary; metabolism; microbiology; oil spill; water pollutant; Arctic Ocean; Alcanivorax; Bacteria (microorganisms); Colwellia; Colwellia rossensis; Cycloclasticus; Oleispira; Oleispira antarctica; Otus; Arctic Regions; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biotransformation; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Petroleum; Petroleum Pollution; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071232355

These effects add to scientific uncertainties that compromise fisheries management. Among the strategies that can respond to climate change and scientific uncertainty, modifications to harvest control rules (HCRs) might be among the most direct and impactful. We used a bioeconomic model to compare alternative HCRs in terms of biomass, yield, and profits in response to potential effects of climate change and scientific uncertainty, specifically simulated retrospective patterns, for 14 stocks on the Northeast Shelf of the United States. Our results suggest that a responsive HCR in which fishing mortality changes with measured changes in biomass builds inherent resilience to adverse effects of both climate change and scientific uncertainty relative to an HCR in which fishing mortality is precautionary but fixed. This was despite that fact that the HCR algorithm did not account for the climate effects modelled. A fixed fishing mortality HCR was effective when climate effects were negligible or beneficial. Scientific uncertainty further reduced biomass, yield, and profits by about the same magnitude as climate change. Our results suggest that simple changes to HCRs can be a readily implementable strategy for responding to climate change and scientific uncertainty. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

In this study, to provide guidelines for developing a suitable waste management strategy for Depok, Indonesia, emissions from four waste management scenarios for the city are calculated. These scenarios involve treatments such as the application of Waste Treatment Unit (WTU), incinerator, anaerobic digester, composting, and landfill. The best scenario affords the treatment of 150 tons/day of municipal solid waste (MSW) via composting, 80 tons via WTU, and 500 tons/day via anaerobic digestion, and 390 tons/day, which are sent to a controlled landfill in Depok. This best scenario generates net GHG emissions of 202,800 kg CO2-eq/day, accounting for 1900 kg CO2-eq/day from transportation; 4 kg CO2-eq/day from WTU; 25,700 kg CO2-eq/day from composting; 46,200 kg CO2-eq/day from anaerobic digestion; and 129,000 kg CO2-eq/day from a controlled landfill. By contrast, the worst scenario corresponds to the city's current waste management approach, producing net GHG emissions of 299,602.6 kg CO2-eq/day from the treatment of 600 tons/day of MSW via landfill, 70 tons/day via open burning, 60 tons/day via MRF, 340 tons/day via anaerobic digestion, and 40 tons/day via composting. © 2020 The Authors","Depok; Greenhouse gases; Indonesia; Solid waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087625374

However, the direct evidence of such ecological interaction in microbial communities remains rare. Using common freshwater microalgae isolated from a High Rate Algal Pond HRAP treating wastewaters, we investigated with both experimental and modeling approaches the direct facilitation between two algal strains during the colonization phase. Our results demonstrate that the first colonization by microalgae under a severe chemical condition arose from the rapid growth of pioneer species such as Chlorella sorokiniana, which facilitated the subsequent colonization of low growth specialists such as Scenedesmus pectinatus. The pioneer species rapidly depleted the total available ammonia nitrogen favoring the specialist species initially inhibited by free ammonia toxicity. This latter species ultimately dominated the algal community through competitive exclusion under low nutrient conditions. We show that microbial successions are not only regulated by climatic conditions but also by interactions between species based on the ability to modify their growth conditions. We suggest that facilitation within the aquatic microbial communities is a widespread ecological interaction under a vast range of environmental stress. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Chlorella; growth, development and aging; microalga; microbiology; physiological stress; Scenedesmus; waste water; water management; Chlorella; Microalgae; Scenedesmus; Stress, Physiological; Waste Water; Water Microbiology; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074742068

Well-recognized approaches for soil C accretion include reducing soil disturbance, increasing plant biomass inputs, and enhancing plant diversity. Yet experimental evidence often fails to support anticipated C gains, suggesting that our integrated understanding of soil C accretion remains insufficient. Here we use a unique combination of X-ray micro-tomography and micro-scale enzyme mapping to demonstrate for the first time that plant-stimulated soil pore formation appears to be a major, hitherto unrecognized, determinant of whether new C inputs are stored or lost to the atmosphere. Unlike monocultures, diverse plant communities favor the development of 30–150 µm pores. Such pores are the micro-environments associated with higher enzyme activities, and greater abundance of such pores translates into a greater spatial footprint that microorganisms make on the soil and consequently soil C storage capacity. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"acid phosphatase; beta glucosidase; cellulose 1,4 beta cellobiosidase; chlorophyll; cytosol aminopeptidase; hemicellulose; n acetyl beta glucosaminidase; xylan endo 1,3 beta xylosidase; carbon; carbon dioxide; accretion; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; microorganism; soil carbon; stabilization; Article; biodiversity; bioenergy; bulk density; carbon footprint; carbon storage; channel gating; community structure; community succession; controlled study; cropping system; environmental parameters; enzyme activity; gravimetry; image processing; micro-computed tomography; microbial biomass; microbial community; microbial diversity; monoculture; nonhuman; Panicum virgatum; particulate matter; plant community; plant leaf; pore size; porosity; productivity; soil analysis; soil fertility; soil moisture; soil pollution; soil pore; soil water content; species diversity; symbiosis; vegetation; x-ray computed tomography; zymography; atmosphere; biomass; carbon cycle; chemistry; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; physiology; plant; plant root; soil; Atmosphere; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Microbiota; Plant Roots; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069444446

Consequently, SEI formation is a time-consuming and rather expensive production step. In order to better understand the influence of the formation current density on the transport of ions and molecules across the SEI, we formed model-type SEIs on planar glassy carbon electrodes under galvanostatic control. In accordance with the expectations from electrochemical nucleation and growth theory, we find that the transport of both ions and molecule becomes slower with increasing formation current density. However, it is remarkable that the ion transport is slowed down more strongly than the molecule transport. We show that at high formation current densities of about −71 μA cm−2, our model-type SEIs clearly exceed the area-specific resistance tolerable in commercial lithium-ion cells. © 2019 The Authors.

(2014). Differences in SOC under elevated and ambient [CO2] depended on cover types, and most evident in soils under deciduous shrubs. Greater SOC was observed in soils close to the surface as well as 0.4 to 0.8 m suggesting elevated [CO2] stimulated production of aboveground litter, root litter, and rhizodeposition. Greater total N under elevated [CO2] was most evident under deciduous shrubs as well as plant interspace that had extensive coverage of biological soil crusts. Greater total N in the top soil profile under elevated [CO2] was accompanied with reduced δ15N by 0.4‰, suggesting elevated [CO2] stimulated N2-fixation and/or reduced N loss. We conclude that, in arid ecosystems under elevated [CO2], shrubs play a major role in determining C sink capacity in desert soils, and N limitation for vascular plants is unlikely to occur due to sustained net N supply. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biological soil crust; Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE); Mojave Desert; Soil organic carbon; Soil total nitrogen","Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Landforms; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Biological soil crusts; CO2 enrichment; Mojave Desert; Soil organic carbon; Soil total nitrogen; Soils; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon sink; concentration (composition); organic carbon; shrub; soil carbon; soil crust; soil nitrogen; topsoil; Nevada; Nevada Test Site; United States; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071270687

Typically, following afforestation, Acacia mangium are introduced to improve soil fertility and sustain productivity. Through investigations of particulate organic matter (POM), potential soil organic matter (SOM) quality was assessed in acacia and eucalypt plantations along rotations. Methods: Nutrients in POM (4000–50 μm) in the 0–5 cm soil layer were measured after five years into the second rotation (R2Y5) in relation to soil pH and P availability. Data were compared to those at the end of the first 7-year-rotation (R1Y7) and after two years into the second rotation (R2Y2) to evaluate overall SOM quality in the topsoil. Results: At R2Y5, soil pH was higher in the pure eucalypt stands (100E) than in stands containing acacia, either in monoculture (100A) or evenly mixed with eucalypt (50A50E). Coarse POM (cPOM, 4000–250 μm) beneath 100A had the highest N concentration (1.71%), followed by those beneath 50A50E (1.42%) and 100E (1.30%). Higher N was always found in the stands containing acacia. Lower sulphur (S) concentrations and P availabilities were observed in cPOM (50A50E). The greatest amount of coarse (414.7 g) and fine (214.5 g) forest floor litter were found in 100A stands, whereas higher C concentrations were found in the 100E stands for coarse forest floor litter (36.5%) and in the 50A50E stands for fine forest floor litter (38.7%). The decrease in cPOM N and C concentrations were lower than 20% (R1Y7) and 26% (R2Y5) relative to the younger stage (R2Y2). This tendency was more pronounced in fine POM (250–50 μm) and organo-mineral fraction (< 50 μm). Conclusions: The main changes occurred in cPOM beneath stands containing acacia while higher weight of forest floor litter was found in 100A. Soil pH decreased in stands containing acacia. Overall N and C dynamics was enhanced in older stands (R2Y5) than in the younger stands (R2Y2). This may reveal a creation of more labile SOM with lower N and C concentrations in POM fractions in the surface layer, i.e., an ecosystem with a lower potential to mitigate climate change along rotations. © 2019, The Author(s).","Carbon; Climate change mitigation; Fast growing tree; Nitrogen; Nitrogen-fixing species; Particulate organic matter; Phosphorus; Sulphur",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071945849

Legislation is one of the tools applying this pressure, and from 1 January 2020, it focuses on the reduction of sulfur percentage in the heavy fuel oil (HFO)-powered vessels to 0.5%. In the beginning of this paper, the harmful environmental contribution of the naval sector is presented, along with the current legislation. The maritime industry is in a transitional stage, diverging from fossil fuels through alternative technologies and fuels, aiming to become over the long term a zero-emission industry. However, there are many implemented technologies, mostly of a mechanical nature, that already improve the efficiency of vessels and indirectly reduce their emissions. Such technologies include shaft generators (SGs), scrubbers, etc. The aim is for alternative fuels and technologies such as solar and wind to be implemented, too. Such technologies, when combined with the advantages of digitalization and automation, can further reduce emissions toward zero-emission vessels (ZEVs) through integrated systems. The present paper serves the purpose of a common point of gathering, addressing, and explaining the latest updates, previous achievements, and future targets of the maritime sector. The very nature of the subject—electric propulsion in the maritime sector—makes it very difficult to find sufficient and trustworthy data. There are two main reasons for this problem. The first one is that electric vehicles became commercial at a large scale (electric cars) very recently, and are still in a transitional stage. The second reason is that the maritime industry is very competitive; therefore, state-of-the-art technologies and data that give each company the lead are rarely published, and when they do, it happens very discreetly. In the quantitative part of the paper, where the photovoltaic (PV) and battery system calculations take place, there is no use of a specific model rather than a simplified approach. The purpose of the calculations is to show that with the present technologies, a purely solar-powered commercial vessel (such as RoRo, passenger, etc.) is technically impossible, and that there could be only a small contribution—of around 7%—to the electricity needs of a roll-on/roll-off (RoRo)-passenger ship. The state of the art finds a very short number of vessels that already use battery propulsion, but is expected to increase in the upcoming years. The present paper not only presents an overview of the state-of-the-art achievements in the electric propulsion of vessels, it also considers the exploitation of the continuous growth that the battery market is facing. As stated before, batteries are on the up, and this is due to the emerging need for energy storage in electricity grids that depend increasingly on renewable energy sources (RES). The paper makes a first consideration about the feasibility and possible benefits of implementing grid-like battery systems on-board vessels. In such a scenario, vessels would acquire significantly bigger energy capacity, allowing greater travel distances, a possible contribution of 44% of the vessel’s total power requirements (propulsion included), and a surplus as far as electricity requirements are concerned. There is also the more futuristic long-term scenario where Green Ports would charge vessels purely from RES dedicated to the port’s needs. The last part of the paper contains a qualitative assessment about the possible impacts that a battery-powered maritime industry could have. © 2019 by the author.

Here, we developed a state-of-the-art method integrating biological theory with survey and experimental data in a way that allows us to explicitly model both physical tolerance limits of species and inherent natural variability in regional conditions and thereby improve the reliability of species distribution predictions under future climate conditions. By using a macroalga-herbivore association (Fucus vesiculosus - Idotea balthica) as a case study, we illustrated how salinity reduction and temperature increase under future climate conditions may significantly reduce the occurrence and biomass of these important coastal species. Moreover, we showed that the reduction of herbivore occurrence is linked to reduction of their host macroalgae. Spatial predictive modelling and experimental biology have been traditionally seen as separate fields but stronger interlinkages between these disciplines can improve species distribution projections under climate change. Experiments enable qualitative prior knowledge to be defined and identify cause-effect relationships, and thereby better foresee alterations in ecosystem structure and functioning under future climate conditions that are not necessarily seen in projections based on non-causal statistical relationships alone. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"animal; climate change; ecosystem; Fucus; herbivory; physiology; seaweed; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fucus; Herbivory; Seaweed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061499547

Here we present an analysis of climate change and climate change velocity at a local scale (1 × 1 km) across Germany. We focus on seasonal climate variability and velocity and investigate changes in three time periods (1901–2015, 1901–1950 and 1951–2015) using a novel statistical approach. Our results on climate variability showed the highest trends for the 1951–2015 time period. The strongest (positive/negative) and spatially the most dispersed trends were found for Summer maximum temperature and Summer minimum temperatures. For precipitation the strongest positive trends were most pronounced in the summer (1951–2015) and winter (1901–2015). Results for climate change velocity showed that almost 90% of temperature velocities were in the range of 0.5 to 3 km/year, whereas all climate velocities for precipitation were within the range of −3.5 to 4.5 km/year. The key results amplify the need for more local and regional scale studies to better understand species individualistic responses to recent climate change and allow for more accurate future projections and conservation strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; climate change; Germany; precipitation; summer; velocity; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061730060

Such a map is required e.g. for the prediction of vegetation changes due to anthropogenic depositions and climate change. In this project the soil map 1: 1.000.000 of the European Soil Data Center (ESDAC) of the European Commission was used. For each soil mapping unit (SMU), the dominating FAO soil type was attributed to a ten-part nutrient classification system. In this expert-based classification, the soil types are ranked by the nutrient supply of the soil, in which the maximum plant growth is to be expected in the middle range (code number 4) where the nutrient supply is well balanced. In addition to the expected composition of the nutrient supply, the intensity of nutrient supply and typical deficiencies are the decisive criteria for the classification of soils. Thus, potential nutrient limits on carbonatic soils (code number 5 and 6) are separated from those on acid soils (code number 1 and 2). Another four classes were required to characterize soil types which are strongly dominated by one specific cation (code number 7), which are water-saturated (code numbers 8 and 9) or which are unrecognizable due to coverage by glaciers, waters, or cities. Since the nutrient supply of some soil types varies in a wide range, the classification of soils is not always clear. In such cases additional information on geology was used.

Thus, to better manage our responses to global warming, it is important to monitor and assess forest aboveground carbon and forest aboveground biomass (FAGB). Different levels of detail are needed to estimate FAGB at local, regional and national scales. Multi-scale remote sensing analysis from high, medium and coarse spatial resolution data, along with field sampling, is one approach often used. However, the methods developed are still time consuming, expensive, and inconvenient for systematic monitoring, especially for developing countries, as they require vast numbers of field samples for upscaling. Here, we recommend a convenient two-scale approach to estimate FAGB that was tested in our study sites. The study was conducted in the Chitwan district of Nepal using GeoEye-1 (0.5 m), Landsat (30 m) and Google Earth very high resolution (GEVHR) Quickbird (0.65 m) images. For the local scale (Kayerkhola watershed), tree crowns of the area were delineated by the object-based image analysis technique on GeoEye images. An overall accuracy of 83% was obtained in the delineation of tree canopy cover (TCC) per plot. A TCC vs. FAGB model was developed based on the TCC estimations from GeoEye and FAGB measurements from field sample plots. A coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76 was obtained in the modelling, and a value of 0.83 was obtained in the validation of the model. To upscale FAGB to the entire district, open source GEVHR images were used as virtual field plots. We delineated their TCC values and then calculated FAGB based on a TCC versus FAGB model. Using the multivariate adaptive regression splines machine learning algorithm, we developed a model from the relationship between the FAGB of GEVHR virtual plots with predictor parameters from Landsat 8 bands and vegetation indices. The model was then used to extrapolate FAGB to the entire district. This approach considerably reduced the need for field data and commercial very high resolution imagery while achieving two-scale forest information and FAGB estimates at high resolution (30 m) and accuracy (R2 = 0.76 and 0.7) with minimal error (RMSE = 64 and 38 tons ha−1) at local and regional scales. This methodology is a promising technique for cost-effective FAGB and carbon estimations and can be replicated with limited resources and time. The method is especially applicable for developing countries that have low budgets for carbon estimations, and it is also applicable to the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) monitoring reporting and verification processes. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Forest aboveground biomass; Google Earth imagery; Multi-scale remote sensing; Optical imagery; Virtual plot","aboveground biomass; forestry production; GeoEye; image analysis; Landsat; machine learning; optical method; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; World Wide Web; Chitwan; Narayani; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049633254

However, this will lead to an increase in energy consumption and subsequent flue gas emission. Proper utilization of waste gas recovery systems is thus a major research area, focusing on reducing fuel consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases without affecting process performance. In this paper, a palm oil-based oleochemical plant is studied. The fuel consumption and emission of flue gas from a thermal oil boiler were measured and the feasibility of implementation of a waste heat recovery system and its environmental impact study. The results show that the implementation of such a system can reduce natural fuel gas consumption by 17.29% and approximately 149.29 t per annum of carbon dioxide gas (CO2). Moreover, the concentration of CO2 released into highly-populated communities is estimated through a Gaussian Plume Model at different wind speed conditions. The preliminary results show that the CO2 concentration at two locations—an apartment and a local school located within 1.5 km of the plant—is well below the concentration limit of 1.938 g/m3 recommended by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Services. © 2019 by the authors.

Current energy models assume optimal consumer decisions which may result in expectations of the effectiveness of climate policies that are far too optimistic. Prospect Theory, on the other hand, aims to model real-life choices, based on empirical observations that losses have a relatively larger influence on decisions than gains, relative to a reference point. Here, we show for the first time how loss aversion can be included into a global energy model with high spatial resolution, using heating technology uptake as a case study. We simulate the future heating technology diffusion for 59 world regions covering the globe, with and without the consideration of loss aversion. We find that ignoring the implications of loss aversion overestimates the market uptake of renewables, in individual countries as well as on the global level. As a consequence, loss aversion results in higher projected CO2 emissions by households, and the need for much stronger policy instruments for achieving decarbonisation targets. In the case of residential heating, a carbon tax of 200 €/tCO2 is projected to reduce overall emission levels to a similar extent than a carbon tax of 100 €/tCO2 without the consideration of loss aversion. Even for similar degrees of decarbonisation, accounting for loss aversion implies substantial changes in the underlying technology composition: technology choices become subject to a ‘conservative shift’ towards low-carbon technologies which are relatively less efficient, but already more established in local markets. © 2019 The Authors","Behavioural realism; Decarbonisation policies; Loss aversion; Policy simulation; Prospect theory; Technology diffusion","Carbon; Commerce; Decarbonization; Emission control; Heating; Behavioural realism; Decarbonisation; Loss aversion; Policy simulation; Prospect theory; Technology diffusion; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072855596

While the quantity of CH4 leakage from natural gas has been studied extensively, the magnitude and timing of the CH4 mitigation required to meet climate policy goals is less well understood. Here we address this topic by examining the case of US electricity under a range of baseline natural gas leakage rate estimates and emissions equivalency metrics for converting CH4 to CO2-equivalent emissions. We find that CH4 emissions from the power sector would need to be reduced by 30%-90% from today's levels by 2030 in order to meet a CO2-equivalent climate policy target while continuing to rely on natural gas. These CH4 emissions reductions are greater than the required CO2 reductions under the same policy. Alternatively, expanding carbon-free sources more rapidly could meet the 2030 target without reductions in natural gas leakage rates. The results provide insight on an important policy choice in regions and sectors using natural gas, between emphasizing a natural gas supply chain clean-up effort or an accelerated transition toward carbon-free energy sources. © 2019 The Author(s).

The significance of winter CO2 contributions to the atmosphere in these regions has likewise been recognized. In this study, concentrations of CO2 and 222Rn were observed in the snowpack and underlying cold temperate soils of northern Japan during two winter seasons. Winter CO2 emissions, estimated alternately by snow density, 222Rn tracer (under steady and non-steady states), and chamber, were 56 ± 2, 42 ± 6, 44 ± 15, and 34 ± 3 gCO2-C/m2/season, respectively, suggesting that contribution from average winter CO2 emission corresponds to 25% (range: 19–33%) of annual emission. Winter CO2 emission is highly regulated by soil temperature at 5 cm, depending on snow depth. Winter CO2 emission transport is not suppressed through the snowpack to the atmosphere; rather it is stimulated when seasonal snow depth is over the 40-cm threshold in the soils. The higher soil CO2 production of 0.11 ± 0.02 gCO2-C/m3/h estimated by 222Rn transfer velocity reflects vigorous microbial activity in soils underlying winter snowpack. Therefore, 222Rn is an important proxy for the estimation of winter CO2 emission and diffusivity in snowpack, and of CO2 production rate and transfer velocity in the seasonal, snow-covered. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR","222Rn Tracer; CO2 Diffusivity and Transfer velocity; CO2 Production Rate; Static Chamber; Winter CO2 Emission","cold front; diffusion; diffusivity; flux chamber; microbial activity; radon isotope; snowpack; soil carbon; soil emission; temperate environment; tracer; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073517332

However, the lack of real-time measurement and poor prediction of the concentration of fine dust provide inaccurate alarm and information to residents. The real-time air quality measurement data is the big data of new field which should be complemented with the national meteorological data in order to meet the demands for the customers and public through the other relevant data.

We also develop an optimized path of sprinkler vehicles to improve air condition in a local city. The density of PM is affected by meteorological variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind speed. To predict the density of (fine) PM, we use machine learning techniques considering not only meteorological data from observatories, but spatial factors like pollutants, floating populations and traffic volumes of a certain location using LTE(Long Term Evolution) signals.

The results showed that the weighted environmental impact of Korea's national power grid supply would increase overall by 66% from 2015 to 2029 using the plan laid out by the 7th Power Roadmap, and by only 33% from 2017 to 2031 using the 8th Power Roadmap plan. This change reflects the substantial amount of renewables in the more recent power mix plan. In 2016, BEV usage in Korea resulted in emissions reductions of about 37% compared with diesel passenger vehicles, and 41% compared with gasoline vehicles per kilometer driven (100 g CO2e/km versus 158 g and 170 g CO2e/km, respectively) related to transportation sector. By 2030, BEV usage in Korea is expected to achieve a greater emissions reduction of about 53% compared with diesel vehicles and 56% compared with gasoline vehicles. However, trade-offs are also expected because of increased particulate matter (PM) pollution, which we anticipate to increase by 84% compared with 2016 conditions. Despite these projected increases in PM emissions, increased BEV usage in Korea is expected to result in important global and local benefits through reductions of climate-changing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Battery electric vehicle; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Megacity; Power mix; Power roadmap","electric vehicle; emission control; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; megacity; particulate matter; pollution policy; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081231112

The polarization ratio was as high as 0.74 at room temperature. High-resolution X-ray reciprocal space mapping measurements revealed that the InGaN quantum wells on GaN/SCES template were under considerable anisotropic in-plane strain states of −1.178% and −1.921% along the directions perpendicular and parallel to the stripe-pattern, respectively. The anisotropic strain states were attributed to the anisotropic alignment of cavity-incorporated sapphire nano-membranes, which accommodated both anisotropic elastic relaxation in the InGaN quantum well plane as well as the graded elastic relaxation along the vertical direction in the GaN template adjacent to the InGaN/GaN MQWs. The partial strain relaxation in the InGaN wells also contributed to reduction of quantum confined Stark effect, resulting in four times higher PL intensity than InGaN/GaN MQWs on planar sapphire substrate. From theoretical calculations based on k∙p perturbation theory, it was found that fundamental origin of the polarized optical emission was strain-induced modification of valence band structures of the InGaN/GaN MQWs on the SCES.

In this study, we analyzed the factors for EV adoption with the data of revealed preference from 2013 to 2017 in Korea. Analyses showed that the driving range of EVs and financial incentives have a positive impact on EV deployment. Also, the driving range is found to be the most critical factor explaining the market growth of EVs. The results suggest that technical improvement increases the value of EVs and in turn raises the probability of consumers' decision to purchase EVs. Financial incentive as well can encourage consumers to buy EVs, however, is not strong enough to create transitions from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to EVs. © 2019 by the authors.","Charging infrastructures; Driving range; Electric vehicle adoption; Financial incentive; Technology adoption; Technology policy","electric vehicle; infrastructural development; infrastructure planning; investment incentive; preference behavior; tax incentive; technology adoption; technology policy; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076709209

In this study, MgO nanocubes synthesized by self-burning micro-sized Mg metal powders in air showed electrical conductivity when they were sandwiched between two gold-mesh electrodes and steadily applied a voltage at room temperature (∼25 °C). In addition, a simultaneous light emission caused by the microdischarge of nitrogen molecules occurred adjacent to the cathode. The light emission was observed when traces of water vapor existed in the gas environment. In the case of a voltage pulse produced by switching off, transient emissions of Mg I and Mg II were detected on both sides of the electrodes. However, those steady and transient light emissions were not observed in the commercial MgO nanoparticles devoid of nanocubes. The light emissions shown in the cases of the steady-state might be caused by electron injection into the empty conductive states, which exist along the edges of MgO nanocubes, as a result of the spontaneous dissociation of water vapors at reactive sites of the nanocube surfaces as well as a result of the reduction of the energy barriers between the cathode and MgO nanocubes in contact. For transient emission, electrons trapped in the low coordinate sites were released with voltage pulse and neutralized the nearby Mg+ and Mg2+ ions, driving them into the excited neutral states, Mg I and Mg II. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Cathodes; Electric potential; Energy gap; Injection (oil wells); Light emission; Magnesia; Powder metals; Trapped ions; Water vapor; Electrical conductivity; Gas environment; Mesh electrodes; Microdischarges; Nitrogen molecule; Steady and transient; Transient emissions; Wide band gap oxides; Power quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076613227

Through selection of a fast and robust numerical algorithm, characterizing and increasing the detection envelope, performing static and dynamic perspective adjustments, accounting for non-uniform and non-linear system response, as well as localized signal-to-noise ratio enhancement through image filtering, the performance of the pyrometric method was improved by a 40% increase in the resolved signal fraction.

This article looks at how the Arctic has been produced in international legal spaces. It addresses the implication of states and Indigenous peoples in processes of Arctic governance. Looking at specific international legal instruments relevant to Arctic climate change and development, the author attempts to tease out the relationship between the concepts of Indigenous rights and state sovereignty that underlie these international legal realms. What do these international legal regimes tell us with respect to the role of Arctic Indigenous peoples and the role of states in governing the 'global' Arctic? It is argued that while international law has come a long way in recognizing the special status of Indigenous peoples in the international system, it still hesitates to recognize Indigenous groups as international law makers. Comparing the status of Indigenous peoples under specific international regimes to their role within the Arctic Council, it becomes evident that more participatory forms of global governance are entirely possible and long overdue. © Foundation of the Leiden Journal of International Law 2019.","Arctic sovereignty; Global governance; International environmental law; Self-determination; United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072303698

These SWBs, such as streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands, reservoirs, and creeks have a positive impact on the cooling of the surrounding climate and, therefore, reduction in SWBs can contribute to the rise of land surface temperature (LST). This study presents the impact of SWBs on the LST across Bangladesh to quantify their roles in the rapid temperature rise of Bangladesh. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST and water mask data of Bangladesh for the period 2000-2015 are used for this purpose. Influences of topography and geography on LST were first removed, and then regression analysis was conducted to quantify the impact of SWBs on the LST. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to assess the changes in LST and SWBs. The results revealed that SWBs were reduced from 11,379 km2 in 2000 to 9657 km2 in 2015. The trend analysis showed that changes in SWBs have reduced significantly at a 90% level of confidence, which contributed to the acceleration of LST rise in the country due to global warming. The spatial analysis during the specific years showed that an increase in LST can be seen with the reduction of SWBs. Furthermore, the reduction of 100 m2 of SWBs can reduce the LST of the surrounding regions from -1.2 to -2.2 °C. © 2019 by the authors.","Bangladesh; Land surface temperature; MODIS; Surface water bodies","climate change; cooling; land surface; MODIS; regression analysis; spatial analysis; surface temperature; surface water; topography; trend analysis; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076683493

This work aims to understand the role of the utilization of solid byproduct of Indonesian mill scale, formed during the cold rolling process, and abundant local resources of coconut coir wastes. Mill scale has a fairly high total iron content with the dominant phase being hematite, while pure Fe content is insignificant. In this study, we utilized coconut coir-based carbon (CCC) for direct reduction of mill scale via a carbothermic process to enhance its metallic Fe content. The reduction was carried out by mixing mill scale/CCC at 6:1 wt% ratio in high energy milling for 2 min. The mixture was pressed (100 MPa for 1 min) into pellets and sintered at 900 °C for 1 h and 1000 °C for 1 and 2 h under inert gas atmosphere. After cooling, the sintered pellets were crushed into powder and separated from impurities by magnetic separation. The results show that the reduction process is dominated by carbon gasification–diffusion from CCC. The improved metallization and better reducing process was more pronounced at 1000 °C for 2 h than that for 1 h with over 80 wt% being separated into metallic Fe and lesser CO2 trapped within the sample. X-ray diffractometry revealed that the intimate contact of mill scale/CCC was more increased in solid than that in powder state and indicated that the obtained phases are Fe, Fe3O4, and CO2. The presence of CO2 can be expected due to incomplete evacuation within the sample. These results suggest that mill scale/CCC has some promising potential on certain technical-industrial-scale applications, which might enhance their economic value after further research investigation and evaluation. © 2019, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Carbothermic; Coconut coir-based carbon; Direct reduction; Industrial waste; Mill scale","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cold rolling; Hematite; Industrial research; Industrial wastes; Inert gases; Iron; Magnetic separation; Magnetite; Mechanical alloying; Pelletizing; Sintering; Waste utilization; X ray diffraction analysis; Carbon gasification; Carbothermic; Coconut coirs; Cold rolling process; Direct Reduction; Industrial-scale applications; Inert gas atmosphere; Mill scale; Cold rolling mills",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072051030

Wildfires consist of burning standing biomass at erratic degrees of intensity, severity, and frequency. Consequently, wildfires generate large amounts of smoke and other toxic pollutants that have devastating impacts on ambient air quality and human health. There is, therefore, a need for a comprehensive study that characterizes land-atmosphere interactions with regard to wildfires, critical for understanding the interrelated and multidimensional impacts of wildfires. Current studies have a limited scope and a narrow focus, usually only focusing on one aspect of wildfire impacts, such as air quality without simultaneously considering the impacts on land surface changes and vice versa. In this study, we use several multisource data to determine the spatial distribution, frequency, disturbance characteristics of and variability and distribution of pollutants emitted by wildfires. The specific objectives were to (1) study the sources of wildfires and the period they are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa over a 9 year period, i.e., 2007-2016, (2) estimate the seasonal disturbance of wildfires on various vegetation types, (3) determine the spatial distribution of black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke, and (4) determine the vertical height distribution of smoke. The results show largest burned areas in December-January-February (DJF), June-July-August (JJA) and September-October-November (SON) seasons, and reciprocal high emissions of BC, CO, and smoke, as observed by Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). In addition, the results reveal an increasing trend in the magnitude of BC, and CO concentration driven by meteorological conditions such as low precipitation, low relative humidity, and low latent heat flux. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of multisource remotely sensed data in characterising long-term wildfire patterns and associated emissions. The results in this study are critical for informing better regional fire management and air quality control strategies to preserve endangered species and habitats, promote sustainable land management, and reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass burning; Burned area; CALIPSO; ESA CCI-LC; MODIS; Smoke; Wildfires","air quality; ambient air; black carbon; CALIPSO; carbon monoxide; endangered species; MODIS; remote sensing; smoke; trend analysis; wildfire; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076686035

The EF is applied in the perpendicular direction to the graphene in the range of −0.015 to +0.015 a.u. with the interval of 0.005 a.u. The effects of EF on the adsorption, transition state and product complexes of the methane activation reaction are revealed. The binding energies of methane on Fe site in Fe-GPs are increased from −12.9 to −15.3, −18.1 and −21.5 kcal/mol for the negative EF of −0.005, −0.010 and −0.015, respectively. By applying positive EF, the activation barriers for methane activation are reduced in range of 3–8 kcal/mol (around 12–31%) and the reaction energies are more exothermic. The positive EF kinetically favors the reaction compared to the system without EF. The adsorption and activation of methane on Fe-GPs can be easily tuned by adjusting the external electric field for various applications. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","DFT; external electric field; Fe-embedded graphene; Graphene; methane C-H bond activation","Adsorption; Binding energy; Chemical activation; Density functional theory; Electric fields; Graphene; Iron compounds; Activation barriers; CH-bond activation; Density-functional methods; External electric field; Methane activation; Methane adsorption; Theoretical study; Transition state; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071471442

Not only does walking have the potential to benefit health, it can also be used as a form of transport, reducing reliance on motorised transport and reducing CO2 emissions. However, little is known about the distribution of such features within urban environments. Furthermore, debate surrounds whether people living in areas with high deprivation face the ‘double jeopardy’ of high deprivation and environments that are unsupportive of walking. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by developing measures of the built environment considered to support walking and assessing and whether there is a relationship between these with area-level deprivation in urban Scotland. It also examines the geographic distribution of these measures in two of Scotland's biggest conurbations. Three aspects of the physical built environment considered to reflect Area Walking Potential (AWP) were created which are considered to show good walking environments, there were residential density, intersection density and destination accessibility, as well as an overall walkability index (a combination of the three measures). The results showed no evidence of deprivation amplification with higher concentrations of the AWP measures in more deprived areas. Those living in the least deprived areas having the lowest levels of the measures. However, spatial analysis showed unequal distribution of these measures, with concentrations of high AWP clustered together with lower AWP scores in peripheral areas. These results support the growing evidence base of unequal geographic distribution of AWP. These results matter for developing built environments to support walking because it is important to understand how existing patterns of AWP to target interventions appropriately. Awareness of associations between AWP and deprivation is important for policies aimed at ameliorating multi-level inequalities demonstrating where people are likely to be experiencing both low AWP and high deprivation. © 2019 The Authors","Area deprivation; Geographic information systems; Socio-spatial; Spatial inequalities; Urban scotland; Walkability","article; awareness; built environment; geographic distribution; geographic information system; human; human experiment; Scotland; spatial analysis; walkability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070691846

Samples of photosynthetic microbial mats, both soft mats (salinities of 55–126 ppt) and gypsum-hosted endoevaporite mats (salinities of 77–320 ppt), were obtained from hypersaline environments in California, USA, Mexico and Chile. Methane production was determined from the increase in headspace methane concentration within incubation vials containing mat samples. At the end of the incubation period, the δ13C values of produced methane were measured. Soft microbial mat vials containing molybdate, a specific inhibitor of bacterial sulfate reduction, exhibited dramatically higher methane production rates and higher (enriched in 13C) methane δ13C values than the controls. This suggests that the inhibition of sulfate reduction allowed the methanogens at these sites to use the competitive substrates (H2 and/or acetate) made available. Further, the higher δ13C values of the produced methane suggest that substrates (both competitive and non-competitive) were used to near completion. At the endoevaporite sites, which have much higher salinities than the soft mat sites, methane production was not significantly different and the methane δ13C values either remained the same or decreased (depleted in 13C) with added molybdate. We suggest that substrate availability increased enough to allow for somewhat greater isotopic fractionation resulting in the lower methane δ13C values that were observed, but not enough to significantly increase measured production rates. Where no changes in either methane production rates or δ13C values occurred, we hypothesize that salinity itself was inhibiting sulfate reduction and thus controlling microbe populations and rates of metabolism. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Hypersaline; Methane production; Molybdate; Stable isotopes","competition (ecology); hypersaline environment; inhibition; isotopic composition; metabolism; methane; methanogenic bacterium; stable isotope; sulfate-reducing bacterium; California; Chile; Mexico [North America]; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075497527

The article seeks to address two research questions. First, how much money could the state raise from securitizing CT revenue, if at all? Second, what are the challenges and uncertainties to operating a levered fund? Based on a modified portfolio model initially capitalized by CT revenue, this article evaluates not only the size and potential performance of a CCA Fund, but also the range of challenges and opportunities facing the development of a portfolio of products advanced in the name of financing climate adaptation investments. The model results are presented through various expert-derived scenarios that are framed by various political drivers and market parameters.

The global burgeoning of SSM datasets in the past decade holds a significant potential in improving our understanding of multiscale SSM dynamics. The primary issues that hinder the fusion of SSM data from disparate instruments are (1) different spatial resolutions of the data instruments, (2) inherent spatial variability in SSM caused due to atmospheric and land surface controls, and (3) measurement errors caused due to imperfect retrievals of instruments. We present a data fusion scheme which takes all the above three factors into account using a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model (SHM), combining a geostatistical approach with a hierarchical model. The applicability of the fusion scheme is demonstrated by fusing point, airborne, and satellite data for a watershed exhibiting high spatial variability in Manitoba, Canada. We demonstrate that the proposed data fusion scheme is adept at assimilating and predicting SSM distribution across all three scales while accounting for potential measurement errors caused due to imperfect retrievals. Further validation of the algorithm is required in different hydroclimates and surface heterogeneity as well as for other data platforms for wider applicability. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

A review at Bogor City government's development plans reveals that a range of activities has been incorporated to reduce the City's Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions and these activities have also targeted major and increasing emission sources based on their emissions profile. We identified relevant activities indicated in Medium-Term City Development Plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Daerah - RPJMD) and Medium-Term Sectoral Strategic Plans (Rencana Strategis - RENSTRA) for the periods of 2014-2019. We examined the emission profile and similar to other cities worldwide, energy was revealed as the largest source of emission in Bogor. Emissions from energy sector accounted for 99% of the total city emission and 36% of it come from transportation. We also examined the annual trends. In 2016, Bogor City had a population of 1,064,687, a 10% increase from year 2010. The increase was similar to their GHG emissions which showed a 13% increase in 2016 compared to the 2010' level. The growth between these two parameters, however, was not similar. While Bogor City's population showed a positive trend, despite at smaller rate than in previous years, emissions level in 2016 was actually less than the 2015 level. This significant emission reduction within a year might not merely be the results of mitigation action, but other factor such as economic condition. Review on Bogor City government's Development Plan for the period of 2014-2019 showed six groups of mitigation programmes were being implemented. Some of the activities within the programmes were progressing well while others were having set back. Consultation with relevant agency's officers revealed some operational constraints to the implementation of the mitigation activities. Bogor City has developed a Bus Rapid Transportation (BRT) system called Trans Pakuan and has improved pedestrian area to reduce individual vehicle trips. Despite enthusiasm from City Government through these programmes, the increasing trend of e-hail apps transportation was potentially constraining as their ability to cater door-to-door trip is preferable for users than using bus or walking. In the waste sector, lack of segregating habit in households contributed to problems in 3R (reduce, reuse, & recycle) stations. These findings indicate that development of mitigation options needs a comprehensive approach, including consideration of people's habit and acceptance of the options. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bus transportation; Climate change; Emission control; Precipitation (meteorology); Urban growth; Development plans; Economic condition; Emission profile; Emission reduction; Emission sources; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Mitigation options; Operational constraints; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077462435

Here, we use a low-carbon based strategy to cultivate low-abundance bacteria from Spongia officinalis. This approach favoured the growth of Alphaproteobacteria strains in the genera Anderseniella, Erythrobacter, Labrenzia, Loktanella, Ruegeria, Sphingorhabdus, Tateyamaria and Pseudovibrio, besides two likely new genera in the Rhodobacteraceae family. Mapping of complete genomes against the metagenomes of S. officinalis, seawater, and sediments confirmed the rare status of all the above-mentioned lineages in the marine realm. Remarkably, this community of low-abundance Alphaproteobacteria possesses several genomic attributes common to dominant, presently uncultivatable sponge symbionts, potentially contributing to host fitness through detoxification mechanisms (e.g. heavy metal and metabolic waste removal, degradation of aromatic compounds), provision of essential vitamins (e.g. B6 and B12 biosynthesis), nutritional exchange (especially regarding the processing of organic sulphur and nitrogen) and chemical defence (e.g. polyketide and terpenoid biosynthesis). None of the studied taxa displayed signs of genome reduction, indicative of obligate mutualism.

Further tightening of fleet targets and worldwide emission regulations will make a faster catalyst light-off to meet legislated standards hence reduce the impact of road transport on air quality even more critical. This work investigates the effect of adding hydrogen (H2) at levels up to 2500 ppm into the exhaust gases produced by combustion of various oxygenated C2-, C4- A nd renewable fuel molecules blended at 20 % wt/wt with gasoline on the light-off performance of a commercially available three-way catalyst (TWC) (0.61 L, Pd/Rh/Pt-19/5/1, 15g). The study was conducted on a modified naturally aspirated, 1.4 L, four-cylinder, direct-injected, spark-ignition engine. The experiments were performed at the steady-state condition of 1600 r/min and BMEP of 3.6 bar, derived from a time-based load distribution of a WLTC cycle simulation, with levels of gaseous pollutants, particulate matter and hydrogen measured both upstream and downstream of the TWC. Low-level H2 addition reduced the TWC light-off temperature of CO, THC and NOx, and decreased the time to reach steady particulate number/mass levels post-TWC. The presence of C2-(ethanol, acetaldehyde, diethyl ether) and C4-(1-butanol, butyraldehyde, 2-butanone, methyl tert-butyl ether) molecules displayed minimal impact on the conversion efficiencies relative to operating the engine with pure reference gasoline. Linalool and valerolactone blends displayed a slight increase in light-off temperature and produced elevated levels of particulates pre and post catalyst, while 2-methylfuran and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran blends emitted lower levels of particulates. Hydrogen levels post-converter were found to reach almost full conversion after H2 light-off, independent of the amount added, however after CO light-off the conversion of the additional H2 was reduced significantly. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Air quality; Catalysts; Conversion efficiency; Direct injection; Efficiency; Engines; Ethers; Exhaust gases; Fog; Gasoline; Hydrogen; Molecules; Particles (particulate matter); Powertrains; 2-methyltetrahydrofuran; After treatment devices; High conversion efficiency; Light-off performance; Light-off temperatures; Methyl tert butyl ether; Oxygenated fuel blends; Steady-state condition; Hydrogen fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084518253

The link between the extratropics and tropics is of high societal concern given its role in controlling regional patterns of climate change. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms that enable these connections would significantly enhance our ability to predict and prepare for future changes in regional hydrology. The spirit of ETIN-MIP is strongly in line with one of the four questions of the World Climate Research Programme’s Grand Challenge on Clouds, Circulation and Climate Sensitivity (Bony et al. 2015). In keeping with the original motivation for ETIN-MIP, namely, to provide guidance on identifying the origin of the double ITCZ bias, we have presented initial results focused on tropical precipitation and energetics. The results have practical implications for GCM development strategy and suggest that fixing tropical biases would be a more viable option for alleviating hemispherically antisymmetric components of tropical precipitation biases while fixing extratropical biases is more desirable for improving the hemispherically symmetric component of tropical precipitation biases. It also implies that the ability of extratropical biases to manifest the hemispherically antisymmetric component of the double ITCZ bias would depend on the strength of stratocumulus–SST feedback in the subtropics (Mechoso et al. 2016). For example, the effect of extratropical biases diminishes away from the source region, but the rate of damping would be weaker in models with a stronger coupling between the subtropical stratocumulus and SST that acts as a positive feedback; hence, extratropical biases are able to project onto the double ITCZ bias in some models. The limited ability of extratropical biases to meridionally displace the tropical precipitation compared to tropical biases is due to efficient heat uptake response by extratropical oceanic processes (Figs. 6 and 7). It suggests constraining tropical response to regional energy perturbations requires improved understanding of deep ocean circulation response. This project will enhance our understanding of the origin of longstanding double ITCZ bias, which is an essential first step in informing model developers. More generally, ETIN-MIP will advance our physical understanding of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation responses to regional energy perturbations in a fully coupled framework, and provides a resource for the climate dynamics community to understand the plausibility of different model responses to such regionally varying energy perturbations, including those expected from anthropogenic climate change. ©2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate models; Clouds; Feedback; Oceanography; Tropics; Anthropogenic climate changes; Deep-ocean circulation; Development strategies; Energy perturbations; Numerical experiments; Regional hydrologies; Symmetric components; Tropical precipitation; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078506725

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current lab-scale research framework, the fuel pellet quality evaluation indexes, the latest characterization methods, and novel sources and functionalities of different materials used in codensification. This paper emphasizes the distinct role of codensification as a bridge between existing and emerging biomass conversion routes, waste treatment processes, and fossil resource refinery technologies, and discussed this technology's potential in energy recovery from different resources, including low-fuel-quality biomass and difficult-to-handle wastes/byproducts such as municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, pyrolysis oil and minerals.

To reduce the density of GGB by increasing the grain size, CVD growth conditions with a reduced CH4 flow rate have been widely applied and, recently, electropolishing of copper (Cu) foil substrates to flatten the surface has been undertaken prior to graphene growth. In this study, we show that polycrystalline graphene layer grown on typical Cu foil features two heterogeneous regions with different average grain sizes: small-grain regions (SGRs) and large-grain regions (LGRs). Statistical analysis of the grains of the graphene layers grown under different process conditions showed that SGRs (which form on Cu striations) limit the average grain size, the ability to control the grain size through adjustment of growth conditions, and global grain-size uniformity. Analysis showed that the surface-flattening process significantly improves grain-size uniformity, and monolayer coverage, as well as the average grain size. These results suggest that a process for flattening the surfaces of Cu substrates is critical to controlling the quality and uniformity of CVD-grown graphene layers for practical device applications. © 2019 Korean Physical Society","Electropolishing process; Global uniformity; Graphene grain boundaries; Small-grain regions","Copper; Deterioration; Electrolytic polishing; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Graphene; Graphene devices; Metal cladding; Morphology; Statistical process control; Surface morphology; Chemical vapor depositions (CVD); Device application; Global uniformity; Heterogeneous region; Monolayer coverage; Polycrystalline graphene; Small grains; Surface flattening; Chemical vapor deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072380430

This argument implies that households with high CFs consume more meat than low-CF households. An observation of diet and CF across 60,000 households in Japan, a nation whose diet and demographics are in many ways globally indicative, does not support this. Meat consumption only weakly explains the difference between high- and low-CF households and is not localized to any particularly easily targeted group. We find that while nearly all households can reduce their CF by eating less meat, higher-CF households are not distinguished by excessive meat consumption relative to other households but rather have higher household CF intensity because of elevated consumption in other areas including restaurants, confectionery, and alcohol. © 2019 The Authors","carbon footprint; diet; food","carbon footprint; diet; food consumption; meat; vegetable; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089803251

East Asia is one of the most polluted regions in the world, but anthropogenic emissions such as NOx and SO2 began to decrease in 2010s. This trend was well observed by satellites, but the spatiotemporal impacts of these emission trends on O3 have not been well understood. Recent advancement in a retrieval method for the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensor enabled detection of lower tropospheric O3 and its legitimacy has been validated. In this study, we investigated the statistical significance for the OMI sensor to detect the lower tropospheric O3 responses to the future emission reduction of the O3 precursor gases over East Asia in summer, by utilizing a regional chemistry model. The emission reduction of 10, 25, 50, and 90% resulted in 4.4, 11, 23, and 53% decrease of the areal and monthly mean daytime simulated satellite-detectable O3 (ΔO3), respectively. The fractions of significant areas are 55, 84, 93, and 96% at a one-sided 95% confidence interval. Because of the recent advancement of satellite sensor technologies (e.g., TROPOMI), study on tropospheric photochemistry will be rapidly advanced in the near future. The current study proved the usefulness of such satellite analyses on the lower tropospheric O3 and its perturbations due to the precursor gas emission controls. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077066297

Based on Landsat8 remote sensing and building vector data, local climate zone (LCZ) method is employed to study the influences of urban form on land surface temperature (LST) of Xi'an. The results confirmed that the LST of the built-up LCZ is higher than the land cover LCZ. In built-up LCZ, LST is increasing with the increasing of building density. In land cover LCZ, the LST of bare land is the highest. Surface urban heat island (SUHI) of 14 samples in LCZ also been calculated. Highest SUHI intensity is found in low-rise buildings with high density area.

However, the enrichment of light Si isotopes in bulk enstatite chondrites is not easy to reconcile with the heavy Si isotopic composition of the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE). To investigate the origin of the light Si isotopic composition of enstatite chondrites, we have obtained in situ Si isotope data and simultaneously major- and trace element data in silicate and metal phases of chondrules, a metal-troilite spherule, and matrix from the enstatite chondrites Sahara 97072 (EH3) and Indarch (EH4) using laser ablation split stream-ICP-MS, which combines femto-second LA-MC-ICP-MS and Quadrupole-ICP-MS. Silicates in chondrules show variations in δ30Si (‰ variations of 30Si/28Si relative to NBS-28) ranges from −1.06 ± 0.13‰ (2 S.E.) to −0.38 ± 0.11‰. δ30Si in matrix silicates ranges from −0.96 ± 0.18‰ to −0.22 ± 0.12‰. The δ30Si-value of silicate phases varies independently of Mg/Si, ruling out simple equilibrium condensation from nebular gas. Some silicates in both enstatite chondrites have δ30Si-values like CI chondrites, whereas Si in other silicates is isotopically lighter, suggesting that the precursor materials of EH chondrites were already depleted in heavy Si isotopes. The metal phases in the matrix show average δ30Si of −6.0 ± 0.6‰. In spite of different metamorphic grades, the fractionation of Si isotopes between matrix metal and silicates in Sahara 97072 and Indarch shows no systematic differences, and thus no re-equilibration of Si isotopes occurred between silicates and metal at metamorphic temperatures below 900 K. The δ30Si-value of metal from a metal-troilite spherule from Sahara 97072 (−8.24 ± 0.12‰) is lower than that of matrix metals. These differences were likely inherited from different formation environments of matrix- and spherule metal. If metal formation occurred under equilibrium conditions, then matrix metal may have formed at higher temperatures than the MTS metal. or at similar temperatures but slightly lower oxygen fugacities, or the MTS metal equilibrated with gas or silicates which were not incorporated into EH chondrites because they were lost from the EH chondrite formation region. Alternatively, the differences in δ30Si of different metals could also reflect variable kinetic isotope fractionation during the formation of metal and exsolution of perryite. The considerably lower δ30Si-values of bulk EH chondrites compared to CI- and other chondrites partly reflects the presence of Si bearing metal and partly silicates with isotopically light Si. The latter indicate loss of a heavy Si-rich silicate component from the EH3 formation region, presumably together with refractory elements. Although the Si isotopic composition of bulk EH chondrites precludes that these represent major building material of the Earth, the combination of complementary heavy Si isotope- and refractory element-enriched reduced materials and carbonaceous or ordinary chondrites could provide a match for the heavy Si isotopic composition of Earth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Enstatite chondrites; LA-MC-ICP-MS; Sil-isotopes","enstatite chondrite; inductively coupled plasma method; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; silicate; silicon; trace element",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073262966

This CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) is highly regulated, responds to illumination/darkness cycles, and allows cyanobacteria to thrive under limiting Ci conditions. While the transcriptional control of CCM activity is well understood, less is known about how regulatory proteins might allosterically regulate Ci transporters in response to changing conditions. Cyanobacterial sodium-dependent bicarbonate transporters (SbtAs) are inhibited by PII-like regulatory proteins (SbtBs), with the inhibitory effect being modulated by adenylnucleotides. Here, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to show that SbtB from Cyanobium sp. PCC7001 (SbtB7001) binds AMP, ADP, cAMP, and ATP with micromolar-range affinities. X-ray crystal structures of apo and nucleotide-bound SbtB7001 revealed that while AMP, ADP, and cAMP have little effect on the SbtB7001 structure, binding of ATP stabilizes the otherwise flexible T-loop, and that the flexible C-terminal C-loop adopts several distinct conformations. We also show that ATP binding affinity is increased 10-fold in the presence of Ca2+, and we present an X-ray crystal structure of Ca2+ATP:SbtB7001 that shows how this metal ion facilitates additional stabilizing interactions with the apex of the T-loop. We propose that the Ca2+ATP-induced conformational change observed in SbtB7001 is important for allosteric regulation of SbtA activity by SbtB and is consistent with changing adenylnucleotide levels in illumination/darkness cycles.

We developed and utilized multi-objective numeric optimization models to analyze the trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES). The approach was used in the land-use planning process in northern Finland when selecting potential peat production sites as a part of the development of the regional master plan. We first quantified Net Present Value (NPV) of peat production, biodiversity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water emissions of peatlands. Then we applied multi-objective optimization to examine the trade-offs between the variables as well as to determine a cost-efficient selection of potential peat production sites, that is, a selection which would simultaneously generate the greatest possible economic returns and environmental benefits. Our results showed that with a relatively small decrease in NPV, a substantial decrease in biodiversity loss and a reduction in water emissions compared to the benchmark level could be attained. However, a significant decrease in GHG emissions resulted in a substantial decrease in NPV. We conclude that it is possible to significantly improve land-use management by applying multi-objective optimization in land-use planning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; GHG emissions; Multi-objective optimization; Peatlands; Water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073023688

However, only about 3% of their photon emission is channeled into the zero phonon line (ZPL), limiting both the rate of indistinguishable single photons and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of coherent spin-photon interfaces. We here report on the enhancement of the SNR of the optical spin read-out achieved by tuning the mode of a two-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) cavity into resonance with the NV-ZPL. PhC cavities are fabricated by focused ion beam milling in thin reactive ion etched ultrapure single crystal diamond membranes featuring modes with Q-factors of up to 8250 at mode volumes below one cubic wavelength. NV centers are produced in the cavities in a controlled fashion by a high resolution atomic force microscope implantation technique. On cavity resonance, we observe a lifetime shortening from 9.0 ns to 8.0 ns as well as an enhancement of the ZPL emission by almost one order of magnitude. Although on resonance the collection efficiency of ZPL photons and the spin-dependent fluorescence contrast are reduced, the SNR of the optical spin read-out is almost tripled for the cavity-coupled NV centers. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Atomic force microscopy; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Ground state; Ion beams; Photonic crystals; Photons; Q factor measurement; Resonance; Single crystals; Collection efficiency; Focused ion beam milling; Implantation technique; Nitrogen vacancies; Photonic crystal cavities; Single crystal diamond; Spin coherence time; Two-dimensional photonic crystals; Signal to noise ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076802396

Metagenomic analysis showed that the dominant bacterial genera shifted from Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas to Methylobacter and Methylocaldum due to the high concentration of methane. A high bacterial diversity was maintained, which may have contributed to the robust performance of the biowindow against environmental fluctuations.

Recent studies have shown that CO can be electrochemically transformed further to C2+ at high reaction rates, high C2+ selectivity and inherently improved electrolyte stability, raising the prospect of a two-step pathway to transform CO2.

Decarbonization is therefore one of the main challenges for the freight transport sector in Europe. Several measures are suggested to contribute to this goal, including clean vehicle technologies, optimising networks and modal shift. This paper focuses on the latter measure; specifically, we reveal the value of shift-share analysis as a method for assessing a freight modal shift’s contribution to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission reduction. The shift-share method is in fact a decomposition analysis that originated in the field of regional economics. However, it can also be applied in other fields, including transport economics. We have exploited this method’s broad applicability to develop a tool that can evaluate how rail and inland waterway transport perform in terms of their contributions to CO 2 emission reduction due to a modal shift. In demonstrating the tool, we analyse the market for freight transport that has the Netherlands as an origin, destination or both, thereby distinguishing between five distance markets. The goal of this paper is to present and show the value of the tool. The tool can provide policy makers with background information about the changes in CO 2 emissions of a freight transport modal shift that occurred in the past, which in turn can be helpful in devising future transport policies. A particular strength of the tool is that it can be used on any spatial scale - countries, regions, corridors, etc. In addition, the data requirements and computing complexity of the shift-share method is low. © 2019, The Author(s).","Assessment tool; CO 2 emission reduction; Inland freight transport; Modal shift; R40; R48; Shift-share analysis","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Commerce; Decarbonization; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Modal analysis; Regional planning; Assessment tool; CO2 emission reduction; Freight transport; Modal shifts; Shift-share analysis; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060734416

Although recent advancements in airborne remote sensing instruments enable retrievals of methane enhancements at an unprecedented resolution of 1-5m at regional scales, emission quantification of individual sources can be limited by the lack of knowledge of local wind speed. Here, we developed an algorithm that can estimate flux rates solely from mapped methane plumes, avoiding the need for ancillary information on wind speed. The algorithm was trained on synthetic measurements using large eddy simulations under a range of background wind speeds of 1-10ms-1 and source emission rates ranging from 10 to 1000 kg h-1. The surrogate measurements mimic plume mapping performed by the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) and provide an ensemble of 2-D snapshots of column methane enhancements at 5m spatial resolution. We make use of the integrated total methane enhancement in each plume, denoted as integrated methane enhancement (IME), and investigate how this IME relates to the actual methane flux rate. Our analysis shows that the IME corresponds to the flux rate nonlinearly and is strongly dependent on the background wind speed over the plume. We demonstrate that the plume width, defined based on the plume angular distribution around its main axis, provides information on the associated background wind speed. This allows us to invert source flux rate based solely on the IME and the plume shape itself. On average, the error estimate based on randomly generated plumes is approximately 30% for an individual estimate and less than 10% for an aggregation of 30 plumes. A validation against a natural gas controlled-release experiment agrees to within 32 %, supporting the basis for the applicability of this technique to quantifying point sources over large geographical areas in airborne field campaigns and future space-based observations. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

It relies on an original optical coupling scheme where the terahertz (THz) signal to be detected and the local oscillator (LO) signal are coupled to the HEB from both sides of the integrated lens/antenna mixer. The THz signal of interest impinges on the front side through the silicon lens while the LO onto the rear (air) side. This concept allows us to remove the beam splitter usually employed in terahertz heterodyne receivers. The mixer consists of a Niobium Nitride HEB with a log-spiral planar antenna mounted on the flat side of a hyperhemispherical silicon lens. The local oscillator of the heterodyne detector is a low power consumption and low beam divergence 3rd-order distributed feedback laser with single mode emission at the target frequency of 2.7 THz. The coupling between the QCL and the HEB has been further optimized, using a dielectric hollow waveguide that reliably increases the laser beam directivity and permits us to pump the HEB into its most sensitive state through the air side of the planar antenna.

We tested the hypothesis that nitrification failure can be correlated to shifts in the nitrifying microbial community. We monitored three parallel, full-scale sequencing batch reactors over the course of a year with respect to reactor performance, microbial community composition via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and functional gene abundance using qPCR. All reactors demonstrated similar changes to their core microbiome, and only subtle variations among seasonal and transient taxa. We observed a decrease in species richness during the winter, with a slow recovery of the activated sludge community during spring. Despite the change in nitrification performance, ammonia monooxygenase gene abundances remained constant throughout the year, as did the relative sequence abundance of Nitrosomonadacae. This suggests that nitrification failure at colder temperatures might result from different reaction kinetics of nitrifying taxa, or that other organisms with strong seasonal shifts in population abundance, e.g. an uncultured lineage of Saprospiraceae, affect plant performance in the winter. This research is a comprehensive analysis of the seasonal microbial community dynamics in triplicate full-scale sequencing batch reactors and ultimately strengthens our basic understanding of the microbial ecology of activated sludge communities by revealing seasonal succession patterns of individual taxa that correlate with nutrient removal efficiency. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"RNA 16S; genetics; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiology; microflora; Minnesota; nitrification; procedures; season; sewage; waste management; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Minnesota; Nitrification; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seasons; Sewage; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062915352

In the scope of this study, 55 publicly available GCPs were evaluated in order to assess their potential for traffic turnaround at a municipal level. All GCPs were analyzed to determine in which of the mentioned five to seven fields of action the respective city had planned measures and which fields of action were prioritized. A more in-depth qualitative analysis of the main topics: Electric mobility, public transport, and mobility concepts was carried out. To get a better understanding of the potential impact of the measures elaborated in the GCPs, complementary information on municipal fleet vehicle stocks, requirements of charging infrastructure for public buses and results of the European roadmap on mobility concepts are given. The evaluation of the GCPs showed that to this day, city administrations mainly optimize the current system by measures of electrification and digitization. Electrification of municipal fleets, car-sharing fleets, and public transport buses is in the focus of the strategies. Instruments to increase non-motorised transport, sustainable commercial transport, and/or mobility concepts are mentioned, but play a minor role. However, there still has been no system change in Germany. Therefore, a substantial turnaround of the transport system (""Verkehrswende"") is necessary.

Based on Beijing panel data for 1993-2012, an economic boom period in China, indirect carbon dioxide emissions were separately calculated for urban and rural households using the consumer lifestyle approach (CLA) model. Then, an extended stochastic impact by regression on population, a_uence, and technology (STIRPAT) model was used to analyze the influence from two aspects, social economy, and land use, with high precision. Results indicate that indirect CO2 emissions in Beijing households display a rising trend in urban areas but a slight decrease in rural areas. Technology influences and forest land are, respectively, the most important aspects of the social economy and land use. Higher population and urbanization resulted in enhanced emissions in both urban and rural areas. The Engel coeffcient presented a negative correlation with indirect CO2 emissions for both rural and urban areas. Compared with urban areas, the per capita net income of rural areas restrained consumption. The consumption structure of urban residents was more biased toward the tertiary industry than that of rural residents. Although technical progress has proceeded, it cannot offset urban residents' indirect CO2 emissions caused by the large amount and rapid growth of consumption. Regarding land use, urban construction land net primary productivity (NPP) was high and not an important factor contributing to indirect CO2 emissions. Forest and lawn primarily served a recreational function and exhibited a positive impact. Water and cultivated land o_ered insuffcient production and thus had a negative influence. For rural residents, lawn and cultivated land production is self-suffcient. Forests offer a carbon sequence effect, and construction land expansion increased the proportion of developed area, offering a scale effect that resulted in reduced carbon emissions. Based on the results, alternative carbon emission reduction policies have been proposed for each tested influence aspect to reduce emissions, including policies for optimizing industrialization quality, constructing a medium-density city, increasing space effciency, encouraging sustainable consumption behavior, and increasing the effciency of energy utilization. © 2019 by the authors.

A total of 12 surface sediment samples were collected from four sites, including an undisturbed central lake region (SMS) and three disturbed sites in fishery (NJS), industrial (RH) and tourism (BSZ) areas. Sediment physicochemical properties and heavy metal contents were combined with the results from Illumina Miseq and Biolog-Ecoplates to quantify the impact of environmental factors driving differences in sediment bacterial structure and microbial function. Our results showed that the bacterial community diversity (Shannon index) was higher in disturbed than in undisturbed areas, although the most predominant bacterial phyla in four studied sites were similar. However, the average well color development (AWCD) based on carbon source utilization pattern of the disturbed area was lower than undisturbed areas and the preference of carbon sources differed among the four studied areas. Site contaminants contributed to the distribution of distinct phyla which differentiated bacterial communities among sites. For example, the contents of TN (1.80 g/kg) and TOC (12.34 g/kg) in NJS showed positive correlation with the abundance of Deltaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi; while the concentration of TP (0.43 g/kg), Cu (69.22 mg/kg) and Zn (134.89 mg/kg) in RH was positively correlated with the predominance of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia. These results indicated that microbial community carbon metabolic profiles changed with the shift of bacterial community structure, and disturbance-induced pollution enhanced the sediment bacterial diversity and reduced carbon metabolic activity. © 2017, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Bacterial community; Illumina Miseq sequencing; Metabolic function; Poyang Lake; Sediment","anthropogenic effect; anthropogenic source; bacterium; functional role; heavy metal; lake ecosystem; microbial community; physicochemical property; sediment chemistry; species diversity; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Deltaproteobacteria; Firmicutes; Verrucomicrobia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018479929

Improved understanding of these changes and potential drivers may help foster strategies to sustain the pastoral system of this region. Using long-term climate, social-economic, and livestock (cattle, horses, sheep, and goats) population data from 1970 to 2010, we analyzed the dynamics of the livestock industry and main driving factors in the Xilinhot region-a central part of the Inner Mongolia Grassland. Our results show that the total livestock population increased dramatically in the past four decades, especially during 1987-2010. Livestock composition also changed substantially, with increasing sheep, goat, and cattle populations but a decreasing horse population. Pastoral population growth and land use policy were the primary drivers for livestock dynamics during 1970-2010.

The macroeconomic factors were output, industrial structure, energy intensity, and energy structure. The microeconomic factors were investment intensity, R&D intensity, and R&D efficiency. It was found that output, R&D intensity, and investment intensity were mainly responsible for the increase of the ERICE, and their average annual contribution rates were 33.212%, 9.537%, and 4.200%, respectively. However, considering the infeasibility of decelerating industrial activities related to these three drivers, the development pattern of a circular economy was promoted. Then, the driving effect of the energy structure was the weakest (0.017%). Nevertheless, the potential of energy structure optimization to improve energy efficiency in Jiangxi should be given sufficient attention, e.g., greatly reducing the use of coal. Inversely, the R&D efficiency, energy intensity, and industrial structure presented obvious mitigating effects on the ERICE (− 13.737%, − 11, 652%, and − 7.804%, respectively). Therefore, some regulatory policy instruments have been recommended. For example, carbon reduction liability and carbon labels related to R&D investment should be implemented to encourage industrial firms to improve their energy efficiency. Then, reducing the energy intensity unceasingly while inhibiting the possible rebound effect should serve as a long-term strategy for the local government. Last, the potential mitigation effect of industrial structure optimization should be given sufficient attention when designing related reduction policies. Particularly, the top five energy-intensive subsectors S33 (Production and Supply of Electric Power and Heat Power), S23 (Smelting and Pressing of Ferrous Metals), S17 (Processing of Petroleum, Coking, and Processing of Nuclear Fuel), S22 (Manufacture of Non-metallic Mineral Products), and S1 (Mining and Washing of Coal) should be given priority. © 2019, The Author(s).","Drivers; Energy efficiency; Energy-related industrial carbon emissions (ERICE); Jiangxi Province; Logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI); Macroeconomic; Microeconomic; Multi-scales","Carbon; Coking; Economics; Industrial emissions; Investments; Nuclear fuels; Processing; Structural optimization; Truck drivers; Carbon emissions; Divisia index; Jiangxi Province; Macroeconomic; Microeconomic; Multi-scales; Energy efficiency; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; industrial emission; industrial structure; input-output analysis; macroeconomics; microeconomics; policy analysis; regulatory framework; research and development; China; Jiangxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070781753

Plants of the Brassicales order constitutively allocate carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur to synthesize glucosinolates as their primary defense metabolites. Previous findings support a model in which steady-state levels of glucosinolates in intact tissues are determined by biosynthesis and turnover through a yet uncharacterized turnover pathway. To investigate glucosinolate turnover in the absence of tissue damage, we quantified exogenously applied allyl glucosinolate and endogenous glucosinolates under different nutrient conditions. Our data shows that, in seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia-0, glucosinolate biosynthesis and turnover are coordinated according to nutrient availability. Whereas exogenous carbon sources had general quantitative effects on glucosinolate accumulation, sulfur or nitrogen limitation resulted in distinct changes in glucosinolate profiles, indicating that these macronutrients provide different regulatory inputs. Raphanusamic acid, a breakdown product that can potentially be formed from all glucosinolate structures appears not to reflect in planta turnover rates, but instead correlates with increased accumulation of endogenous glucosinolates. Thus, raphanusamic acid could represent a metabolic checkpoint that allows glucosinolate-producing plants to measure the flux through the biosynthetic and/or turnover pathways and thereby to dynamically adjust glucosinolate accumulation in response to internal and external signals. © Copyright © 2019 Jeschke, Weber, Moore and Burow.","glucosinolate metabolism; metabolic regulation; nitrogen limitation; nutrient conditions; seedling development; sulphur limitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077283875

However, fundamental understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism and parameters determining the CO2RR performance is still missing. In this study, we have employed size-controlled (∼5 nm) Cu100-xZnx nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon to investigate the correlation between their structure and composition and catalytic performance. By tuning the concentration of Zn, a drastic increase in CH4 selectivity [∼70% Faradaic efficiency (F.E.)] could be achieved for Zn contents from 10 to 50, which was accompanied by a suppression of the H2 production. Samples containing a higher Zn concentration displayed significantly lower CH4 production and an abrupt switch in the selectivity to CO. Lack of metal leaching was observed based on quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy measurements revealed that the alloying of Cu atoms with Zn atoms takes place under reaction conditions and plays a determining role in the product selectivity. Time-dependent XAFS analysis showed that the local structure and chemical environment around the Cu atoms continuously evolve during CO2RR for several hours. In particular, cationic Zn species initially present were found to get reduced as the reaction proceeded, leading to the formation of a CuZn alloy (brass). The evolution of the Cu-Zn interaction with time during CO2RR was found to be responsible for the change in the selectivity from CH4 over Cu-ZnO NPs to CO over CuZn alloy NPs. This study highlights the importance of having access to in depth information on the interplay between the different atomic species in bimetallic NP electrocatalysts under operando reaction conditions in order to understand and ultimately tune their reactivity. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

There are lot of challenges in adopting EV in India with lack of supporting supply chain, manufacturing and infrastructure ecosystem. Four technology driven trends Electrification, Shared mobility, Connectivity and Autonomous driving are leading the automotive industry in India. This paper functionally designs an efficient electric vehicle telematics framework for smart transportation aiming at providing an EV- related advertisement via digital multimedia broadcasting. Taking advantage of information technology and wireless communication, the telematics system can support electric vehicle tracking, vehicle sharing, charging station selection and location data analysis. The electric vehicle charge service develops a reservation protocol between drivers and stations, charge station scheduling and path adaption according to a new charge plan. In addition, as a promising business model, electric vehicle sharing needs station placement and relocation schemes to which a previous pick up point analysis result van be a helpful guide.

Which types of factors are most effective at encouraging PEV adoption, and what magnitude of reduction in emissions could be achieved by expanding charging infrastructure as an influential factor on PEVs? To answer these questions, we developed a statistical model relating charging station infrastructure and other potential factors to PEV adoption rate in 58 California counties. We found that male buyers in households with fewer number of vehicles are more likely to purchase PEVs particularly in counties with more available public charging station per capita. Then we investigated the life-cycle petroleum use, emissions, and costs of light duty vehicles for a hypothetical scenario where existing public charging stations are expanded relative to total daily miles travelled in each county. We found under this scenario Modoc County experiences the largest reduction in life-cycle GHG emissions, by 0.035%, followed by Sierra and Mono counties. The smallest potential is found in counties with low response rate to expanded charging station infrastructure, led by Alpine, Del Norte, and King counties. For 20 counties, including Butte, San Joaquin, and San Francisco, the benefit-cost ratio is less than one, which means the investment and maintenance costs of new infrastructure have not been offset by operation and externality cost savings. For the rest of the counties, this scenario is found to be compatible.

Such integration requires public managers to prioritize ecosystem services as public values. However, the actual evidence for this prioritization remains scarce. To explore this evidence, we assessed officially documented election promises from 243 elected local government heads in the 2018 local elections in South Korea using qualitative content analysis. The study results showed that these government heads prioritized various ecosystem services as public values, including agricultural products and nature-based tourism. Ecosystem services management was even proposed to mitigate social issues, such as using forests to reduce particulate matter and the political tension between South and North Korea. Economic, cultural, and conservation values were associated with these ecosystem services, but economic values were the government heads’ main motivation to prioritize these services in the elections. Our findings demonstrate that ecosystem services have widely permeated the public-policy making process, but mainly in the form of market-based approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073153971

Therefore, quantifying the extent to which climate change may damage a hydrological system becomes crucial. This paper aims to evaluate the findings from previous research on projected impacts of climate change on hydrological systems located in regions bounded by the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. It intends to provide an in-depth understanding of the climatic conditions, applied approaches, climate change impacts on future streamflow, and measures to reduce prediction uncertainty in the tropics. The review revealed that there is a significant variation in the magnitude of climate change impacts on streamflow in the tropics. The reason for the inconsistent trend prediction is that projections are heavily dependent on the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, climate model structural differences, and uncertainty of downscaling methods and hydrological models. Therefore, to minimize the uncertainty and maximize confidence in streamflow projections, it is essential to apply multi-member model ensembles and to clarify the adaptation strategy (coping, adjusting, or transforming). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bias correction; Climate change projections; Downscaling method; Hydrological model; Model uncertainty; River discharge","Climate models; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrology; Rivers; Stream flow; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Bias correction; Climate change projections; Downscaling methods; Hydrological modeling; Model uncertainties; River discharge; Climate change; rain; climate change; climate effect; downscaling; error correction; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; river discharge; sampling bias; streamflow; tropical region; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental impact; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; hydrology; prediction; process model; Review; river; trend study; tropics; climate change; drought; environmental monitoring; flooding; hydrology; theoretical model; Climate Change; Droughts; Environmental Monitoring; Extreme Hot Weather; Floods; Hydrology; Models, Theoretical; Rain; Rivers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075061173

Despite being a commonly observed feature, the modification of the velocity structure in spectral line profiles by hyperfine structure complicates the interpretation of spectroscopic data. This is particularly true for observations of simple molecules such as CH and OH toward the inner Galaxy, which show a great deal of velocity crowding. Aims. In this paper, we investigate the influence of hyperfine splitting on complex spectral lines, with the aim of evaluating canonical abundances by decomposing their dependence on hyperfine structures. This is achieved from first principles through deconvolution. Methods. We present high spectral resolution observations of the rotational ground state transitions of CH near 2 THz seen in absorption toward the strong FIR-continuum sources AGAL010.62 - 00.384, AGAL034.258+00.154, AGAL327.293 - 00.579, AGAL330.954 - 00.182, AGAL332.826 - 00.549, AGAL351.581 - 00.352 and SgrB2(M). These were observed with the GREAT instrument on board SOFIA. The observed line profiles of CH were deconvolved from the imprint left by the lines' hyperfine structures using the Wiener filter deconvolution, an optimised kernel acting on direct deconvolution. Results. The quantitative analysis of the deconvolved spectra first entails the computation of CH column densities. Reliable N(CH) values are of importance owing to the status of CH as a powerful tracer for H2 in the diffuse regions of the interstellar medium. The N(OH)/N(CH) column density ratio is found to vary within an order of magnitude with values ranging from one to 10, for the individual sources that are located outside the Galactic centre. Using CH as a surrogate for H2, we determined the abundance of the OH molecule to be X(OH) = 1.09 × 10-7 with respect to H2. The radial distribution of CH column densities along the sightlines probed in this study, excluding SgrB2(M), showcase a dual peaked distribution peaking between 5 and 7 kpc. The similarity between the correspondingly derived column density profile of H2 with that of the CO-dark H2 gas traced by the cold neutral medium component of [CII] 158 μm emission across the Galactic plane, further emphasises the use of CH as a tracer for H2 © A.

These reactions can be performed at metallic surface sites on heterogeneous electrocatalysts or through redox mediation at molecular electrocatalysts. The relative ease of synthesis and characterization for homogeneous catalysts has allowed for molecular-level control over the active site and permitted systematic tuning of activity and selectivity. Similar control is difficult to achieve with heterogeneous electrocatalysts, because they typically exhibit a distribution of active site geometries and local electronic structures, which are challenging to modify with molecular precision. However, metallic heterogeneous electrocatalysts benefit from a continuum of electronic states that distribute the redox burden of multielectron transformations, enabling more efficient catalysis. We envisioned that we could combine the attractive properties of molecular and heterogeneous catalysts by integrating tunable molecular active sites into the delocalized band states of a conductive solid.The Surendranath group has developed a class of electrocatalysts in which molecules are strongly electronically coupled to graphitic electrodes through a conductive, aromatic pyrazine linkage such that they behave like metallic surface active sites. In this Account, we discuss the dual role of these graphite-conjugated catalysts (GCCs) as a platform with which to answer molecular-level questions of metallic active sites and as a tool with which to fundamentally alter the mechanism and enhance the performance of molecular active sites. We begin by describing the electrochemical and spectroscopic studies that demonstrated that GCC sites behave like metallic active sites rather than simply as redox mediators attached to electrode surfaces. We then discuss how electrochemical studies of a series of graphite-conjugated acids enabled the construction of a molecular model for the thermochemistry of proton-coupled electron transfer reactions at GCC sites based on the pKa of the molecular analogue of the conjugated site and the potential of zero free charge of the electrode. In the final section, we discuss the effects of graphite conjugation on the mechanism and rate of oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, and carbon dioxide reduction catalysis across four different GCC platforms involving N-heterocycle, organometallic, and metalloporphyrin active sites. We discuss how molecular-level tuning at graphite-conjugated active sites directly correlates to changes in catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. We demonstrate that graphite-conjugated porphyrins show enhanced catalytic oxygen reduction activity over amide-linked porphyrins. Lastly, we describe how catalysis at graphite-conjugated sites proceeds through mechanisms involving concerted electron transfer and substrate activation, in stark contrast to the mechanisms observed for molecular analogues. Overall, we showcase how GCCs provide a rich platform for controlling heterogeneous catalysis at the molecular level. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075173503

Future changes in SOC are, however, highly uncertain owing to its heterogeneity and complexity. In this study, we analyzed the outputs of simulations of SOC stock by Earth system models (ESMs), most of which are participants in the Land-Use Model Intercomparison Project. Using a common protocol and the same forcing data, the ESMs simulated SOC distribution patterns and their changes during historical (1850-2014) and future (2015-2100) periods. Total SOC stock increased in many simulations over the historical period (30 ± 67 Pg C) and under future climate and land-use conditions (48 ± 32 Pg C for ssp126 and 49 ± 58 Pg C for ssp370). Land-use experiments indicated that changes in SOC attributable to land-use scenarios were modest at the global scale, in comparison with climatic and rising CO2 impacts, but they were notable in several regions. Future net soil carbon sequestration rates estimated by the ESMs were roughly 0.4‰ yr-1 (0.6 Pg C yr-1). Although there were considerable inter-model differences, the rates are still remarkable in terms of their potential for mitigation of global warming. The disparate results among ESMs imply that key parameters that control processes such as SOC residence time need to be better constrained and that more comprehensive representation of land management impacts on soils remain critical for understanding the long-term potential of soils to sequester carbon. © 2020 The Author(s).

In Mexico the transport sector generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions, in 2014 it contributed with 31.3% of net emissions. Two original scenarios for the Mexican transport sector, a no-policy baseline scenario (BLS) and a low carbon scenario (LCS) were constructed. In the LCS were applied 21 GHG mitigation measures, which far exceeds the proposals for reducing transport sector GHG emissions that Mexico submitted in its National Determined Contributions (NDC). As a result, the proposed LCS describes a sector transformation path characterized by structural changes in freight and passenger mobility, new motor technologies for mobility, introduction of biofuels, price signals, transportation practices and regulations, as well as urban planning strategies, which altogether achieve an accumulated reduction of 3166 MtCO2e in a 25 year period, producing a global net benefit of 240,772 MUSD and a GHG emissions' reduction of 56% in 2035 in relation to the BLS. © 2019 by the authors.

Although companies have been requested to voluntarily evaluate their water risks and provide information thereon, the water quality risk in river basins is difficult to assess owing to insufficient monitoring information. This paper proposes the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology - Standardized Hydrology-based AssessmeNt tool for chemical Exposure Load (AIST-SHANEL) model as a river water quality simulation model that can be employed for chemical risk assessment and evaluation of the effects of use of a company's consumer products on river basins. AIST-SHANEL is the only unsteady analysis model that estimates spatial and temporal chemical concentrations and assesses water quality within river basins by point/non-point emission of chemical substances. To evaluate the efficacy of AIST-SHANEL, a case study focused on the surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), found in the detergents of widely used health care products, was conducted. The water risk assessment was performed in three Japanese river basins with different watershed characteristics: Tama River in urban Tokyo with high sewerage penetration rate, Nikko River in urban Nagoya with a low sewerage penetration rate, and the nonurban None River with no sewerage. In Tama River, the LAS river water concentrations were found to be strongly influenced by seasonal variations as well as the flow rate associated with dilution and temperature-induced biodegradation. Their concentrations in Nikko River were strongly affected by flooding, indicating that the influence on their transport through the drainage channel was due more to low sewage levels than temperature-induced biodegradation. In None River, the LAS river water concentrations were only slightly affected by dilution. The river sediment concentrations of LAS in the three river basins showed mild seasonal variations. The 95th percentile of river water concentrations, predicted environmental concentration (PEC), at the most downstream and maximum concentration grids in the three river basins were 4.5 and 51.2 mg/m3 for Tama River, 30 and 58.6 mg/m3 for Nikko River, and 0.15 mg/m3 for None River. Neither of the PECs nor maximum values at these grids exceeded the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of LAS (270 mg/m3), suggesting minimal ecological risk in these river basins over the year for all target river basins due to LAS. Furthermore, we analyzed a scenario in which LAS was substituted with the highly biodegradable alcohol ethoxylates (AE) for corporate self-management measures in Nikko River with only a few sewers, and therefore only a low risk. The AIST-SHANEL model has useful and widespread application with no need for monitoring by companies; as long as the relevant watershed characteristics can be obtained, water risk assessments of chemical substances can be performed for any river basin in the world. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon disclosure project (CDP) water program; Chemical substances; River water and sediment concentration; Spatial and temporal estimation; Unsteady analysis model; Water risk assessment","Alcohols; Biodegradation; Chemical analysis; Consumer products; Hydrochemistry; Industrial chemicals; Quality control; Risk perception; Rivers; Sewage; Sewers; Soaps (detergents); Social aspects; Sustainable development; Water quality; Watersheds; Carbon disclosure projects; Chemical substance; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology; Predicted environmental concentrations; Predicted no-effect concentrations; Sediment concentration; Unsteady analysis; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070875948

This is even more important when considering the stochastic nature of turbulence, which determines cycle-by-cycle variability specific for spark ignition (SI) engines. Within this context, combustion characterization was performed through in-cylinder pressure analysis and spectroscopy, in an optically accessible single cylinder direct injection (DI) SI engine. Gasoline, ethanol and their blend containing 20% alcohol were tested at 2000 rpm in WOT conditions; stoichiometric and lean burn cases (λ≅1.2) were considered. The optical signal recorded through a window fitted in the piston crown allowed detailed UV-visible spectroscopic characterization of three distinct phases: ignition (identified through the presence of the spark), flame development and the main combustion stage (related to high rates of heat release). CN (B-X) emission bands were used for identifying the initial stages of ignition and evaluate the gas temperature during spark discharge. Flame development was associated to the UV emission mainly due to OH (A-X) transitions. CO2∗ and OH represented the markers of the main combustion phase. Moreover, spectral features of soot precursors were detected and associated to the oxidation of fuel deposits. Optical results were also correlated to the particle emissions at the exhaust. Although the overall engine output was practically the same for both fuel types, less stable combustion was noted for the alcohol, given by higher coefficient of variation recorded for the indicated mean effective pressure. Incomplete fuel evaporation was identified as the main reason for the observed differences and the basis was set for evaluating the correlation between local air-fuel variation and optical parameters. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077849407

Building-up soil organic carbon (SOC) enhances soil fertility and efficient use of rainwater, which can increase drought tolerance in food production. SOC management demonstrates its benefit at various locations and is a promising means to achieve food security and climate mitigation at once. However, no global assessment of its potential and co-benefits gained from SOC enhancement has been presented. Here we evaluated the extent to which SOC build-up could reduce agricultural drought risk. Using statistical analysis of spatially-explicit global crop and soil datasets, we find that relatively small enhancement in topsoil (0–30 cm) organic carbon content (OCtop) could increase drought tolerance of the food production systems operating over 70% of the global harvested area (particularly drylands). By closing the gap between current and upper limit of tolerance levels through SOC addition of 4.87 GtC at the global scale, farmer’s economic output in drought years would increase by ~16%. This level of SOC increase has co-benefit of reducing global decadal mean temperature warming by 0.011 °C. Our findings highlight that progress towards multiple development goals can be leveraged by SOC enhancement in carbon (C)-poor soils in drier regions around the world. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077167480

We synthetize paleoecological data to explore the emergence and evolution of anthropogenic landscapes in southwestern Europe and northern Africa. Specifically, we estimate trends in vegetation and fire, and assess how changes in climate and resource exploitation altered ecosystem dynamics over the last 10,000 years. Pollen data reveal that a complex vegetation mosaic resulted from the conversion of forests into areas suitable for crops, especially after 7000 cal yr BP. Cross-scale analysis shows a progressive decoupling of climate and ecosystem trajectories, which displayed an overall south-to-north time-transgressive pattern consistent with models of population expansion. As human impact increased, so did the use of fire, and after 4000 cal yr BP, levels of biomass burning became homogeneous across the region. This region-wide rise in burning suggests that land-management overrode the effects of climate, fuel and topography. Thus, while increasing the returns and predictability of resources, rapidly-growing communities created a new form of frequent and extensive disturbance that led to profound and persistent changes in the landscape, including shrub encroachment, increased erosion and soil impoverishment. © 2019 by the authors.

Generally, integrated assessment models (IAMs) are used to estimate future GHG emissions considering both economic structure and final energy consumption. However, these models usually do not consider the entire supply chain, because of differences in the aims of application. In contrast, life cycle assessment (LCA) considers the entire supply chain but does not cover future environmental impacts. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the national carbon footprint projection in Japan based on life cycle thinking and IAMs, using the advantages of each. A future input–output table was developed using the Asia-Pacific integrated model (AIM)/computable general equilibrium (CGE) model (Japan) developed by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES). In this study, we collected the fundamental data using LCA databases and estimated future GHG emissions based on production-based and consumption-based approaches considering supply chains among industrial sectors. We targeted fiscal year (FY) 2030 because the Japanese government set a goal for GHG emissions in 2030 in its NDC report. Accordingly, we set three scenarios: FY2005 (business as usual (BAU)), FY2030 (BAU), and FY2030 (NDC). As a result, the carbon footprint (CFP) in FY2030 will be approximately 1097 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq), which is 28.5% lower than in FY2005. The main driver of this reduction is a shift in energy use, such as the introduction of renewable energy. According to the results, the CFP from the consumption side, fuel combustion in the use stage, transport and postal services, and electricity influence the total CFP, while results of the production side showed the CFP of the energy and material sectors, such as iron and steel and transport, will have an impact on the total CFP. Moreover, carbon productivity will gradually increase and FY2030 (NDC) carbon productivity will be higher than the other two cases. © 2019 by the authors.

Development of mechanisms that support the large-scale deployment of renewables towards global warming and climate change mitigation continues to remain an issue of utter importance. The most important challenges the energy system of Kosovo faces today is the difficulty to meet all the demand for electricity, low operating efficiency and high release of greenhouse gas emissions, but specifically a large source of carbon dioxide (CO2). Consequently, this influences not only the stability of the system but the society as a whole. This paper addresses several possibilities for designing an adaptable energy system in Kosovo with the ability to balance electricity supply and demand which will meet the requirements for a more efficient, reliable and secure system. A new way of energy generating through integration of new renewable and non-renewable technologies is developed using the EnergyPLAN model. The system is based on available technologies: existing hydro, wind, photovoltaic (PV), combined heat and power (CHP) and new solar thermal, heat pumps and biomass. The baseline scenario 2015 was expanded by four additional scenarios, two for the year 2030 and two for the year 2050. The contribution of renewable sources in the primary energy supply (PES) in the performed scenarios was 14.8%, 34.1%, 38.4%, 69.7% and 68.3% respectively. Further, a very important component of this paper is the investigation of integrating carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology in the coal-based power plant as part of the analysis in the second scenario for 2050. The shift to zero-carbon energy system in Kosovo requires additional research and assessment in order to identify the untapped potential of renewable sources. However, from the results obtained it can be concluded that the goal of a secure, competitive and sustainable energy system in Kosovo state which will meet its long-term energy needs can be certainly achieved. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Energy system analysis; Kosovo; Renewable energy share; Sustainable energy system","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Solar power generation; System stability; CO2 emissions; Energy system analysis; Kosovo; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy systems; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076681470

By integrating 3-D seismic, well log, core, and other measured data, this study analyzed the sedimentary characteristics and factors controlling the deposition of shallow-marine fans in Member #1 of the Huangliu Formation in the Yinggehai Basin. Four depositional elements were recognized in the channel-lobe complexes (CLCs), channel-fill sandy debrites, channel-fill turbidites, sand-rich lobe deposits and mud-rich lobe deposits. The channel-fill sandy debrites, which are characterized by low root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude in plan view and deep V-shaped reflections in seismic profile, are commonly located in the internal regions of CLCs. They have widths ranging from 1 to 2 km and single sandbody thicknesses exceeding 25 m. A cored interval from a channel-fill sandy debrite comprising several ungraded sand units revealed massive fine-grained sandstones with floating mud clasts and muddy rip-up clasts. In contrast, the channel-fill turbidites are characterized by low or high RMS amplitude in plan view and shallow V-shaped or vermiform-shaped reflections in profile. They have a small-size frontal splay at the terminus, thus forming a lobe-channel-lobe depositional style. The width of a channel-fill turbidite is usually less than 0.5 km, and the single sandbody thickness is no more than 20 m. A cored interval of channel-fill turbidite consisted of very fine-grained sandstones containing incomplete Bouma subdivisions Ta–Tb. The sand-rich and mud-rich lobe deposits are characterized by high RMS amplitude and low RMS amplitude with continuous sheet reflection patterns, respectively. The deposition of the shallow-marine fans was significantly influenced by sea-level fluctuations and paleogeomorphology. When sea level fell rapidly, gravity flows with higher erosive energy and velocity tended to form widely developed large-scale channel-fill sandy debrites and sand-rich lobe deposits. When sea level rose, small-scale channel-fill turbidites were dominant because of relatively decreased gravity flow energy. Distinct variations of reservoir characteristics, including mean grain size, mud content, and pore-throat radius, were controlled by sea-level fluctuations. From the period of rapid sea-level fall to the period of rising sea level, the gravity flows may have been increasingly diluted due to sufficient mixing with ambient seawater, resulting in a gradual transformation from sandy debris flows into turbidity currents. In addition, changes in gradient caused by irregular paleogeomorphology may have significantly triggered different depositional styles. With a steeper gradient, the CLC is dominated by a channelized-lobe depositional style; however, a lobe-channel-lobe depositional style prevails under a gentler gradient condition.

In this study, we examine the CO2 emissions embodied in the imports and exports of the Hong Kong special administrative region (SAR) from 1990 to 2015 using the emissions embodied in bilateral trade (EEBT) method. The results show that Hong Kong SAR has been a net CO2 importer and Mainland China plays a dominating role in the embodied CO2 emissions of Hong Kong SAR. The sectors with high imported CO2 emissions are mainly the energy sectors, such as electricity, heat, gas and water production and supply. Population density, GDP per capita, and trade openness have significantly positive effects on net CO2 emissions increases in Hong Kong SAR, with population density taking the leading role. Population density increases by 1%, total net CO2 emissions increase by 4%. Population slowdown scenario simulation results show that net CO2 emissions of Hong Kong SAR could be reduced by 5.5%. Whereas, net CO2 emissions of Hong Kong SAR could increase by 8.7% in the accelerated economic development scenario. Therefore, to reduce CO2 emissions, Hong Kong SAR need control its population, develop the circular economy, and promote green lifestyle and consumption patterns. © 2019","Embodied CO2 emissions; Hong Kong SAR; Input-output model; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Carbon emissions reductions; Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Consumption patterns; Hong kong special administrative regions; Hong-kong; Input output model; Urbanization; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070913885

It shows high faradic efficiency for CO, approximately 100%, along with long-term stability. The single-crystal to single-crystal transformation demonstrates that coordinated OH– can activate the linear CO2 into planar triangular HCO3 – in the ECR process. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.The activation of CO2 on the electrocatalyst surface is regarded as the rate-determining step in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR), and it is therefore highly important to find out its adsorption and activation mechanism. Herein, we develop the OH–-coordinated metal-organic framework (NNU-15) to simulate the surface state of catalyst in alkaline environment of ECR and then further explore its activation mechanism to CO2. NNU-15 shows high faradic efficiency for CO (FECO) reaching up to 99.2% at −0.6 V versus RHE along with long-term stability (110 h) and surpassing 96% over a wide potential range from −0.6 to −0.9 V. In the ECR process, single-crystal to single-crystal transformation between NNU-15 and NNU-15-CO2 demonstrates that coordinated OH– can activate the CO2 into HCO3 –, which will chelate to the metal center. Theoretical calculations validate that both O-adsorbed and C-adsorbed initial geometries are inclined to result in the formation of HCO3 – during the ECR process. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) is an effective method to convert CO2 into energy products by means of efficient electrocatalysts. In the ECR process, the first step requires a large reorganizational energy to adsorb and activate linear CO2 molecules, which is the most crucial step for ECR. A clear CO2 activation mechanism is extremely important for investigating the mechanism of different reduction products, and developing efficient target catalysts to improve the ECR performance. Herein, we design and report a stable OH–-coordinated metal-organic framework as catalyst model to investigate the CO2 activation mechanism in the ECR process. The capture of OH–-induced single-crystal to single-crystal transformation in ECR clearly expresses the dynamic structural evolution (CO2-HCO3 –) of CO2 in the electrocatalytic process, providing profound evidence to help disclose the CO2 activation mechanism. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","activation of CO2 into HCO3–; electrocatalytic CO2 reduction; hydroxyl MOF; MAP 2: Benchmark; single-crystal to single-crystal transformation","Chemical activation; Chromium compounds; Crystal lattices; Electrocatalysts; Linear transformations; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Single crystals; Surface states; Activation of CO2; CO2 reduction; Electrocatalytic process; hydroxyl MOF; Rate determining step; Reorganizational energy; Single crystal-to-single-crystal transformation; Theoretical calculations; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078469237

Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce N2O emissions. However, few have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems. In the current study, we investigate whether maize-soybean intercropping treatments could reduce N2O emission rates. Two differently configured maize-soybean intercropping treatments, 2:2 intercropping (two rows of maize and two rows of soybean, 2M2S) and 2:1 intercropping (two rows of maize and one row of soybean, 2M1S), and monocultured maize (M) and soybean (S) treatments were performed using a static chamber method. The results showed no distinct yield advantage for the intercropping systems. The total N2O production from the various treatments was 0.15 ± 0.04–113.85 ± 12.75 µg m−2 min−1. The cumulative N2O emission from the M treatment was 16.9 ± 2.3 kg ha−1 over the entire growing season (three and a half months), which was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than that of the 2M2S and 2M1S treatments by 36.6% and 32.2%, respectively. Two applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (as urea) at 240 kg N ha−1 each induced considerable soil N2O fluxes. Short-term N2O emissions (within one week after each of the two N applications) accounted for 74.4%–83.3% of the total emissions. Soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N were significantly correlated with soil N2O emissions (R2 = 0.246–0.365, n = 192, P &lt; 0.001). Soil nitrate (NO− )3 and moisture decreased in the intercropping treatments during the growing season.

The utilization of the Internet-of-Things and Edge-of-Things technologies presents a significant foundation for the development of smart cities where intelligent transportation system is one of the most important applications. Due to the obvious advantages of reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, electric vehicles are playing an increasingly important role in the intelligent transportation system. However, there is no shared framework for the interaction between electric vehicles and intelligent transportation system in smart cities. To handle this issue, this work proposes a practical framework to collect trajectory data of electric vehicles via edge devices and use a novel modified dynamic time warping method to analyze drivers’ preference. The analysis based on real data shows that a certain percentage of electric vehicle drivers have driving preference. That is, they tend to go through specific routes or locations during commuting. Furthermore, a few simulation experiments are conducted to compare the system performance between the time-of-use and load-of-use pricing strategies of the charging stations. The results demonstrate that the load-of-use pricing strategy can effectively divert the traffic flow and balance the load differences between different charging stations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Driving preference; Edge device; Intelligent transportation system; Modified dynamic time warping; Pricing strategy; Smart city","Computer aided software engineering; Costs; Electric automobiles; Energy utilization; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Population statistics; Power markets; Driving preference; Dynamic time warping; Edge device; Intelligent transportation systems; Pricing strategy; Smart city",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068998254

Without specific information on the temporal variation in NH3 emissions, a simplified temporal variation in NH3 emissions is often used in chemical transport models. To better characterize NH3 emissions in an air quality model simulation for Taiwan, a dynamical NH3 emissions parameterization was applied to improve the temporal profile of NH3 emissions from livestock operations, synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, and standing crops. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling simulation with a fixed NH3 emissions rate (the CONST experiment) presents a large positive bias in simulated nitrate and NH3, particularly during the nighttime and winter months. On the other hand, the CMAQ simulation with a dynamical NH3 emissions approach (the DYN experiment) improves the diurnal and seasonal variations and reduces the simulated bias. Moreover, according to the Taiwan emissions inventory, NH3 emissions from sewage accounts for a large portion (37%) of total NH3 emissions in Taiwan.

As agriculture is a large sector in Benin, the climate change-induced crop yield losses are expected to affect the entire economy as well as household welfare in both rural and urban areas. The paper applies a dynamic general equilibrium model and simulates productivity shocks in the agricultural sector derived from climate change scenarios for Benin. The findings show that climate change-induced crop yield losses reduce domestic agricultural outputs by 4.4% and the nonagricultural output by 0.9% on average by 2025. While export supply decrease by 25.5%, import demand increases by 4.9% on average by 2025. As price of labour and capital decline, household income drop for all household groups by 2.5% on average. Ultimately, household welfare decline for all household groups by 2.7% on average. Rural and particularly poor households are projected to experience the worst adverse effects of climate change-induced crop yield losses. The results show that without adaptive strategies to cope with climate change, economic growth and household welfare will decline even further by 2035 and 2045. Subsequently, the paper suggests that adaptation strategies are needed not only at the national level to overcome the projected negative effects on macroeconomic indicators, but also at household level to enhance the adaptative capacity of households, especially the poor households living in rural areas. © 2019 by the authors.","Benin; Climate change; Dynamic computable general equilibrium; Economic effects; Food crop yield losses; Household welfare","adaptive management; agricultural economics; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; economic impact; general equilibrium analysis; household income; welfare impact; Benin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076548414

Full details of the commercial ships including the type of ships, their speed and geographic location are available using satellites and global positioning system (GPS). The proposed method has fewer challenges and limitations than existing mechanisms such as wireless sensor networks. In the proposed technique, the produced noise of spinning propellers (in cavitation or non-cavitation mode) plays the role of pings in active sonars. The noise is continuously released from the propeller and is reflected from the underwater targets. The recurrent echo is continuously received by the towable hydrophone array. The geographic location of this array is available at any moment. Using the existing localization algorithms, position of target is determined. So this idea uses the existing signals in the environment for target localization.

In this paper, we propose an improved, spectrally efficient new discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-Spread Windowing and Restructuring (WR)-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-Spread WR-OFDM) communications system, in thought of various strengths of high-power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearity for a reasonably allowable peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and out-of-band (OOB) power emission reduction. Compensation for HPA nonlinearity becomes a difficult task when properly designing efficient multicarrier schemes and fifth generation (5G)- beyond 5G candidate waveforms for cellular wireless communications systems. In practical communications systems, spectral efficiency and power are highly affected by HPA nonlinearity features, and bit error rate (BER) performance also deteriorates. We implemented a time domain window named Tukey (tapered cosine) and localized subcarrier mapping, and the impact of HPA nonlinearity on BER performance and spectral characteristics is comprehensively analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system reduces PAPR and OOB power emissions by 3.176 dB and -81 dB, respectively. Additionally, compared to conventional systems, the communication quality of the proposed scheme clearly demonstrates better performance even in HPA nonlinear environments. © 2020 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers.

Drawing on Hajer's approach to discourse and different qualitative methods, we analyse the production of different low-carbon storylines. Our findings show that state and industrial actors accommodate environmentally damaging oil shale production in low-carbon energy transformation, despite good conditions for expanding renewable energy. Additionally, they limit their ambition to transform mere technological modifications to the minimum requirements of the EU GHG emission reduction target. The socio-economic conditions of workers and people living near oil shale mining areas, primarily Estonian Russians, are a critical factor in upholding oil shale as a necessity. Despite being at the centre of dominant storylines, these people are portrayed as a category that needs to be kept at ease, rather than actively engaged in constructing acceptable sustainable routes to low-carbon futures. We conclude that in order to accelerate the decarbonisation in Estonia and beyond, and unleashing the transformative potential of EU energy policy, it is vital to make marginalised voices heard and engaged in energy policy decision-making. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Decarbonisation; Discourse; Estonia; Low-carbon economy; Oil shale","Behavioral research; Carbon; Climate change; Decarbonization; Decision making; Economics; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Oil shale; Renewable energy resources; Decarbonisation; Discourse; Estonia; Low carbon economy; Low carbon energies; Minimum requirements; Socio-economic conditions; Technological modifications; Energy policy; alternative energy; climate change; decision making; energy planning; energy policy; European Union; future prospect; policy approach; sustainability; technological development; Estonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074355642

One important component of this heat transport is the movement of warm water from equatorial regions toward the poles, with colder water flowing in return. Here, we introduce a framework relating meridional heat transport to the diabatic processes of surface forcing and turbulent mixing that move heat across temperature classes. Applied to a (1/4)° global ocean model the framework highlights the role of the tropical Indo-Pacific in the global ocean heat transport. A large fraction of the northward heat transport in the Atlantic is ultimately sourced from heat uptake in the eastern tropical Pacific. Turbulent mixing moves heat from the warm, shallow Indo-Pacific circulation to the cold deeper-reaching Atlantic circulation.

The 5×106-year time frame is interesting for a range of paleo-environmental questions, not least because it encompasses the evolution of humans. However, the choice of time frame was primarily pragmatic; tectonic changes can be neglected to first order, so that it is reasonable to consider climate forcing restricted to the Earth's orbital configuration, ice-sheet state, and the concentration of atmosphere CO2. The approach uses the Gaussian process emulation of the singular value decomposition of ensembles of the intermediate-complexity atmosphere-ocean GCM (general circulation model) PLASIM-GENIE. Spatial fields of bioclimatic variables of surface air temperature (warmest and coolest seasons) and precipitation (wettest and driest seasons) are emulated at 1000-year intervals, driven by time series of scalar boundary-condition forcing (CO2, orbit, and ice volume) and assuming the climate is in quasi-equilibrium.

Here, we show that stringent mitigation strategies consistent with the 1.5 ∘C scenario could, indeed, provoke a critical difference for the ocean’s carbon cycle and calcium carbonate saturation states. Favorable conditions for calcifying organisms like tropical corals and polar pteropods, both of major importance for large ecosystems, can only be maintained if CO2 emissions fall rapidly between 2025 and 2050, potentially requiring an early deployment of CO2 removal techniques in addition to drastic emissions reduction.

Combined exposure of ketamine and radiation at doses that alone did not affect learning and memory induced permanent cognitive impairment in mice. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism behind this adverse outcome. Neonatal male NMRI mice were administered ketamine (7.5 mg kg-1) and irradiated (whole-body, 100 mGy or 200 mGy,137Cs) one hour after ketamine exposure on postnatal day 10. The control mice were injected with saline and sham-irradiated. The hippocampi were analyzed using label-free proteomics, immunoblotting, and Golgi staining of CA1 neurons six months after treatment. Mice co-exposed to ketamine and low-dose radiation showed alterations in hippocampal proteins related to neuronal shaping and synaptic plasticity. The expression of brainderived neurotrophic factor, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein, and postsynaptic density protein 95 were significantly altered only after the combined treatment (100 mGy or 200 mGy combined with ketamine, respectively). Increased numbers of basal dendrites and branching were observed only after the co-exposure, thereby constituting a possible reason for the displayed alterations in behavior. These data suggest that the risk of radiation-induced neurotoxic effects in the pediatric population may be underestimated if based only on the radiation dose. © 2019 by the authors.

With a global population estimate of < 120,000, Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) is considered one of the Nearctic-Neotropical migrants at greatest risk of extinction. This range-restricted songbird breeds in high-elevation fir (Abies balsamea) forests of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, and primarily overwinters in forests of the Dominican Republic. The Conservation Action Plan for Bicknell’s Thrush identifies numerous actions that may help stem population declines and promote recovery of the species, yet the empirical data needed to prioritize among these actions are lacking. We fit Cormack-Jolly-Seber models with mark-recapture data to test a series of hypotheses about the factors that limit apparent survival in 178 adult Bicknell’'s Thrush (50 females and 128 males) captured on the breeding grounds in Vermont (June-July, 2001-2015). We focused on putatively important factors from throughout their annual cycle: cyclical population dynamics of nest predators, and weather effects on food abundance on the breeding and wintering grounds. Apparent survival of Bicknell’s Thrush was relatively stable (mean Φ = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.68) over our 15-year study, and most strongly associated with fir mast production. Apparent survival was higher following years during which fir trees produced large mast crops (mean Φ = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.79), compared to following nonmast years (Φ = 0.56 ± 0.06, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.68). These results are likely driven by the reduced red squirrel density and increased nesting success and site fidelity of adult thrushes following nonmast years. Apparent survival of Bicknell’s Thrush was also associated with relatively wet conditions on the wintering grounds in Hispaniola as assessed via the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) precipitation index (ESPI). These relatively wet December-March periods are likely linked to greater primary productivity and the local availability of fruits and arthropods consumed by Bicknell’s Thrush. Our research provides the most comprehensive examination of potentially limiting factors on Bicknell’s Thrush populations to date and suggests future avenues of research exploring the relationship between food availability, survival, and climate change induced reductions in rainfall for the Greater Antilles. © 2019 by the author(s).","Bicknell's Thrush; Catharus bicknelli; Climate interaction; El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); ENSO precipitation index (ESPI); Food limitation; Interspecific competition; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Population limitation; Resource pulse; Tamiasciurus hudsonicus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077877720

This includes impacts on ecosystem functioning that can involve feedbacks on climate through changes in rates of greenhouse gas emissions. The combination of high nutrient supply and shallow depth typical of urban freshwaters is particularly conducive to high rates of methane (CH4) production and emission, suggesting a potentially important role in the global CH4 cycle. However, there is a lack of comprehensive flux data from diverse urban water bodies, of information on the underlying drivers, and of estimates for whole cities. Based on measurements over four seasons in a total of 32 water bodies in the city of Berlin, Germany, we calculate the total CH4 emission from various types of surface waters of a large city in temperate climate at 2.6 ± 1.7 Gg CH4/year. The average total emission was 219 ± 490 mg CH4 m−2 day−1. Water chemical variables were surprisingly poor predictors of total CH4 emissions, and proxies of productivity and oxygen conditions had low explanatory power as well, suggesting a complex combination of factors governing CH4 fluxes from urban surface waters. However, small water bodies (area &lt;1 ha) typically located in urban green spaces were identified as emission hotspots. These results help constrain assessments of CH4 emissions from freshwaters in the world's growing cities, facilitating extrapolation of urban emissions to large areas, including at the global scale. © 2019 The Authors.

Warming has also an effect on the hydrological cycle through the precipitation intensity. Consequently, the supposed changes in the distribution and amount of precipitation with the continuously increasing temperature may induce a higher rate in water consumption of the plants, thus the adaptation of the plants to the climate change can be critical. The hydrological impact of climate change was studied based on typical environmental conditions of a specific agricultural area in Austria. For this purpose, (1) a monthly step, Thornthwaite-type water balance model was established and (2) the components of the water balance were projected for the 21st century, both (a) with a basic rooting depth condition (present state) and (b) with a (hypothetically) extended rooting depth (in order to evaluate potential adaption strategies of the plants to the warming). To achieve the main objectives, focus was set on calibrating and validating the model using local reference data. A key parameter of the applied model was the water storage capacity of the soil (SOILMAX), represented in terms of a maximum rooting depth. The latter was assessed and modified considering available data of evapotranspiration and soil physical properties. The adapted model was utilized for projections on the basis of four bias corrected Regional Climate Models. An extended rooting depth as a potential adaptation strategy for effects of climate change was also simulated by increasing SOILMAX. The basic simulation results indicated increasing evapotranspiration and soil moisture annual mean values, but decreasing minimum soil moisture for the 21st century. Seasonal examination, however, revealed that a decrease in soil moisture may occur in the growing season towards to the end of the 21st century. The simulations suggest that the vegetation of the chosen agricultural field may successfully adapt to the water scarcity by growing their roots to the possibly maximum. © 2019 András Herceg et al., published by Sciendo 2019.","Plant available water; Regional Climate Model; Water balance; Weighing lysimeter","Climate models; Cultivation; Digital storage; Evapotranspiration; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Water management; Water supply; Available water; Environmental conditions; Increasing temperatures; Precipitation intensity; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate models; Water balance; Water storage capacity; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; evapotranspiration; humid environment; hydrological cycle; precipitation (climatology); prediction; regional climate; soil moisture; water availability; water budget; water storage; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076294466

The removal of heavy metals by Chara subspinosa from the water was tested in single- and multi-metal additions. The uptake capacity of C. subspinosa decreased during the course of the experiment and was higher in single-metal addition than in multi-metal addition of Pb2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+. Accumulation of heavy metals in the carbonate encrustation of charophytes was far lower than those to which they were exposed. Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn co-precipitated more in the encrustation of C. subspinosa exposed to single-metal approach than to multi-metal approach. The carbonate composition of charophytes was influenced by the water chemistry. Content of Na in the carbonate encrustation correlated with the Na+ concentration of the respective water. The toxic effect of heavy metals on photosynthesis was species-specific. Electron transport rates (ETRmax) were higher in Chara tomentosa than in C. subspinosa.

To develop a solution that induces neither the transfer of nitrogen pollution nor decreases agricultural production, we specifically investigated the last step of the denitrification pathway, the N2O reduction path, in soils. We first observed that this path is mainly driven by soil pH and is progressively inhibited when pH is lower than 6.8. During field experiments, we observed that liming acidic soils to neutrality made N2O reduction more efficient and decreased soil N2O emissions. As we estimated acidic fertilized soils to represent 37% [27–50%] of French soils, we calculated that liming could potentially decrease France’s total N2O emissions by 15.7% [8.3–21.2%]. Nevertheless, due to the different possible other impacts of liming, we currently recommend that the deployment of this solution to mitigate N2O emission should be based on local studies that take into account agronomic, environmental and economic aspects. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077329569

Along with the temperature increase, modifications in the humidity and wind regime amplify the regional and local impacts on livestock husbandry. Direct impacts include the occurrence of climatic stress conditions. In Europe, cows are economically highly relevant and are mainly kept in naturally ventilated buildings that are most susceptible to climate change. The high-yielding cows are particularly vulnerable to heat stress. Modifications in housing management are the main measures taken to improve the ability of livestock to cope with these conditions. Measures are typically taken in direct reaction to uncomfortable conditions instead of in anticipation of a long-term risk for climatic stress. Measures that balance welfare, environmental and economic issues are barely investigated in the context of climate change and are thus almost not available for commercial farms. Quantitative analysis of the climate change impacts on animal welfare and linked economic and environmental factors is rare. Therefore, we used a numerical modeling approach to estimate the future heat stress risk in such dairy cattle husbandry systems. The indoor climate was monitored inside three reference barns in central Europe and the Mediterranean regions. An artificial neuronal network (ANN) was trained to relate the outdoor weather conditions provided by official meteorological weather stations to the measured indoor microclimate. Subsequently, this ANN model was driven by an ensemble of regional climate model projections with three different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. For the evaluation of the heat stress risk, we considered the number and duration of heat stress events. Based on the changes in the heat stress events, various economic and environmental impacts were estimated. The impacts of the projected increase in heat stress risk varied among the barns due to different locations and designs as well as the anticipated climate change (considering different climate models and future greenhouse gas concentrations). There was an overall increasing trend in number and duration of heat stress events. At the end of the century, the number of annual stress events can be expected to increase by up to 2000, while the average duration of the events increases by up to 22 h compared to the end of the last century. This implies strong impacts on economics, environment and animal welfare and an urgent need for mid-term adaptation strategies. We anticipated that up to one-tenth of all hours of a year, correspondingly one-third of all days, will be classified as critical heat stress conditions. Due to heat stress, milk yield may decrease by about 2.8 % relative to the present European milk yield, and farmers may expect financial losses in the summer season of about 5.4 % of their monthly income. In addition, an increasing demand for emission reduction measures must be expected, as an emission increase of about 16 Gg of ammonia and 0.1 Gg of methane per year can be expected under the anticipated heat stress conditions. The cattle respiration rate increases by up to 60 %, and the standing time may be prolonged by 1 h. This causes health issues and increases the probability of medical treatments.

By conducting sensitivity tests, tree-ring process-based cambial growth models can provide an innovative way to better understand wood formation under different climate change scenarios. As a case study in semi-arid north central China, we used artificially increased or decreased daily climatic data as input to the Vaganov-Shashkin dynamic growth model to investigate the response of wood formation to climatic change. By calibrating the tree-ring model using daily climate data over the period 1951–2010, we found that 81% of radial growth was driven by soil moisture, while 13% of growth was controlled by temperature. During the main growing season June–August, significant differences in the integral growth rate occurred after changing precipitation by ± 30% or by decreasing temperature by 3.0 °C (p < 0.05). However, increasing temperature showed only modest effects on tree radial growth rate. During the past 60 years, a significant advancement of the starting dates of growth was detected, whereby non-significant variability was found for the ending dates of growth. Contemporaneously, the effect of previous winter temperature (previous December to current January) on cambial growth initiation declined after 1980. Significant differences in the growth onset dates only occurred when temperature was reduced by 4.5 °C or increased by 5.5 °C. Moreover, both the onset and ending dates of growth in the study region were more sensitive to cooling rather than to warming. If temperature will increase by 2°C and precipitation will increase by 30% at the end of this century as predicted by some Earth system models, tree radial growth might increase by 19% in the study region, compared to the average during the period 1952–2010. Consequently, tree stem radial growth is expected to increase under a warming and wetting climatic scenario, but will decrease under drying conditions. © 2019","Climate change; Forest ecosystems; Process-based model; Sensitivity test; Tree-ring width series; Xylogenesis","climate change; climate modeling; cooling; forest ecosystem; global warming; growing season; growth; growth modeling; growth rate; precipitation (climatology); semiarid region; sensitivity analysis; simulation; tree ring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072036111

L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of promising means, although its signal is saturated at 75-150 Mg ha-1 of AGB, making it difficult to monitor high biomass forest. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/Phased Array L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2) conducts ScanSAR mode observations that cover the whole tropical region about nine times a year. We investigated whether such time-series data is effective in overcoming the signal saturation issue. In Borneo, we adopted a spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)-derived AGB data for training and validation data, then developed an AGB estimation model using the Random Forest algorithm. As a result, we improved the saturation issue, and estimated the AGB up to 280 Mg ha-1 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 62.8 Mg ha-1. Such an AGB range covers 83% of Borneo's forests. The developed model was applied to create an AGB map of Borneo with a 250-m resolution as of 2016. Total AGB of Borneo was calculated at 12.8 Gt with an average of 173.3 Mg ha-1. This article showed the PALSAR-2 time-series data to be highly useful in the AGB mapping of high carbon stock forests. However, we needed to correct the difference in observation years between GLAS and PALSAR-2 using a simple biomass growth model, but the accuracy will be improved by using future LiDAR and SAR sensors. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Aboveground biomass (AGB); borneo L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR); signal saturation","Aneroid altimeters; Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Decision trees; Mean square error; Optical radar; Radar imaging; Radio altimeters; Random forests; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Aboveground biomass; Advanced land observing satellites; Climate change mitigation; L-band synthetic aperture radars; Light detection and ranging; Random forest algorithm; Root mean square errors; Signal saturation; Mapping; aboveground biomass; ALOS; carbon cycle; climate change; mapping; PALSAR; synthetic aperture radar; time series; Borneo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079358624

The neutrinos are produced by the decay of charged pions originating in ultrarelativistic protons that are accelerated there. In the standard theory of tidal disruption events (TDEs), there are four distinct phases from the debris circularization of stellar debris to super- and sub-Eddington to radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). In addition, we consider the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state in both the super-Eddington accretion and RIAF phases. We find that there are three promising cases to produce neutrino emissions: the super-Eddington accretion phase of the MAD state and the RIAF phases of both the non-MAD and MAD states. In the super-Eddington MAD state, the enhanced magnetic field makes it possible to accelerate the protons to with the other given appropriate parameters. The neutrino energy is then at the peak of the energy spectrum. For M bh ⪆ 107.7 M o, the neutrino light curve is proportional to, while it follows the standard decay rate for Mbh&lt;107.7M⊙. In both cases, the large luminosity and characteristic light curves diagnose the super-Eddington MAD state in TDEs. In the RIAF phase of the non-MAD state, we find and, and its light curve is proportional to . This indicates that one can identify whether the existing RIAFs are the TDE origin or not.

In this study, injection of flue gas into permafrost gas hydrates reservoirs has been studied in order to evaluate its use in energy recovery and CO2 sequestration based on the premise that it could significantly lower costs relative to other technologies available today. We have carried out a series of real-time scale experiments under realistic conditions at temperatures between 261.2 and 284.2 K and at optimum pressures defined in our previous work, in order to characterize the kinetics of the process and evaluate efficiency. Results show that the kinetics of methane release from methane hydrate and CO2 extracted from flue gas strongly depend on hydrate reservoir temperatures. The experiment at 261.2 K yielded a capture of 81.9% CO2 present in the injected flue gas, and an increase in the CH4 concentration in the gas phase up to 60.7 mol%, 93.3 mol%, and 98.2 mol% at optimum pressures, after depressurizing the system to dissociate CH4 hydrate and after depressurizing the system to CO2 hydrate dissociation point, respectively. This is significantly better than the maximum efficiency reported in the literature for both CO2 sequestration and methane recovery using flue gas injection, demonstrating the economic feasibility of direct injection flue gas into hydrate reservoirs in permafrost for methane recovery and geological capture and storage of CO2. Finally, the thermal stability of stored CO2 was investigated by heating the system and it is concluded that presence of N2 in the injection gas provides another safety factor for the stored CO2 in case of temperature change. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074684142

This devastating situation for livestock production is even becoming worse under the present climate change scenario. Strategies focused to breed animals with better thermo-tolerance and climatic resilience are keenly sought these days to mitigate impacts of heat stress especially in high input livestock production systems. The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) are a protein family known for its potential role in thermo-tolerance and widely considered as cellular thermometers. HSP70 function as molecular chaperons and have major roles in cellular thermotolerance, apoptosis, immune-modulation and heat stress. Expression of HSP70 is controlled by various factors such as, intracellular pH, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP), protein kinase C and intracellular free calcium, etc. Over expression of HSP70 has been observed under oxidative stress leading to scavenging of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and protection of pulmonary endothelial barrier against bacterial toxins. Polymorphisms in flanking and promoter regions in HSP70 gene have shown association with heat tolerance, weaning weight, milk production, fertility and disease susceptibility in livestock. This review provides insight into pivotal roles of HSP70 which make it an ideal candidate genetic marker for selection of animals with better climate resilience, immune response and superior performance. © 2019 Chinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine","Heat stress; HSP70; Immunity; Livestock; Molecular chaperons; Thermo-tolerance","autoantibody; bacterial toxin; chaperone; cyclic AMP; endocrine disruptor; glucocorticoid receptor; heat shock protein 70; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; Mycobacterium vaccine; protein kinase C; reactive oxygen metabolite; antibody production; apoptosis; autoimmune disease; bovine tuberculosis; calcium cell level; cell pH; cell protection; climate change; climate resilience; DNA flanking region; genetic linkage; genetic marker; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; growth rate; heat shock; heat stress; heat tolerance; human; immunomodulation; inflammation; livestock; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; nucleic acid base substitution; oxidative stress; paratuberculosis; promoter region; Review; steroid release; temperature acclimatization; temperature stress",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075458852

The resulting smoke plumes are carried west over the Atlantic Ocean at altitudes between 2 and 4 km. As only limited observational data in West Africa have existed until now, whether this pollution has an impact at lower altitudes has remained unclear. The Dynamics-aerosol-chemistry-cloud interactions in West Africa (DACCIWA) aircraft campaign took place in southern West Africa during June and July 2016, with the aim of observing gas and aerosol properties in the region in order to assess anthropogenic and other influences on the atmosphere. Results presented here show that a significant mass of aged accumulation mode aerosol was present in the southern West African monsoon layer, over both the ocean and the continent. A median dry aerosol concentration of 6.2 μg m-3 (standard temperature and pressure, STP) was observed over the Atlantic Ocean upwind of the major cities, with an interquartile range from 5.3 to 8.0 μg m-3. This concentration increased to a median of 11.1 μg m-3 (8.6 to 15.7 μg m-3) in the immediate outflow from cities. In the continental air mass away from the cities, the median aerosol loading was 7.5 μg m-3 (5.9 to 10.5 μg m-3). The accumulation mode aerosol population over land displayed similar chemical properties to the upstream population, which implies that upstream aerosol is a significant source of aerosol pollution over the continent. The upstream aerosol is found to have most likely originated from central and southern African biomass burning. This demonstrates that biomass burning plumes are being advected northwards, after being entrained into the monsoon layer over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. It is shown observationally for the first time that they contribute up to 80 % to the regional aerosol loading in the monsoon layer over southern West Africa. Results from the COSMO-ART (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling - Aerosol and Reactive Trace gases) and GEOS-Chem models support this conclusion, showing that observed aerosol concentrations over the northern Atlantic Ocean can only be reproduced when the contribution of transported biomass burning aerosol is taken into account. As a result, the large and growing emissions from the coastal cities are overlaid on an already substantial aerosol background. Simulations using COSMO-ART show that cloud droplet number concentrations can increase by up to 27 % as a result of transported biomass burning aerosol. On a regional scale this renders cloud properties and precipitation less sensitive to future increases in anthropogenic emissions. In addition, such high background loadings will lead to greater pollution exposure for the large and growing population in southern West Africa. These results emphasise the importance of including aerosol from across country borders in the development of air pollution policies and interventions in regions such as West Africa. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; COSMOS; monsoon; pollution monitoring; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Atlantic Ocean; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068538849

Here we report a dramatic decline in the abundance and diversity of Coleoptera (beetle) taxa in a large tract of intact northern hardwood forest during the last 45 years, and provide evidence supporting winter warming as the primary cause. Beetles were sampled using the same method (window traps) and in the same locations within the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, in 1973–1977 and again in 2015–2017. The mean (±SE) number of beetles captured per 48-h fell from 23.2 (±3.89) to 3.9 (±1.19), a decline of 83% over this 45-year period. The number of beetle taxa captured decreased by 39%, with 19 beetle families disappearing entirely. Beetle capture rate was least when and where climate was warmest. Capture rate was significantly lower in the 2010s when mean daily temperature was about 1.8 °C warmer, and sampling during 2016–2017 at low, mid and high elevations (320, 540, and 810 m asl, respectively) revealed lowest beetle captures at low elevation where climate was warmest. Most importantly, beetle capture rate was significantly lower after winters with less snow cover during the previous winter, indicating that snow cover in northern hardwood forest is essential for sustaining the beetle community. These results imply that additional climate warming might further reduce the abundance and diversity of beetles and other arthropods inhabiting the forest-floor, potentially affecting critical ecosystem processes such as decomposition and carbon storage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coleoptera; Forest-floor; Hubbard Brook; Insect decline; Temperate deciduous forest","beetle; captan; capture method; climate change; deciduous forest; decomposition analysis; ecosystem approach; forest floor; population decline; snow cover; temperate forest; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest; New Hampshire; United States; Arthropoda; Coleoptera; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074284161

An increase in carbon dioxide [CO2], higher temperatures, and regional changes in tropospheric ozone [O3] will influence the growth responses of existing crop species and varieties. Ozone is phytotoxic and a plant stressor at current concentrations, reducing yields worldwide, but possible interactions with changes in other abiotic factors have been considered very little. In this study, we have used eight combinations: two levels of temperature, two levels of [CO2], and three [O3] exposure regimes to assess the impact of medium-to-high ozone concentrations (80–100 ppb) on wheat growth when other abiotic factors change. Two modern spring wheat varieties (KWS Bittern and Lennox) and a landrace variety (Lantvete) were grown to maturity in climate chambers. We examined plant performance during growth as development rate, rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use, and at harvest as total aboveground dry matter and grain yield. All three varieties lost yield in all treatments compared to the ambient treatment that had the following settings: Lowest temperature, ambient [CO2], and very low [O3]. For episodic ozone exposure in the ambient or high [CO2] and high-level temperature treatment, the yield losses were 18 and 25%, respectively, for KWS Bittern; 44 and 34% for Lennox; and 16 and 37% for Lantvete. The yields of the modern varieties are significantly higher than the landrace variety in two out of eight treatments, although they are higher by weight in seven of the eight treatments. The landrace variety's fraction loss from its highest grain yield in the ambient treatment to the high-[CO2]-and high-level-temperature-treatments was smaller than the modern varieties’, showing a comparably higher degree of plasticity of performance. Current crop varieties might be more sensitive to ozone than older varieties, emphasizing the need of future breeding programs to expand the gene pool to provide more climate robust crops. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Climate change; Ecophysiology; Multifactorial design; Ozone episodes","air temperature; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate conditions; crop production; crop yield; dry matter; ecophysiology; environmental factor; episodic event; experimental design; growth rate; growth response; ozone; phytotoxicity; pollution exposure; stomatal conductance; water use; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071559556

Examining the spatial and temporal variability of CM is important for understanding its sources and transport, evaluating its environmental impacts, and designing mitigation strategies. CM was computed at 195 collocated U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) PM10 and PM2.5 Federal Reference Method (FRM) sites from 2000 through 2016. These data were integrated with remote/rural CM data at 155 sites from the IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) network to create a continental-scale dataset of daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual mean CM concentrations, as well as regionally aggregated data. Annual mean average continental United States (CONUS) urban CM concentrations were twice that of rural CM concentrations (10.5 μg m−3 versus 4.9 μg m−3, respectively) for 2012–2016. The highest CM concentrations occurred in the Southwest in spring, the central United States in summer and fall, and southern California nearly year-round. The lowest CM concentrations occurred in the Intermountain West, northwestern United States, and regions in the East. While urban CM concentrations were higher, CONUS average urban and rural CM/PM10 fractions were similar, with an annual mean fraction of 0.5. However, many regions, especially across the West, experienced much higher fractions (&gt;0.7) depending on season. Regional mean CM weekly cycles with lower weekend concentrations were observed at both urban and rural sites throughout most of the country, indicating anthropogenic influence. Trend analyses suggest spring and summer mean CM has increased significantly at some remote and urban sites over the 2000–2016 period, especially at sites in the central and eastern United States. However, CONUS annual mean urban CM has decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) at a rate of −1.8% yr−1 compared to an insignificant increase of 0.5% yr−1 at rural sites. Urban and rural relative contributions of CM to PM10 have increased since 2000 due to the strong reductions of PM2.5 mass. Understanding CM seasonal and temporal variability, composition, and sources is increasingly important in order to develop effective mitigation strategies for managing its environmental and climate impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol trends; Coarse aerosol mass; IMPROVE; Particulate matter; Remote aerosols; Urban aerosols","Aerosols; Aggregates; Environmental impact; Environmental Protection Agency; Coarse aerosols; IMPROVE; Interagency monitoring of protected visual environments; Northwestern United States; Particulate Matter; Spatial and temporal variability; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Urban aerosols; Urban growth; aerosol; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); long-term change; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollutant transport; rural area; seasonal variation; spatial variation; urban site; aerosol; article; California; climate; controlled study; environmental impact; environmental protection; particulate matter; spring; summer; California; Intermountain West; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072779191

Sablefish recruitment is related to large-scale climate forcing indexed by regionally correlated sea level (SL) and zooplankton communities that pelagic young-of-the-year sablefish feed upon. This study forecasts trends in future sablefish productivity using SL from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and explores the robustness of harvest control rules (HCRs) to climate driven changes in recruitment using management strategy evaluation (MSE). Future sablefish recruitment is likely to be similar to historical recruitment but may be less variable. Most GCMs suggest that decadal SL trends result in recruitments persisting at lower levels through about 2040 followed by higher levels that are more favorable for sablefish recruitment through 2060. Although this MSE suggests that spawning biomass and catches will decline, and then stabilize, into the future under both HCRs, the sablefish stock does not fall below the stock size that leads to fishery closures. © 2019 Published by International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

The scope and scale of understanding avian use of these wetlands in conjunction with changes in climate are daunting yet critical to address lest we lose continent-wide migratory pathways. Here, we assess changes in waterbird use of North America’s Pacific Flyway in the Great Basin by examining water availability and climate trends over the past 100 years. We found recent (1980–2015) climate warming has significantly reduced the amount and shifted seasonality of water flowing into wetlands. Further, we found remarkable changes in waterbird species composition over time. We propose that a reduced hydroperiod and lower water quality from reduction in water level and flow limits sites used by waterbirds. These factors reduce chick survivorship as they cannot metabolize saline water, which makes suitable freshwater conditions a limiting resource. Collectively, climate-induced changes in Great Basin wetlands suggest a major shift in freshwater ecosystems, resulting in degradation of a continental migratory route. This work illustrates the importance of examining multi-scale changes in critical regional resources to understand their impact across a hemispheric flyway and provides a model to examine other flyways. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062972669

The study, conducted for a Northern high latitude location, investigates several parameters related to building types, their density, floor area as well as ratio of specific building types to the total built area. Several methods are employed in the investigation, including energy simulations, statistical methods, optimization and decision making. A selection method of single optimal neighborhood scenario, based on the analysis of seasonal average hourly load is proposed. The results show that an optimal commercial to built land area ranges between 22% and 32%, with the remaining area dedicated to residential buildings. Multiple combinations of residential buildings that enhance energy performance while reducing GHG emissions are formed by 50% of detached houses and 50% of combined townhouses and apartment units (with different ratios). On the commercial side, near optimal combinations of commercial buildings area is constituted by 46–75% offices, 18–45% retails, and 6–9% supermarkets. Optimizing the hourly energy load profile, a scenario combining commercial land area of 25% with equal composition of office and retail buildings (47.5%), to residential area consisting of equal proportion of single detached and townhouses (48% each) can be selected. © 2019",,"Decision making; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; Mixtures; Office buildings; Commercial building; Energy performance; Environmental performance; Optimal neighborhoods; Optimization and decision makings; Optimization techniques; Residential areas; Residential building; Housing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073234944

The aim of this study is to assess and compare Sentinel-1 C-band, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band and combined C/L-band SAR-based land cover mapping over a large tropical area in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The overall approach is to benefit from multi-temporal observations acquired from 2015 to 2017 to extract statistical parameters and seasonality of backscatters to improve forest land cover (FLC) classification. We investigate whether and to what extent the denser time series of C- band SAR can compensate for the L-band's deeper vegetation penetration depth and known better FLC mapping performance. The supervised classification differentiates into forest, inundated forest, woody savannah, dry and wet grassland, and river swamps. Several feature combinations of statistical parameters from both, single and multi-frequency observations in a multivariate maximum-likelihood classification are compared. The FLC maps are reclassified into forest, savannah, and grassland (FSG) and validated with a systematic sampling grid of manual interpretations of very-high-resolution optical satellite data. Using the temporal variability of the dual-polarized backscatters, in the form of either wet/dry seasonal averages or using the statistical variance, in addition to the average backscatter, increased the classification accuracies by 4-5 percent points and 1-2 percent points for C- and L-band, respectively. For the FSG validation overall accuracies of 84.4%, 89.1%, and 90.0% were achieved for single frequency C- and L-band, and C/L-band combined, respectively. The resulting forest/non-forest (FNF) maps with accuracies of 90.3%, 92.2%, and 93.3%, respectively, are then compared to the Landsat-based Global Forest Change program's and JAXA's ALOS-1/2 based global FNF maps. © 2019 by the authors.","ALOS PALSAR; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Land cover; MLC; REDD/MRV; SAR; Sentinel-1; Tropical forest","Backscattering; Deforestation; Mapping; Maximum likelihood; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; ALOS PALSAR; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Land cover; REDD/MRV; Sentinel-1; Tropical forest; Space-based radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077904790

This study mainly analysed Lxx localization and its effects on sugarcane leaf. Methods and Results: Badila were inocultated by bacteria of Lxx. It was noted that the number of Lxx cells were rapidly enriched in sugarcane leaves from the 150th to the 210th days of post inoculation (dpi). Lxx infection disrupted the integrity of vascular bundle sheath cells (BSC) in the ‘Kranz anatomy’ of leaves, resulting in irregular accumulation of starch in vascular BSC of leaves. In situ PCR showed that the Lxx localized in the xylem vessels, mesophyll cell (MC) and BSC as described before in sugarcane leaf, a new niche within the host tissues in the phloem of sugarcane stem. The gene expression and activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) and NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) enzymes were lower in Lxx-inoculated sugarcane plants as compared to the MI group. Conclusion: Lxx infection not only disrupted the structure of vascular BSC in the C4 ‘Kranz anatomy’ of sugarcane leaves, but also affected the activities and gene expression of the key enzymes PEPC, PPDK and NADP-ME in the C4 cycle of sugarcane suggesting a reduction in CO2 fixation. Significance and Impact of the Study: The effect of Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli (Lxx) infection on the photosynthetic physiology of sugarcane is currently limited to the evaluation of photosynthetic parameters.

As each provincial region has different energy structures and technology levels, their mercury emission profiles may have heterogeneity, thus requiring targeted regional control polices. Therefore, this study investigates the provincial energy-related mercury emissions and identifies their underlying socioeconomic factors during 2007–2012, by combining structural decomposition analysis (SDA) with the multi-regional input-output analysis (MRIO). Results show that the rising consumption per capita and decreasing emission factor are the largest contributors to emission growth and decline, respectively. However, their contributions vary significantly across regions. The rising consumption per capita leads to nearly 20 t emission increase in Shandong and Jiangsu, but less than 1 t in Qinghai. The decreasing emission factor's negative effect on mercury emission reduction is extremely important in Jiangsu, Shandong and Guangdong, but not so obvious in most western provinces. Energy efficiency is another critical contributor to mercury reduction in all provinces except Guizhou, as the coal consumption in Guizhou nearly doubled during 2007–2010. Moreover, production structure and consumption structure have opposite effects during 2007–2010 and 2010–2012: they first drive energy-related mercury emissions growing in most provinces, then inhibit the emissions especially in Shandong and Guangdong. These findings point to targeted mercury mitigation strategies (for example: improving energy efficiency in Guizhou and Liaoning, optimizing economic structure in Henan and Sichuan) for each province. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Driving factors; Mercury emissions; Regional disparities; SDA-MRIO","coal; hot water; mercury; decomposition analysis; economic structure; emission; energy efficiency; government; input-output analysis; mercury (element); socioeconomic impact; Article; China; driver; electricity; energy; human; socioeconomics; socioeconomics; China; China; Mercury; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072530524

Implementing effective policies and measures to promote carbon emissions reduction is of great importance. This study deploys the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to explore carbon emissions and CO2 sources from aluminium manufacturing in China as well as a scenario analysis to evaluate the reduction potential and driving forces of carbon emissions in the industry. The evaluated scenarios include a new capacity allocation scheme, technological progress and energy structure optimization. The carbon emissions from the aluminium chain are mostly contributed by indirect emissions (more than 68%) from electricity generation. Significant regional discrepancies are observed in the total emissions and intensity, and a reasonable industry layout tends to transfer to the south and southwest areas from the perspective of the environmental pillar. Production output remains the dominant factors associated with total carbon emissions from manufacturing firms, such as the aluminium industry. Technological progress and the energy structure contribute to total reductions and carbon efficiency, although the former has a relatively limited scope for aluminium firms. This paper also shows that marginal carbon efficiency improvements are not very effective in lowering the total CO2 emissions under the context of high output growth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminium; Carbon emissions; LCA; Reduction potential; Scenario analysis","Aluminum; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Manufacture; Structural optimization; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon reduction potentials; High energy consumption; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Reduction potential; Scenario analysis; Technological progress; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070841162

The results indicate that the annual mean mass concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and CO all decreased year by year during 2015–2017. However, the annual mean NO2 concentrations were almost unchanged, while the annual mean O3 concentrations increased year by year. Anthropogenic factors were mainly responsible for the variations of air quality. Further analysis suggested that PM2.5 and PM10 were the main factors influencing air quality, while NO2 played an important role in the formation of PM2.5 and O3. These findings can provide a theoretical basis for the formulation of future air-pollution control policy in China. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074109524

A series of biological gas production experiments were carried out using bituminous coal D and indigenous bacteria from the Qianqiu coal mine, with the addition of NaHCO3 to simulate CO2 sequestration in coal seams, to explore the feasibility of biomethanation of CO2 sequestered in coal seams. Changes in the characteristics of both the gas and liquid phases during the fermentation process were studied. The results showed that the methane production follows a low-high-low trend with an increase in the bicarbonate concentration. During the fermentation process, the pH and chemical oxygen demand (COD) values of the fermentation solution initially increased and later decreased. In the early stage of the fermentation experiment, the microorganisms mainly degraded the ethers; the alcohols were degraded in the later stage. Identification of the microbial community structure showed that although bicarbonate inhibits the growth of some microorganisms, it increases the hydrolysis capacity of the fermentation process and also enriches the hydrogenotrophic methanogens associated with the bioconversion process of CO2 to CH4. This indicates that the composition of the archaea in the fermentation solution transforms to support the bioconversion of CO2 to CH4. The results show that the CO2 sequestered in the coal seams can be converted into CH4 by indigenous bacteria, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the re-leakage risk of CO2 and also produce clean energy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to comply with the new standards, the most impactful parameters are subject to important revisions. Airtightness is revealed as an impacting parameter on air conditioning energy demand for nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB). Currently the Passivhaus standard, taken as a constructive reference for nZEB in Europe, establishes 0.6 ACH as the maximum infiltration at 50 Pa for all new buildings irrespective of the climate zone.

L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were established as cover crops and compared to the traditional fall-winter fallow between two irrigated cash crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). The global warming potential (GWP) balance included direct and indirect (nitrous oxide (N2O) resulting from the deposition of ammonia (NH3) or from leached nitrate (NO3 −)) soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and albedo, and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) emissions from inputs, irrigation and farm operations. Several scenarios involving i) changes in the termination method of the cover crops, ii) consideration of the application of a distinct nitrogen (N) source (urea, slurry or manure instead of ammonium nitrate) or nitrification inhibitors, iii) employing the same N rate for all treatments (i.e., conventional instead of integrated fertilization), iv) modelling SOC accumulation over a 100-year horizon, and v) using default emission factors, were also analysed. Under the conditions of our experiment, cover crops mitigated yield-scaled emissions by 77.4% (barley) and 91.9% (vetch). Synthetic N fertilization (particularly the industrial production of fertilizer) contributed 38% to the balance of the cover cropping treatments, followed by SOC (22.5%), irrigation (14.7%) and albedo (14.5%). All scenarios led to notable mitigation efficacies, ranging from 39% mitigation (in barley when considering default or non-specific emission factors) to a net CO2eq sink (i.e., &gt;100% mitigation) in the scenario consisting of the replacement of ammonium nitrate by urea or organic fertilizers although with side effects on NH3 volatilization and/or yields. Based on these results, the combined use of cover cropping and integrated soil fertility management could lead to the design of C-neutral irrigated cropping systems in semi-arid regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Carbon sequestration; Catch crop; Conservation agriculture; Green manure; Life cycle assessment","Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Crops; Gas emissions; Global warming; Grain (agricultural product); Irrigation; Life cycle; Manures; Metabolism; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soils; Solar radiation; Urea; Urea fertilizers; Carbon sequestration; Catch crops; Conservation agricultures; Green manures; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071940817

Regional air quality varies significantly due to intensive inter-provincial trades, diversified resource endowments and complicated economic structures. This study breaks the limitations of measuring environmental inequality only from a single perspective and establishes a three-perspective atmospheric pollutant equivalents accounting model (or APE accounting model) for air-pollution inequality assessment under environmentally-extend multi-regional input-output framework. From three perspectives of local production (i.e. production-based), final demand (i.e. consumption-based) and primary supply (i.e. income-based), APE emissions, APE transfers and environmental Gini coefficient are investigated to exam emission responsibilities of various impact factors, evaluate the impacts of inter-provincial trades on pollutants transfers, and characterize regional emission inequalities at both provincial and sectoral levels. The results indicate that local emitters are merely parts of contributors to air pollution. Direct emitters like Hebei Province, primary suppliers like Inner Mongolia and final consumers like Shandong Province induce large amounts of air pollutants as embedded within various economic activities. Because of unequal supply-demand levels and complex exchange mechanisms, three-perspective APE emissions are significantly heterogeneous, especially in mining, construction, energy and material-transformation sectors. Particularly, inequality of the mining sector in embodied emissions has the highest environmental Gini coefficient (0.881). This model provides a framework to assess regional environmental inequality and its findings provide scientific bases for the formulation of desired regional air pollution control policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric pollutant equivalents; China; Environmental inequality assessment; Multi-regional input-output model; Three-perspective accounting","Air quality; Commerce; Atmospheric pollutants; China; Economic activities; Environmental inequality assessment; Input output model; Material transformation; Regional air pollution; Regional air quality; Air pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; economic activity; emission; environmental assessment; input-output analysis; pollution monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution control; article; consumer; human; Inner Mongolia; mining; responsibility; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071053047

Some novel factors (e.g., private car ownership, urban travel structure, and income level) were chosen and added to the LMDI model. The combination of the LMDI and SD models might provide a new pathway for policymakers to cope with such sophisticated issues. The results showed that: (1) GDP per capita is the main positive driving force for CO2 emission growth, followed by population, average income level per capita, and car ownership per capita. Energy intensity is the main factor for carbon mitigation, followed by economic structure, residential energy intensity, and emission coefficient. (2) The additive effect of different scenarios is essential for emission control. (3) CO2 emissions and emission per capita would peak by 2025 at the level of 218.20 Mt and 8.83 t per capita, respectively.

At the same time, SAI technologies have deeply uncertain economic and environmental impacts and complex ethical, legal, political, and international relations ramifications. Robust governance strategies are needed to manage the many potential benefits, risks, and uncertainties related to SAI. This perspective reviews the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC)’s guidelines for emerging risk governance (ERG) as an approach for responsible consideration of SAI, given the IRGC’s experience in governing other more conventional risks. We examine how the five steps of the IRGC’s ERG guidelines would address the complex, uncertain, and ambiguous risks presented by SAI. Diverse risks are identified in Step 1, scenarios to amplify or dissipate the risks are identified in Step 2, and applicable risk management options identified in Step 3. Steps 4 and 5 involve implementation and review by risk managers within an established organization.

Identifying spatial analogs is usually a step preceding the analysis of local climate impacts and adaptation actions in regions already experiencing a plausible future climate for the target. Such methodology involves several important technical choices. For instance, climates must be synthesized, for example as distributions of a few study-specific annual indices calculated from daily temperature and precipitation time series, before a metric is used to rank candidate analogs in terms of similarity with the target. Moreover, simulations used as target plausible future climates must often be bias-corrected, raising the issue of the order of operations between indices calculation and bias correction (BC). This study investigates the impact of the order of operations on the subsequent identification of analogs, by considering three approaches: BC after (the calculation of the indices); BC before; and BC both before and after. The study, part of a broader project related to agricultural pest management, considers five farms as the targets, which are located in southern Quebec, Canada. Target climate scenarios are built from an ensemble of twenty CMIP5 simulations. The reference product, used for both synthesizing recent-past analog climates and bias-correcting simulations, is the MERRA reanalysis. Results led to the formulation of recommendations for climate services centres providing users with spatial analogs, including the recourse to the self-analog test, proposed as a verification procedure to potentially reveal methodological deficiencies. © 2019 The Author(s)","Agro-climatic application; Bias correction; Climate indices; Spatial analogs","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; CMIP; spatial analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072751894

Some coastal habitats are experiencing increases in organic runoff, which when coupled with a loss of vegetated coastline can accelerate reductions in seawater pH. Marine larvae that hatch in coastal habitats may not have the ability to respond to elevated temperature and changes in seawater pH. This study examined the response of Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) larvae to elevated temperature (30°C control and 32°C treatment) and CO2-induced reductions in pH (8.05 pH control and 7.80 pH treatment). We determined whether those singular and simultaneous stressors affect larval vertical movement at two developmental stages. Geotactic responses varied between larval stages. The direction and rate of the vertical displacement of larvae were dependent on pH rather than temperature. Stage III larvae swam upwards under ambient pH conditions, but swam downwards at a faster rate under reduced pH. There was no observable change in the directional movement of Stage V larvae. The reversal in orientation by Stage III larvae may limit larval transport in habitats that experience reduced pH and could pose challenges for the northward dispersal of stone crabs as coastal temperatures warm. © 2019 The Authors.

It resembles the cel operon of Streptococcus pyogenes, which is implicated in the metabolism of cellobiose. However, genBA mutants grew normally on cellobiose, but not (genA) or only slowly (genB) on gentiobiose and amygdalin. The two glucosides were also found to be the main inducers of the operon, confirming that the encoded proteins are involved in the utilization of β-1,6- rather than β-1,4-linked oligosaccharides. Expression of the genBA operon is regulated by the transcriptional activator GenR, which is encoded by the gene upstream from genB. Thermal shift analysis showed that it binds gentiobiose-6′-P with a Kd of 0.04 mM and with lower affinity also other phospho-sugars. The GenR/gentiobiose-6′-P complex binds to the promoter region upstream from genB. The genBA promoter region contains a cre box and gel-shift experiments demonstrated that the operon is under negative control of the global carbon catabolite regulator CcpA. We also show that the orphan EIIC (GenB) protein needs the EIIA component of the putative OG1RF_10750-OG1RF_10755 operon situated elsewhere on the chromosome to form a functional PTS transporter. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"amygdalin; beta 1,4 oligosaccharide; beta 1,6 oligosaccharide; gentiobiose; oligosaccharide; sugar; unclassified drug; 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase; bacterial protein; cellobiose; disaccharide; glucosidase; glucoside; oligosaccharide; phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase; phosphotransferase; repressor protein; transcription factor; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; carbohydrate transport; chromosome; controlled study; Enterococcus faecalis; genA gene; genB gene; gene expression; gene locus; gene repression; genR gene; in vivo study; nonhuman; operon; priority journal; promoter region; stop codon; thermal analysis; thermal shift analysis; transcriptomics; Enterococcus faecalis; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Bacterial Proteins; Cellobiose; Disaccharides; Enterococcus faecalis; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Glucosidases; Glucosides; Oligosaccharides; Operon; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System; Phosphotransferases; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Repressor Proteins; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074113824

The value of these services represents a basis for political decision-making. To be sure that these decisions are made on a valid basis, policymakers require an understanding of the biophysical processes involved. This study was carried out around two forest reserves (Alibori-Supérieur and Ouénou-Bénou) in Northern Benin. It aimed to highlight the knowledge of the surrounding communities and their perceptions about the importance of the ecosystem services provided by these forest reserves as well as the factors that influence their knowledge and perceptions. Methods: Primary data were collected from 25 group discussions in 25 villages surrounding the forest reserves based on predefined ecosystems services of the Millennium Ecosystems Assessment (MA). Multiple linear regression models were used to examine how socio-economic characteristics of the communities influenced the ecosystem services identification rate. Perceptions of importance, levels of satisfaction, and trends of services provided were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Our results showed that education level, poverty index, household size, and proximity to forests played an important role in the variation in knowledge of ecosystem services (P < 0.05). Provisioning services (such as crops supply, fuelwood, lumber, wild food, and medicinal plants) were mostly identified by the poorest villages located very close to the forests (P < 0.05). The importance of the provided services for well-being has been unanimously recognized. The most recognized cultural services were education and knowledge facilitation (84%) and spiritual value (76%). Climate regulation (84%) and pollination (84%) were the best-known regulating services. However, supporting services (soil formation and pest regulation) that are important for improving production systems were unknown to the communities. Conclusion: Education level, poverty index, and village proximity to the forest were important predictors of regulating and supporting services identification. But use of non-tangible services by local rural communities will require more emphasis on targeted environmental education specifically designed according to the needs of each group. © 2019 The Author(s).","Benin; Ecosystem services; Local community; Local perceptions; Targeted conservation education","Benin; ecology; education; educational status; environmental protection; family size; forest; human; knowledge; poverty; Benin; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Educational Status; Family Characteristics; Forests; Humans; Knowledge; Poverty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075932969

Previous ice-core studies in Antarctica show little climate dependence of marine biogenic sulphur emissions and hence primary productivity, contradictory to marine sediment records. Here we present new 720,000-year ice core records from Dome Fuji in East Antarctica and show that a large portion of non-sea-salt sulphate, which was traditionally used as a proxy for marine biogenic sulphate, likely originates from terrestrial dust during glacials.

However, land carbon feedbacks are often quantified using a two-parameter description, with separate cumulative carbon uptake responses to surface warming, γL in petagram of carbon per kelvin, and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, βL in petagram of carbon per parts per million. Converting the γL and βL responses to an overall terrestrial carbon feedback parameter, λcarbon in watt per square meter per kelvin, has remained problematic, with λcarbon affected by significant nonlinear interactions between carbon-climate and carbon-concentration responses and a nonlinear relation between atmospheric CO2 and subsequent radiative forcing. This study presents new relationships quantifying how the overall steady state terrestrial carbon feedback to anthropogenic emission, λcarbon, is dependent on the terrestrial carbon responses to rising CO2 and temperature, βL, and γL, and the physical climate feedback, λclimate. Nonlinear interactions between βL and γL responses to carbon emission are quantified via a three-parameter description of the land carbon sensitivities to rising CO2 and temperature. Numerical vegetation model output supports the new relationships, revealing an emerging sensitivity of land carbon feedback to climate feedback of ∂λcarbon/∂λclimate ~ 0.3. The results highlight that terrestrial carbon feedback and physical climate feedback cannot be considered in isolation: Additional surface warming from stronger climate feedback is automatically compounded by reduced cooling from terrestrial carbon feedback, meanwhile around half the uncertainty in terrestrial carbon feedback originates from uncertainty in the physical climate feedback. ©2019.

But are current plans consistent with the international climate change goals laid out in the Paris Agreement? In this paper, we assess committed CO2 emissions from existing and planned power plants in LAC. Those are the carbon emissions that would result from the operation of fossil-fueled power plants during their typical lifetime. Committed emissions from existing power plants are close to 6.9 Gt of CO2. Building and operating all power plants that are announced, authorized, being procured, or under construction would result in 6.7 Gt of CO2 of additional commitments (for a total of 13.6 Gt of CO2). Committed emissions are above average IPCC assessments of cumulative emissions from power generation in LAC consistent with international temperature targets. To meet average carbon budgets from IPCC, 10%-16% of existing fossil-fueled power plants would need to be closed before the end of their technical lifespan.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are regulated by a complex interplay of drivers. Climate, generally represented by temperature and moisture, is regarded as one of the fundamental controls. Here, we use 54 forest sites in Switzerland, systematically selected to span near-independent gradients in temperature and moisture, to disentangle the effects of climate, soil properties, and landform on SOC dynamics. We estimated two SOC turnover times, based on bulk soil 14 C measurements (τ 14C ) and on a 6-month laboratory soil incubation (τ i ). In addition, upon incubation, we measured the 14 C signature of the CO 2 evolved and quantified the cumulated production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Our results demonstrate that τ i and τ 14C capture the dynamics of contrasting fractions of the SOC continuum. The 14 C-based τ 14C primarily reflects the dynamics of an older, stabilised pool, whereas the incubation-based τ i mainly captures fresh readily available SOC. Mean site temperature did not raise as a critical driver of SOC dynamics, and site moisture was only significant for τ i . However, soil pH emerged as a key control of both turnover times. The production of DOC was independent of τ i and not driven by climate, but primarily by the content of clay and, secondarily by the slope of the site. At the regional scale, soil physicochemical properties and landform appear to override the effect of climate on SOC dynamics. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064920266

But the implications of straw removal for soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emission are not yet fully understood due to scarcity of studies under Brazilian conditions. Four field experiments were designed to assess soil N2O and CH4 emissions derived from nitrogen (N) fertilization under scenarios of sugarcane straw removal in São Paulo state, Brazil. Our focus was also to derive the direct N2O emission factor (EF) that represents the regional conditions of sugarcane production, taking into account the data obtained from this study and those from the literature. In each field study, four straw removal rates (no removal (NR); low removal (LR)—removal of 5 Mg ha−1; high removal (HR)—removal of 10 Mg ha−1; and total removal (TR)—removal of 15 Mg ha−1) were arranged in a randomized block design. This study shows a clear evidence that CH4 fluxes are very low for all assessed sites regardless of straw removal rates, indicating a predominance of CH4 consumption by the soil. Cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.20 to 4.09 kg ha−1 year−1 and were significantly affected by straw removal in two sites, indicating that straw removal reduces N2O emissions. The average direct N2O EFs obtained from this study and from the literature were 0.28, 0.44, 0.70, and 0.56% for TR, HR, LR, and NR treatments, respectively, which are consistently lower than the EF of 1% suggested by the IPCC. Based on our regional-specific EF (Tier 2), the direct N2O emissions derived from N fertilization under scenarios of straw removal showed a reduction of at least 50% in relation to IPCC approach. Our findings are a step forward in providing regional-specific data to reduce the high level of uncertainty concerning N2O emission assessments of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil, but further studies are needed to evaluate how straw removal for bioenergy production and the associated changes in soil organic carbon stocks affect the GHG balance of sugarcane. © 2019, The Author(s).","CH4 emissions; Crop residues; IPCC methodology; N2O emission factor; N2O emissions; Saccharum spp; Tier 2","Agricultural wastes; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Magnesium; Nitrogen fertilizers; Organic carbon; Soils; Crop residue; Emission factors; IPCC methodology; Saccharum spp; Tier 2; Nitrogen removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069207669

The alternative scenario draws on the assessment of the national policy frameworks for alternative fuels infrastructure requested by the Directive (2014/94/EU). Five environmental indicators are examined: tailpipe CO2, NOx and PM2.5 emissions as well as NO2 and PM2.5 urban background concentrations. By 2030, car travel activity is simulated to generate ca. 425 MtCO2/year in the EU28 under the alternative scenario. Compared to the base scenario, electric vehicles contribute to a 3% reduction in tailpipe CO2 emissions. Only two countries attain CO2 emission reductions greater than 10% in the model. The need for a higher level of policy ambition towards the deployment of less polluting vehicles in Europe is highlighted as a conclusion. © 2019, The Author(s).","Electro-mobility; Greenhouse gas emissions; Passenger road transport; Scenario analysis; Urban background air pollution","Alternative fuels; Carbon dioxide; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Exhaust systems (engine); Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Urban transportation; Atmospheric emission; CO2 emission reduction; Electro mobilities; Environmental indicators; National policy framework; Road transports; Scenario analysis; Urban background; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071018827

Decarbonisation of urban rail is a vital component of policy and strategy to minimize anthropogenic emissions. Decarbonisation is a systems problem, however, that needs to reflect the interaction between components and processes. Dynamic computer modelling of systems for decarbonisation involves interfacing multiple models together and running them in parallel in order to observe and predict systems-level effects. This is challenging due to the diverse nature of models, achieving parallel model integration and concerns around intellectual property (IP). One solution is the multi-modelling paradigm, which supports integrated, diverse, secure interfacing of models. This paper demonstrates the application of the multi-modelling approach, using the INTO-CPS tool chain. A multi-model was developed comprising key components required for urban rail decarbonisation problems. This multi-model was tested for power consumption in four different scenarios with an example drawn from the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the United Kingdom. These scenarios compared combinations of decarbonisation intervention (baseline rolling stock versus lightweight, regenerative braking rolling stock and baseline driving style versus energy-efficient defensive driving style), generating different power consumption profiles for each.

A statistical model is fit to a collection NO2 plumes observed from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and is used to calculate top-down NOX emissions. Decreases in OMI-derived NOX emissions are observed across the eight cities from 2006 to 2017 (−17% in Miami to −58% in Los Angeles), and are generally consistent with long-term trends of bottom-up inventories (−25% in Miami to −49% in Los Angeles), but there are some interannual discrepancies. City-specific NOX-to-CO2 emission ratios, used to calculate inferred CO2, are estimated through annual bottom-up inventories of NOX and CO2 emissions disaggregated to 1 × 1 km2 resolution. Over the study period, NOX-to-CO2 emission ratios have decreased by ~40% nationwide (−24% to −51% for our studied cities), which is attributed to a faster reduction in NOX when compared to CO2 due to policy regulations and fuel type shifts. Combining top-down NOX emissions and bottom-up NOX-to-CO2 emission ratios, annual fossil-fuel CO2 emissions are derived. Inferred OMI-based top-down CO2 emissions trends vary between +7% in Dallas to −31% in Phoenix. For 2017, we report annual fossil-fuel CO2 emissions to be: Los Angeles 113 ± 49 Tg/yr; New York City 144 ± 62 Tg/yr; and Chicago 55 ± 24 Tg/yr. A study in the Los Angeles area, using independent methods, reported a 2013–2016 average CO2 emissions rate of 104 Tg/yr and 120 Tg/yr, which suggests that the CO2 emissions from our method are in good agreement with other studies' top-down estimates. We anticipate future remote sensing instruments – with better spatial and temporal resolution – will better constrain the NOX-to-CO2 ratio and reduce the uncertainty in our method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; NOx emissions; OMI NO2; Top-down emissions","Carbon dioxide; Nitrogen oxides; Remote sensing; Ultraviolet spectrometers; CO2 emissions; NOx emissions; OMI NO2; Ozone monitoring instruments; Remote sensing instruments; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Topdown; Fossil fuels; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; nitrogen dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission inventory; fossil fuel; megacity; monitoring; nitrogen oxides; observational method; ozone; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Article; carbon footprint; comparative study; devices; forecasting; Ozone Monitoring Instrument; policy; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); satellite imagery; summer; United States; wind; Arizona; California; Chicago; Dallas; Florida [United States]; Illinois; Los Angeles [California]; Miami; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; Phoenix; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070495083

Based on an analysis of panel data from American states from 1980 to 2012, this paper investigates the particular impact of citizen ideology on per-capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study contributes to the existing literature through a focus on the role of citizen ideology as a frame shaping pro-environmental behavior at the individual level when the effect of structural factors, like per-capita economic output, fossil-fuel production, and population density, are controlled for. The findings suggest not only that states with more liberal citizen ideology emit less CO2, but also that this effect both precedes and exceeds the influence of policies directly targeting climate change. Finally, this paper suggests that a change in popular perception of the environment and climate change as an American matter, as opposed to an ideological alignment issue, can lead to further decreases in CO2 emissions due to changes in citizens’ preferences and behaviors. © 2019, AESS.","American states; Citizen ideology; Climate change politics; Ideological alignment and environment","agri-environmental policy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; panel data; perception; politics; spatiotemporal analysis; Central America; North America; South America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071127356

Although they are only temporary, the environmental burdens of building activities can have a great impact on the environment and communities, and must be properly assessed and mitigated. A comprehensive evaluation of the impacts requires the consideration of all construction activities, construction sites and the type and operation time of off-road machines and plants that will be used in each site. In this paper, a case study relating to the project of a motorway was carried out with the following objectives: (i) to estimate the dust and gases arising from the whole construction process and identify the most critical pollutants in terms of emitted quantity; (ii) to investigate the worksites, activities and processes with the greatest impact from an emissive standpoint, and (iii) to propose a rational approach for designing and putting in place effective mitigation measures. Carbon oxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and fine particulate matter (PM10) emissions have been estimated by applying different models, methodologies and databases, depending on the construction process under analysis, and an emissive balance sheet has been produced. Results showed that CO is the pollutant released in the greatest quantity, followed by NOx. The emission of PM10, mainly due to the movement of trucks on unpaved roads, is one order of magnitude less with respect to CO and NOx, but produces the most perceived and undesired effects of the construction process in the interested communities. Tunnels and bridge are the components of a road with the greatest impact in terms of air emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution; Emissive balance sheet; Environmental impact; Road construction; Sustainability","atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; environmental impact; eolian deposit; gas; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; road construction; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079483571

Diversification patterns in South American grasslands have been neglected, especially in the Pampas. In this study, we applied an ensemble-modeling framework and a bioregionalization method to test the hypothesis that Petunia axillaris subspecies responded differently to past climate changes in the South American grasslands. Scenarios for the future were projected to better understand the consequences of climatic shifts on the species’ survival. Our results revealed that each subspecies is currently distributed in different bioregions and displays substantial geographic separation as a consequence of past climate oscillations. The projected future scenarios suggest that all subspecies would be affected by habitat fragmentation. This could influence the genetic structuring among P. axillaris populations, as the diversity of grasslands species depends on the genetic characteristics of the remaining populations over the fragmented regions. These results reinforce the importance of considering intraspecific diversity when planning conservation efforts in grasslands in southern South America. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Environmental changes; Pampas; Petunia axillaris; Phylogeographical lineages","climate change; environmental change; evolutionary theory; grassland; herb; Neotropical Region; paleoclimate; phylogeography; Quaternary; spatial distribution; Argentina; Europe; North America; Pampas; South America; Petunia axillaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074126949

They have been increasingly applied large scale (i.e. from farm-level to regional and global applications) to understand and quantify the trade-off between productivity, management and the sustainability of cropping systems, in terms of responsible use of resources (e.g. water and nitrogen) and of adaptation to or mitigation of climate change impacts. This contribution reviews the most recent information about spatializing crop models and provides a comprehensive overview of major assumptions and criticalities related to this methodological approach. The first paragraph focuses on the definition of crop models, presenting their historical evolution and main fields of application. A bibliometric analysis was carried out on 1017 scientific papers published between 1990 and 2018 in order to identify the most frequent scientific topics concerning the adoption of crop simulation modelling for sustainable agriculture. The second section describes the main sources of uncertainty in spatializing crop models, addressing two main aspects. Firstly, basic assumptions and validity domains of processes/phenomena represented may still not be valid when applied in a different spatial resolution. Secondly, reference input data needed to characterize the cropping system under study, to run models and test their performance at large scale can often be scarce and/or uncertain due to aggregation/disaggregation issues. The third section defines the minimum amount of data about environment (i.e. site, weather, soil), management (e.g. sowing and harvest date, cultivars and crop operations adopted) and crop type, needed to operate crop models at a given location under current/future climate scenarios. Necessary methodological indications for building a multi-layer georeferenced database facilitating coupling with biophysical models are also provided. Ways of integrating proxy variables (e.g. obtained from pedo-transfer functions and remote sensing data) and crop models have been reported. The last section presents two case studies dealing with the spatialized application of crop models to promote the sustainability of agriculture. A European case study is centred on the definition of farmer adaptation strategies to alleviate climate change impacts, while a regional case study evaluates the efficiency of water management and water footprint of tomato cultivation in Southern Italy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Biophysical models; Crop model uncertainty; Cropping system sustainability; Model data requirement; Remote sensing assimilation; Spatial-temporal scale; Spatially-explicit modelling",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077641907

In Europe, the in-service conformity of heavy-duty engines has been checked with PEMS for gaseous pollutants since 2014. To strengthen emissions regulations with a view to minimise the differences between on-road and laboratory emission levels in some cases, PEMS testing, including solid particle number (SPN), was introduced for the type-approval of light-duty vehicles in Europe in 2017 and for in-service conformity in 2019. SPN-PEMS for heavy-duty engines will be introduced in 2021. This paper gives an overview of the studies for SPN-PEMS from early 2013 with the first prototypes until the latest testing and improvements in 2019. The first prototype diffusion charger (DC) based systems had high differences from the reference laboratory systems at the first light-duty vehicles campaign. Tightening of the technical requirements and improvements from the instrument manufacturers resulted in differences of around 50%. Similar differences were found in an inter-laboratory comparison exercise with the best performing DC-and CPC-(condensation particle counter) based system. The heavy-duty evaluation phase at a single lab and later at various European laboratories revealed higher differences due to the small size of the urea generated particles and their high charge at elevated temperatures. This issue, along with robustness at low ambient temperatures, was addressed by the instrument manufacturers bringing the measurement uncertainty to the 50% levels.

Study focus: Using an isotope mass balance approach, watershed, climatic and isotopic data were applied to estimate evaporation losses and residence time of lakes, as well as to estimate water yield from watersheds. New hydrological insights for the region: Site-specific differences in water yield to 50 lakes over 16 years were found to be controlled by latitudinal gradients in climate, wetland type, lake/watershed configuration and permafrost. 19 plateau watersheds located northeast of Fort McMurray and in the Birch and Caribou Mountains which contained significant permafrost were found to have similar water yield to permafrost-poor watersheds if fen-dominated (159 mm/yr: n = 5 vs. 166 mm/yr; n = 31), and enhanced water yield (405 mm/yr; n = 14) if bog-dominated. Water yield was found to be systematically dependent on permafrost extent, yielding up to several hundred millimetres of additional runoff in bog-dominated systems. Temporal trend analysis indicates systemic momentum of change in hydrologic drivers over the 16-year period, although few are statistically significant. A new conceptual framework is proposed for classification of site-to-site permafrost thaw stage to improve water yield prediction, which is expected to influence lake water quality including observed pH increases noted previously for many lakes in the region. © 2019 The Authors","Bog; Boreal; Evaporation; Fen; Isotopes; Lakes; Permafrost thaw; Water balance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075265490

The National Emission Ceilings Directive 2016/2284/EU has set an obligation for all European Union countries to reduce the NH3 emissions by 6%, relative to 2005, by 2020. This study aims to assess the costs and benefits of four NH3 emission abatement options for the compliance of the agricultural sector with the commitments of the European air quality regulatory framework. A regional atmospheric model (WRF/Chem) was used to assess the effects of regulating NH3 emissions reductions on PM2.5 concentrations over Europe. Non-market valuation techniques (value of statistical life) were used to monetize the associated health outcomes. Results: We calculated that 16 out of the 28 EU member states exceeded their 2020 NH3 emission ceilings in 2016. The highest exceedances from the 2020 emission commitment level occurred in Latvia (15%), Germany (12%) and the UK (12%). Simulation of the required NH3 emission reduction by WRF/Chem showed that relatively large reductions in PM2.5 concentrations occur over central-western Europe and the UK. The largest health benefits (&gt; 5% reduction in premature mortality) were found for Scandinavia. The economic benefit from avoided premature deaths over Europe amounts to 14,837 M€/year. The costs of four NH3 emission abatement options, where each would fully achieve the required emission reduction, range from 80 M€/year for low nitrogen feed to 3738 M€/year for low-emission animal housing, with covered manure storage (236 M€/year) and urea fertilizer application (253 M€/year), in between. Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that the costs of compliance by the agricultural sector with the commitments of the European air quality regulations are much lower than the economic benefit. Thus, much more ambitious reduction commitments for NH3 emissions could be applied by the EU-28. The monetization of the health benefits of NH3 emission abatement policies and the assessment of the implementation costs can help policy-makers devise effective air pollution control programmes. © 2019, The Author(s).","Ammonia emissions; CAP; PM2.5 in Europe; Premature mortality; Value of statistical life; WRF/Chem","abatement cost; agricultural emission; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; compliance; cost-benefit analysis; currency devaluation; European Union; fertilizer application; mortality; pollution control; statistical analysis; weather forecasting; Germany; Latvia; Scandinavia; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076620899

Concrete production has been increasing in the past decades and this is now one of the biggest concerns of researchers who follow a sustainable development approach. The use of waste materials in concrete production is a proven alternative to reduce the consumption of natural resources. On the other hand, red mud (RM), granite (GP) and marble (MP) waste powders, whose disposal has adverse environmental effects, have become environmental concerns in industrial areas. In light of these issues, employing alternatives to benefit from such valuable local waste materials, rich in silica, alumina, and ferric oxide, can be a great help to the environment. In this study, to evaluate the efficiency of using these materials in self-compacting mixes, the fresh and mechanical parameters were first determined, and then experiments on waste mixes produced with varying percentages of RM (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10%) as partial replacement of cement, besides using GP and MP as filler replacement (at 100%), were performed. Although application of RM negatively influenced the fresh properties, it was observed that a low level of RM incorporation along with MP and GP enhanced the mechanical properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC), e.g. a mix made with 2.5% of RM and 100% of GP can increase the compressive strength by 19% compared to that of the control mix. Depending on the local characteristics of RM, these conclusions are expected to apply to many locations worldwide. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Granite; Limestone; Marble; Performance; Red mud; Self-compacting concrete","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cements; Compressive strength; Concrete industry; Fillers; Granite; Industrial waste disposal; Iron oxides; Lime; Limestone; Marble; Planning; Powders; Silica; Sustainable development; Cement and concrete industries; Concrete productions; Environmental concerns; Environmental pollutions; Local characteristics; Mechanical parameters; Performance; Red mud; Self compacting concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071881577

It is argued that that decision risks giving rise to a serious setback for the international protection of climate. Yet, the Parties to the Paris Agreement have so far been reluctant to react to the United States’ conduct. In particular, since the United States withdrawal could not have effect before 4 November 2020, the cessation of implementation of the Paris Agreement has already resulted in a wrongful act, at least as regards the obligation to pursue domestic mitigation measures with the aim of achieving the objectives of the nationally determined contributions. Should the Parties to the Paris Agreement invoke the responsibility of the United States, they would eventually face the need to solve certain difficulties emerging from the application of the general rules concerning State responsibility to a case relevant to climate change, because the implementation mechanism of the Paris Agreement would prove to be inadequate owing to its facilitative nature. © The Author(s) 2019.

In particular, some scholars have argued that, due to the burden of pollution abatement, businesses commonly constrain governments, which then take less cooperative positions on global climate agreements. I suggest that this argument needs further qualification: pollution-related costs rarely have unconditional effects on preferences for global climate agreements. Instead, a sector's pollution level is more likely to influence preferences for climate cooperation if mediated by its trade exposure. If pollution is high, firms in high-trade sectors may be less able to absorb climate regulation, and hence they should be more sensitive to climate cooperation. If pollution is low, firms in high-trade sectors may support climate cooperation, because by being more efficient they are more capable of adjusting to regulation. These dynamics should then affect governmental positions on global climate politics. I test my sectoral argument with original data from business statements and national communications at the United Nations climate negotiations. In line with my argument, I find that businesses in trade-open sectors are more likely to oppose climate agreement as their sector's emissions increase. I also find that in countries where high-emission sectors are open to trade, governments have low preferences for climate cooperation. The findings have implications for the domestic politics of environmental agreements and the distributive politics of global public good provision. © The Author(s) (2019).

Here, we investigated the PM2.5 chemical composition changes over eastern China associated with the Action Plan during 2013–2017 using satellite-based PM2.5 chemical composition data derived using CMAQ simulations and satellite inputs. The PM2.5 concentrations decreased considerably during this time as a result of the reductions in all chemical species in PM2.5. The population-weighted mean concentrations over eastern China decreased from 11.1 to 6.7 μg m-3 for SO42−, 13.8–13.1 μg m-3 for NO3−, 7.4–5.8 μg m-3 for NH4+, 9.9–8.4 μg m-3 for OM, 4.6–3.8 μg m-3 for BC and 12.9–9.6 μg m-3 for other species in PM2.5. SO42− had the largest reduction of 40%, while NO3− had the lowest reduction of 5%, resulting in a greater fraction of NO3− and a smaller fraction of SO42− in PM2.5. Among the three key regions, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei had the largest reduction in PM2.5 and its chemical compositions. The decrease in SO4 2 concentrations was in line with the reduction of SO2 emissions, and the major driver of the SO2 emission reductions was the industrial sector. The decrease in NO3− concentrations was limited because the decrease in SO2 emissions and the stable NH3 emissions facilitated the formation of NO3− from HNO3, which partially offset the reduction in NOx emissions driven by the power sector. To mitigate PM2.5 pollution more effectively, future efforts are needed to reduce NH3 emissions. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan; PM2.5 chemical composition; Satellite remote sensing","Ammonia; Emission control; Remote sensing; Satellites; Air pollution prevention; Chemical composition data; Chemical compositions; Control measures; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Industrial sector; PM2.5 concentration; Satellite remote sensing; Air pollution; action plan; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution control; satellite imagery; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069713397

Reducing uncertainty about demand and, in case of renewable electricity generation, supply is important for the determination of spot electricity prices. In this work we propose and evaluate a context-based technique to anticipate the electricity production and consumption in buildings. We focus on a household with photovoltaics and energy storage system. We analyze the efficiency of Markov chains, stride predictors and also their combination into a hybrid predictor in modelling the evolution of electricity production and consumption. All these methods anticipate electric power based on previous values. The main goal is to determine the best method and its optimal configuration which can be integrated into a (possibly hardware-based) intelligent energy management system. The role of such a system is to adjust and synchronize through prediction the electricity consumption and production in order to increase self-consumption, reducing thus the pressure over the power grid. The experiments performed on datasets collected from a real system show that the best evaluated predictor is the Markov chain configured with an electric power history of 100 values, a context of one electric power value and the interval size of 1. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity prediction; Energy management system; Energy storage; Markov chains; Photovoltaics","Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Markov processes; Smart city; Electricity production; Electricity-consumption; Energy storage systems; Forecasting electricity; Greenhouse gas reductions; Intelligent energy management systems; Photovoltaics; Spot electricity prices; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059855153

The compressive strength of these blocks varies from 4 to 6 MPa. This paper discusses the properties of aerated concrete by the use of mineral admixtures like fly ash, construction and demolition waste (C&amp;D Waste) and hemp fibres. In order to reduce CO2 emissions, save energy and conserve natural resources, there is a need for reducing the production and consumption of concrete products. This paper manifests the investigations carried out to study the feasibility of using aerated Hemp concrete Blocks in Urban Housing. Industrial Hemp fibers have been identified to potentially absorb carbon. Hence the use of processed Hemp hurd can be used to develop concrete blocks. The aeration process and the complete elimination of coarse aggregates make the blocks light-weight and energy absorbing.

The paper estimates the willingness to act as a crowdshipper (supply) and to buy a crowdshipping service (demand) to get goods delivered/picked-up in the last mile B2C e-commerce situation. Specifically, it innovates by considering an environmental-friendly crowdshipping based on the use of the mass transit network of the city where parcels customers/crowdshippers pick-up/drop-off goods in automated parcel lockers located either inside the transit stations or in the surroundings. This issue is very important since “standard” crowdshipping is usually not able to reduce congestion and polluting emissions due to the dedicated trips performed using private motorized vehicles. The paper rests on an extensive stated preference survey. The hypothetical scenarios used to acquire both demand (customers’) and supply (crowdshippers’) preferences make use of the most relevant attributes emerging from a preliminary investigation performed in the study context. The investigation is performed in the city of Rome and the metro is the transit system considered. The results are useful in understanding and quantifying the potential of this freight transport strategy for e-commerce in an urban context and in providing local policy makers with a good knowledge base for its future development. © 2019, The Author(s).","City logistics; Crowdshipping; Discrete choice models; On demand economy; Stated preference; Urban freight transport","Electronic commerce; Knowledge based systems; Light rail transit; Traffic congestion; Urban planning; Urban transportation; City logistics; Crowdshipping; Discrete choice models; On demands; Stated preferences; Urban freight transport; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061822868

The adopted nuclear decay characteristics (possible disintegration modes and branching ratios, energies and half-lives of nuclear energy levels, types and energies of emitted particles) are from the NUCLEIDE evaluated database ( http://www.nucleide.org/DDEP_WG/DDEPdata.htm) in the specific format PenNuc. The initial energies of electrons and positrons emitted in beta disintegrations are sampled from their continuous spectra by means of the RITA (rational inverse transform with aliasing) algorithm, which is described in the Appendix. Electronic relaxation of the residual ion after electron capture and internal conversion is simulated by using the data and sampling methods of the PENELOPE code system. At each call the subroutines deliver a list of state variables of the particles (photons, electrons, positrons and alphas) emitted in a random decay path of the considered radionuclide down to a metastable level or to the ground state of the daughter nucleus. The distribution package includes a main program that simulates the emission spectrum of a radionuclide and, optionally, produces a list of particles emitted in a prescribed number of decays. Program summary: Program Title: PenNuc Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/dy28h8xmkv.1 Licensing provisions: CC by NC 3.0 Programming language: Fortran 90/95 Nature of problem: PENNUC simulates the emission of energetic particles in random decay pathways of radionuclides. The initial state of a particle is described by the following variables: type of particle (photon, electron, positron, or alpha), energy, direction, and emission time relative to the start of the decay. For each decay the program provides a list of initial states of the particles emitted with energies higher than the adopted cutoff ECNUC, which is set to 200 eV in the original source file. Solution method: The nuclear disintegration mode and the subsequent de-excitation of the daughter nucleus are simulated by using decay information from the NUCLEIDE evaluated databases. De-excitation of ions produced in electron capture and internal conversion is simulated by using atomic transition data and sampling methods from the Monte Carlo code system PENELOPE [1]. The energy of beta particles is sampled using the RITA (rational inverse transform with aliasing) algorithm, which optimizes both simulation speed and accuracy. Additional comments: Although PENNUC can describe several radionuclides simultaneously, the selection of the active nuclide (appropriate to the characteristics of the radioactive source) must be done in the main program. The subroutines provide the complete set of particles emitted with energies higher than the cutoff ECNUC in each nuclear decay, including x rays and Auger electrons. [1] F.

The controlled heat injection allowed by electrically heated catalysts can effectively reduce the catalyst light-off time with relatively moderate fuel penalty. This paper compares the exhaust temperature and emissions of a case study diesel vehicle in cold and warm start conditions, and proposes two electrically heated catalyst control strategies, which are evaluated in terms of emission reduction and energy consumption with different target temperature settings. In addition, a new performance indicator, that is, the specific emission reduction, is used to evaluate the after-treatment system and associated thermal management. For the worldwide harmonized light vehicle test cycle, the results without electrically heated catalyst show that from both cold and warm start conditions a large amount of operating points of the engine is located in the region of partial catalyst light off. Moreover, emissions, especially in terms of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon, significantly decrease with the electrically heated catalyst implementation, for example, by at least 50% from cold start; however, they still tend to be rather substantial when the fuel is re-injected after the engine cutoff phases. The exhaust temperature is lower than the target values in the sections of the driving cycle in which the electrically heated catalyst power is saturated according to the maximum level allowed by the device. The carbon dioxide penalty brought by the electrically heated catalyst ranges from 3.93% to 6.65% and from 6.49% to 9.35% for warm and cold start conditions, respectively. © 2019 University of Surrey.

Of the many studies focusing on the quantification and visualization of ecosystem services, few have explored the visualization characteristics of the different scales related to ecosystem services and losses. In this study, we selected one of the most important urban agglomerations in China—the Yangtze River Delta (YRD)—as a case for the analysis of ecosystem service benefits (which include environmental purification, climate and air regulation, and tourism and leisure) and losses (pollen allergies, air pollution, and the heat island effect) and the spatial patterns of both at multiple scales (grid divisions, administrative districts, and functional areas). We found that the value of ecosystem service losses in the YRD, with a net value of approximately −$42.02 × 106, was slightly higher than the value of ecosystem service benefits. The patterns of ecosystem service benefits were consistent with urbanization processes and patterns, with the natural landscape always serving as the main provider of ecosystem service benefits while the spatial pattern of the urbanized landscape determined the ecosystem service losses. Based on K-means clustering using randomly selected objects as an initial cluster center, we divided the YRD into different functional areas (optimized-, key-, and restricted-development zones) within the grid to create divisions with consistent biophysical properties, thereby avoiding the impact of urban administrative boundaries on the results. To facilitate closing the gap between positive and negative ecosystem outcomes in a politically feasible manner, we also identified functional areas in terms of ecosystem service bundles at the administrative district scale.

Vital to its success is achieving a decrease in the abundance of atmospheric methane (CH4), the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. If this reduction is to be achieved, individual nations must make and meet reduction goals in their nationally determined contributions, with regular and independently verifiable global stock taking. Targets for the Paris Agreement have been set, and now the capability must follow to determine whether CH4 reductions are actually occurring. At present, however, there are significant limitations in the ability of scientists to quantify CH4 emissions accurately at global and national scales and to diagnose what mechanisms have altered trends in atmospheric mole fractions in the past decades. For example, in 2007, mole fractions suddenly started rising globally after a decade of almost no growth. More than a decade later, scientists are still debating the mechanisms behind this increase. This study reviews the main approaches and limitations in our current capability to diagnose the drivers of changes in atmospheric CH4 and, crucially, proposes ways to improve this capability in the coming decade. Recommendations include the following: (i) improvements to process-based models of the main sectors of CH4 emissions—proposed developments call for the expansion of tropical wetland flux measurements, bridging remote sensing products for improved measurement of wetland area and dynamics, expanding measurements of fossil fuel emissions at the facility and regional levels, expanding country-specific data on the composition of waste sent to landfill and the types of wastewater treatment systems implemented, characterizing and representing temporal profiles of crop growing seasons, implementing parameters related to ruminant emissions such as animal feed, and improving the detection of small fires associated with agriculture and deforestation; (ii) improvements to measurements of CH4 mole fraction and its isotopic variations—developments include greater vertical profiling at background sites, expanding networks of dense urban measurements with a greater focus on relatively poor countries, improving the precision of isotopic ratio measurements of 13CH4, CH3D, 14CH4, and clumped isotopes, creating isotopic reference materials for international-scale development, and expanding spatial and temporal characterization of isotopic source signatures; and (iii) improvements to inverse modeling systems to derive emissions from atmospheric measurements—advances are proposed in the areas of hydroxyl radical quantification, in systematic uncertainty quantification through validation of chemical transport models, in the use of source tracers for estimating sector-level emissions, and in the development of time and space resolved national inventories.

Identification of point defects which deteriorate the optical, electrical, and electromechanical properties of AlN crystals for such applications is the subject of the present work. Using Raman spectroscopy, two local vibrational modes (LVMs) were discovered at wave numbers of 1189 cm-1 and 1148 cm-1. By analyzing an AlN crystal intentionally enriched with the carbon isotope 13C, it is unambiguously shown that the two LVMs originate from two different, but in each case carbon-related defects. Furthermore, it is evidenced that the defect underlying the LVM at 1189 cm-1 contains exactly two carbon atoms. The tricarbon defect-related LVM reported earlier in an infrared absorption study is found to be Raman active at 1772 cm-1. The Raman scattering intensity of all three LVMs strongly depends on the photon energy of the exciting light what is interpreted as a resonance Raman effect. This allows linking the identified defects with their contribution to the strong, carbon-related ultraviolet absorption around 4.7 eV and proves that these defects introduce optically and electrically active deep levels in the bandgap of AlN. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Aluminum nitride; III-V semiconductors; Light absorption; Light emission; Point defects; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Single crystals; Bulk single crystals; Electrically actives; Electromechanical property; Local vibrational mode; Physical vapor transport; Piezoelectric resonators; Raman scattering intensity; Ultraviolet absorption; Nitrogen compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076008846

The aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of cropping systems on soil metal(loid)s accumulation and speciation and to identify metal sources for each cropping system. To achieve these objectives, 40 soil samples from cereal, fruit, citrus and horticultural cropping areas and 15 samples from non-disturbed areas were collected. pH, salinity, particle size distribution, organic carbon and carbonate contents were analysed. In addition, total, DTPA-extractable and water-soluble Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and As concentrations and their chemical speciation were determined. Results showed an enrichment of Pb in cereal and horticultural soils, of Zn in fruit and horticultural soils and of Cu and Cd in citrus soils. The most available metals were Pb and Cd which was due to their ability to bind to carbonate and reducible phases of soils. The PCA suggested an anthropogenic origin of Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn in most of the cropping systems; this origin was related to both agriculture management practices and other anthropic actions, such as traffic. Therefore, changes in crop managements are necessary for a sustainable agriculture in the studied crop systems. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Chemical speciation; Crop; Metals; Multivariate analysis; Soil","anthropogenic source; arsenic; concentration (composition); cropping practice; metalloid; multivariate analysis; soil chemistry; source identification; speciation (chemistry); Mediterranean Region; Citrus; arsenic; metal; pentetic acid; agriculture; bioavailability; chemistry; environmental monitoring; pharmacokinetics; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; Spain; Agriculture; Arsenic; Biological Availability; Environmental Monitoring; Metals; Pentetic Acid; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067797764

Six capture scenarios are examined for a representative 550 megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant, and three CO2-EOR injection scenarios are evaluated for both East Canton oil field and Gore consolidated oil field. The potential costs and credits associated with CO2 storage related tax incentives are also considered. Power plant capture performance and costs integrated with field-scale CO2-EOR techno-economics suggest that there are potentially feasible scenarios for capture, transport, and CO2-EOR storage of 25%, 50%, and 90% of CO2 emissions, respectively, from a 550 MW power plant. Economically feasible outcomes exhibiting net present values of $2191, $1380, and $1940 million are estimated for the 25%, 50%, and 90% capture scenarios, respectively. On average, the 45Q tax credit for CO2 storage affords a $3–$7 per barrel decrease in the minimum oil price required to break-even on the project. In all source-sink scenarios qualifying as feasible, the CO2 capture costs incurred by the power plant are offset by revenue from CO2-EOR and are not passed on to ratepayers during the 30-year analysis time frame.

In this study, a nested-grid version of global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) is employed to assess the impacts of variations in meteorological parameters, terrestrial fluxes, fossil fuel emissions, and biomass burning on inter-annual variations of CO2 concentrations over East Asia in 2004–2012. Simulated CO2 concentrations are compared with observations at 14 surface stations from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) and satellite-derived CO2 column density (XCO2) from the Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). The comparison shows that the simulated CO2 column density is generally higher than that of GOSAT by 1.33 × 10−6 (annual mean point by point biases averaged over East Asia). The model reasonably captures the temporal variations of CO2 concentrations observed at the ground-based stations, but it is likely to underestimate the peaks-to-troughs amplitude of the seasonal cycle by 50% or more. The simulated surface CO2 concentration in East Asia exhibits the largest inter-annual variation in December-January–February (DJF). The regional mean absolute deviation (MAD) values over East Asia are within (4.4–5.0) × 10−6 for all seasons. Model sensitivity simulations indicate that the inter-annual variations of surface CO2 concentrations are mainly driven by variations of meteorological parameters, and partly modulated by the inter-annual variations of terrestrial fluxes and fossil fuel emissions in local regions. The variations of the terrestrial fluxes and fossil fuel emissions may account for ∼28% of the inter-annual variation of surface CO2 concentration in southern China. The inter-annual variations of the peaks-to-troughs amplitude are dependent on variations of meteorological parameters, terrestrial fluxes and fossil fuel emissions in local regions. The influence of biomass burning emissions is relatively weak. © 2020 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)","Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuel emission; Inter-annual variation; Terrestrial biosphere flux",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082821143

The goal of this paper is to present a theoretical pattern of economic activities and water environmental improvement by incorporating their bidirectional causality relationship. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) has been useful in connecting economic and environmental concepts, thus becoming an important tool for evaluating watershed sustainability. The high governance cost makes water pollution-intensive goods relatively expensive to produce. According to the EKC, there is an inverted U‐shaped relationship between water environment deterioration and the level of social and economic improvement. Based on EKC hypothesis, we studied the coordinated relationship between environmental protection of water and economic and social sustainable development in the Huntai River Watershed from 2003 to 2012 by means of a panel threshold data. The EKC is an empirical curve that describes the relationship between economic restructuring and water environmental conditions improvement. The Green Environmental Kuznets Curve (GEKC) is used to describe the relationship among watershed pollution emissions, the environmental quality and income per capita. However, according to the GEKC, U‐shaped relationship exists between the coordination of water environmental protection and the level of social economic development (SED). The GEKC is affected by water resource consumption, the regional trade situation (T), the per capita gross domestic product level (Y), and controls on the total amount of water pollution discharge. We try to adjust to the type of GEKC curve and apply dataset of water pollutant emission reduction cost control to fit main characteristic of equilibrium cost. In accordance with Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) data statistical analysis, the value of the GEKC regression equation independent variables Y, Y2, per capita water resources consumption (E), T, adding value of production (AVP) and modified socioeconomic development index (MSDI) were 1.988, −0.150, 0.720, 0.216, 0.070, and 1.890, respectively. In the long-term, the correlation formula of watershed per capita sewage discharge (C) to Y was 2.090–0.300Y. For every 1% increase in E, T, AVP, and MSDI, C increased by approximately 0.720%, 0.216%, 0.072%, and 1.890%, respectively. The E, T and MSDI are key factors in developing an effective way to control the levels of water pollution discharge. Pollution is endogenous, so water environment pollution is not necessarily caused by economic growth. According to the total amount control of water pollution discharge, the GEKC equilibrium optimization calculation results can be used to effectively control watershed pollutant emissions and improve water environmental quality. Through the adjustment of industrial structure or industrial transformation and technological progress, it is possible to change the relationship between current economic growth and water environment. With GEKC related Curve characteristic and indicator classes, it is possible to realize harmonious and sustainable development of regional economy and society in the Huntai River Watershed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Equilibrium optimization calculation; Green Environmental Kuznets Curve; Huntai River Watershed; Sewage discharge; Sustainable development","Curve fitting; Deterioration; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Environmental protection; Industrial economics; Oil spills; Planning; Quality control; Regional planning; River pollution; Rivers; Sewage; Sustainable development; Watersheds; Environmental conservation; Environmental improvements; Environmental Kuznets curves; Equilibrium optimizations; River watersheds; Sewage discharges; Water environment pollution; Water environmental protection; Water pollution control; cost analysis; economic activity; economic development; economic growth; environmental conditions; environmental economics; environmental protection; Kuznets curve; river basin; river discharge; sustainability; sustainable development; watershed; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073520363

The Paris Agreement requires a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, in fact net zero by 2050. One of the priority areas is the building stock, as it is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. COP23, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and an increasing number of countries are extending their consideration from aspects such as energy consumption and emissions from building operation to the manufacture of construction materials and building construction. The event offered an excellent platform to exchange ideas and thoughts on existing and planned environmental benchmarking schemes for buildings. Methods: The one day event dealt at first with life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches applied in European, Asian, Australasian and American countries to assess the environmental performance of buildings. Within a round robin test, organised within the IEA EBC (Energy in Building and Communities) Annex 72 project, 22 organisations from 21 countries assessed the environmental performance of one identical building, the be2226 office building located in Lustenau, Austria. The materials, the building technologies and the energy consumption were kept constant. This allowed to identify the main differences in LCA data used and LCA methodology applied in the national contexts. In the LCA forum, eight organisations presented the current state or future plans of an environmental benchmarking system in their home country. The systems were characterised in terms of scope, in particular (a) which types of buildings are covered; (b) which life cycle stages are included; (c) which building elements and which operational energy uses are considered; and (d) which environmental impacts are addressed. Furthermore, the default reference service life and the main source of LCA data were specified and the current or planned benchmark values for greenhouse gas emissions of residential buildings were reported. Results and discussion: The round robin test revealed the LCA background data as one major source of difference in assessment results. Methodological and modelling choices were less important except for the Danish assessment, which applies a comparatively long reference study period (80 years for office buildings, 120 years for residential buildings) and considering future changes in the electricity mix towards 100% renewables to describe the operational electricity demand during the lifetime of the building. Most benchmarking systems presented are applied on new and retrofit residential, office and school buildings. Other use types such as shops, restaurants, universities or hospitals are covered only in few or just one country. The greenhouse gas emission benchmark for residential buildings (construction and operation) revealed a significant gap between the current level of the building benchmarks on one hand and the target of net zero CO2-eq emissions derived from the 1.5 °C scenarios of IPCC on the other. An online inquiry carried out among the audience during the event showed a preference for a per capita overall budget of 500 kg CO2-eq per year to derive greenhouse gas emission benchmarks for buildings and that life cycle-based benchmarks for buildings should be legally binding. Conclusions: The 71st LCA forum on environmental benchmarks for buildings showed that the experts present acknowledge the net zero CO2 emission target derived from the 1.5 °C scenarios. Several countries have expertise and experience in assessing the environmental impacts of buildings. However, the current (mostly voluntary) benchmarking schemes are way too weak to support the building sector in contributing significantly to the required CO2 emission turn off. The outlook given by several speakers showed that the current benchmarks will likely be tightened and oriented on the planetary boundaries and on the scientifically defined CO2 emission budgets rather than on the technical or economic feasibility. Finally, the responsibility of governments for defining environmental requirements and targets was stressed. The event, the exchange of ideas and the discussions helped to nurture and hopefully accelerate the developments in the construction sector of the home countries of the experts and government representatives.

However, there are still fundamental open issues regarding the complex redox equilibria among the involved species which could include reducing compounds. The aim of this study was the pilot application of the 2,2-ciiphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay to PM in order to evaluate the presence of reducing species. The assay, commonly applied to biological matrices, was adapted to PM and showed good analytical performances. It allowed the analysis of conventional 24 h airborne PM samples with suitable sensitivity and good repeatability of the measurements. The assay was applied to seven samples representing possible PM contributes (certified urban dust NIST1648a; brake dust; Saharan dust; coke dust; calcitic soil dust; incinerator dust; and diesel particulate matter certified material NIST1650b) and to PM2.5 field filters. The same samples were also analyzed for elements. Preliminary results indicated that the assay gave a linear response and that detectable amounts of reducing species were present in PM samples. The combined application of DPPH and conventional OP assays could then permit, in the future, to gain more knowledge about the reaction and/or competition between oxidative and reducing processes. © 2019 by the authors.

The planet has limited resources, and it is necessary to use these resources effectively. This paper examines the environmental impact of three energy solutions for the heating and cooling of buildings. The solutions are conventional district heating and cooling, a smart energy solution for heating and cooling (ectogridTM), and geothermal energy. The ectogridTM balances energy flows with higher and lower temperatures to reduce the need for supplied energy. The three solutions have been studied for Medicon Village, which is a district in the city of Lund in Sweden. The study shows that the energy use for the conventional system is 12,250 MWh for one year, and emissions are 590 tons of CO2 equivalents. With ectogridTM, the energy use is reduced by 61%, and the emissions are reduced by 12%, compared to the conventional system. With geothermal energy, the energy use is reduced by 70%, and the emissions by 20%. An analysis is also made in a European context, with heating based on natural gas and cooling based on air conditioners. The study shows that the environmental impact would decrease considerably by replacing the carbon dioxide intensive solution with ectogridTM or geothermal energy. © 2019 by the authors.","Building energy solutions; District-heating system; Ectogrid; Geothermal energy; Heat pump; Smart energy systems","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cooling; environmental impact; geothermal energy; heating; natural gas; Lund; Skane; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082741753

This work presents the formulation of the Urban Air Quality Management Capabilities Index (CECA) and the results of its pilot application in ten Latin American cities. CECA offers a comprehensive and systematic analysis of a city's capacity to formulate and implement air quality management strategies. It is comprised of 31 indicators classed across nine dimensions and three main components (technical capabilities, data capabilities, exploiting capabilities). We defined a specific scoring scale for each indicator. Scores in the scale were determined from surveys administered to local authorities and experts. The pilot application of CECA in Latin America demonstrated that the index provides relevant information on the needs and possibilities for cities to implement primary and rapid actions to reduce air pollution. Within the ten pilot cities, Mexico City and Santiago stand out for leading AQM capabilities. They have integrated technical knowledge into long-term AQM plans and implementation strategies. Consequently, both cities have managed to strengthen their institutions and policies to set effective command and control mechanisms, while proposing incentives for technological improvements. The group of cities with CECA intermediate and low scores evidenced that AQM is starting to emerge in the region. An essential aspect to improve across such cities is the transition to a comprehensive AQM, that goes much further than monitoring. Continuous assessment is needed to improve urban capabilities to address air pollution and to promote interactions among cities in finding solutions. Furthermore, CECA approach encourages cities to prioritize urban AQM, while fosters a comprehensive view and multisector action at local, regional and national scales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality management; Composite index; Urban air pollution; Urban sustainability indicators","air pollution; air quality; article; city; human; Mexico City; South and Central America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073019453

The building is a two-floor office structure, with 550 m2 total surface, designed under the guide and the scientific supervision of a Bergamo University research group, jointly to the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC). The goal of the project was to assure a high level of internal comfort all over the year by using only solar energy. The building architecture has been designed to minimize the cooling load and the energy demand. The energy system is based on a 40 kWp PV field coupled with a 48 kWh electric storage and a high-efficiency chiller (reversible heat pump). Transient simulations by Trnsys code have been carried out to optimize both the thermal envelope and the energy plants so to make the building energy-autonomous 24/7. The numerical predictions of the energy performance (including cooling load, PV production and power consumption for chiller, lighting and appliances) are compared to the real data measured by a sophisticated monitoring system, including sensors located in the roof, in the external walls and in the energy systems. The field measurements confirm that the model predictions were accurate both in terms of peak and annual values. The small variations between prediction and real data show that both thermal envelope and PV field perform better than expected. This building is a pioneering pilot-project: the goal was to show that new sustainable construction standards using only solar energy are possible in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and that this is a viable solution to reduce the carbon footprint in all the Gulf region. The strategic importance of an accurate modeling activity leading to an optimal design has been proved. The monitored data under real operating conditions have confirmed that the expected targets in terms of energy savings and carbon footprint reduction have been successfully achieved. © 2019","Dynamic simulation; Energy+ building; Monitoring system; PV; Solar cooling","Air conditioning; Buildings; Carbon footprint; Computer simulation; Cooling; Cooling systems; Digital storage; Emission control; Energy conservation; Forecasting; Heating; Monitoring; Solar energy; Carbon footprint reductions; High efficiency chillers; Monitoring system; Numerical predictions; Real operating conditions; Reversible heat pumps; Solar cooling; Sustainable construction; Structural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074215804

Various abiotic and biotic factors affect their biomass and nutrient content. Understanding the effect of these factors on root traits could improve biogeochemical modelling, nutrient management and ecosystem services provision in planted forests. Data from 14-year old poplars planted along a fertility/climatic gradient in Southeastern Canada, show that live fine root biomass varied with genotype and environment, was negatively correlated to soil fertility, and uncorrelated to tree size. Dead fine root biomass varied with genotype and peaked during fall and in colder environments with slower element cycling. Root chemistry also varied with environment, genotype and season. The genotype producing recalcitrant leaf litter had the highest root biomass, suggesting a compensation strategy. Along the studied gradient, plasticity level observed for some root traits (biomass, element contents) was genotype-specific and high for some genotypes. Regionally, such plasticity patterns should be considered in elemental budgets, for nutrient management and ecosystem services provision in plantations (carbon storage, nutrient retention). The small inter-site aboveground productivity differences observed suggest that plasticity in fine root growth may contribute to overcome nutrient limitations on less fertile marginal lands. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon; agriculture; biomass; Canada; chemistry; ecosystem; forest; growth, development and aging; human; metabolism; plant leaf; plant root; Populus; season; soil; tree; Agriculture; Biomass; Canada; Carbon; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Nutrients; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Populus; Seasons; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064573278

Conversely, anthropogenic N deposition can negatively feed back on soil microbes and reduce soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. Mechanistically, this can include reductions of decomposer biomass, especially fungi, and decreases in activities of lignin-modifying enzyme (LMEs). Moreover, N inputs can lower resource C:N and thus decrease the C:N imbalance between microbial decomposers and their resources. As a result, microbially-mediated decomposition might slow down, resulting in larger SOM pools with consequences for ecosystem nutrition and climate regulation. Here, we studied the long-term impact of experimental N addition on soil microbes and microbially-mediated decomposition in two coniferous forests in Switzerland and Denmark. We measured microbial biomass C and N, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers and potential enzyme activities related to C, N, and P acquisition along the topsoil profile (0–30 cm). In particular, we investigated shifts in microbial C:N homeostasis and relative C:N:P limitation. Contrary to prevailing theory, microbial biomass and community composition were remarkably resistant against two decades of 750 and 1,280 kg ha−1 of cumulative N inputs at the Swiss and Danish site, respectively. While N reduced fungal-specific PLFAs and lowered fungi-to-bacteria (F:B) ratios in some (mainly organic) horizons where soil organic carbon (SOC) has accumulated, it increased F:B ratios in other (mainly mineral) horizons where SOC has declined. We did not find a consistent reduction of LME activities in response to N. Rather, relationships between LME activities and SOC concentrations were largely unaffected by N addition. This questions prevalent theories of lignin decomposition and SOC storage under elevated N inputs. By using C:N stoichiometry, we further show that microbial communities responded in part non-homeostatically to decreasing resource C:N, in addition to a likely increase in their carbon use efficiency and a decrease in nitrogen use efficiency. While the expected increased allocation to C- and decreased allocation to N-acquiring enzymes was not found, microbial investment in P acquisition (acid phosphatase activity) increased in the nutrient-poor Podzol (but not in the nutrient-rich Gleysol). Enzyme vector analysis showed decreasing C but increasing P limitation of soil microbial communities at both sites. We conclude that simulated N deposition led to physiological adaptations of soil microbial communities across the topsoil profile in two independent experiments, with long-term implications for tree nutrition and SOC sequestration. However, we expect that microbial adaptations are not endless and may reach a tipping point when ecosystems experience nitrogen saturation. © Copyright © 2019 Forstner, Wechselberger, Stecher, Müller, Keiblinger, Wanek, Schleppi, Gundersen, Tatzber, Gerzabek and Zechmeister-Boltenstern.","ecological stoichiometry; forest fertilization; nitrogen saturation; Norway spruce; phosphorus limitation; soil carbon; soil enzymes; soil organic matter decomposition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094830040

However, differences in indoor exposure levels to Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene (BTEX) in those vehicles have not been investigated so far. The primary aim of this study was to determine if passengers are exposed to different BTEX levels when using buses powered by CNG or by diesel, and further explore if indoor levels are influenced by external air quality. For this purpose, BTEX air concentrations were measured in bus cabins (CNG and diesel), parking stations and in a background urban area using passive air samplers. Results showed that BTEX concentrations inside vehicles were higher than outside, but no significant differences were found between buses powered by CNG or by diesel. In CNG vehicles, high and significant positive correlation was found between benzene and the number of journeys in the same route (rs = 0.786, p &lt; 0.05), vehicle operating time (rs = 0.738, p &lt; 0.05), exposure time (rs = 0.714, p &lt; 0.05) and exposure index (rs = 0.738, p &lt; 0.05), but this was not observed for diesel vehicles. Benzene in bus cabins was found to be significantly below reference value for human health protection. However, excepting p-xylene, all other aromatic pollutants have a mean concentration significantly above the lowest effect level (p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons). Additionally, higher BTEX levels in cabin buses than in outdoor air suggest the presence of other emission sources in indoor cabins. These findings emphasize the need for further studies to fully characterize indoor emission sources in order to minimize the negative impact of BTEX exposure to human health. Main Findings: Buses running on natural gas or diesel showed no differences in indoor BTEX levels. Other emission sources of toluene and xylenes in indoor cabins are present. Distinct vehicle uses and/or routines can influence indoor vehicle emissions. BTEX are below guidelines for human health, but above the lowest effect level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Compressed natural gas; Diesel; Indoor exposure; Public transport; Volatile organic compounds","Air quality; Benzene; Diesel engines; Gas emissions; Health; Indoor air pollution; Toluene; Vehicles; Volatile organic compounds; Xylene; Aromatic pollutants; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Diesel; Indoor exposure; Mean concentrations; Passive air sampler; Positive correlations; Public transport; Compressed natural gas; benzene; diesel fuel; ethylbenzene; natural gas; toluene; xylene; 4-xylene; benzene; benzene derivative; ethylbenzene; natural gas; toluene; xylene; BTEX; bus transport; concentration (composition); diesel; health impact; natural gas; pollutant source; pollution exposure; public transport; traffic emission; urban pollution; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; air quality; air sampling; Article; carbon footprint; concentration (parameter); correlational study; environmental exposure; motor vehicle; urban area; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; indoor air pollution; motor vehicle; procedures; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Benzene; Benzene Derivatives; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Motor Vehicles; Natural Gas; Toluene; Vehicle Emissions; Xylenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072270092

At low pyrolysis temperature (300-400 °C), primarily carbon is produced during the reaction time. Rapid pyrolysis takes place at temperatures between 500 and 650 °C. If the temperature is higher than 700 °C, the final product is methane, also known as biogas. The pyrolysis generator can be combined with a small power plant (CHP), which is a promising technology because the unit can be installed directly near the biomass production, and electricity can be fed de-centrally to the public utility network, while there are several possibilities for using waste heat in local systems. Carbonaceous ash can be utilized well in the agricultural field, because, in areas with intensive farming, the soil suffers from carbon and mineral deficiencies, and the phenomenon of material defect can be reduced by a proper level of implementation. This study describes the technical content of the biochar pilot project, and then, through a detailed presentation of the experimental results, we interpret the new scientific results. Our aim is to improve the quality of the produced gas by increasing the efficiency of the pyrolysis generator. In order for the pyrolysis unit to operate continuously, with proper efficiency and good gas quality, it is necessary to optimize the operation process. Our review reveals that the use of vibration may be advantageous during pyrolysis, which affects the mass of the pyrolysis carbon in a plane. Accordingly, the application of vibration to the input section of the funnel might enhance the quality of the gas, as well. The study concludes that more accurate dimensioning of the main parts of the gas reactor and a more convenient design of the oxidation and reduction zones enhance the good-quality gas output. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon cycle; Fixed bed pyrolysis; Oxidation-reduction zone; Reduction of tar in gas; The significance of biomass particle size",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079757396

Restrictive policies may lead some individuals to choose to not travel to otherwise useful or enjoyable activities. This paper therefore explores what factors drive the probability of ‘not travel’ as a behavioural response to restrictive policies. Using stated choice data among car owners in the 10 largest cities in Norway, we investigate observed and unobserved taste variation for ‘not travel’ given different (hypothetical) policies. The empirical evidence suggests that the likelihood of ‘not travel’ (a) is lower for work-related trips; (b) is higher where respondents state they have no decent alternatives; (c) increases with trip distance; and (d) increases with the intensity of the policy. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations illustrating different predicted choice behaviour for car users and public transport users under different types of stylized policies (travel time changes versus travel cost changes). © 2019 The Authors","Diversion; Monte-Carlo simulations; Passenger demand; Restrictive policy; Suppressed demand; Trip cancellation","Behavioral research; Digital storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; River diversion; Travel time; Effective measures; Passenger demands; Passenger transport; Public transport; Suppressed demand; Technological improvements; Trip cancellation; Trip distances; Monte Carlo methods; computer simulation; Monte Carlo analysis; probability; public transport; transportation policy; travel behavior; travel demand; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074293848

The confounding of correlation and connection hinders our understanding of plant strategies, and how these vary among growth forms and climate zones. We identified the direct and indirect connections across plant traits relevant to competition, resource acquisition and reproductive strategies using a global database and explored whether connections within and between traits from different tissue types vary across climates and growth forms. Location: Global. Major taxa studied: Plants. Time period: Present. Methods: We used probabilistic graphical models and a database of 10 plant traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, mass- and area-based leaf nitrogen and phosphorous content, leaf life span, plant height, stem specific density and seed mass) with 16,281 records to describe direct and indirect connections across woody and non-woody plants across tropical, temperate, arid, cold and polar regions. Results: Trait networks based on direct connections are sparser than those based on correlations. Land plants had high connectivity across traits within and between tissue types; leaf life span and stem specific density shared direct connections with all other traits. For both growth forms, two groups of traits form modules of more highly connected traits; one related to resource acquisition, the other to plant architecture and reproduction. Woody species had higher trait network modularity in polar compared to temperate and tropical climates, while non-woody species did not show significant differences in modularity across climate regions. Main conclusions: Plant traits are highly connected both within and across tissue types, yet traits segregate into persistent modules of traits. Variation in the modularity of trait networks suggests that trait connectivity is shaped by prevailing environmental conditions and demonstrates that plants of different growth forms use alternative strategies to cope with local conditions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","leaf traits; plant functional traits; plant strategy integration; seed traits; stem traits; trait interdependence; trait networks","competition (ecology); environmental gradient; functional response; growth form; leaf morphology; reproductive strategy; seed; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071450743

We report high precision atmospheric measurements of CH4 and ethane (C2H6) within and downwind of the PBOF. Biogenic CH4 emissions, due to methanogenic processes within the Arctic tundra, are not co-emitted with C2H6. We show that the thermogenic gas emanating from oil and gas extraction point sources contains on average 1 mol of C2H6 for every 16 mol of CH4. We use a mass balance approach to estimate total emissions of thermogenic CH4 from two days in the summer of 2016 and find 2–5 times greater emissions than the sum of all sources in the PBOF reported to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program in 2016. Although higher than reported, these emissions are much smaller than estimates of CH4 emissions from other oil and natural gas production areas in the US, and they make a very small contribution to total CH4 emissions from the North Slope. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic methane emissions; Fugitive methane emissions; Oil and gas methane emissions; Prudhoe bay; Thermogenic methane","Barium compounds; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Oil fields; Petroleum industry; Atmospheric measurement; Elevated concentrations; Greenhouse gas reporting; Methane emissions; Oil and gas production; Oil and natural gas productions; Prudhoe bay; Thermogenic methane; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; ethane; halocarbon; hydrocarbon; methane; natural gas; biogenic emission; concentration (composition); emission; gas production; methane; natural gas; oil production; point source pollution; pollutant source; aerosol; Alaska; arctic tundra; Article; atmosphere; carbon footprint; humidity; oil and gas field; plume; priority journal; summer; troposphere; wind speed; Alaska; Arctic; North Slope; Prudhoe Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073016473

However, uncertainty in climate change projections will evolve over the 100-year lifetime of a dam as new climate observations become available. Flexible strategies in which infrastructure is proactively designed to be changed in the future have the potential to meet water supply needs without expensive over-building. Evaluating tradeoffs between flexible and traditional static planning approaches requires extension of current paradigms for planning under climate change uncertainty which do not assess opportunities to reduce uncertainty in the future. We develop a new planning framework that assesses the potential to learn about regional climate change over time and therefore evaluates the appropriateness of flexible approaches today. We demonstrate it on a reservoir planning problem in Mombasa, Kenya.

To this end, more effective monitoring and control strategies need to be developed in the near future. In particular, the development of a real-time monitoring technique for the in-cylinder pressure plays a key role. If the use of direct, flush-mounted, in-cylinder pressure sensors is hampered by several disadvantages (harsh environment due to high temperature and pressure, expensive machining to install the sensor inside the combustion chamber), indirect measurement technique could provide relevant benefits. The experimental activity presented in this study was then focused at finding a numerical correlation between the in-cylinder pressure and the mechanical stress of an engine component measured by a strain washer sensor applied to one of the studs of the engine head. The improvement of the working conditions enhances the long-term reliability of the device and it cuts out the installation costs. The activity was performed on a YANMAR four-stroke turbocharged, four-cylinder engine. The main combustion parameters were investigated, such as the peak value, its positioning and the position of the MBF50. Additional experimental tests were carried out for the analysis of transient states in order to assess the capability of the strain washer in detecting phenomena like misfiring and injection variations. The results show the direct comparison between the strain washer and pressure signal, which is considered as benchmark for the assessment of this methodology. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077910263

In this view, the real-time monitoring of the in-cylinder pressure is becoming mandatory in order to ensure the desired levels of performance and efficiency. At the current state of technology, however, the cost and the intrusiveness of pressure sensors, coupled with the harsh operating conditions that limit their lifetime, make the direct measurement of in-cylinder pressure not suitable for mass production applications yet. Therefore, cost-effective and reliable alternative solutions to extract the pressure trace are of major interest. In this study, a methodology for this scope has been developed and validated with experiments. The methodology consists in a two-step procedure; first, the mechanical stress signal coming from a piezoelectric strain washer, installed under one of the engine studs, is considered. Then, this information is coupled with a 0D thermodynamic model, able to estimate the in-cylinder pressure for the entire cycle without combustion. In this way it is possible to compare in real-time the estimated in-cylinder pressure and the mechanical stress measured on the engine stud and to define a direct mathematical correlation between the two. The developed model has proven to properly estimate the correlation between stud stress and in-cylinder pressure, providing a more accurate estimation of the in-cylinder pressure, pressure peak position and maximum value, together with the parameters related to the combustion process. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077882217

In this paper, we show how location data collected by smartphone applications can be exploited to quantify the personal exposure of a large group of people to air pollution. A Bayesian approach that blends air quality monitoring data with individual location data is proposed to assess the individual exposure over time, under uncertainty of both the pollutant level and the individual location. A comparison with personal exposure obtained assuming fixed locations for the individuals is also provided. Location data collected by the Earthquake Network research project are employed to quantify the dynamic personal exposure to fine particulate matter of around 2500 people living in Santiago (Chile) over a 4-month period. For around 30% of individuals, the personal exposure based on people movements emerges significantly different over the static exposure.

The tribal households of Lachen and Lachung in North Sikkim rear yaks at an altitude of 3000 to 5000 m in semi-pastoral system which is highly dependent on temperature and snowfall pattern. Any change in climatic factors is expected to affect the yaks and livelihood of the yak herders. Hence, an explorative study was conducted to understand how the pastoral yak rearing system is changing in the region with change in climate. The estimated temperature increment was 0.03–0.04 °C/annum which is corroborated by herders’ perceptions. They observed that the amount of snowfall has receded, especially in lower altitudes and the snowfall period shifted from November–December to January–March. The commencement of upward migration of yak herders advanced by 15–30 days due to increase in March temperature and the migration span extended by 45 days now. The downward migration is restricted to mid alleviation (2750–3000 m) now which was earlier about 2000 m whereas the upward migration has gone up farther about 500 m due to increasing temperature and unavailability of quality pasture. The study revealed that the pastoral yak rearing in North Sikkim is transforming to cope the impending climate change. However, to reduce the vulnerability of yak, research and extension efforts/policies should be concentrated on fodder production and pasture management suiting to the awaiting climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Agriculture; Snow; Climatic factors; Himalayas; Increasing temperatures; Integral part; Pasture management; Subsistence agriculture; Temperature increment; Climate change; Bos grunniens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074662829

It includes the study of a multi-family residential building in five different climate zones of Spain, i.e., A4 (very hot climate zones), B4 (hot climate zones), C4 (moderate climate zones), D3 (cold climate zones), and E1 (very cold climate zones). The authors accomplished a sensitivity analysis in order to identify the influence of passive strategies (i.e., with regard to solar reflectance) and renewable energy (i.e., with regard to aerothermal energy) on indoor temperatures and energy demands. The increment in indoor temperatures depends on the neighboring buildings so that effect of urban contexts as a source of protection against sunlight is also considered. The increment in the albedo (i.e., the solar reflectance) of the façade during the winter period produces little differences in indoor operative temperatures. On the contrary, during the summer period, it produces large temperature differences. Therefore, it is shown that colors significantly reduce temperatures from 1.24 to 3.04 °C, which means considerable annual energy savings. This research demonstrates that solar reflectance can reduce the air indoor operative temperature down to 4.16 °C during the month of May in the coldest climate zones. As a result of the simulations, it is noted that the coldest climate zones are influenced to a greater extent by the inclusion of their urban contexts in the simulations. However, the heating demand, without considering it, becomes lower. Therefore, ignoring the urban context produces important errors in the heating analysis (12.2% in the coldest climate zones) and also in the cooling analysis (39% in the hottest climate zones). Finally, the use of renewable energy in the configuration of a model with a high urban canyon (Hc), as well as with an east-west building orientation and a low albedo produces a difference of around 76% in the cooling costs within the hottest climate zones and around 73% in the heating costs within the coldest climate zones. The results of this study can be applied as a guideline in early architectural design. © 2019 by the authors.

To analyze these effects, we implement a methodology to link TIMES energy models with life cycle assessment using open-source software. The proposed method uses a cutoff to identify the most relevant processes. These processes have their efficiencies, fuel mixes, and emission factors updated to be consistent with the TIMES model. The use of a cutoff criterion reduces exponentially the number of connection points between models, facilitating the analysis of scenarios with a large number of technologies involved. The method is used to assess the potential effects of deploying low-carbon technologies to reduce combustion emissions in the province of Quebec (Canada). In the case of Quebec, the reduction of combustion emissions is largely achieved through electrification of energy services. Global warming mitigation efforts reduce the impact on human health and ecosystem quality, mainly because of lower global warming, water scarcity, and metal contamination impacts. The TIMES model alone underestimated the reduction of CO2eq by 21% with respect to a full account of emissions.

This work introduces a new approach to integrate the NG-diesel dual-fuel compression ignited (CI) engine, hybrid electric powertrain system, and optimal powertrain control and energy management to consider vehicle performance, fuel efficiency and CO2/HC/CO/NOx emissions simultaneously to address these issues. The mining truck's hybrid powertrain system and component models, including NG engine fuel efficiency and emission models, have been introduced to support the work. An advanced surrogate model based global optimization method is extended to solve the computational intensive, black-box optimization problem for optimal power control and energy management.

As a quick response to the 2013 PM2.5 episodes, the Chinese Government issued the “Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan” as the national strategy and roadmap for air quality improvements consisting of phased quantitative targets and concrete measures. Taking this into account, this study explores the spatiotemporal variations of the five conventional pollutants—PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3—as well as the Air Quality Index and primary pollutants in 338 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2017 in order to comprehensively understand China's current air pollution situation and evaluate the effectiveness of the Action Plan. The results indicate that: (1) the overall air quality has been significantly improved, with the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 decreasing noticeably, although the still high PM level, the dramatically increasing O3 concentration, and the stagnant amounts of NO2 present further challenges, along with the intensification of regional compound air pollution problems; (2) in contrast to the three key regions under the Action Plan exhibiting significant decreases in PM and SO2, the Fen-Wei Plain (FWP) is suffering from serious compound pollution, suggesting that there is an urgent need for the development of a regional joint prevention and control mechanism in the FWP and similar areas; (3) with the exception of the common pollution hot spots mainly concentrated in the FWP as well as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and its surrounding regions, the distribution of each pollutant exhibited remarkable spatial heterogeneity due to their distinctive emission sources, a finding that strongly indicates the need for regionally differentiated management; and (4) the most frequent primary pollutant at the national level was O3, followed by PM2.5 and PM10. In the Wuhan Metropolitan Area (WHM), Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan Metropolitan Area (CZT), and Sichuan-Chongqing Region (CY), PM2.5 pollution is playing the dominant role, while in the FWP, BTH, Yangtze River Delta region (YRD), and Pearl River Delta region (PRD), the synergistic control of PM2.5 and O3 pollutants is urgently needed as soon as possible, which will require that more attention be paid to emission mitigation in the transportation sector, as well as the synergistic control of NOx and VOC emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution prevention and control action plan; China; Conventional pollutants; Spatial and temporal variations","air quality; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; national strategy; particulate matter; pollution control; spatial variation; temporal variation; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; air quality control; ambient air; Article; China; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; concentration process; exhaust gas; human; particulate matter; primary prevention; public policy; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; synergistic effect; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; total quality management; Beijing [China]; Changsha; China; Chongqing; Guangdong; Hebei; Hubei; Hunan; Sichuan; Tianjin; Wuhan; Xiangtan; Zhujiang Delta; Zhuzhou [Hunan]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Quality Improvement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072777883

PM2.5, the atmospheric particulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of less than 2.5 μm, is the most concerning atmospheric pollutant for heath. Pollution control policies are commonly applied nationwide, but atmospheric pollution may vary from one area to another, thus suggesting the need for different, adapted policies. However, there is little knowledge on pollution distribution in China. Therefore, here we used recurrent neural network and random forest models to analyze the wintertime regional PM2.5 patterns in four most polluted cities of China, which are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu, from December 2014 to February 2019. We find that different megacities in China have completely different PM2.5 patterns, which remained unchanged during the past 6 years. CO plays a predominant role in shaping PM2.5 nationwide, and the importance of CO varies from region to region. Therefore, different regional PM2.5 control policies should be carried out for better regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PM2.5 is not strongly linked with time series, inferring that PM2.5 concentrations at a given date are not linked with previous PM2.5 concentrations. This finding suggests that the chemical reaction equilibrium may get reversed and that the rate of chemical reactions of PM2.5 is faster than we normally think. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Feature importance; PM2.5; Random forest; Recurrent neural network",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065670835

Methanogenic archaea contribute to CH4 production in the rice field and control CH4 emission rates; an important greenhouse gas significantly emitted from the rice field. Characteristic of archaeal and methanogenic community in Indonesian rice field has not been well documented. In this study, rice plants grown in the rice field were treated with two different fertilizer applications, i.e., 100% urea without biofertilizer (250 kg ha-1) (B0), and 50% urea (125 kg ha-1) with biofertilizer consisted of methanotrophic bacteria and N2O-reducing bacteria (B1). Soil archaeal community of the two types of fertilization was characterized over the rice-growing period using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The succession and dynamic of the archaeal population were detected in each of the two treatments before fertilizer application (0 days after transplanting [DAT]) until the rice generative phase (69 DAT). During the period, the archaeal soil community in both treatments was dominated by Crenarchaeota. The relative abundance of putative methanogens was higher in the B0 treatment than that of B1 treatment. Within the methanogenic community, Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomassiliicoccaceae which found as most dominant group in both treatments were presumably to be important contributors to CH4 emission. The application of 50% urea with biofertilizer (B1) changed the structure of the archaeal and methanogenic community in the rice field compared to the application of 100% urea (B0). © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Real-time hourly concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and gaseous air pollutants (GAPs) of twenty-two air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs) were obtained from Tehran Air Quality Control Company (TAQCC) in 2017. Annual mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10–2.5, and PM10 (PMX) ranged from 21.7 to 40.5, 37.3 to 75.0 and 58.0 to 110.4 μg m−3, respectively. Annual mean PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were higher than the World Health Organization air quality guideline (WHO AQG) and national standard levels. NO2, O3, SO2 and CO annual mean concentrations ranged from 27.0 to 76.8, 15.5 to 25.1, 4.6 to 12.2 ppb, and 1.9 to 3.8 ppm over AQMSs, respectively. Our generated spatial maps exhibited that ambient PMX concentrations increased from the north into south and south-western areas as the hotspots of ambient PMX in Tehran. O3 hotspots were observed in the north and south-west, while NO2 hotspots were in the west and south. COD values of PMX demonstrated more results lower than the 0.2 cut off compared to GAPs; indicating high to moderate spatial homogeneity for PMX and moderate to high spatial heterogeneity for GAPs. Regarding CV approach, the spatial variabilities of air pollutants followed in the order of O3 (87.3%) &gt; SO2 (65.2%) &gt; CO (61.8%) &gt; PM10–2.5 (52.5%) &gt; PM2.5 (48.9%) &gt; NO2 (48.1%) &gt; PM10 (42.9%), which were mainly in agreement with COD results, except for NO2.

Manganese-based deNOx catalysts have attracted much attention owing to their unstable valence states. Nickel-foam-supported manganese-based catalysts show excellent low-temperature deNOx activities. However, the detailed deNOx mechanism is still unclear. In this paper, the adsorption mechanism of NH3, NO, and O2 molecules over nickel-foam-supported manganese-based catalysts was studied by a density functional theory. The model of MnO2, Mn2O3, and Mn3O4 clusters loading on the Ni (111) surface was chosen. The results show that MnO2, Mn2O3, and Mn3O4 clusters can be stably adsorbed on the Ni (111) surface accompanied by charge redistributions, which provide a large number of stable adsorption sites for gas molecules. NH3 molecule can be adsorbed on the Ni-top and Mn sites as the coordinated NH3. For MnO2, Mn2O3, and Mn3O4 clusters, Mn3O4 clusters are the most favorable for NH3 adsorption, indicating that they can promote NH3-SCR reaction. NO exists in three adsorption states on the MnxOy/Ni (111) surface and forms different nitrite or nitrate species. Interestingly, NO molecule tends to adsorb on the hollow site of Ni (111) surface. O2 molecule has various adsorption states on the MnxOy/Ni (111) surface. NO molecule is more likely to be adsorbed on the Mn site of the O2–MnxOy/Ni (111) surface to form nitrosyl structure, and some of NO molecules can react with adsorbed oxygen to form the adsorbed NO2 spices, which can facilitate the SCR deNOx reaction. The catalytic activity of Mn3O4/Ni (111) surface is higher than those of MnO2/Ni (111) and Mn2O3/Ni (111) surfaces by comparing the work functions and adsorption properties of NH3, NO, and O2 molecules. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Adsorption; Ammonia; Catalyst activity; Density functional theory; Manganese oxide; Molecules; Nickel; Nitrogen oxides; Selective catalytic reduction; Temperature; Adsorption mechanism; Adsorption properties; Charge redistribution; De-NOx catalysts; Density functional theory studies; Low temperatures; Selective catalytic reduction of NOx; Stable adsorption; Manganese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071222680

Accurate estimation of forest biomass is important for global carbon accounting and afforestation policy making, yet saturated reflectance signals over vegetation and a shortage of cloud-free images during the growing season largely limit the utility of optical remote sensing for biomass estimation of planted forests in subtropical and tropical regions. Stand age is a crucial factor in determining forest growth and stand development but hasn't been widely used in remote sensing-based biomass estimation approaches. The main objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of an allometric analysis approach combined with Landsat-derived forest age structure to estimate stand biomass of fast-growing forest plantations in a subtropical landscape of China. We used the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) approach and Landsat time series data from 1986 to 2016 to detect annual stand-replacing disturbance and estimate forest stand age. Allometric equations and relative growth rate functions were combined to establish the linkage between tree biomass and forest stand age. We also modeled the spatial distribution of tree biomass using a conventional remote sensing (CRS) method that only utilizes spectral and textural variables and an extended CRS method that incorporates stand age (CRS_EX). We then compared the CRS and CRS_EX methods with the allometric analysis method to highlight the importance of stand age and post-disturbance forest regrowth for biomass estimation. The Landsat-derived disturbance history was significantly correlated with stand age (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 3.7 year, p &lt; 0.01). The CRS_EX and allometric analysis methods substantially improved tree biomass estimates (R2 CRS_EX = 0.77, RMSECRS_EX = 37.7 t/ha; R2 Allometric = 0.70, RMSEAllometric = 43.5 t/ha) compared to the CRS method (R2 CRS = 0.53, RMSE CRS = 54.38 t/ha). Tree biomass estimated from the allometric analysis method aligned better with the allometric growth curves, while CRS_EX and CRS methods both exhibited notable overestimation for young and mid-aged forests. This study suggests that allometric models have the potential to be applied in subtropical forest plantations through the use of the existing forest stand development knowledge and increasingly open access remote sensing data. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Allometric equation; Chinese fir plantation; Disturbance history; Forest age; Landsat time series; Tree biomass","Biomass; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Time series; Tropics; Vegetation; Allometric equations; Chinese fir; Disturbance history; Forest age; Landsat time series; Tree biomass; Ecology; aboveground biomass; allometry; coniferous tree; disturbance; forest edge; Landsat; plantation forestry; subtropical region; time series analysis; Cunninghamia lanceolata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073761550

This paper focuses on the bike-sharing rebalancing problem (BRP), which consists of two aspects: determining desired demands at each station and designing routes to redistribute bikes among stations. For the first task, we firstly apply the random forest, a very efficient machine learning algorithm, to forecast desired demands for each station, which can be easily implemented with distributed computing. For the second task, it belongs to the broad class of the vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery (VRPPD). In most existing settings, all of the demands being strictly satisfied can lead to longer routes and add operational costs. In this paper, we propose a new model with unserved demands by relaxing demands satisfying constraints. Then, we design a distributed ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm with some specific modifications to increase its efficiency for the proposed model. We propose to use the percentage of average cost saving per bike as a metric to evaluate the performance of our method on cost-reducing and compare with existing methods and best-known values. Computational results on benchmarks show the advantage of our approach. Finally, we provide a real case study of BSS in Hangzhou, China, with insightful elaborations. © 2019 Fan et al.

This study aims to enhance our understanding of how, why, and with what effect such entrepreneurs operate to cross boundaries. As this requires an account of both entrepreneurial strategy and the surrounding policy environment, we embed entrepreneurship in the policy frameworks of multiple streams, advocacy coalitions, and punctuated equilibrium. We use qualitative methods to analyse policy development for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Kenya. CSA is a cross-cutting strategy to sustainably increase agricultural productivity, resilience, and food security while curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Our results demonstrate that policy entrepreneurs target varying ideas, interests, and institutions across boundaries in order to establish cross-boundary linkages, but this requires additional resources including connections, funding, and time. Simultaneously, this process offers opportunities, for instance, regarding choice of audience and potential resources to tap. Cross-boundary entrepreneurial strategies include venue shopping to soften up communities; framing CSA in multiple ways to address different audiences; demonstrating brokerage between coalitions through impartial leadership and creating a neutral institutional setting; and process manipulation to bypass complexities arising from the scattered policy environment. Although entrepreneurs managed to realize the adoption of a Kenya CSA strategy, the process displays limited changes in policymakers’ ideas; the policy remains the main responsibility of the agriculture ministry alone and receives limited support from local authorities. This raises questions regarding the cross-boundary nature and implementability of this strategy. © 2019, The Author(s).","Advocacy coalition framework; Climate-smart agriculture; Multiple streams approach; Policy entrepreneurship; Policy process; Punctuated equilibrium theory","advocacy; agricultural policy; agricultural production; entrepreneur; food security; policy approach; policy development; productivity; qualitative analysis; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069631012

This research aimed to analyze carbon sequestration potential on macroalgae Kappaphycus striatum with different harvested ages; i.e. young (25 days) and adult (60 days). Samples were collected randomly from off-bottom seaweed aquaculture system, at Alaang village, Alor island, East Nusa Tenggara. The parameter observed was carbon content determined by using gravimetric analysis. Growth rate measurement and light-dark bottle experiment were also conducted to be further analyzed. Results showed in total area 1,552 m2, it was estimated that the carbon sequestration potential of macroalgae Kappaphycus striatum was 13.28 tonnes C/cycle for young and 26.63 tonnes C/cycle for adult. These results were equal to 66.07 tonnes C/ha/cycle and 125.51 tonnes C/ha/cycle, respectively. Therefore, the carbon sequestration potential of adult seaweed was higher about 32.78% than that of young seaweed, followed by its lower growth rate and higher primary productivity. It can be concluded that the carbon sequestration potential was influenced by growth rate and primary productivity. Further study on sustainable management of seaweed aquaculture sites, by considering ecological and economic values, could potentially provide multiple functions both for human and ecosystem. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","adult; carbon; seaweed; sequestration; young","Bottles; Climate change; Ecology; Engineers; Fisheries; Gravimetric analysis; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Rural areas; Seaweed; Sustainable development; adult; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Ecological and economic; Primary productivity; sequestration; Sustainable management; young; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079023012

To map the LCZs in a city, the World Urban Database and Portal Tool is used as conventional method. However, this requires the assignment of training areas for each LCZ, which entails local knowledge of the area and may introduce errors, as distinction between LCZ types through visual inspection is inconclusive. This paper aims to develop a methodology and GIS tool to enhance and automate the mapping of LCZs using seven LCZ properties (sky view factor, building surface fraction, pervious surface fraction, impervious surface fraction, building height, roughness length, and surface albedo), and apply it in Quezon City, Philippines which comprises varying land use and land cover. Fuzzy Logic was used to determine the membership percentage of 100 m cells to an LCZ type based on these properties. Cellular Automata was implemented using Python to derive the LCZ map from the fuzzy layers. Results show that seven out of ten built-up LCZs and five out of seven land cover LCZs were identified. Through visual inspection on a basemap, the mapped LCZs was confirmed to match with the features of the city.

However, the gaseous state of CO2 does render the indefinite storage of this greenhouse gas challenging. Herein, we created a liquid metal electrocatalyst that contains metallic elemental cerium nanoparticles, which facilitates the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to layered solid carbonaceous species, at a low onset potential of −310 mV vs CO2/C. We exploited the formation of a cerium oxide catalyst at the liquid metal/electrolyte interface, which together with cerium nanoparticles, promoted the room temperature reduction of CO2. Due to the inhibition of van der Waals adhesion at the liquid interface, the electrode was remarkably resistant to deactivation via coking caused by solid carbonaceous species. The as-produced solid carbonaceous materials could be utilised for the fabrication of high-performance capacitor electrodes. Overall, this liquid metal enabled electrocatalytic process at room temperature may result in a viable negative emission technology. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon nanotube; cerium oxide; electrolyte; metal; nanoparticle; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; catalyst; electrochemical method; electrode; exploitation; liquid; metal; reduction; solid; temperature effect; adhesion; Article; current density; electrochemical analysis; liquid; room temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062077373

According to the recently revised Section 45Q tax credits, said credits will be provided for implementing CCS, which is motivating some United States (US) electricity generation companies to revisit their business strategies for CCS. This paper discusses alternative business models being considered by companies for undertaking CCS, including providing a ‘template’ for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of CCS with Section 45Q tax credits and storage in saline reservoirs. Using stylized illustrative examples, the paper indicates how use of Section 45Q tax credits should be expected to change dispatch at an electricity generating unit. For situations similar to the examples, the paper suggests that Section 45Q tax credits may need to be modified to achieve its intended impact. Modifications can include extending the time period of tax credit availability beyond the current 12 years. In addition, continued R&amp;D investments in CCS and specific support for first-of-a-kind CCS demonstrations would be valuable complements for the deployment of the Section 45Q tax credit. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon capture and storage; CCS business models; costs of carbon capture; costs of geologic storage; electrical generation units; modeling tax credits; Section 45Q tax credits","Chemical industry; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Taxation; Business models; Business strategy; Electrical generation; Electricity generation; Electricity industry; Geologic storage; Important features; Tax credits; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; electricity generation; electricity industry; fossil fuel; tax system; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073986608

We explore the interface between worldviews, power relations and policy interventions, focusing in particular on the way that asymmetric gender and expert-farmer relations may be reinforced or contested through climate-smart agricultural interventions. It has been argued that fundamental changes required in the face of climate change can only take place through transformation across the personal, practical and political spheres. In particular, it is in the interaction between these spheres where spaces for transformation lie; for example, in the contesting of subjectivities casting farmers as passive recipients of expert advice, in the assumptions regarding what constitutes “good development”, and in how worldviews frame the way we see human-nature relations. Nevertheless, interventions like CSA are often focused mainly on changes to practices or technologies, rather than on how power relations or worldviews shape practices, food security and inequity. Through a case study of Hoima, Uganda, we examine the ways in which the implementation of climate-smart agriculture reinforces existing subjectivities and authority relations or opens up for new (and potentially more emancipatory) subjectivities. First, we describe food security and social inequality drawing on survey data from Hoima. Next, we examine how social actors such as farmers, project workers, local leaders, and government officials position particular farmers or practices as good/progressive or problematic/traditional. We then analyze how these subjectivities reflect authority relations, and the ways in which CSA reinforces or creates space for contesting these. We argue that a focus on commercial agriculture as “good” by many social actors also persists within CSA activities, and is intertwined with asymmetric gender and expert-farmer relations. Commercialization takes place within the need to increase agricultural production to feed growing urban populations. However, commercialization for the case of Uganda has also entailed state attempts to govern farmers through farmer associations, the institutional set-up through which CSA often works. A closer attention to these dynamics could potentially help create deeper transformational change through climate-smart agriculture and related climate change interventions. © Copyright © 2019 Eriksen, Cramer, Vetrhus and Thornton.","Africa; climate change adaptation; climate-smart agriculture; gender; power relations; subjectivity; worldviews",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077568475

Two structural responses, “canopy-opening” and “below-ground-mass-depletion”, govern the photoacclimatory response and facilitate, respectively, light penetration within the canopy and functional adjustments in whole-plant carbon balances. Conversely, “canopy-closing” may also explain dense canopies formed close to the waterline, as they provide shade and photoprotection to a susceptible leaf physiology under high-light. Canopy light attenuation is primarily regulated by the leaf area index (LAI), which is governed by changes in shoot size and density. Shoot density diminishes non-linearly with depth, while shoot size increases to a maximum followed by a decline. The initial increase in shoot size, which resembles a self-thinning response, increases LAI and meadow production in shallow depths. These seagrass structural adjustments have relevant ecological implications. Canopy-thinning allows macrophyte diversity to increase with depth, while seagrass production and carbon storage diminish exponentially, and are maximal only in a shallow coastal fringe. The results support the universality of plant self-thinning, from phytoplankton to complex canopies, likely the consequence of simple physical laws related to light limitation and pigment self-shading within photosynthetic structures and communities. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon; sea water; acclimatization; aquatic species; carbon cycle; chemistry; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; light; metabolism; physiology; plant leaf; Poaceae; radiation response; shoot; Acclimatization; Aquatic Organisms; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Ecosystem; Light; Plant Leaves; Plant Shoots; Poaceae; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073104664

To achieve our goals, grain size, total organic carbon, planktic and benthic foraminifera, dinoflagellate cysts have been investigated. Few micropalaentological studies have been done in the studied area and none of them used the combined proxies of benthic foraminifera and dinoflagellate cyst. Theses combined proxies reflects more comprehensive paleoenvironmental view. Biotic and abiotic data have been analysed with multivariate technique including Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Diversity indices such as: Fisher alpha index (α) and Shannon index (H) have been applied. The foraminiferal study yields 9 planktic species and 10 benthic species. Foraminiferal assemblages have low species diversity indices especially at sapropel layer S1. Mediterranean sapropels are layers with elevated organic carbon concentrations that contrast with surrounding organic poor sediments. Sapropels occur periodically in sedimentary sequences of the last millions years, which have been the subject of extensive previous study. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) yields two groups of foraminiferal assemblages depending on the changes of total organic carbon and clay content. The dinocysts study yields 15 species, the majority of cyst types belonging to the order Gonyaulacales. The association of dinoflagellate cyst shows two depositional phases in the sediment. The sapropel layer S1, with anoxic condition and warmer temperature, is recorded at depth 28–46 cm where heterotrophic taxa dominate and the post-sapropel layer is recorded at depth 0–28 cm; where autotrophic taxa dominate. © 2019, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","dinoflagellate cysts; offshore Egypt; paleoenvironmental changes; planktic and benthic foraminifera",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075133276

Previous research suggests that partially distinct cortical networks are active during verb and noun processing, but what information do these networks represent? We used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to investigate whether these networks are sensitive to lexicosemantic distinctions among verbs and among nouns and, if so, whether they are more sensitive to distinctions among words in their preferred grammatical class. Participants heard 4 types of verbs (light emission, sound emission, hand-related actions, mouth-related actions) and 4 types of nouns (birds, mammals, manmade places, natural places). As previously shown, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (LMTG+), and inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) responded more to verbs, whereas the inferior parietal lobule (LIP), precuneus (LPC), and inferior temporal (LIT) cortex responded more to nouns. MVPA revealed a double-dissociation in lexicosemantic sensitivity: classification was more accurate among verbs than nouns in the LMTG+, and among nouns than verbs in the LIP, LPC, and LIT. However, classification was similar for verbs and nouns in the LIFG, and above chance for the nonpreferred category in all regions. These results suggest that the lexicosemantic information about verbs and nouns is represented in partially nonoverlapping networks. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

This increase is making local authorities suffering in waste management when they are using traditional technics (collect and dumping in landfill). This study is aiming to characterize solid waste in this region for suitable management. Based on samples collected from trucks arriving to landfill site (4 km from Khenifra city), we used characterization method (MODECOM references) to distinguish between three fraction size particles (large, > 250 mm; medium, 250–80 mm; fine, < 80 mm) and 10 categories (organic materials, paper, cardboard, plastics …). This operation is repeated on 4 sectors in Khenifra region with a frequency of 2 campaigns in the season. A matter characterization has been done on the fine fraction (< 80 mm) to facilitate monitoring procedure and reducing environmental emissions. As results, during the two campaigns, the household waste is mainly composed by fermentable waste between 66 and 69%, and the rest is packaging waste (paper, paperboard, glass, textile, and plastic). The glass percentage is significantly varying on the two periods with a large difference between rural and urban sectors. The waste humidity is 67–85% successively in dry and wet season.

The ratios of carbon stored to carbon uptake and water loss to carbon gain are key ecophysiological indicators essential to assess the magnitude and response of the terrestrial plant to the changing climate. Here, we use estimates from 10 terrestrial ecosystem models to quantify the impacts of climate, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and nitrogen (N) deposition on water use efficiency (WUE), and carbon use efficiency (CUE). We find that across models, WUE increases over the 20th Century particularly due to CO2 fertilization and N deposition and compares favorably to experimental studies. Also, the results show a decrease in WUE with climate for the last 3 decades, in contrasts with up-scaled flux observations that demonstrate a constant WUE. Modeled WUE responds minimally to climate with modeled CUE exhibiting no clear trend across space and time. The divergence between simulated and observationally-constrained WUE and CUE is driven by modeled NPP and autotrophic respiration, nitrogen cycle, carbon allocation, and soil moisture dynamics in current ecosystem models. We suggest that carbon-modeling community needs to reexamine stomatal conductance schemes and the soil-vegetation interactions for more robust modeling of carbon and water cycles. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073152142

To identify such an alternative, this study examines the strength and microstructural properties of marine clay-cemented mixes, using two extreme preparation methods to understand which sample preparation technique better mimics the in situ behavior of the mix; further, it proposes a solution that is both environment friendly and economical. To this end, three marine clay specimens were produced through cementation and subjected to in situ grinding and ped-compaction in an unconfined compression test to evaluate the structure of the specimens. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was conducted to analyze the microstructure formed in the ped and ground specimens due to cementation. Results revealed that finely ground marine clay offered a homogeneous mixing opportunity that led to reduced pore space and allowed the following four discrete processes to be conducted—cation exchange, flocculation and agglomeration, cement hydration, and pozzolanic reaction. These processes further increased the strength of the marine clay to approximately three times that of the ped-compacted specimen. Nevertheless, ped compaction still achieved strengths similar to in situ clay strength, which satisfies the strength requirements of applications such as minor road subbase, rammed earth wall, and structural fill. Furthermore, the proposed solution resulted in a reduction of embodied energy, effort required for compaction to specific unit weight, and energy consumption of grinding process; thereby reducing carbon foot print and overall costs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cementation; Cemented marine clay; Embodied energy; Grind compaction; In situ compaction; Marine clay microstructure; Ped compaction; Scanning electron microscopy; Unconfined compression test","Cementing (shafts); Compaction; Compression testing; Energy utilization; Grinding (machining); Hydration; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Walls (structural partitions); Cementation; Embodied energy; Engineering community; Environmental problems; Marine clays; Micro-structural properties; Sample preparation techniques; Unconfined compression tests; Soil testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070648376

However, empirical evidence about past glacier states at regional or global scales is largely incomplete, both spatially and temporally, calling for the use of automated numerical methods. This study presents a new way to initialize the Open Global Glacier Model from past climate information and present-day glacier states. We use synthetic experiments to show that even with these perfectly known but incomplete boundary conditions, the problem of model initialization is an ill-posed inverse problem leading to nonunique solutions, and we propose an ensemble approach as a way forward. The method works as follows: we generate a large set of physically plausible glacier candidates for a given year in the past (e.g., 1850 in the Alps), all of which are then modeled forward to the date of the observed glacier outline and evaluated by comparing the results of the forward runs to the present-day states. We test the approach on 2660 Alpine glaciers and determine error estimates of the method from the synthetic experiments. The results show that the solution is often nonunique, as many of the reconstructed initial states converge towards the observed state in the year of observation. We find that the median state of the best 5&thinsp;% of all acceptable states is a reasonable best estimate. The accuracy of the method depends on the type of the considered observation for the evaluation (glacier length, area, or geometry). Trying to find past states from only present-day length instead of the full geometry leads to a sharp increase in uncertainty. Our study thus also provides quantitative information on how well the reconstructed initial glacier states are constrained through the limited information available to us. We analyze which glacier characteristics influence the reconstructability of a glacier, and we discuss ways to develop the method further for real-world applications.</p>. © Author(s) 2019.",,"boundary condition; climate modeling; geometry; glacier; inverse problem; numerical model; quantitative analysis; uncertainty analysis; Alps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076678999

Because roots are challenging to measure in situ, data are sparse, and this has limited our understanding of root allocation across a range of forest types. Increased sampling in the oceanic and cool temperate forests of the southern hemisphere means we are now able to better understand biomass allocation in this biome. Here we compile and systematically review root:shoot ratios for these forests and examine the taxonomic, regional, and environmental determinants of variability in biomass allocation to roots. Specifically, we assess whether limited access to resources resulting from low temperatures or low rainfall:temperature ratios increases root allocation. A literature and database search identified 441 root:shoot records from 25 studies and 32 locations around the South Pacific. Records were weighted by excavated area as a measure of sampling effort. Root:shoot ratios for eucalypts in southeast Australia (0.277) and southern beech in South America (0.275) were 6–7% above the global mean of 0.26, while southern beech (0.233) and other dicots (0.234) in New Zealand were consistent with values reported for temperate (mostly northern hemisphere) broadleaved forests. Low root:shoot ratios (of trees ≥5 cm stem diameter) relative to the global mean were noted for South American gymnosperms (0.219), seemingly driven by low values in the Cupressaceae, and New Zealand tree ferns (0.194). Size effects were taxon dependent, with a marked decline in root:shoot ratios with increasing stem size for the southern beech in South America and modest effects for other combinations of taxa and region. A clear signal of increasing root allocation with declining rainfall:temperature ratios was detected, but no major effects of temperature were noted within the range of the data. Our findings support current approaches to biomass and carbon estimation but leave room for refinement, with specific recommendations given for the New Zealand context. © 2019","Below-ground biomass; Eucalyptus; Nothofagaceae; Root:shoot ratio; Tree fern; Tree size","Biomass; Rain; Search engines; Temperature; Eucalyptus; Ground biomass; Nothofagaceae; Root: shoot ratios; Tree fern; Tree size; Forestry; belowground biomass; biomass allocation; low temperature; root; root-shoot ratio; Southern Hemisphere; temperate forest; Biomass; Distribution; Eucalyptus; Forestry; Forests; Rain; Ratios; Temperature; Australia; New Zealand; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); South America; Cupressaceae; Dicotyledoneae; Eucalyptus; Fagus; Filicophyta; Gymnospermae; Nothofagaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071991170

However, the future habitability of these countries will critically depend on the response of inhabited and exploited islands to ocean-climate pressures. Here, using the Maldives as a case study and based on a database including 608 islands (representing 56.8% and 86.0% of the country’s land area and population, respectively), we assess the influence of human disturbances on island natural response capacity over the last decade. We show that over the last decade, island change was rapid and primarily controlled by anthropogenic drivers. The great majority of inhabited and exploited islands now exhibit an altered-to-annihilated capacity to respond to ocean-climate pressures, which has major implications for future research and adaptation strategies. First, future studies should consider not only climate, but also anthropogenic tipping points (in contrast to climate tipping points). Second, adaptation strategies must be implemented without delay, despite climate uncertainties, in order to contain any additional detrimental path-dependency effects. This study provides critical information for better addressing the attribution issue under climate change, and a replicable rapid assessment frame. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; climate change; human; Maldives; sea; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073759847

In human homolog, the substitution of Mn2+ with Co2+ significantly reduces the Km value without affecting the kcat. However, in the Helicobacter pylori counterpart (important for pathogenesis), the kcat increases nearly 4-fold with Co2+ ions both in the recombinant holoenzyme and arginase isolated from H. pylori grown with Co2+ or Mn2+. This suggests that the active site of arginase in the two homologs is modulated differently by these two metal ions. To investigate the underlying mechanism for metal-induced difference in catalytic activity in the H. pylori enzyme, we used biochemical, biophysical and microsecond molecular dynamics simulations studies. The study shows that the difference in binding affinity of Co2+ and Mn2+ ions with the protein is linked to a different positioning of a loop (-122HTAYDSDSKHIHG134-) that contains a conserved catalytic His133. Consequently, the proximity of His133 and conserved Glu281 is varied. We found that the Glu281- His133 interaction is crucial for catalytic function and was previously unexplored in other homologs. We suggest that the proximity difference between these two residues in the Co2+- and Mn2+-proteins alters the proportion of protonated His133 via variation in its pKa. This affects the efficiency of proton transfer - an essential step of L-arginine hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by arginase and thus activity. Unlike in human arginase, the flexibility of the above segment observed in H. pylori homolog suggests that this region in the H. pylori enzyme may be explored to design its specific inhibitors. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"arginase; cobalt; manganese; metal; arginase; arginine; bacterial protein; mutant protein; protein binding; proton; Article; binding affinity; biochemical analysis; catalysis; Helicobacter pylori; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; priority journal; proton transport; biocatalysis; chemistry; circular dichroism; enzyme active site; enzymology; fluorescence polarization; Helicobacter pylori; kinetics; metabolism; pH; Arginase; Arginine; Bacterial Proteins; Biocatalysis; Catalytic Domain; Circular Dichroism; Cobalt; Fluorescence Polarization; Helicobacter pylori; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Manganese; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Mutant Proteins; Protein Binding; Protons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076329834

Large-scale afforestation has been implemented over the past three decades in northern China. The ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) connects the carbon cycle and water cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems and is defined as the ratio of the gross primary productivity (GPP) to the evapotranspiration. However, there are still an insufficient number of studies on the impact of the afforestation on the WUE. In this study, we applied the random forest (RF) model to explore the impacts of climate and nonclimate factors on the WUE in northern China. The results showed that in areas with high precipitation, the forests had the highest WUE, while in the arid areas, the croplands had the highest WUE. Of the total area, 44.34% showed a significant increase, and 5.89% showed a significant decrease in the WUE from 1982-2015 in northern China. The main driving factors for the changes in the WUE were climate factors, including the precipitation, temperature and solar radiation, which contributed to approximately 84% of the WUE trends, while human activities, such as afforestation, contributed to approximately 16% of the WUE trends. Overall, although the climate had a larger impact on the WUE dynamics than the human activities, our results suggested that the impacts of the afforestation programs on forest carbon and water cycles should be considered in the context of climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Afforestation; GLASS; MODIS; Random forest; Spatiotemporal dynamic; WUE","Arid regions; Carbon; Climate models; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Glass; Reforestation; Water resources; Water supply; Afforestation; Arid and semi-arid regions; Global climate changes; Gross primary productivity; Large-scale afforestation; MODIS; Random forests; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076560001

However, when used in reactors, serpentine minerals need to be activated to promote Mg2+ leaching. In this study, ground and unground samples have been thermally activated in a muffle furnace at different temperatures and residence times. Their mineralogical composition have been determined using XRD coupled with Rietveld refinements from which the amorphous phases have been distinguished and quantified. The objectives are to determine the influence of the particle size distribution of the samples on the dehydroxylation process and on the dissolution under aqueous mineral carbonation reaction. Results show that in a muffle furnace, unground particles tend to heat faster than ground particles. This is due to the larger spaces left between the particles, allowing a better heat diffusion through the sample. In ground particles samples, water vapor tends to be entrapped in those space, leading to the formation of a water vapor layer, slowing down the heat process. Carbonation experiments were performed on the different resulting fractions obtained. Regarding Mg dissolution efficiencies, 6 batches experiments show that Mg2+ extraction is higher when performed on sample ground prior to thermal activation. The collected information will advance the knowledge on serpentine heat activation mechanism and help to improve carbonation technologies efficiencies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonation; Dehydroxylation; Heat activation; Magnesium leaching; Particle size; Rietveld refinement; Serpentine; X-Ray diffraction","Carbonation; Chemical activation; Dissolution; Efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Leaching; Particle size analysis; Residence time distribution; Rietveld refinement; Serpentine; Water vapor; X ray diffraction; Dehydroxylations; Dissolution efficiencies; Heat activation; Mineral carbonation; Mineralogical compositions; Serpentine minerals; Thermal activation; Thermally activated; Particle size; aqueous solution; carbon dioxide; dehydroxylation; dissolution; leaching; magnesium; mineralogy; particle size; Rietveld analysis; serpentine; X-ray diffraction; Canada; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071844663

Ligustrum lucidum, native to temperate Asia, is one of the most invasive plant species in the world. Climate is an important ecological factor influencing species distribution. Therefore, we investigated the climatic niche of L. lucidum in various regions of the world to determine whether it uses different climatic conditions in its invasive ranges than in its native range. The geographical coordinates of its occurrence were extracted from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and Southern African Plant Invaders Atlas databases. Climatic variables and altitude data were obtained from WorldClim. We evaluated niche overlap and performed niche similarity tests, and estimated niche shift parameters. L. lucidum occurs mostly in warm temperate climates. Niche overlap between native and invaded areas was low. Niche similarity tests indicated that the species could expand its occurrence into regions with climates similar to and different from that of its native range. We concluded that L. lucidum uses different realized climatic niches in its invasive ranges than in its native range. Warmer and wetter climatic conditions may not necessarily constrain this species from establishing populations outside of its native range. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"altitude; article; biodiversity; climate; human; Ligustrum lucidum; nonhuman; plant leaf; biodiversity; climate; climate change; ecosystem; Ligustrum; Biodiversity; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Ligustrum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062639738

Dangerous wildfire events such as these could potentially be influenced by anthropogenic climate change, however, there are large knowledge gaps on how these events might change in the future. The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) is used to represent near-surface weather conditions and the Continuous Haines index (CH) is used here to represent lower to mid-tropospheric vertical atmospheric stability and humidity measures relevant to dangerous wildfires and pyroconvective processes. Projected changes in extreme measures of CH and FFDI are examined using a multi-method approach, including an ensemble of global climate models together with two ensembles of regional climate models. The projections show a clear trend towards more dangerous near-surface fire weather conditions for Australia based on the FFDI, as well as increased pyroconvection risk factors for some regions of southern Australia based on the CH.

It notes that environmental regulation divides the Republican and Democratic Parties but that the response of individual party members may be more nuanced, particularly amongst younger voters. The Article comments on state level initiatives to counteract the effects of climate change that have gathered bipartisan support but are now subject to partisan actions by the federal government designed to limit their effectiveness. The Article concludes with the observation that as the combination of an aging demographic and alignment with a declining fossil fuel industry shrinks the GOP traditional constituency, it is to be hoped that far-sighted politicians from both parties will embrace credibility on this issue as a key component of enhancing their own as well as the planet's survival. © 2019 Valentina Dotto et al., published by Sciendo.","Environmental Federalism; Environmental Partisanship; State-level Bipartisan Initiatives; U.S. Withdrawal from the Paris Climate Change Agreement",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106855760

Daily isotopic measurements of rainfall (2014–2017, Rio Claro, Southeast of Brazil) were used to identify the climatic factors governing the isotopic variability. Overall, precipitation presented large variations, ranging between −18.36‰ and +4.89‰ for δ18O, −136‰ to + 43.4‰ for δ2H, and −11.8‰ to +26.6‰ for d-excess. The Local Meteoric Water Line (δ2H = 8.05 ± 0.1·δ18O + 13.08 ± 0.5) indicated a strong influence of moisture recirculation along the transport of air masses. During the summer (wet season), high moisture content prevailed in the atmosphere. The latter was associated with recycled moisture from Amazonia region due to the influence of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone and Frontal Systems, resulting in depleted precipitation (δ18O ≤ −6‰). During the winter (dry season), the combination of Cold Fronts and minimal moisture transport from the Amazonia region, resulted in more enriched rainfall (δ18O ≥ −1‰). Atmospheric recirculation processes along the moisture pathway were also reflected on the seasonal d-excess variation. The strong correlation of δ18O and relative humidity along HYSPLIT trajectories confirmed the influence of regional atmospheric dynamics over isotopic composition of precipitation.

I use a difference-in-differences approach to compare pollution reductions at power plants located in states subject to more uncertainty to plants in states that that were not. I find that plants with a lower probability of being regulated invested in fewer capital-intensive pollution controls and reduced pollution by 13% less on average.

OA is of particular concern for coral reefs, as the associated reduction in carbonate ion availability impairs biogenic calcification and promotes dissolution of carbonate substrata. While these trends ultimately affect ecosystem calcification, scaling experimental analyses of the response of organisms to OA to consider the response of ecosystems to OA has proved difficult. The benchmark of ecosystem-level experiments to study the effects of OA is provided through Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (FOCE), which we use in the present analyses for a 21-d experiment on the back reef of Mo’orea, French Polynesia. Two natural coral reef communities were incubated in situ, with one exposed to ambient pCO2 (393 µatm), and one to high pCO2 (949 µatm). Our results show a decrease in 24-h net community calcification (NCC) under high pCO2, and a reduction in nighttime NCC that attenuated and eventually reversed over 21-d.

Multiple genomes encode enzymes for anaerobic oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic compounds, including those of candidate phyla Aerophobetes, Aminicenantes, TA06 and Bathyarchaeota. Microbial interactions are predicted to be driven by acetate and molecular hydrogen. These findings are supported by sediment geochemistry, metabolomics, and thermodynamic modelling.

Due to climate change, it is advisable to identify the vulnerable area and to investigate if the local reservoir network of hundreds of larger reservoirs and thousands of smaller reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate-induced hydrologic variation. Therefore, the local high-density reservoir network is integrated into a distributed hydrologic model (HMS) through a fully coupled reservoir module. We then apply the extended HMS in a one-way coupled mode to the bias corrected Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment in East Asia (CORDEX-EA) regional climate simulations under two Representative Concentration Pathways – RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results indicate that climate change poses new challenges to water resources management for the PLB, with a likely decrease of water availability in the dry season but an increase of water availability, flood magnitude and flood frequency in the flood season till 2049. The local reservoir network can mitigate climate impacts by displacing excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season and mitigating floods across the basin. Despite that, much of the southern basin is likely to see a higher risk of water shortage in the dry season, while most of the northern basin is expected to see a higher flood risk. The approach and findings are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs in the context of climate change, and provide implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation strategies on a regional scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate impact; Floods; Hydrologic modelling; Reservoir network","Climate change; Drought; Floods; Lakes; Reservoir management; Climate change adaptation; Climate impacts; Distributed hydrologic model; Hydrologic modelling; Hydrologic variation; Regional climate simulation; Reservoir networks; Water resources management; Reservoirs (water); climate change; climate effect; flood; flood frequency; high temperature; hydrological modeling; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; reservoir; resource management; water availability; water resource; China; Far East; Jiangxi; Poyang Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072282142

However, cost-optimal mitigation pathways consistent with the Paris agreement project large-scale land-based mitigation for bio-energy and afforestation to achieve stringent climate targets. Land demand from land-based mitigation leads to competition with food production, raising concerns that climate policy (SDG13 – climate action) conflicts with food security objectives (SDG2 – zero hunger). In this study we use the computable general equilibrium model MAGNET and the IMAGE integrated assessment model to quantify the food security effects of large-scale land-based mitigation. Subsequently, we implement two measures to prevent reduced food security: increased agricultural intensification and reduced meat consumption. We show that large-scale land-based mitigation (∼600 Mha in 2050) leads to increased food prices (11%), reduced food availability (230 kcal/cap/day) and substantially more people at risk of hunger (230 million) compared to the baseline scenario in 2050, most notably in developing regions. Land-based mitigation also leads to yield increases (9%) and intensified ruminant production (11%). Additional crop yield improvement (9%) and intensification in ruminant production (3%) could prevent the negative effect of mitigation on food security. Introducing a reduction in meat consumption in high- and middle-income regions reduces required crop yield improvement (7%) and ruminant intensification (2%). Our study highlights the importance of transparency about food security effects in climate change mitigation scenarios. In addition, it provides an example of explicitly including measures to limit negative trade-offs in mitigation scenarios. In this way, we show how the Paris agreement can be made consistent with food security objectives and how multiple Sustainable Development Goals can be achieved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural intensification; Climate change; Diet change; Food security; Land-based mitigation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064655976

Montado sites provide a multitude of services including materials (mostly valuable cork), food for free-ranging livestock, agricultural products, game, and tourism. Several stakeholders operate at various levels in these systems, all of whom must be involved in assessments of the value of these ecosystem services. We used a series of participatory workshops at local and regional levels to assess the ecosystem services most valued by these stakeholders. We also evaluated their awareness of the threats to montado and their vision for its future provision of ecosystem services. As expected, among the 12 categories of ecosystem services we assessed, stakeholders valued “materials” most, confirming the importance of cork in this landscape. However, regulating services were also highly valued, revealing strong awareness among stakeholders about montado ecology. Cultural services were more highly valued at the local level, demonstrating that local stakeholders have a strong attachment to their farms. All stakeholders were particularly aware of the threat of climate change, but regional stakeholders had a more negative perception for the future. The greater optimism of local stakeholders may be due to their greater realism and/or emotional connections to their farms. Our findings demonstrate that stakeholders are receptive to climate mitigation measures, but corresponding policy should consider local differences in management and land-use patterns. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agro-forest systems; Aridity; Climate change; Farm; Participatory process; Socio-cultural valuation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069448470

Noticeably, they need electricity which is often by diesel generators. The refuelling process is a barricade due to the very far and remote area distance which make it very expensive. To overcome this issue, a hybridization is initiated with the local renewable solar energy. Correspondingly, the PV source marks an excess or shortage of energy; to cope this uncontrolled power an energy storage system is compulsory. This work is confined to the hydro pumped storage system which is favorable due to its geological aspects and the subject matter. This hybridization needs a specific energy management control. The suggested management strategy considers the temporal solar energy and associates it to the pumping servitudes and the online fuel consumption optimization. This last, proves the PSH performance dual function in both the irrigation and power restitution; it also reduce the gas emission and save fuel. As far as this study is concerned, the suggested formula of online fuel consumption per kWh is successfully examined through the energy management strategy in comparison to that of the literature. Consequently, this study could be helpful for similar future studies. © 2019 IEEE.","Diesel Generator; energy management; Hybrid Microgrid energy system; PSH system; PV system","Agricultural robots; Electric energy storage; Energy management; Fuel storage; Fuels; Pumped storage power plants; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Diesel generators; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; Fuel consumption optimizations; Hybrid energy system; Hydro pumped storages; Management strategies; Optimal fuel consumption; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091796797

Protecting vulnerable communities is, therefore, a key public policy objective. Natural flood management measures (NFM)—notably re-afforestation on hillslope and floodplain—are increasingly discussed as cost-effective means for providing flood regulation, particularly when considering ecosystem services other than flood regulation. However, studies that place flood benefits alongside other benefits are rare, potentially causing uncertainty in policy decision-making. This paper provides a cost-benefit analysis of the impacts of afforestation on peak river flows under UKCP09 climate change projections, and on additional ecosystem services in a rural catchment in Scotland. We find significant positive net present values (NPV) for all alternatives considered. However, benefits are dominated by ecosystem services other than flood regulation, with values related to climate regulation, aesthetic appeal, recreation and water quality contributing to a high positive NPV. The investment in riparian woodland (under low and central climate change scenarios) delivers a positive NPV alone when considering flood regulation benefits only. The case study suggests that afforestation as a sole NFM measure provides a positive NPV only in some cases but highlights the importance of identifying and quantifying additional ecosystem co-benefits. © 2018 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","afforestation; climate change; cost-benefit-analysis; natural flood risk management","adaptive management; afforestation; catchment; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; environmental risk; flood; flood control; flood forecasting; hillslope; policy making; social policy; water quality; Scotland; United Kingdom; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074823514

The objectives of this paper are to develop a Geographic Inventory Framework (GiF) for spatially-explicit estimation and mapping of agricultural N2O and CH4 emissions for the province of Alberta, Canada. The GiF consists of a modelling component, a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) component, and interconnecting Python software to communicate between the model, GIS database and census data. The results show that methane emissions from enteric fermentation (247.04 Gg) prevail over those from manure (20.39 Gg). Nitrous oxide emissions from manure (8.89 Gg) are comparable to those from soil (11.02 Gg). Cattle emit most N2O and CH4, followed by plant N2O emissions and pigs CH4 emissions. The GIS maps show “hot-spots” and discernible patterns of N2O and CH4 emissions increasing from north and west to central Alberta, then slightly declining to south and east, which could be useful for addressing mitigation strategies. The advantages of this framework keep the IPCC approach simple, open, transparent and comparable.

In this paper, we seek to contribute towards bridging this gap by identifying local practices connected to climate adaptation in six large Brazilian cities, and presenting a framework, based on the existing literature, for assessing constraints to adaptation across the municipal level. Although local governments are not the only actors who can take the lead through their actions, the employed framework considers that effective adaptation planning in urban areas is highly dependent on municipal efforts. Our findings indicate that six aspects have the highest levels of impact on adaptation in the Brazilian cities studied: administrative practices, political will, level of commitment, mismatch between the scale of urban issues and the extent of local government authority, pressures from private sectors, and inspection. Although these barriers are not specific only to climate issues and can be identified in other environmental arenas, when combined, they cause and worsen constraints to advancing urban adaptation at the local level. Specifically concerning the local dynamics of urban planning, the combination of pressures from private sectors and insufficient inspection negatively affects the ability of these cities to consolidate adaptation interventions. Our results are helpful in the context of large cities, particularly in Global South, where, as in Brazil, competitive urbanism and specific interest groups confront municipal efforts, and make achieving adaptation more difficult. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Brazil; Cities; Climate change; Local governments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074720026

In particular, when the engine is started from a cold state, lubricant oil viscosity is very high and this affects the friction performance of the mechanical components of the engine. When the engine is warmed up, then, the viscosity of the oil can be up to 15 times lower than the cold phase and even more in very cold climates, producing significant reduction in specific fuel consumption and, so, carbon dioxide emissions. In this work, the Authors demonstrate the effectiveness of some technical opportunities to reduce the warm up time of the oil, with particular reference to a 3.0 L turbocharged diesel engine during a light duty homologation driving cycle. Experimental assessments have been done on different oil circuit layouts and proposing prototyped technologies. Oil sump modification, coolant-to-oil heat exchanger bypass, external heater, heat recovery option, and thermal storage have been tested and compared with each other. Among them, exhaust heat recovered to accelerate the warming up of lubricant oil seems to be the most promising one and it could be easily integrated with a thermal storage section. It is the opinion of the Authors that these technical options could be easily implemented on a vehicle and they can represent a significant step forward to a more efficient thermal management and friction reduction in internal combustion engines. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077872681

Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with the downstream ammonia slip catalyst (ASC) are deployed in diesel emission control to remove NOx and prevent ammonia release. Earlier works have shown that washcoat diffusion can be rate controlling for both SCR and ASC. Here we use sacrificial agents (polymer, yeast) to enhance the conversion without compromising the selectivity for SCR and ASC. The agents are removed during calcination, creating inter-crystallite pores that increase the washcoat macroporosity. Steady state reaction studies of SCR on a Cu-SSZ-13 coated monolith show a noted increase in NOx conversion during standard SCR (NH3 + NO + O2). The improved performance is sustained for hydrothermally aged samples. Similar conversion enhancement is observed for NH3 oxidation over the single-layer Cu-SSZ-13 washcoat. Conversion increases are also encountered for the dual-layer ASC (top Cu-SSZ-13 and base Pt/Al2O3 layer) during the selective oxidation of NH3 to N2. For both SCR and ASC, the N2 product selectivity is negligibly impacted on the modified catalysts. Sharper NH3 desorption profiles are obtained during NH3 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments with Cu-SSZ-13. The results show that modified washcoat may reduce the amount of catalyst to maintain a desired conversion. For the ASC up to a 70% reduction in the Pt loading is demonstrated by using the sacrificial agents to achieve the same conversion. The implication for both SCR and ASC catalyst design and performance is discussed. © 2018","Ammonia slip catalyst; Cu-SSZ-13; Diffusion; NOx; Selective catalytic reduction","Aluminum compounds; Ammonia; Catalyst selectivity; Copper compounds; Diffusion; Emission control; Exhaust systems (engine); Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Platinum compounds; Temperature programmed desorption; Ammonia slip; Desorption profiles; Diesel emission control; Enhanced transports; Product selectivities; Selective oxidation; Similar conversions; Steady state reactions; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052812421

The CO oxidation has been a huge interest in recent years because of its importance in various fields. Cobalt oxide catalysts has shown a great potential for CO oxidation catalyst in a catalytic converter for their high thermal stability and tailoring flexibility. Supported cobalt oxide nanoparticles have been synthesized over different supports at subsequent heat treatment. The cobalt oxides (Co3O4 and CoO) can be well dispersed over supporting materials such as gamma-alumina and other covalent frameworks with average particle sizes below 5 nm. The cobalt oxide catalysts usually refer to particles of cobalt (+2 and + 3) oxide in nanometer size, with various shapes and crystal structures. In cobalt oxide catalyst presence of Co3+/Co2+ redox couple with oxygen vacancy formation. Under steady-state conditions, the Co3O4 surface appeared with oxidized Co2+ species. Activity order of CO oxidation over various cobalt nanoparticles was observed as follows: nanoplates &gt; nanorods &gt; nanocubes &gt; nanosphere. Cobalt has been reported as a good catalyst from economic, thermal, activity, selectivity, and availability point of view. There are various mechanisms that have been developed in the analysis of CO oxidation reaction over cobalt oxide catalysts. These mechanisms are reliable and good enough as per the current situation in the literature.

Among the existing power plants, steam power plants with coal fuel are power plants that supply the most significant electrical energy needs because this type of power plant is very economical and capable of producing high capacity electricity. Behind all that, this steam power plant is a power plant with very high emission factors when compared to other power plants so that it will have an impact on the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the operation of Steam Power Plants by optimising economic deliveries and emissions to get the scheduling of plants with the smallest emission values with minimum operating costs.

For example, Bergmann’s rule predicts a decrease in body size within species and across closely related species with increasing temperature, whereas Gloger’s rule states that birds and mammals should be darker in humid and warm environments compared to colder and drier areas. However, it is still not clear whether ecotypic responses to variation in the local environment can also apply to morphological and colouration changes through time in response to climate change. We present a 100-year-long time series on morphological and melanin-based colours of snowfinch (325 Montifringilla, 92 Pyrgilauda and 30 Onychostruthus) museum specimens. Here we show that the tarsus length of the species has decreased and the saturation of the melanin-based colour has increased, which was correlated with the increase of temperature and precipitations. As ecotypic variations are tightly linked to individual behavioural and physiological responses to environmental variations, differently sized and coloured individuals are expected to be differently penalized by global changes. This study opens the pertinent question about whether ecotypic responses can enhance population persistence in the context of global change. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"melanin; animal; bird; body size; classification; climate change; color; ecotype; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; temperature; Animals; Birds; Body Size; Climate Change; Color; Ecotype; Melanins; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074622409

Here we evaluate species sensitivity, a component of climate change vulnerability, and whether climate change is discussed as a threat in planning for climate-related management action in official documents from 1973 to 2018 for all 459 US animals listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. We find that 99.8% of species are sensitive to one or more of eight sensitivity factors, but agencies consider climate change as a threat to only 64% of species and plan management actions for only 18% of species. Agencies are more likely to plan actions for species sensitive to more factors, but such planning has declined since 2016. Results highlight the gap between climate change sensitivity and the attention from agencies charged with conserving endangered species. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"action plan; biodiversity; climate change; conservation planning; endangered species; management practice; population decline; species conservation; vulnerability; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075372279

While being a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and increase engine fuel economy, Gasoline Direct Injected (GDI) engines produce a number of particles (PN) of fine size higher than Port Fuel Injected (PFI) ones. As a consequence, the EU commission significantly tightened the emission standards for passenger cars, following which all gasoline engines will have to meet the euro-6d regulation coming into force in 2020. Efforts are made by the research community to understand the root causes leading to soot formation and possibly identify technical solutions to lower it. An important piece of the puzzle is the investigation of soot formation via 3D-CFD. To this aim, relevant efforts have been and are still being paid to adapt soot emissions models, originally developed for Diesel combustion, for GDI units. Among the many available models, one of the most advanced is the so-called Sectional Method. So far, studies presented in literature were not able to formulate a methodology to quantitatively match experimental PM, PN and PSDF without a dedicated soot model tuning. In the present work, a Sectional Method-based methodology to quantitatively predict GDI soot is presented and validated against PM, PN and PSDF measurements on a optically accessible GDI research unit. While adapting the model to GDI soot, attention is devoted to the modelling of soot precursor chemistry: a customized version of a pre-existing chemical kinetics mechanism, used to predict the formation of the key PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) species, is presented and validated via 1D numerical simulations on a premixed flat flame burner dataset available in literature. The present work demonstrates that a Sectional Method-based approach can be a powerful tool to quantitatively predict engine-out soot emissions. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077854231

Data from 2004 to 2014 were used and the environmental Kuznets curve equation for Brazilian states was estimated via a spatial econometric method for panel data. Thus, two effects have been demonstrated for both urban and rural areas. First, rising economic growth increases short-term pollutant emissions. Second, in the long run, maintaining the rise in economic growth levels leads to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

The majority of the researchers focus on improving the catalyst material, leading to higher current densities at lower cell potentials and increased selectivities. However, so far, little attention has been given to the investigation and optimization of the ECR reactor design and process parameters, which are equally, if not more, important in order to up-scale the process towards an industrial level. In this work the ECR towards formate on tin nanoparticles in a flow-by electrolyzer is discussed. Special attention is given to the lay-out of both the reactor and the overall process. Additionally, the influence of the differential pressure across the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) on the reactor performance is investigated. It was found that by controlling the differential pressure, the perspiration, or leaking of electrolyte through the GDE, could be controlled and minimized. Results show that by controlling the differential pressure at 0 mbar, perspiration is minimal and that an optimal CO2 diffusion can be achieved, leading to an overall FE of 76% over 6 h at 100 mA/cm2. Furthermore, due to the electro-wetting effect of the GDE, it was impossible to operate the reactor without perspiration, thereby avoiding the risk of salt crystallization in the reactor. Overall this study strengthens the idea that flow-by electrolyzers are promising reactors for the industrialization of electrochemical CO2 conversion and that pressure regulation is essential to obtain optimal process conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 reduction; Electrochemical engineering; Electrochemistry; Electrosynthesis; Formate","Catalyst selectivity; Diffusion in gases; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Global warming; Reduction; CO2 reduction; Differential pressures; Electrochemical engineering; Electrosynthesis; Formate; Gas diffusion electrodes; Salt crystallization; Scientific community; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069448570

In a mostly urbanised world, local governments have a major part to play in designing and implementing climate policies that will help overcome carbon lock-in and enable the transition to a sustainable low-carbon future. Transnational municipal networks (TMNs) have a well-documented history of contributing to multilevel climate governance and supporting experiments in local climate action in many countries. In Brazil, urban climate experimentation has increased since 2005 and accelerated after 2015. Based on empirical evidence from a national survey and two Brazilian metropolises, the study demonstrates that TMNs have been drivers of the municipal climate agenda in Brazil, but there is no evidence so far that urban governance experiments have resulted in significant greenhouse gas emission reductions. Furthermore, the collective impact of cities' experimentation on the national climate agenda is yet to be verified. In light of multilevel climate governance and the urban experimentation conceptual framework, we contend that while there is no documented evidence that local climate action has affected Brazil's ability to meet its mitigation goals, cities' paradiplomacy and policy experiments have strengthened a multilevel approach to climate governance and contributed to positive change towards a sustainable transition. Furthermore, a closer look at policies across scales and their interactions will help our understanding of how to improve t'he institutional framework for climate governance in Brazil and secure GHG emission reductions, thus contributing to global goals beyond 2020. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065047823

Water emulsified fuels represents a promising solution. In this regard, the present work provides two main contributions. First, an experimental investigation of the effects of the addition of water into jet-A1 fuel has been carried out on a 300-kW liquid-fueled swirling combustor. Direct measurements of both exhaust temperature and pollutant emissions, defined the diagnostics setup. Several water concentrations have been tested at different fuel/air ratios and under lean conditions, and the impact of each fuel composition has been evaluated on emissions reduction and combustor efficiency. Results pointed out the nitrogen oxides (NOx) reduction in combination with the lowering of the exhaust gas temperature, which coupled with losses in the combustion and in the overall thermal efficiencies. Despite this, the energy losses became negligible when water content in Jet-A1 was limited to 2.5% by mass, which still ensured the benefit in terms of NOx reduction in the measure of about 11% at φ = 0.36 up to 27.4% at φ = 0.18. Further increase of the water content to 5% at fixed φ = 0.36, as well as going to a leaner condition (φ = 0.18) at fixed water content of 2.5%, strongly impacted on the thermal efficiency which reduced to about 25.4% and 41.2%, respectively. Based on the thermal efficiency losses estimated through experimental results, a gas path analysis was performed by implementing a gas turbine model. This allowed to predict the impact of the water addition into Jet-A1 on the performance of the military turbojet Rolls-Royce VIPER 632-43. Both sea level take-off and cruise flight conditions have been analyzed. Numerical predictions confirmed the experimental finding of the NOx reduction in proportion to the reduction of the peak combustion temperature. In addition, the turbojet engine model figured out an increase of the thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) of about 6.7% and 22% for 2.5% and 5% of water in Jet-A1 respectively during sea level take-off. Its value rose to 8.0% and 26.7%, respectively, when under cruise conditions. Water addition decreased the engine thrust in proportion to the percent increment of the TSFC. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077840244

In this work, the economic input–output model is adapted to track emissions flows through electric grids and quantify the pollution embodied in electricity production, exchanges, and, ultimately, consumption for the 66 continental US Balancing Authorities (BAs). The hourly and BA-level dataset we generate and release leverages multiple publicly available datasets for the year 2016. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of considering location and temporal effects as well as electricity exchanges in estimating emissions footprints. While increasing electricity exchanges makes the integration of renewable electricity easier, importing electricity may also run counter to climate-change goals, and citizens in regions exporting electricity from high-emission-generating sources bear a disproportionate air-pollution burden. For example, 40% of the carbon emissions related to electricity consumption in California’s main BA were produced in a different region. From 30 to 50% of the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released in some of the coal-heavy Rocky Mountain regions were related to electricity produced that was then exported. Whether for policymakers designing energy efficiency and renewable programs, regulators enforcing emissions standards, or large electricity consumers greening their supply, greater resolution is needed for electric-sector emissions indices to evaluate progress against current and future goals. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

The construction and operation of reservoirs represent a massive alteration of their natural and social environments leading to discourses and potential conflicts between a wide scope of heterogeneous interest patterns. Studies have shown that large reservoirs can be an important contributor to water supply, irrigation, energy storage and therefore climate change mitigation on a global scale, which brings these conflicting interests to a broader societal concern. Yet, information about conflicts around existing (German) reservoirs is limited. To assess which issues and conflicts appear on the daily agenda and how they are perceived, communicated and addressed by the stakeholders, a total of 609 articles in the Nürnberger Nachrichten and 22 semi-structured expert interviews were analysed, using qualitative content analysis. The results show that discourses at FLD are predominantly determined by economic factors. Management issues are dominated by discussions about cyanobacteria, which can pose a health risk, thereby impeding recreational use of the lakes and consequently causing economic losses and an image problem for the region. The issue is also strongly interlinked with other aspects of concern and therefore one of the main challenges at the FLD. Due to the construction of the lakes and the evolving strong tourism sector, the formerly agricultural region was subject to a major structural change linking together a very heterogeneous set of interests. The results of this study can help in establishing a management framework to suit all stakeholders and possibly be transferrable to similar projects. © 2019 by the authors.","Agenda setting; Climate change mitigation; Cyanobacteria; Franconian Lake District; Media analysis; Reservoir management; Semi-structured (expert) interviews; Water governance","Climate change; Health risks; Lakes; Losses; Reservoir management; Water supply; Agenda settings; Climate change mitigation; Cyanobacteria; Franconian Lake District; Media analysis; Semi-structured; Water governance; Reservoirs (water); climate change; cyanobacterium; energy storage; expert system; governance approach; media role; questionnaire survey; stakeholder; water management; water planning; Franconia; Germany; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076683799

Identifying and protecting these refugia is a key climate change adaptation approach for conservation planning. Objectives: To identify climate refugia for Australian tropical/sub-tropical rainforest flora, from the Last Glacial Maximum to 2070. Methods: Habitat suitability models were calibrated for 30 species using Maxent, and projected onto climate data for: Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~ 22,000 ybp); mid-Holocene (MH, ~ 6000 ybp); current period; and 2070. The intersection of suitable habitat over consecutive periods was assessed, identifying: current refugia (LGM–MH–Current); future refugia (Current–Future); and High Value Refugia (HVR, suitable over all four periods). Refugial hotspots (regions suitable for at least 15 species) were also identified. Results: Suitable habitat was generally projected to span the greatest area in the current period. Four current refugial hotspots were identified: Wet Tropics, Central Mackay Coast, South Eastern Queensland, and North Coast (New South Wales). While suitable habitat for most species may decline in the future, HVRs will likely be retained for all species to at least 2070, although restricted in size. Future refugia was also projected in areas beyond species’ dispersal ranges. Conclusions: HVRs are highly important for the conservation of these rainforest species, given their generation times, limited dispersal capabilities and additional anthropogenic barriers to movement.

In this context, assessing the relationship between rapid urban expansion and ecosystem services play an important role for the urban sustainability and development related to planning and policies. This study mainly focuses on the assessment of the dynamic nature of urbanization and its impact on urban ecosystem services through land use and land cover (LULC) changes of Old Malda Municipal town, Eastern India. The ecosystem service values (ESVs) are analyzed using Remote Sensing data and GIS techniques corresponding with the global Value Coefficient (VC) for four-time periods (1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017) to estimate total ecosystem service values (ESVt) and individual ecosystem service function change. Coefficient of Sensitivity (CS) is also applied to test the reliability of the estimated VC used as proxies for each LULC categories. The result of the study landscape reveals that the ecosystem service values (ESVs) decreased by 25% from US$ 1.33 million to US$ 1.07 million because of losing cropland and vegetation cover by 34% and 35% respectively during 1990–2017. In case of individual ecosystem service functions, regulating services increased by 12% since 1990–2017 with highest contributing services of water regulation (57%), water supply (22%) and waste treatment (8%) respectively while maximum decline is recorded in soil formation (33.33%) followed by climatic regulation (31.82%) and nutrient cycling (31.25%). The decline in total and some individual ESV in the study landscape requires for urgent measures to be taken to enhance the urban ecosystem sustainability through effective planning and policies. © 2019 Zhejiang University and Chinese Association of Urban Management","Ecosystem services; Medium size town; Sensitivity analysis; Urban ecosystem; Urban sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074858294

Alternative sources such as stormwater harvesting and treated wastewater are being considered in many cities to supplement existing water supplies. Stormwater harvesting schemes that supplement existing water supply systems are complex as they consist of an integrated set of components that perform the functions of collection, storage, treatment, distribution and discharge. Many options and possible sizes exist for each component. Furthermore, the selection and evaluation of stormwater harvesting schemes need to consider economic, environmental and social criteria, as well as technical feasibility. In order to deal with this complexity, an integrated framework is presented that assists authorities with determining if stormwater harvesting is preferable to other water sources and, if so, what type of stormwater scheme is best. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative water sources; Benefit-cost analysis; Cost; Energy and greenhouse gas emission database; Environmental impact; Framework; Multi-criteria analysis; Social impact; Stormwater harvesting","Climate change; Costs; Economics; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Population statistics; Storms; Wastewater treatment; Water resources; Water supply; Water supply systems; Alternative water sources; Benefit-cost analysis; Framework; Multi Criteria Analysis; Social impact; Stormwater harvesting; Cost benefit analysis; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; economic growth; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; multicriteria analysis; performance assessment; social impact; wastewater; water management; water resource; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073669635

Three near-road monitoring stations were established in the downtown area and beside a large highway in Toronto, and beside a major trucking route in Vancouver. 24-hour integrated samples were concurrently collected at these near-road and nearby urban background sites. This study has provided detailed chemical data for PM2.5 and reactive gases (NH3, HONO and HNO3) for a year in 2015–2016. Differences between pollutant concentrations at the near-road and background urban sites were identified, and compared with observations at other urban locations. The traffic contribution was quantified as the concentration increment between the near-road and background sites. The highest increments due to traffic were observed for elemental carbon, select trace metals (e.g. Fe, Ba, Cu, Sb, Zn) and reactive gases (NH3, HONO). In general, the percent contribution of local traffic-related emissions followed a descending order of Toronto highway &gt; Vancouver truck route &gt; downtown Toronto for most of these pollutants. It appears that the influence of traffic-related emissions on air pollution near roads depends more on the proportion of large trucks in the fleet than the total traffic volume. Application of principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis to the local traffic increment pollutant data, as well as knowledge of chemical markers representative of different sources, helped to identify the possible sources of traffic-related PM2.5. These sources include non-exhaust (brake wear abrasion, resuspended road dust) and vehicular exhaust (mixed gasoline/diesel, diesel and lubricating oil combustion) emissions. The contribution of each of the sources varied between sites. In particular, the contribution of diesel exhaust emissions, presumably from highly polluting heavy-duty vehicles and trucks, was significant at the truck route (Vancouver) and the highway (Toronto) sites. Furthermore, the substantial contribution of non-exhaust emissions (brake wear and resuspension of road dust) to PM2.5, and thus metals, with differences between sites due to traffic characteristics or local meteorology was identified. Emissions related to lube oil combustion were not statistically significant. Overall, this work delivered valuable information that serves as input for further studies involving other roads and cities in order to generate reliable and representative results for air quality management and associated health outcomes. © 2019","Exhaust emissions; Non-exhaust emissions; PM2.5 speciation; Source apportionment; Traffic-related air pollution","Air quality; Ammonia; Automobiles; Brakes; Chemical analysis; Combustion; Diesel engines; Dust; Fleet operations; Inclusions; Nitric acid; Quality management; Roads and streets; Trace elements; Trucks; Wear of materials; Diesel exhaust emissions; Exhaust emission; Multi-linear regression; PM2.5 speciation; Pollutant concentration; Source apportionment; Traffic-related air pollution; Traffic-related emissions; Urban growth; barium ion; carbon; cuprous ion; diesel fuel; gasoline; iron; lubricating agent; trace metal; air quality; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; exhaust emission; metropolitan area; particulate matter; pollutant source; road; source apportionment; speciation (chemistry); traffic emission; urban pollution; urban site; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; air sampling; Article; Canada; chemical composition; combustion; dust; exhaust gas; highway; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; British Columbia; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; Vancouver [British Columbia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072269508

Using a novel in situ experiment we examined impacts of reduced seawater pH on Antarctic sea ice-associated microalgal communities, key primary producers and contributors to food webs. pH levels projected for the following decades-to-end of century (7.86, 7.75, 7.61), and ambient levels (7.99), were maintained for 15 d in under-ice incubation chambers. Light, temperature and dissolved oxygen within the chambers were logged to track diurnal variation, with pH, O 2 , salinity and nutrients assessed daily. Uptake of CO 2 occurred in all treatments, with pH levels significantly elevated in the two extreme treatments. At the lowest pH, despite the utilisation of CO 2 by the productive microalgae, pH did not return to ambient levels and carbonate saturation states remained low; a potential concern for organisms utilising this under-ice habitat. However, microalgal community biomass and composition were not significantly affected and only modest productivity increases were noted, suggesting subtle or slightly positive effects on under-ice algae. This in situ information enables assessment of the influence of future ocean acidification on under-ice community characteristics in a key coastal Antarctic habitat. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064454496

The California climate regulator has called for cap-and-trade to deliver nearly half of the emission reductions needed to achieve the state's legally binding limit on greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, making the program the single biggest driver of the state's post-2020 policy portfolio. However, the program's supply of compliance instruments has persistently exceeded emissions subject to the program- A condition known as overallocation, which independent studies have projected may continue into the mid-2020s. If market participants purchase and bank excess compliance instruments for future use, they may be able to comply with the program's regulations while nevertheless emitting significantly in excess of the state's legally binding 2030 limit. Here, we present methods for tracking observed banking behavior on both an annual and multi-year compliance period basis. By the end of 2018, market participants had already acquired more unused compliance instruments than the regulator anticipated for 2020. The size of the private bank is now comparable to the cumulative mitigation expected from the program over the period 2021 through 2030, raising questions about the program's ability to achieve its expected reductions. Beyond diagnosing market conditions, banking metrics can also help policymakers design dynamic program reforms that increase program stringency conditional on observed market behavior deviating from expectations. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, the trade-offs perceived across sustainability, NCD prevention and food security objectives in the vegetable oils sector are considered a barrier for policy influence and implementation. Sustainability and nutrition advocates tend to focus on different segments of the value chain, missing potential synergies. Moreover, policy priorities are dominated by historical concerns for food security, understood as energy provision, as well as economic and strategic priorities.Conclusions: Systematic efforts towards identifying synergistic approaches, from agricultural production to distribution of edible oils, as well as increased involvement of nutrition advocates with upstream policies in the oils sector, could increase policy influence for advocates of both nutrition and sustainability. © The Authors 2019.","Edible oils; Fatty acids; Sustainable nutrition","vegetable oil; catering service; health promotion; human; India; legislation and jurisprudence; non communicable disease; nutrition policy; procedures; Food Supply; Health Promotion; Humans; India; Noncommunicable Diseases; Nutrition Policy; Plant Oils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070399268

To support more sustainable forest uses, we need to measure and monitor carbon stocks and emissions at high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed the first large-scale very high-resolution map of aboveground carbon stocks and emissions for the country of Peru by combining 6.7 million hectares of airborne LiDAR measurements of top-of-canopy height with thousands of Planet Dove satellite images into a random forest machine learning regression workflow, obtaining an R2 of 0.70 and RMSE of 25.38 Mg C ha−1 for the nationwide estimation of aboveground carbon density (ACD). The diverse ecosystems of Peru harbor 6.928 Pg C, of which only 2.9 Pg C are found in protected areas or their buffers. We found significant carbon emissions between 2012 and 2017 in areas aggressively affected by oil palm and cacao plantations, agricultural and urban expansions or illegal gold mining.

We investigated the role of latitudinal heterogeneity in climate on the organization of genetic and phenotypic variation in the dominant coastal tree Avicennia schaueriana. In a common garden experiment, samples from an equatorial region, with pronounced seasonality in precipitation, accumulated less biomass, and showed lower stomatal conductance and transpiration, narrower xylem vessels, smaller leaves and higher reflectance of long wavelengths by the stem epidermis than samples from a subtropical region, with seasonality in temperature and no dry season. Transcriptomic differences identified between trees sampled under field conditions at equatorial and subtropical sites, were enriched in functional categories such as responses to temperature, solar radiation, water deficit, photosynthesis and cell wall biosynthesis. Remarkably, the diversity based on genome-wide SNPs revealed a north-south genetic structure and signatures of selection were identified for loci associated with photosynthesis, anthocyanin accumulation and the responses to osmotic and hypoxia stresses.

Despite the reduction in acidic inputs due to legislation curbing industrial emissions in the United States, continued N deposition may impact forest ecosystems. Soil and foliar samples were collected from four high elevation red spruce sites along a modeled gradient of historic N deposition. The three most abundant tree species at all sites, Acer rubrum L., Betula alleghaniensis Britt., and Picea rubens Sarg., were sampled. Bulk soil beneath the canopies of individual trees were collected from the top 15-cm and separated into organic and mineral fractions for analysis. Mehlich-III soil extracts of soil fractions and foliar digests from these trees were subjected to elemental analysis. Soil N concentrations supported the presence of a N deposition gradient: in organic horizon soil fractions, N concentrations were driven by precipitation volume and elevation; whereas in mineral soil fractions, N concentration was explained by modeled N deposition rate and elevation. In organic fractions, significant reductions in Ca, K, and P were evident as N deposition increased, whereas the Ca:Sr ratio increased. Foliar Ca, K, and Sr declined in foliage with increasing N deposition, with concomitant increases in foliar Ca:Sr ratios. Although the three species were sympatric in mixed stands at all four sites, the foliar–soil nutrient associations differed among them across the gradient, indicating differential uptake and cycling of nutrients/metals by these forest tree species. © 2019 by the authors.

It has also been shown to increase crop yields during dry periods of the growing season, by providing water to the crop root zone, via upward flux or capillary rise. However, by retaining nitrates in anoxic conditions within the soil profile, SI could potentially increase greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, particularly N 2 O through denitrification. This process may be further exacerbated by high precipitation and mineral N-fertilizer applications very early in the growing season. In order to investigate the effects of water table management (WTM) with nitrogen fertilization on GHG fluxes from corn (Zea mays) agro-ecosystems, we conducted a research study on a commercial farm in south-western Quebec, Canada. Water table management treatments were: free drainage (FD) and controlled drainage with subsurface-irrigation. GHG samples were taken using field-deployed, vented non-steady state gas chambers to quantify soil CO 2 , N 2 O and CH 4 fluxes weekly. Our results indicate that fertilizer application timing coinciding with intense (≥24 mm) precipitation events and high temperatures (&gt;25 °C) triggered pulses of N 2 O fluxes, accounting for up to 60% of cumulative N 2 O fluxes. Our results also suggest that splitting bulk fertilizer applications may be an effective mitigation strategy, reducing N 2 O fluxes by 50% in our study. In both seasons, pulse GHG fluxes mostly occurred in the early vegetative stages of the corn, prior to activation of the subsurface-irrigation. Our results suggest that proper timing of WTM mindful of seasonal climatic conditions has the potential to reduce GHG emissions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon dioxide; fertilizer; methane; nitrous oxide; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; maize; metabolism; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062059558

As the temperatures increase, droughts and desertification will render whole regions inhospitable to agriculture. At the same time, other regions might suffer significant crop losses due to floods. Usually, regional food shortages can be covered by surpluses from elsewhere on the planet. However, the climate breakdown could trigger sustained food supply disruptions globally. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more stress-resilient crop alternatives by both breeding new varieties and promoting underutilized crop species (orphan crops). The articles in this special issue cover responses of staple crops and orphan crops to abiotic stresses relevant under the climate breakdown, such as heat, water, high salinity, nitrogen, and heavy metal stresses.

In recent years, evidence is accumulating that air pollution may adversely affect the nervous system as shown by human epidemiological studies and by animal models. Age appears to play a relevant role in air pollution-induced neurotoxicity, with growing evidence suggesting that air pollution may contribute to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Traffic-related air pollution (e.g. diesel exhaust) is an important contributor to urban air pollution, and fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM) may possibly be its more relevant component. Air pollution is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation both in the periphery and in the nervous system, and fine and ultrafine PM can directly access the central nervous system. This short review focuses on the adverse effects of air pollution on the developing brain; it discusses some characteristics that make the developing brain more susceptible to toxic effects, and summarizes the animal and human evidence suggesting that exposure to elevated air pollution is associated with a number of behavioral and biochemical adverse effects. It also discusses more in detail the emerging evidence of an association between perinatal exposure to air pollution and increased risk of autism spectrum disorder. Some of the common mechanisms that may underlie the neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity of air pollution are also discussed.

It also includes identification of mitigation measures to increase energy efficiency, promoting at the same time the reduction of CO2 emissions and consequently the decrease in industry’s Ecological Footprint. Moreover, the analysis presents the Ecological Footprint reduction potential for each mitigation option proposed for an important textile facility located in the North Region of Portugal, used as a case study in this work. The results for the case study showed that the total Ecological Footprint accounted, for the year 2016, summed up to 4890 gha. Furthermore, the energy category corresponds to more than 50% of the total Ecological Footprint estimation, and natural gas was the most required fuel for the processes. The calculation of the Ecological Footprint in the textile facilities can be used as a tool to analyze the processes’ energy efficiency and to quantify the global impact of the implementation of mitigation measures in the energy field.

The use of TEGs in waste heat recovery systems offers a source of sustainable electricity, which helps to reduce emissions to the environment. Optimization of the electrical operating point of TEGs is important to improve the overall efficiency of TEG systems. Previous literature focused mostly on characterizing the maximum power point (MPP) of TEGs when operating at constant temperature difference. However, in most practical applications TEGs operate under constant or limited heat conditions. In fact, in waste heat recovery systems the amount of thermal energy is limited. This work presents a new simplified TEG model that simulates the dynamic response of the TEG systems with a good degree of accuracy. With the aid of this TEG model, power and control electronics have been designed to operate a TEG system, with limited input heat flux, at its optimum load. The control architecture is based on the perturb and observe maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique and modified to take into consideration the thermal transient response of the TEG. A boost dc-dc converter is used to step-up the TEG voltage to 28 V for connection to an eight-cell Lithium-Ion battery. A microcontroller implements the control algorithm that drives the power converter. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two state-of-the-art algorithms (standard perturb and observe and fractional open-circuit) by 1.14% and 2.08%, respectively, when the TEG operates under constant heat flux. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Boost converter; Constant heat; Modeling; MPPT; Thermoelectric; Transient response","Heat flux; Lithium-ion batteries; Maximum power point trackers; Models; Solid state devices; Thermoelectric equipment; Tracking (position); Transient analysis; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; BOOST converter; Constant temperature differences; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Maximum Power tracking algorithm; Thermal transient response; Thermoelectric; Thermoelectric generators; Waste heat recovery systems; DC-DC converters; algorithm; barrier (equipment); efficiency measurement; electricity; electronic equipment; energy efficiency; equipment; experimental study; growth modeling; heat flux; model; modeling; performance assessment; simulation; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073201737

Energy systems optimal design thus assumes a critical importance in determining both costs and environmental impact of operating such districts. This is particularly true following the concept of Local Energy Community, with a single entity representing both the demand and the manager of the energy generation assets. This paper proposes an innovative model for the optimal design of an energy community aiming at lowering its carbon footprint. The community is modeled as a network of spatially dislocated energy hubs, each with its own demand of electricity, heating and cooling energy. The model aims at defining the optimal mix of energy systems, thermal and electric energy storages and energy network infrastructures needed to satisfy the district's users energy demands. The model is validated using energy demand data from the Nanyang Technological University campus in Singapore by analyzing three scenarios. In the first one, the optimization goal is purely economic and it aims at minimizing the overall cost of operating the district. The second and third scenarios focus on reducing the carbon footprint of the district by imposing an additional constraint, which limits the overall primary energy consumption. In all the scenarios the algorithm chooses to partially or totally connect the five sites with a district cooling network and take advantage of cold thermal storage, proving their potential in hot climates. In the first scenario, the advantages of the district cooling solution are mainly related to the savings in the capital cost of electric chillers that partially offset the cost of the district cooling network; indeed, district cooling network allows the sites to share cooling power thus achieving a reduction in chillers total installed size of 33%. In the second scenario, in order to meet the target of 10% reduction of the overall primary energy, the optimal solution also requires the installation of a photovoltaic system. In the third scenario, imposing a 20% reduction of the overall primary energy, also a natural gas fed trigeneration plant comes into play. © 2019","Distributed generation; District heating and cooling; District planning; Network of multi energy systems; Polygeneration; Thermal microgrid","Carbon footprint; Costs; Digital storage; Distributed power generation; District heating; Emission control; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Microgrids; Natural gasoline plants; Optimal systems; Photovoltaic cells; Power generation; Trigeneration plant; Zoning; Cold thermal storage; District heating and cooling; Micro grid; Multi-energy systems; Nanyang Technological University; Photovoltaic systems; Poly-generation; Primary energy consumption; Cooling systems; carbon footprint; cooling; cost analysis; economic conditions; energy planning; energy storage; environmental impact; heating; photovoltaic system; power generation; power plant; thermal pollution; urban design; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072555289

In particular, we study how energy system and economy-wide models include and quantify rebound effects - the gap between actual and expected saving or the behavioral adjustment in response to an energy efficiency improvement, in terms of energy or greenhouse gas emissions. First, we explain the interaction between drivers of energy efficiency improvements, energy efficiency policies, and the rebound effect to provide a framework for a general theoretical revision from micro- to macro-economic levels. Using this classification, we analyze rebound effect representations in empirical models by four dimensions: actors (industry or the production side, and private households or the consumption side), the aggregation level (from micro- to macro-economic levels), income level (developed or developing countries), and time (short- and long-run). Furthermore, we review rebound effect studies whose models focus on three drivers of energy efficiency improvements: market-based policies, non-market-based policies, and a costless energy efficiency improvement that holds other attributes constant (zero-cost breakthrough). We find that a clear representation of one or simultaneous drivers of energy efficiency improvements is crucial to target the goals of energy savings, greenhouse gas mitigation, and welfare gains. Under this broader view, the rebound effect is one additional phenomenon to be taken into consideration. This perspective provokes and provides additional policy implications. Reporting rebound effects as a stand-alone percentage is not sufficiently informative for policy considerations and the distinction of the aggregation level is important to asses the scalability of energy efficiency policies. Finally, we identify some ideas and motivations for future research. © 2020 The Author(s).

Efforts to mitigate risks associated with non-prescription codeine, such as addiction and toxicity, have been primarily through two initiatives; regulatory changes restricting their availability, and voluntary live-recording supply of non-prescription codeine combination analgesics (CCAs). This study sought to explore the supply of CCAs in the climate of regulatory change. Methods: Eighty University of Sydney pharmacy students mystery-shopped 34 community pharmacies across metropolitan Sydney, Australia from August 2016 to November 2017, with scripted symptom-based (SBR) or direct product requests (DPR) for a CCA. Questions asked, staff involvement, regulatory compliance, voluntary recording, and product(s) supplied were recorded. Results: Of 158 total visits, a non-prescription CCA was supplied in 101 instances. Sixty-one (60%) of these supplies complied with the legislative requirement for a pharmacist to supply the medicine. Voluntary recording was surmised to have been utilised 13 times (13% CCA supplies). CCAs were supplied less frequently in 2017 DPR scenarios compared to 2016 DPR scenarios (64% vs 86%; p = 0.024), and a greater proportion of 2017 DPR supplies were compliant with the legislative requirement of pharmacist supply (72% vs 46%; p = 0.041). No difference in proportion of sales surmised to have been voluntarily recorded was observed between the years. Interactions involving pharmacists resulted in less frequent supply of codeine than those without (58% vs 82%; p = 0.012). Conclusion: Mandatory legislative regulation of pharmacist supply of non-prescription codeine was more likely to be complied with than voluntary recording. Compliance with pharmacist supply for DPRs appeared to improve following the announcement of regulatory change to prescription-only, whereas voluntary recording of supply did not appear to change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Analgesics; Codeine; Drug monitoring program; Drug policy; Opioids; Pharmacy; Simulated patient","analgesic agent; codeine; codeine; narcotic analgesic agent; non prescription drug; Article; audio recording; Australia; cohort analysis; controlled study; direct product request; drug industry; health care concepts; human; information processing; law; pharmacist; pharmacy (shop); prescription; priority journal; recording; regulatory change; simulation; symptom based request; voluntary real time recording; drug combination; legislation and jurisprudence; organization and management; patient simulation; professional standard; Analgesics, Opioid; Australia; Codeine; Community Pharmacy Services; Drug Combinations; Humans; Nonprescription Drugs; Patient Simulation; Pharmacists; Professional Role",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074147049

Studies have suggested that agriculture accounts for around 11% of total greenhouse gas emissions and the industry has a significant role in meeting international and national climate change reduction objectives. However, there is currently little consensus on the mechanisms that regulate the production and assimilation of greenhouse gases in arable land and the practical factors that affect the process. Practical advice for farmers is often overly general, and models based on the amount of nitrogen fertiliser applied, for example, are used despite a lack of knowledge of how local conditions affect the process, such as the importance of humus content and soil types. Here, we propose a systematic map of the evidence relating to the impact on greenhouse gas flux from the agricultural management of arable land in temperate regions. Methods: Using established methods for systematic mapping in environmental sciences we will search for, collate and catalogue research studies relating to the impacts of farming in temperate systems on greenhouse gas emissions. We will search 6 bibliographic databases using a tested search string, and will hand search a web-based search engine and a list of organisational web sites. Furthermore, evidence will be sought from key stakeholders. Search results will then be screened for relevance at title, abstract and full text levels according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. Consistency checking will be employed to ensure the criteria are being applied accurately and consistently. Relevant studies will then be subjected to coding and meta-data extraction, which will be used to populate a systematic map database describing each relevant study's settings, methods and measured outcomes. The mapping process will help to identify knowledge gaps (subjects lacking in evidence warranting further primary research) and knowledge clusters (subjects with sufficient studies to allow a useful full systematic review), and will highlight best and suboptimal research methods. © 2019 The Author(s).","Carbon; Climate; Climate change; Climate targets; COP; Farming; Global warming; Methane, nitrous oxide; Sustainable farming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076205648

We seek to describe the co-emergence of a research community, its instruments, and its domain of applicability. We highlight the role of the IPCC process in the making of the IAM community, showing how IAMs worked their way to an influent position. We then survey three elements of the repertoire that served to organise collective work on scenarios in interaction with the IPCC and the European Union, and which now frames the community and its epistemic practices.

Mountain regions could potentially provide safe sites for arctic-alpine plants in a warmer climate, but empirical evidence is fragmentary. Here we present a 24,000-year record of species persistence based on sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) from Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye (Polar Urals). We provide robust evidence of long-term persistence of arctic-alpine plants through large-magnitude climate changes but document a decline in their diversity during a past expansion of woody vegetation. Nevertheless, most of the plants that were present during the last glacial interval, including all of the arctic-alpines, are still found in the region today. This underlines the conservation significance of mountain landscapes via their provision of a range of habitats that confer resilience to climate change, particularly for arctic-alpine taxa. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Arctic; classification; climate change; ecosystem; plant; plant development; Arctic Regions; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Plant Development; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077092027

On this basis, we introduce a paradigm for modeling the properties of magnetized, dusty regions of the interstellar medium (ISM), using the orientation of H i structure at different velocities to map ""magnetically coherent"" regions of space. We construct three-dimensional (position-position-velocity) Stokes parameter maps using H i4PI full-sky spectroscopic H i data. We compare these maps, integrated over the velocity dimension, to Planck maps of the polarized dust emission at 353 GHz. Without any free parameters governing the relation between H i intensity and dust emission, we find that our Q and U maps are highly correlated (r > 0.75) with the 353 GHz Q and U maps of polarized dust emission observed by Planck and reproduce many of its large-scale features. The E/B ratio of the dust emission maps agrees well with the H i-derived maps at large angular scales (ℓ ≲ 120), supporting the interpretation that this asymmetry arises from the coupling of linear density structures to the Galactic magnetic field. We demonstrate that our 3D Stokes parameter maps constrain the 3D structure of the Galactic ISM and the orientation of the interstellar magnetic field. © 2019. The American Astronomical Society.

The reduction of fossil fuels is a need and calls for technologies based on renewable sources which provide continuity of production, even when the source is unavailable. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants represent a valid alternative able to replace fossil fuels in a medium/long term as high thermal source, keeping conventional technologies for the energy conversion section: the possibility to have small-medium and large-scale power plants increases the plant flexibility and provides a valid contribution to the GHG reduction policies on a local and global scale. The paper is focused on an innovative Parabolic Trough CSP plant using air as working fluid, with the purpose of reaching an acceptable overall global efficiency of the conversion section, ensuring production continuity thanks to a Thermal Energy Storage section. The hybridization of the CSP plant with an auxiliary biomass plant improves the performances of the components of the conversion section keeping them at design conditions even in presence of the Sun energy variability during days and months. In order to make a yearly-based producible energy evaluation, a typical solar year in the South of Italy has been considered. The use of air as thermal fluid, the conversion cycle adopted (presented by the authors in previous studies) and the integration with the biomass conversion sections have invited to recover the thermal energy losses at medium and high temperature with conversion sections based on the use of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), significantly improving the overall plant performance and, therefore, profitability. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077872013

Ozone enters plants through stomata, reacts to form reactive oxygen species in the apoplast and ultimately decreases photosynthetic C gain. In this study, 10 diverse inbred parents were crossed in a half-diallel design to create 45 F1 hybrids, which were tested for ozone response in the field using free air concentration enrichment (FACE). Ozone stress increased the heritability of photosynthetic traits and altered genetic correlations among traits. Hybrids from parents Hp301 and NC338 showed greater sensitivity to ozone stress, and disrupted relationships among photosynthetic traits. The physiological responses underlying sensitivity to ozone differed in hybrids from the two parents, suggesting multiple mechanisms of response to oxidative stress. FACE technology was essential to this evaluation because genetic variation in photosynthesis under elevated ozone was not predictable based on performance at ambient ozone.

Conventional conservation efforts have focused on establishing protected areas and restoring degraded lands in order to maintain current conditions or restore ecosystems to a pre-damaged state. However, as the climate changes, the current bioclimatic zones will be re-distributed globally. Historical distribution patterns may no longer serve as an effective guide for supporting biodiversity under climate change. In response to these challenges, this study proposes a spatially explicit strategy for biodiversity conservation that takes climate change into account using bioclimatic classification. The bioclimatic classification maps of Northeast Asia (NEA) were constructed for three historical time periods (the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s) and two future time periods (the 2050s and 2070s) using five general circulation models (GCMs) in representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) scenarios. It was predicted that, in general, zones are shifting north, and some zones are expanding or shrinking rapidly. Based on an analysis of latitudinal and areal change for each zone, the bioclimate vulnerability index (BVI) and naturality index (NI) were developed to quantify the impact of environmental change. As a result of the BVI analysis, the distribution of vulnerable zones is expected to shift northward and expand. As is evident with the increased vulnerability of the subarctic region caused by the expansion of the temperate climate, the extent of vulnerable zones will increase. Also, the southern regions of NEA are becoming vulnerable due to the transformation of the temperate zone to a more subtropical zone. Quadrant graphs based on the BVI and NI were created to present appropriate strategies for each zone. Our proposed framework shows that conservation strategies should be modified based on the changes in the relative position of each zone over time. © 2019 The Author(s).

We hypothesize that nitrogen (N) in urine deposited by grazing cattle on degraded pastures, with low vegetative cover, is highly susceptible to losses. Here, we quantified the magnitude of urine-based nitrous oxide (N2O) lost from soil under paired degraded (low vegetative cover) and non-degraded (adequate vegetative cover) pastures across five countries of the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region and estimated urine-N emission factors. Soil N2O emissions from simulated cattle urine patches were quantified with closed static chambers and gas chromatography. At the regional level, rainy season cumulative N2O emissions (3.31 versus 1.91 kg N2O-N ha−1) and emission factors (0.42 versus 0.18%) were higher for low vegetative cover compared to adequate vegetative cover pastures. Findings indicate that under rainy season conditions, adequate vegetative cover through proper pasture management could help reduce urine-induced N2O emissions from grazed pastures. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"nitrous oxide; rain; agriculture; animal; bovine; Caribbean; chemistry; environment; environmental monitoring; herbivory; season; soil; South and Central America; urine; Agriculture; Animals; Caribbean Region; Cattle; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Herbivory; Latin America; Nitrous Oxide; Rain; Seasons; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060807687

However, patterns and drivers of community stability along a precipitation gradient remain unclear. A regional-scale transect survey was conducted over a 3-year period from 2013 to 2015, along a precipitation gradient from 275 to 555 mm and spanning 440 km in length from west to east in a temperate semiarid grassland of northern China, a central part of the Eurasian steppe. Our study provided regional-scale evidence that the community stability increased with increasing precipitation in the semiarid ecosystem. The patterns of community stability along a precipitation gradient were ascribed to community composition and community dynamics, such as species richness and species asynchrony, rather than the abiotic effect of precipitation. Species richness regulated the temporal mean (μ) of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), while species asynchrony regulated the temporal standard deviation (σ) of ANPP, which in turn contributed to community stability. Our findings highlight the crucial role of community composition and community dynamics in regulating community stability under climate change. © 2019 The Authors.

Modern landfills are provided with gas collection systems, however, significant amount of landfill gas (LFG) escapes into the atmosphere, making landfills one of the largest anthropogenic sources of CH4 and CO2 emissions. Several researchers have investigated various alternative landfill cover systems, such as biocovers, in order to mitigate CH4 transport across landfill covers by enhancing microbial CH4 oxidation. In recent years, biochar as an organic amendment has shown promise in enhanced microbial oxidation due to its inert/stable chemical nature, high surface area, high internal porosity, and high moisture holding capacity. However, in all these efforts, little regard is given to the CO2 that still escapes into the atmosphere in undesirable amounts. The current study introduces the concept of biogeochemical cover, which uses steel slag in conjunction with biochar-amended soil to mitigate fugitive emissions from a landfill. The current study compares the CO2 sequestration potential of steel slag, mainly basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slag under various environmental conditions that may prevail in the landfill cover. BOF slag shows significant CO2 sequestration potential under variable conditions including moisture, temperature, gas flow conditions, and BOF slag type and particle size. The results suggest that the use of BOF slag could be a cost effective and green solution to the problems of fugitive LFG emissions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biochar; Biogeochemical cover; BOF slag; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Landfill gas emissions; Municipal solid waste","Basic oxygen converters; Biogas; Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Flow of gases; Gas emissions; Internal oxidation; Moisture; Municipal solid waste; Particle size; Renewable energy resources; Slags; Bio chars; Biogeochemical; BOF slags; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Landfill gas emissions; Land fill; anthropogenic source; biochar; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition; experimental study; innovation; landfill; methane; mitigation; municipal solid waste; oxidation; parameterization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073796162

Those activities are very energy intensive, and therefore the implementation of waste heat recovery technologies would have great potential to make contributions to the reductions of primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission in the longer term. In the community of HTSG waste heat recovery in metallurgy and building materials industries, there are two critical features: wide partice size range and wide temperature range. This work aims at reviewing progress on the key fundamental nature, advanced technologies and future issues in waste heat recovery from HTSG materials. The configurations and limitations of current waste heat recovery techniques depending on solid particle size are addressed. In particular, a new waste heat recovery device for solid particles consisting of powder and lump materials is discussed. Additionally, the available multi temperature stages heat recovery techniques, combined usage of different heat recovery manners, and development of compact heat exchangers are critiqued. The available techniques to minimize the negative impacts of HTSG property variations during rapid temperature change are introduced.

Here we investigate the impact of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering on the terrestrial hydrological cycle. We use the Geoengineering Large Ensemble, which involves a 20-member ensemble of simulations using the Community Earth System Model with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, in which sulfur dioxide (SO2) was injected into the stratosphere at four different locations, to maintain global mean surface temperature, and also the interhemispheric and equator-to-pole temperature gradients at values representative of 2020 (“baseline”) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. In our simulations, annual mean land precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) increase by 12% each under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Under the Geoengineering Large Ensemble, the hydrological cycle is suppressed compared to the baseline, with end-of-century decreases of 1.4% (12 ± 5 mm/year) and 3.3% (18 ± 2 mm/year) in global mean, annual mean precipitation, and ET over land, respectively. Geoengineering effectively maintains global mean soil moisture under a high CO2 scenario, although there is significant regional variability. Summertime soil moisture is reduced by 42 ± 11 kg/m2 (3.5%) and 27 ± 16 kg/m2 (2.1%) in India and the Amazon, respectively, which is dominated by the decrease in precipitation. We also compare these regional changes in soil moisture under the Geoengineering Large Ensemble with an equatorial-only SO2 injection case and find a similar sign in residual changes, although the magnitude of the changes is larger in the equatorial run. ©2019.

The PM2.5 concentrations increase from the northern to southern part of western Taiwan, and reductions in the PM2.5 concentration generally decrease from northern to southern part of western Taiwan. Thus, mitigation of the PM2.5 problem is less effective in southwestern Taiwan than in other regions in Taiwan. Analysis of a 39-year ERA-interim reanalysis dataset (1979–2017) reveals a weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon, a reduction in northeasterly (NE) monsoonal flow, and a tendency of enhanced stably stratified atmospheric structures in Taiwan and the surrounding area. The observed surface wind speed also presents a long-term decline. We can conclude that the long-term PM2.5 variations in Taiwan are mainly associated with changes in local anthropogenic emissions and modulated by short-term yearly variations due to strong haze events in China. In southwestern Taiwan, the long-term trend of PM2.5 reductions is possibly offset by worsening weather conditions, as this region is situated on the leeside of the mountains and often subject to stagnant wind when under the influence of NE monsoonal flow. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"air pollution control; article; China; haze; human; meteorology; Taiwan; wind speed; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065071475

Understanding the variations and controls of CUE is crucial for regional carbon assessment. Here, we used 15-years of continuous remote sensing data to examine the variations of CUE across broad geographic and climatic gradients in China. The results showed that the vegetation CUE was averaged to 0.54 ± 0.11 with minor interannual variation. However, the CUE greatly varied with geographic gradients and ecosystem types. Forests have a lower CUE than grasslands and croplands. Evergreen needleleaf forests have a higher CUE than other forest types. Climate factors (mean annual temperature (MAT), precipitation (MAP) and the index of water availability (IWA)) dominantly regulated the spatial variations of CUE. The CUE exhibited a linear decrease with enhanced MAT and MAP and a parabolic response to the IWA. Furthermore, the responses of CUE to environmental change varied with individual ecosystem type. In contrast, precipitation exerted strong control on CUE in grassland, while in forest and cropland, the CUE was mainly controlled by the available water. This study identifies the variations and response of CUE to environmental drivers in China, which will be valuable for the regional assessment of carbon cycling dynamics under future climate change. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076919111

Compounds PNO, PNS, and PNSe have significantly nonplanar geometries in the ground state, which undergo PISP to give a planarlike conformer and hence a large emission Stokes shift. A combination of femtosecond early relaxation dynamics and computational approaches established an R*→I* (intermediate)→P* sequential kinetic pattern for PNS and PNSe, whereas PNO undergoes R*→P* one-step kinetics. The polarization ability of the substituted heteroatoms, which is in the order O<S<Se, correlates with their increase in π conjugation, and hence the Stokes shift of the emission is in the order PNO<PNS<PNSe. Compound PNSe with the largest PISP barrier was shown to be a highly sensitive viscosity probe. Further evidence for heteroatom-harnessing PISP is given by PNC, in which the dimethylmethanediyl substituent lacks lone pair electrons for π extension, showing the normal emission of the bent structure. The results led to the conclusion that PISP is ubiquitous in dihydrodibenzo[ac]phenazines, for which the driving force is elongation of the π delocalization to gain stabilization in the excited state. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The construction and operation of UFTSs require many resources invested at early stages, while the resources provided in each city are limited. Properly creating an environmentally friendly UFTS under finite resources is a prerequisite for effective reduction of the carbon emissions generated by freight transportation and is a key basis for guidance regarding operations management and network expansion. The main goal of the present research study is to develop an optimal resources allocation strategy to reduce carbon emissions by using a bi-level programming model under the finite construction resources of an UFTS. Thus, an optimal resources allocation method was developed to optimize carbon dioxide emissions in an integrated network of roads and UFTS under finite construction resources. This method integrates the characteristics of carbon emissions in UFTS and road transportation, together with a relationship between construction resources and initial design speed. Due to the nonconvexity and discreteness of the question, we transform the bi-level programming model to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to obtain the optimum resource allocation strategy by linearizing the constraints and objective functions. The freight network between the Xiongan New Area and Beijing is taken as an example to verify the superiority of the model. The influences of the changes in resource quantities and typical strategies of transport time, freight volume in a UFTS and rotation volume of freight transport are analyzed, which provides a foundation for further study of the implementation of UFTSs in reality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Construction resource; Underground freight","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Integer programming; Mathematical transformations; Resource allocation; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; Bilevel programming models; Carbon emissions; Construction resource; Freight transport systems; Logistics transportations; Mixed integer linear programming model; Optimum resource allocation; Underground freight; Freight transportation; carbon emission; emission control; freight transport; resource allocation; road; transportation system; underground construction; urban transport; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072224769

Both plant diversity and water availability are individually known to influence soil microorganisms; however, their interactive effects remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether the effects of tree species mixtures on microbial biomass and composition were altered by water availability. This was accomplished by sampling soils in the growing season from stands that were dominated by Populus tremuloides and Pinus banksiana, respectively, and their relatively even mixtures under reduced (−25% throughfall), ambient, and added (+25% throughfall) water. Microbial community biomass and composition were determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. We found that water addition increased soil total microbial biomass and by individual groups, whereas water reduction had no effect. Under ambient water conditions, soil total microbial biomass, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal, bacterial, gram-positive (GP) bacterial, and gram-negative (GN) bacterial biomass were significantly lower in mixtures than from those of constituent monocultures, but saprotrophic fungal biomass and the ratios of fungal/bacterial and GP/GN bacteria were not significantly affected by tree species mixtures. Water reduction increased species mixture effects on total and individual group microbial biomass from negative to neutral, while water addition only increased mixture effects on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal and GP bacterial biomass. Across all water treatments, soil total and individual group microbial biomass significantly increased with the abundance of broadleaved trees, but only weakly with species richness. Further, microbial community compositions differed significantly with both overstory type and water treatment. Microbial community compositions exhibited strong associations with tree species richness, soil moisture, soil pH, and litterfall production, whereas microbial biomass did not. Our results suggest that higher species diversity is not always of benefit for soil microorganisms; however, mixed tree species have the potential to regulate ecosystem responses to climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Microbial biomass; Microbial composition; Plant diversity; PLFA; Water availability","Availability; Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate change; Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Forestry; Fungi; Mixtures; Phospholipids; Soil moisture; Water treatment; Microbial biomass; Microbial composition; Plant diversity; PLFA; Water availability; Bacteria; abundance; biodiversity; boreal forest; climate change; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; ecosystem response; fatty acid; fungus; growing season; litterfall; microbial community; overstory; soil microorganism; species diversity; species richness; water availability; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Pinus banksiana; Populus tremuloides; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073919582

Previous studies have proved that the application of different accounting principles results in different emission levels, thus bring different policy implications, while the emissions enabled by primary inputs (or income-based emission) have been overlooked in studies for carbon mitigation in China. Understanding the role of primary inputs in CO2 emissions is a prerequisite to create efficient supply-side mitigation policies. Here, we conduct a quantitative study of China's provincial production-, consumption-, and income-based CO2 emissions in a unified multi-regional input-output analysis framework. The results are compared from the three perspectives for 30 provinces in China to help the government identify the main policy targets from production, demand, and supply sides. We found that 64% and 35% of China's emissions are transferred among provinces driven by final demands and primary inputs, respectively. Mitigation policies in heavily industrialized provinces, such as Hebei, Liaoning, and Henan, where the production-based emissions are higher than the consumption- and income-based emissions, should be focused on production side. Similarly, policies in eastern coastal developed provinces and resource-abundant provinces should be focused on demand- and supply-side, respectively. Moreover, we found that tertiary industries, which previous studies generally regard as low-carbon industries, are the major contributors to China's income-based CO2 emissions with a total of 2026 Mt or 31% of China's total income-based CO2 emissions. Thus, expanding tertiary industries without reducing their industrial linkages to carbon-intensive industries is not conducive to China's emission reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Embodied CO2 emission flow; Income-based CO2 emission; Interprovincial trade; Multi-region input-output analysis","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Public policy; China; CO2 emissions; Emission mitigation; Input output analysis; Low-carbon industries; Mitigation policies; Policy implications; Tertiary industries; Economic analysis; carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; input-output analysis; international trade; trade-environment relations; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072398082

Using results of a brute force source sensitivity (BFSS) method may complement IPR. This paper integrates CMAQ-IPR and BFSS to examine the causes of a PM2.5 episode on Jan 15, 2010 across two air quality monitoring stations in Taichung, Taiwan (Shalu, a rural station and Situn, an urban station). Two pollution deterioration events (time intervals) were observed and simulated. When only CMAQ-IPR was used for simulation, the results revealed most pollution (&gt;60%) was from local sources at the Situn Station. The two deterioration intervals differed however, as interval 1 showed a contribution from local emissions (49%), vertical advection (41%) and aerosols processes (10%). Interval 2 at Shalu Station was categorized as a downwind monitoring station, where emission from the grid constituted only 37%, and the majority of pollutants travelling by horizontal advection (56%), and to some extent, aerosols process (6%). Simulation by integrating IPR and BFSS (including diesel vehicles, gasoline vehicles/motorcycles, construction/road dust, iron/steel industries, and power plants around Taiwan) rendered to the type of physical or chemical process in which pollutants went through and its impact on the concentration of PM2.5 in the air quality monitoring station, which helped planning of emission control measures. Simulation results indicated improvement of PM2.5 concentrations in Situn and Shalu would be limited (only 0.2–4.2% contribution to deteriorating PM2.5 levels at the stations) even the emissions of the power plants and iron/steel industries in whole Taiwan were under control. However, by controlling the emissions of diesel vehicles, gasoline vehicles/motorcycles, and construction/road dust in whole Taiwan, the improvent is much enhanced (49–79% contribution to deteriorating PM2.5 levels at the stations), but it cost a lot. Nonethless, the improvement was quite significant by controlling the local emissions (around the monitoring station) of diesel vehicles, gasoline vehicles/motorcycles, and construction/road dust for Situn Station as they accounted for 72–85% of these three sources contribution to deteriorating PM2.5 levels at the station. For Shalu Station, it required a wide area of controlling the emissions from diesel vehicles, gasoline vehicles/motorcycles, and construction/road dust because there was 22–53% of these three sources contribution to deteriorating PM2.5 levels at the station from horizontal or vertical advection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality modeling; Fine particulate matter; Haze; Process analysis; Source contribution","Advection; Aerosols; Air quality; Chemical analysis; Deterioration; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Dust; Emission control; Gasoline; Iron; Pollution detection; Power plants; Vehicles; Air quality modeling; Fine particulate matter; Haze; Process analysis; Source contributions; Quality control; gasoline; advection; air quality; atmospheric pollution; chemical process; emission control; haze; particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; steel; traffic emission; advection; aerosol; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; building industry; coastal plain; comparative study; concentration (parameter); dust; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; haze; highway; iron and steel industry; motor vehicle; motorcycle; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; simulation; Taiwan; wind speed; Shalu; Taichung; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072985957

This paper optimizes the whitening coefficient in a grey Markov model by a genetic algorithm, predicts the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and then quantifies the health effects of PM2.5 pollution by utilizing the predicted concentration, computable general equilibrium (CGE), and a carefully designed exposure–response model. Further, the authors establish a social accounting matrix (SAM), calibrate the parameter values in the CGE model, and construct a recursive dynamic CGE model under closed economy conditions to assess the long‐term economic losses incurred by PM2.5 pollution. Subsequently, an empirical analysis was conducted for the Beijing area: Despite the reduced concentration trend, PM2.5 pollution continued to cause serious damage to human health and the economic system from 2013 to 2020, as illustrated by various facts, including: (1) the estimated premature deaths and individuals suffering haze pollution‐related diseases are 156,588 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 43,335–248,914)) and six million, respectively; and (2) the accumulated labor loss and the medical expenditure negatively impact the regional gross domestic product, with an estimated loss of 3062.63 (95% CI: 1,168.77–4671.13) million RMB.

Contrarily, extensive insect defoliations such as that caused by spruce budworm (SBW; Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) often are species-specific and vary greatly in their intensities and consequent influences on forest carbon dynamics over large spatial and temporal extents. In this study, we applied an individual tree growth model across a large forested area in the state of Maine, USA to simulate the impact of SBW outbreaks on above-ground carbon stock in merchantable trees, which is the primary carbon pool of interest in forest management and its associated downstream industries. The model, the Acadian Variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS-ACD), provides the necessary resolution needed to capture the spatio-temporal variability in SBW defoliation and its impacts on the mixed species, structurally complex spruce-fir (Picea-Abies) forests of Maine. Our evaluation of two 40-year SBW outbreak cycles (1975–2015 and 2017–2057) indicates that, due primarily to changing species composition (particularly significant increases of hardwood species), this carbon stock of spruce-fir forests was not reduced and not significantly different than what it would be without an outbreak at the end of either cycle. However, there were temporary decreases in carbon growth immediately following these outbreaks. These decreases were at smaller scales in the 40-year cycle starting 2017 where significant increases of hardwood species along with decreases of SBW's primary host species were observed. As this trend of changing species composition continues in this region, a future SBW outbreak would cause less reduction in carbon growth and less likely to result in a decrease of carbon stock in spruce-fir forests. Overall, the utilized tree-level modeling framework may prove useful for assessing the influence of complex disturbances like insect defoliation in other regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Balsam fir; Defoliation; Disturbance; Forest carbon dynamics; Forest Vegetation Simulator; Individual-based modeling; Landscape analysis; Red/black/white spruce; Spruce budworm","Carbon; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Vegetation; Balsam fir; Defoliation; Disturbance; Forest carbons; Forest vegetation simulator; Individual based model; Landscape analysis; Red/black/white spruce; Spruce budworm; Forestry; aboveground biomass; carbon cycle; coniferous forest; defoliation; disturbance; forest ecosystem; individual-based model; landscape ecology; mixed forest; pest outbreak; population outbreak; simulator; timber harvesting; vegetation dynamics; Abies Lasiocarpa; Carbon; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Plants; Maine; United States; Abies; Abies balsamea; Choristoneura fumiferana; Hexapoda; Picea; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071886365

In this Letter we will consider the effect of tidal locking on limit cycling between snowball and warm climate states, which has been suggested could occur for rapidly rotating planets in the outer regions of the habitable zone with low CO2 outgassing rates. Here, we use a 3D Global Climate Model that calculates silicate-weathering to show that tidally locked planets with an active carbon cycle will not experience limit cycling between warm and snowball states. Instead, they smoothly settle into ""Eyeball"" states with a small unglaciated substellar region. The size of this unglaciated region depends on the stellar irradiation, the CO2 outgassing rate, and the continental configuration. Furthermore, we argue that a tidally locked habitable zone planet cannot stay in a snowball state for a geologically significant time. This may be beneficial to the survival of complex life on tidally locked planets orbiting the outer edge of their stars, but might also make it less likely for complex life to arise. © 2019.

This extensive peatland network stores significant amounts of carbon, regulates local and regional hydrological cycles, supports habitats for a variety of plant and animal species, and has provided critical water and forage resources for the livestock of the indigenous Aymara communities for thousands of years. Nevertheless, little is known about the productivity dynamics of the high Andean peatlands, particularly in the drier western Altiplano region bordering the Atacama desert. Here, we provide the first digital peatland inventory and multiscale productivity assessment for the entire western Altiplano (63,705 km2) using 31 years of Landsat data (about 9000 scenes) and a non-parametric approach for estimating phenological metrics. We identified 5665 peatland units, covering an area of 510 km2, and evaluated the spatiotemporal productivity patterns at the regional, peatland polygon, and individual pixel scales. The regional assessment shows that the peatland areas and peatlands with higher productivity are concentrated towards the northern part of our study region, which is consistent with the Altiplano north-south aridity gradient. Regional patterns further reveal that the last seven years (2011-2017) have been the most productive period over the past three decades. While individual pixels show contrasting patterns of reductions and gains in local productivity during the most recent time period, most of the study area has experienced increases in annual productivity, supporting the regional results. Our novel database can be used not only to explore future research questions related to the social, biological, and hydrological influences on peatland productivity patterns, but also to provide technical support for the sustainable development of livestock practices and conservation and water management policy in the Altiplano region. © 2019 by the authors.","Atacama; Bofedal; Npphen; Phenology; Time series; Wetlands","Forestry; Pixels; Productivity; Research and development management; Time series; Water conservation; Water management; Atacama; Bofedal; Hydrological cycles; Nonparametric approaches; Npphen; Phenology; Productivity assessment; Water management policy; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077845441

However, there have been no rigorous estimations of local market potential and consumer preferences for these hypothetical products yet. On the other hand, while there are clear efforts concerning the environmental impacts of cattle production, its animal welfare implications have taken a secondary place. This research attempts to evaluate the consumer’s response to both the environmental and animal welfare aspects of more sustainable food systems by (i) determining the characteristics of a consumer segment for sustainably produced beef using contingent valuation methods and (ii) estimating the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for animal welfare compliance and the environmental benefits derived from sustainable intensification within the identified consumer segment, employing a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). In addition, the study estimates the effect of information on consumer’s MWTP for environmentally friendlier beef. Results show that consumers within the identified segment are willing to pay on average 40.2% more for beef certified with both animal welfare and eco-friendly standards, with an increase of nearly 10% after being provided with information of the sector’s environmental impacts. These findings support some of the current climate change mitigation strategies in the national cattle industry while highlighting relevant opportunities and trade-offs in the context of a developing country. © 2019, The Author(s).","Animal welfare; Discrete choice experiment (DCE); Silvopastoral systems (SPS); Willingness to pay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076611761

Here we analyze the issue using the seed dispersal network (data of interaction between trees and animal seed dispersers) and forest composition of a 30-ha forest dynamics plot in central Thailand, where an intact fauna of primates, ungulates, bears and birds of all sizes still exists. We simulate the effect of two defaunation scenarios on forest biomass: 1) only primates extirpated (a realistic possibility in near future), and 2) extirpation of all large-bodied frugivores (LBF) including gibbons, macaques, hornbills and terrestrial mammals, the main targets of poachers in this region. For each scenario, we varied the population size reduction of the LBF dispersed tree species from 20% to 100%. We find that tree species dependent on seed dispersal by large-bodied frugivores (LBF) account for nearly one-third of the total carbon biomass on the plot, and that the community turnover following a complete defaunation would result in a carbon reduction of 2.4% to 3.0%, depending on the defaunation scenario and the model assumptions. The reduction was always greater than 1% when the defaunation intensity was at least 40%. These effect sizes are comparable to values reported for Neotropical forests, suggesting that the impact of defaunation on carbon deficit is not necessarily lower in Southeast Asian forests. The problem of defaunation in Asia, and the mutual benefits between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, should therefore not be neglected by global policies to reduce carbon emissions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068928186

Among these, the three items most prone to exceeding the standard are PM2.5, PM10, and O3, in that order. PM2.5 pollution episodes in Taiwan mainly occur in winter and spring when the northeast monsoon prevails. In addition to local pollution sources, transboundary air pollution affects Taiwan. Obviously, the existing AQ monitoring data analyzed by the BD-oriented perspective not only simplifies the simulation calculation and verification resources of the AQ model but also assists in real-time insight into the causal relationships between the AQ and important parameters of meteorology, pollution sources, and regions. This study integrates the BD-oriented Social Network Analysis (SNA) approach and data visualization tools to analyze the event co-occurrence and spatial correlation characteristics of two pollution scenarios for AQ monitoring stations based on two severe PM2.5 pollution conditions: (1) the Z-value of PM2.5 daily average concentration is higher than 1.65 (Scenario I), and (2) the daily average concentration of PM2.5 exceeds TEPA’s regulation on the AQ standard (Scenario II), to identify the regional leading nodes suitable for different pollution scenarios. Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and time series data are employed to verify the spatial-temporal representation of these leading nodes, which can be regarded as means to the real-time AQ management decision-making as well as instant transboundary pollution precaution in the future. This study contributes to the application of the discrete data-driven approach (SNA) and the continuous data-driven approach (PCA) in an ambient AQ monitoring network, which can clearly explain and analyze the regional high pollution characteristics of PM2.5 in Scenarios I and II.

However, the chemical state of oxide-derived copper during the CO2RR has remained elusive and is lacking in situ observations. Herein, a two-step process was developed to synthesize Ag nanowires coated with various thicknesses of a CuOx layer for the CO2RR. By employing in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a strong correlation between the chemical state under reaction conditions and the CO2RR product profile can be revealed to validate another competing reaction (i.e., the spontaneous oxidation of Cu(0) in aqueous electrolyte) that significantly governs the chemical state of active centers of Cu. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the existence of reoxidation behavior under cathodic potential, and the quantification analysis of reoxidized behavior is revealed to indicate that the reoxidation rate is independent of surface morphology and strongly proportional to the electrochemically surface area. The steady oxidation state of Cu in an in situ condition is the paramount key and dominates the products' profile of the CO2RR rather than other factors (e.g., crystal facets, atomic arrangements, morphology, elements) that have been investigated in numerous reports. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalyst selectivity; Copper; Electrolytes; Morphology; Nanowires; Oxidation; Silver; Surface morphology; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Aqueous electrolyte; Cathodic potentials; Hydrocarbon product; In-situ observations; In-situ Raman spectroscopy; In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy; Quantification analysis; Reaction conditions; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076789468

Survival rate can be optimized by planting provenances originating from an altitudinal belt of 500–1400 m in North America. Neither the variety nor the climate of origin of planted Douglas-fir provenances influence its response to frost events. Context: Understanding the risks of frost during late spring and early autumn is crucial for planting non-native Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirbel] Franco) as an alternative tree species under climate change in Europe. Aims: We investigate the role of early and late frost events on the survival of juvenile Douglas-fir and tested whether survival depends on seed origin. Methods: With data from 19 provenance trials across Austria, we modeled the effects of early and late frost events on juvenile survival rate, accounting for random variations due to site condition and provenance origin. Results: Wide variations (37–93%) in the juvenile survival rate of Douglas-fir were mainly driven by early and late frost events (daily Tmin &lt; 0 °C), summer drought, and continentality. Juvenile survival declined with an increasing number of frost events within the observation period and prevailing warm spells preceding the frost events. The seed origin of the tested provenances had a minor effect and was related to the altitude, but not to the variety or the climate of provenance origin. Conclusion: For planting Douglas-fir in the transition zone from Atlantic to continental climates, typical in Austrian forests, the local site conditions and the probability of the occurrence of early and late frosts should be considered, while provenance selection should rather focus on productivity. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Early frost; Extreme events; Late frost; Provenance trial; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Survival","altitudinal zonation; climate change; coniferous forest; extreme event; frost; juvenile; probability; provincialism; survival; transition zone; Atlantic Ocean; Austria; North America; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074331185

Fluctuation in load results in cycling operation of coal/gas power plants and enhanced carbon emission. In this paper, an attempt is made to quantify the savings in cycling of electrical power plant operation and the associated carbon emission with adjustment of time-keeping systems.

This transfer may be modulated by the glacial/interglacial cycling of water between oceans and continental ice sheets, which alters the surface loading of the solid Earth. The consequent volcanic-carbon fluctuations have been proposed as a pacing mechanism for Pleistocene glacial cycles. This mechanism is dependant on the amplitude and lag of the mid-ocean ridge response to sea-level changes. Here we develop and analyse a new model for that response, eliminating some questionable assumptions made in previous work. Our model calculates the carbon flux, accounting for the thermodynamic effect of mantle carbon: reduction of the solidus temperature and a deeper onset of melting. We analyse models forced by idealised, periodic sea level and conclude that fluctuations in melting rate are the prime control on magma and carbon flux. We also discuss a model forced by a reconstruction of eustatic sea level over the past 800 kyr. It indicates that peak-to-trough variations of magma and carbon flux are up to about 20% and 10% of the mean flux, respectively. Peaks in mid-ocean ridge emissions lag peaks in sea-level forcing by less than about 20 kyr and the lag could well be shorter. The amplitude and lag are sensitive to the rate of melt segregation. The lag is much shorter than the time it takes for melt to travel vertically across the melting region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","carbon flux; glacial cycles; magmatism; mid-ocean ridges","Carbon; Earth (planet); Glacial geology; Melting; Submarine geology; Carbon fluxes; Continental ice sheet; Glacial cycles; Magmatisms; Mid-ocean ridges; Pleistocene glacial; Solidus temperature; Thermodynamic effect; Sea level; amplitude; carbon flux; ice sheet; interglacial; magmatism; mid-ocean ridge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072601945

Nonetheless, intensified straw removal may aggravate the effects of mechanized harvesting and increase the risks of soil compaction, declining sugarcane yield. An experiment was designed, and four field studies were conducted to evaluate the cumulative effects of straw removal on soil physical attributes (bulk density, BD; soil resistance to penetration, SRP; macroporosity, MaP; microporosity, MiP, and mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, MWD) and their relationship with crop yield under clayey and sandy soils in the São Paulo state, Brazil. In each field study, four straw removal rates (no removal, NR; low removal, LR, removal of 5 Mg ha−1; high removal, HR, removal of 10 Mg ha−1; and total removal, TR, removal of 15 Mg ha−1) were arranged in a randomized block design with four replicates. The 4-year intensive management of straw removal (HR and TR) resulted in an increased soil compaction (BD and SRP values) and reduced the MWD in both sandy and clayey soils. Our findings also showed that these effects are more significant in sandy soils, where soil carbon content was substantially reduced in HR and TR treatments. Sites with higher BD and SRP induced by straw removal were strongly associated with lower sugarcane yields, especially in sandy soils. Conversely, our findings indicate that LR was not detrimental to soil physical quality and sugarcane yield. Nevertheless, considering the multifunctionality of straw in sustaining multiple ecosystem services in different soil types, straw management should be defined taking into consideration site-specific conditions. We advocate that recommendations for straw removal should also be combined with other conservationist soil management practices in order to minimize soil compaction and its negative implications on sugarcane yield and other ecosystem services. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Crop residues; Oxisols; Soil compaction; Soil resilience; Stalk yield","Agricultural wastes; Agronomy; Compaction; Crops; Ecosystems; Sand; Soil mechanics; Crop residue; Oxisols; Soil compaction; Soil resiliences; Stalk yield; Soils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068862294

The aims of this study were: To simulate the effects of a large fire event in the SWAT (Soil andWater Assessment Tool) hydrological model previously calibrated to a medium-sized watershed in Portugal; and to predict the hydrological impacts of large fires and future climate on water supply and soil erosion. For this, post-fire recovery was parametrized in SWAT based on satellite information, namely, the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The impact of future climate was based on four regional climate models under the stabilization (RCP 4.5) and high emission (RCP 8.5) scenarios, focusing on mid-century projections (2020-2049) compared to a historical period (1970-1999). Future large fire events (>3000 ha) were predicted from a multiple linear regression model, which uses the daily severity rating (DSR) fire weather index, precipitation anomaly, and burnt area in the previous three years; and subsequently simulated in SWAT under each climate model/scenario. Results suggest that time series of satellite indices are useful to inform SWAT about vegetation growth and post-fire recovery processes. Different land cover types require different time periods for returning to the pre-fire fraction of vegetation cover, ranging from 3 years for pines, eucalypts, and shrubs, to 6 years for sparsely vegetated low scrub. Future climate conditions are expected to include an increase in temperatures and a decrease in precipitation with marked uneven seasonal distribution, and this will likely trigger the growth of burnt area and an increased frequency of large fires, even considering differences across climate models. The future seasonal pattern of precipitation will have a strong influence on river discharge, with less water in the river during spring, summer, and autumn, but more discharge in winter, the latter being exacerbated under the large fire scenario. Overall, the decrease in water supply is more influenced by climate change, whereas soil erosion increase is more dependent on fire, although with a slight increase under climate change. These results emphasize the need for adaptation measures that target the combined hydrological consequences of future climate, fires, and post-fire vegetation dynamics. © 2019 by the authors.","Fire; Future climate; Hydrological impacts; Post-fire recovery; Satellite data; SWAT model","Climate change; Erosion; Fire hazards; Fires; Linear regression; Recovery; Satellites; Soils; Vegetation; Water supply; Future climate; Hydrological impacts; Post-fire; Satellite data; SWAT model; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076515643

This article outlines lessons learned through the Arctic Corridors and Northern Voices (AC-NV) project, which involved 14 communities across Inuit Nunangat. The AC-NV focused on understanding community-identified impacts and potential management options of increased shipping in Inuit Nunangat due to sea ice reductions and a changing climate. The approach used to conduct the research involved visiting researchers and community partners working together with local organizations, and training and hiring northern youth as cultural liaisons and workshop co-facilitators. We strove to develop a model of collaborative partnership and strong north-south research relationships. In this paper, we draw on our broad learning experiences from four community case studies conducted as part of the AC-NV project: Arviat, Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, and Pond Inlet, Nunavut. Close partnerships were formed in each of these communities, and 32 youth were trained in participatory mapping and workshop facilitation. For our diverse team of Inuit, northern-(i.e., non-Inuit, living in Inuit Nunangat), and southern-based non-Inuit researchers, our efforts to engage in partnered research were a critical component of the research and learning experience. In this article we share methodological reflections and lessons learned from what collaborative-partnered research means in practice. In so doing, we aim to contribute to the increasing dialogue and efforts around knowledge co-production and Inuit self-determination in research. Key conclusions of this reflective exercise include the importance of 1) conducting research that is relevant to local needs and interests, 2) visiting researchers and local organizations partnering together, 3) co-creating and refining knowledge documentation tools, 4) including youth cultural liaisons as co-facilitators, 5) conducting results validation and sharing exercises, and 6) being open to forming personal friendships.

We develop a statistical model to investigate relationships among and between the planetary boundaries and social foundations of the sustainability ‘doughnut’ model. We find over 35 direct and indirect, positive and negative, influences of varying magnitude among seven boundaries (biodiversity loss, climate change, ocean acidification, land use, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, atmospheric aerosol loading and freshwater use) and eleven foundations (energy, income, health, education, food, water, gender equality, resilience, jobs, voice and social equity). We observe that biodiversity loss is driven by other planetary boundaries (land-use change and freshwater use), but also a social foundation (jobs, measured as vulnerable employment). The planetary boundaries of freshwater use and land use are also related: freshwater use is higher in urban centres than in rural areas. The planetary boundary of climate change is also related to land use (the extent of agricultural lands), and the social foundation of income per capita (greater income, higher carbon dioxide emissions). We also find that several social foundations are themselves interrelated. For example gender equality (measured as female participation in the work force) is mainly predicted by vulnerable employment. Also, food deficit increases with poverty level, but is alleviated by access to clean water. Education (literacy rate) and social equity (social insurance) can both lift people out of poverty. These inter-relations suggest that both synergies and trade-offs exist between and within boundaries and foundations. We provide a new conceptual framework that moves us away from the doughnut approach towards one that can begin to address the complex interactions that sustainability scientists and policy makers face when trying to maintain multiple social foundations while not compromising any of the planetary boundaries. We illustrate several hypothesis-based relationships here, to suggest that everything is not related to everything else. It is possible to work out significant pathways within this complex system, which is necessary to implement policies.

Nevertheless, the (dis)incentives for the wider adoption of local production and self-consumption of energy (also known as ""prosumerism"") from renewable energy sources (RESs) are still not sufficiently addressed, nor are the broader social-ecological benefits of introducing RES as part of a sustainable viticulture strategy. Drawing on the social-ecological systems (SESs) resilience framework, this article presents the results of a Living Lab (an action-research approach) implemented in Alentejo (South of Portugal), which is an important wine-producing Mediterranean region. The triangulation of results from the application of a multi-method approach, including quantitative and qualitative methods, provided an understanding of the constraining and enabling factors for individual and collective RES prosumer initiatives. Top enablers are related to society's expectation for a greener wine production, but also the responsibility to contribute to reducing carbon emissions and energy costs; meanwhile, the top constraints are financial, legal and technological. The conclusions offer some policy implications and avenues for future research. © 2019 by the authors.","Constraints and enablers; Mediterranean wineries; Prosumers; Renewable energy sources; Resilience; Social-ecological system","cost analysis; demand-side management; energy efficiency; Mediterranean environment; qualitative analysis; resilience; triangulation; viticulture; wine industry; Alentejo; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076672875

These ecosystems are severely threatened, but little is known about their structure and functioning. We provide the first reports of the dasometric structure and spatial distribution of eight forests of Polylepis canoi, P. flavipila and P. rodolfovasquezii in the Central Peruvian Andes as fundamental information for management and conservation policies. We sampled all individuals ≥1 cm of diameter at ground level (DGL) in 20 plots of 10x10 m in each forest, and measured total height (TH) and DGL. Also, we mapped the spatial distribution of the individuals in two plots of 30x30 m (X and Y axes). We found differences in the dasometric structure between forests of the same species, which, in some cases, were associated with climate, soil or elevation variables. However, no well-defined pattern was found. The allometric relationships of the linear and non-linear models did not differ widely with respect to the R2 nor to the Akaike (AIC) scores, indicating that the forests did not show a saturation of tree height with increasing diameter. In the P. canoi forests, individuals with diameters ≥10 cm were the most abundant. In contrast, the forests of P. rodolfo-vasquezii showed a predominance of individuals with diameters ≤10 cm, whereas P. flavipila presented an altered structure with no relationship between DGL and TH in one of the evaluated forests. The analysis of spatial distribution according to the Ripley’s K function on a small scale revealed that P. flavipila and P. canoi presented random patterns, whereas P. rodolfo-vasquezii showed an aggregate pattern. Finally, our results showed that even forests of the same species have different dasometric structures, whereas spatial patterns differ only between species. So, caution must be taken when extrapolating information between species or forests during ecological studies and conservation actions. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

The genome-wide association study (GWAS) represents an important tool for the detection of candidate genes, haplotypes or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers related to characteristics of economic interest. The present study included information for 280 cows in three dairy production systems in Mexico: 1) Dual Purpose (n = 100), 2) Specialized Tropical Dairy (n = 76), 3) Familiar Production System (n = 104). Concentrations of CH4 in a breath of individual cows at the time of milking (MEIm) were estimated through a system of infrared sensors. After quality control analyses, 21,958 SNPs were included. Associations of markers were made using a linear regression model, corrected with principal component analyses. In total, 46 SNPs were identified as significant for CH4 production. Several SNPs associated with CH4 production were found at regions previously described for quantitative trait loci of composition characteristics of meat, milk fatty acids and characteristics related to feed intake. It was concluded that the SNPs identified could be used in genomic selection programs in developing countries and combined with other datasets for global selection. © 2019 by the authors.

However, individual firms still encounter technical and financial barriers that hinder the installation of renewables. The eco-industrial park approach aims to create synergies among firms thereby enabling them to share and efficiently use natural and economic resources. It also provides a suitable model to encourage the use of renewable energy sources in the industry sector. Synergies among eco-industrial parks and the adjacent urban areas can lead to the development of optimized energy production plants, so that the excess energy is available to cover some of the energy demands of nearby towns. This study thus provides an overview of the scientific literature on energy synergies within eco-industrial parks, which facilitate the uptake of renewable energy sources at the industrial level, potentially creating urban-industrial energy symbiosis. The literature analysis was conducted by arranging the energy-related content into thematic categories, aimed at exploring energy symbiosis options within eco-industrial parks. It focuses on the urban-industrial energy symbiosis solutions, in terms of design and optimization models, technologies used and organizational strategies. The study highlights four main pathways to implement energy synergies, and demonstrates viable solutions to improve renewable energy sources uptake at the industrial level. A number of research gaps are also identified, revealing that the energy symbiosis networks between industrial and urban areas integrating renewable energy systems, are under-investigated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions reduction; Eco-industrial parks; Industrial energy symbiosis; Industrial symbiosis; Renewable energy sources; Urban-industrial energy symbiosis","Emission control; Fossil fuels; Industrial plants; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Carbon emissions reductions; Eco-industrial park; Industrial energy; Industrial symbiosis; Renewable energy source; Industrial research; carbon emission; conceptual framework; design; emission control; industrial ecology; installation; literature review; optimization; renewable resource; symbiosis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071966262

It can encourage economic development while reducing carbon emissions, but large hydroelectric projects have serious social and environmental consequences. Democratic Developmental and Ecological Modernization theorists counseled the adoption of new regulations and institutions to increase citizen participation and socioenvironmental protection. Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and public audiences are considered best practice, but do these new protections and procedures alter government behavior when it makes critical development decisions? We argue scholars have paid too little attention to how bureaucratic hierarchies and weak cross-agency harmonization weaken environmental regimes. To highlight these issues, we provide an in-depth case study of hydroelectric dam construction in India, a country simultaneously confronting widespread underdevelopment and an energy matrix overwhelmingly reliant on carbon-based sources. Our multi-method analysis includes: innovative ArcGIS techniques to create an original database of large hydroelectric projects, field research, and a longitudinal analysis of three distinct periods of dam construction. We find the Indian government gradually shifted from large, multipurpose impoundment dams to smaller run-of-the-river (ROR) projects. ROR dams maintain a smaller footprint by requiring less flooding, but they are less efficient and versatile. Facing greater constitutional protections, concerns about resettlement costs, and past social mobilization, the Indian government is prioritizing smaller projects in remote locations to mitigate the social consequences of dam projects. Nevertheless, environmental concerns have been perfunctory. No fish ladders, exposed riverbeds, compromised waterflow regimes, and minimal riparian rehabilitation mean the environmental consequences of ROR dams remain extremely severe. These findings can be attributed to bureaucratic hierarchies, which limit the power of environmental agencies. Additionally, EIAs have been largely cursory and public audiences have not tangibly improved environmental outcomes because civil society generally prioritizes the social impacts of projects. In conclusion, our study finds India is better reconciling economic development with greater social protection and inclusion. The continued negative environmental externalities of contemporary hydroelectric projects highlight significant space for improving environmental protection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bureaucratic hierarchy; Democratic developmentalism; Ecological modernization; Hydroelectric dams; India; Sustainable development","bureaucracy; dam construction; economic development; environmental impact assessment; hydroelectric power plant; modernization; sustainable development; water flow; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071027962

In this regard, the WLTC-World-wide harmonized Light duty Test Cycle-stands as the new global reference cycle for fuel consumption, CO2 and pollutant emissions across the globe. Regulations keep a constant pressure on CO2 emission reduction leading vehicle manufacturers and component suppliers to modify hardware to ensure compliance. Within this balance, lubricants remain worthwhile contributors to lowering CO2 emission and fuel consumption. Yet with WTLC, new additional lubricant designs are likely to be required to ensure optimized friction due to its new cycle operating conditions, associated powertrain hardware and worldwide product use. Through friction torque and vehicle test campaigns, NISSAN and TOTAL have conducted a complete study to assess particularly how the Fuel Economy (FE) lubricants originally designed for JC08 (official Japanese driving cycle) or NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) will perform on the new WTLC. Beyond this initial state of art, the study was designed to quantify the potential of current lubricant industry trends such as the rise of lower viscosity oils, multi-fuel compatible products as well as new industry standards (upcoming ILSAC GF-6 or newly released ACEA C5-16).

This paper, therefore, describes three potential decarbonization pathways to analyze different effects for the electricity, transport, heating, and industrial sectors until 2050. Using an enhanced version of the multi-sectoral, open-source Global Energy System Model, enables us to assess the impact of different CO2 budgets on the upcoming energy system transformation. A detailed provincial resolution allows for the implementation of regional characteristics and disparities within China. Conclusively, we complement the model-based analysis with a quantitative assessment of current barriers for the needed transformation. Results indicate that overall energy system CO2 emissions and in particular coal usage have to be reduced drastically to meet (inter-) national climate targets. Specifically, coal consumption has to decrease by around 60% in 2050 compared to 2015. The current Nationally Determined Contributions proposed by the Chinese government of peaking emissions in 2030 are, therefore, not sufficient to comply with a global CO2 budget in line with the Paris Agreement.

We developed recommendation domains with common degree of impact requiring incremental, systemic or incremental adaptation effort to provide decision support for interventions to scale out adaptive practices. We used Random Forests to divide the cocoa production belt into four zones with distinct climatic features under current and future climate conditions. To make model results actionable we used an expert validation approach. Cocoa experts evaluated and verified cocoa occurrence data for model input, prioritized climate and soil variables for modeling use and confirmed the validity of the distribution of climate zones. Climate change will reduce the available area for cocoa production in the north due to a shift of the northern transition to the Savanna zone. The current area for cocoa in central Ashanti will remain suitable but will face uncertain climatic conditions. Areas in the Western, Central and Eastern regions will likely become hotter and wetter. Each of these projected impacts will require site-specific adaptation strategies matching the degree of impacts. Failing to prepare may subject rural communities to high risks of losing their livelihoods. Our recommendation domains can support impact specific preparation so that the majority of Ghana's cocoa production area may be sustained despite adverse climatic changes. Institutional and private actors can use our work to scale out locally conceived interventions to alleviate impacts from drought, heat and erratic rainfall. © 2019 The Author(s)","Climate impacts; Cocoa; Decision support; Ghana; Recommendation domains; West Africa","adaptive management; climate change; climate conditions; cocoa; crop production; decision support system; livelihood; risk assessment; rural population; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072540976

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) is one of the aromatic hydrocarbon compounds with the ability to cause cancer, while l ead is allegedly able to reduce IQ levels of children up to 5 (five) years. Therefore, considering the health hazards caused by these pollutants, it is essential to reduce its spread in the environment.

Living things, especially trees, are bio-indicators, known to be capable of reducing air pollution, both in the form of gas and particles while responding differently to the environment. Plants response to an environment is ameliorated or treated, with a balance to the metabolic system in a potentially toxic concentration condition. This study shows plants ability to absorb particles through leaves, thereby, making it able to take up roles in controlling air quality in urban areas and as a bioindicator of air pollution.

Given the potential for currently stabilised dune systems to reactivate under climate change and increased anthropogenic pressures, identifying the role of external disturbances in driving geomorphic response is vitally important. We developed a novel approach, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to time series of historical reactivation-deposition events from the Nebraska Sandhills, to determine the relationship between historic periods of sand deposition in semi-arid grasslands and external climatic conditions, land use pressures and wildfire occurrence. We show that both vegetation growth and sediment re-deposition episodes can be accurately estimated. Sensitivity testing of individual factors shows that localised forcings (overgrazing and wildfire) have a statistically significant impact when the climate is held at present-day conditions. However, the dominant effect is climate-induced drought.

PM10 showed a maximum concentration during pre-monsoon, whereas PM2.5 showed it in winter. The monsoon season showed the lowest concentrations for both PM10 and PM2.5. Concentrations were significantly reduced in 2016 due to the washout effect from enhanced rainfall during that year.

Through disclosure, climate change imprints the contents of directors' duty of skill and care in Europe. On the contrary, inUS there is no federal legislation or SEC regulations specifically on climate disclosure. Absent any binding decision yet, the current assessment of directors' fiduciary duties under state law does not include consideration of climate change risks and opportunities according to American authors, even though fiduciary dutiesmayevolve. The sole effective tool is the Martin Act. Levels of disclosure of US andEUcorporations are therefore already significantly different both in terms of climate risks and opportunities. This situation can drive the financial sector to direct capital to Europe. Institutional investors in US have been trying to increase disclosure through shareholders' proposals under Rule 14a-8 but these efforts have been recently undermined by the micro-management argument used by SEC. The conclusion is that the market cannot govern climate change by itself: Because of regulation, European corporations are better positioned to mitigate the ""carbon bubble"".

One of the most toxic metals is Cadmium (Cd), which is lethal to many aquatic organisms already at low concentrations. Denitrification by facultative anaerobic microorganisms is an essential process to transform, but also to remove, excess nitrate in eutrophied systems. Cd has been shown to decrease denitrification and sequester free sulfide, which is available when oxygen is scarce and generally inhibits complete denitrification (i.e. N2O to N2). In polluted sediments, an interaction between oxygen and Cd may influence denitrification and this relationship has not been studied. For example, in the Baltic Sea some sediments are double exposed to both Cd and hypoxia. In this study, we examined how the double exposure of Cd and fluctuations in oxygen affects denitrification in Baltic Sea sediment. Results show that oxygen largely regulated N2O and N2 production after 21 days of exposure to Cd (ranging from 0 to 500 μg/L, 5 different treatments, measured by the isotope pairing technique (IPT)). In the high Cd treatment (500 μg/L) the variation in N2 production increased compared to the other treatments. Increases in N2 production are suggested to be an effect of 1) enhanced nitrification that increases NO3− availability thus stimulating denitrification, and 2) Cd successfully sequestrating sulfide (yielding CdS), which allows for full denitrification to N2. The in situ field sediment contained initially high Cd concentrations in the pore water (∼10 μg/L) and microbial communities might already have been adapted to metal stress, making the effect of low Cd levels negligible. Here we show that high levels of cadmium pollution might increase N2 production and influence nitrogen cycling in marine sediments. © 2019 The Authors","Baltic Sea; Benthos; Denitrification; Hypoxia; Oxygen; Pollution; Sediment","cadmium; isotope; nitrogen; nitrogen 15; nitrous oxide; sulfide; cadmium; messenger RNA; nitrate reductase; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; nitrous oxide reductase; oxidoreductase; oxygen; anoxic conditions; benthos; cadmium; concentration (composition); denitrification; hypoxia; marine sediment; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; pollution incidence; sediment pollution; Article; Baltic Sea; chemical stress; concentration (parameter); controlled study; denitrification; environmental exposure; environmental impact; marine environment; microbial community; nitrification; nitrogen availability; nitrogen cycling; pollution; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; sediment; chemistry; drug effect; gene dosage; genetics; metabolism; porosity; sea; sediment; toxicity; water pollutant; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Cadmium; Denitrification; Gene Dosage; Geologic Sediments; Nitrate Reductase; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Oceans and Seas; Oxidoreductases; Oxygen; Porosity; RNA, Messenger; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073170054

In this paper, this challenge is addressed by introducing a novel integrative model for a private homeowner's decision-making process concerning energy renovation measures. The model distinguishes between the various stages of the process, the multiple factors that influence these stages, and the many considerations facing homeowners as they decide to adopt or reject energy renovation measures. Data were collected from interviews with and questionnaires completed by private homeowners in the city region of Parkstad Limburg (NL) who received an energy audit for their home. The findings reveal that various factors are relevant in different stages of the decision-making process. In the first stage, external developments, physical factors, socio-demographic factors, and environmental concerns can trigger an interest in energy renovation measures. In the second stage, homeowners gain knowledge about the measures, and personal background and advice from their social network or from professionals can influence this decision stage. In the third stage, during which financial and economic factors are particularly important, homeowners form an opinion about the energy renovation measures. After implementing the energy renovation measures, homeowners can also influence others in their social network and become ambassadors for further energy-saving changes. Based on the results, policy recommendations are provided to increase the adoption of energy renovation measures by private homeowners. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decision-making model; Energy audit; Energy renovation measures; Influencing factors; Private homeowners",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071868431

The Pacific Northwest is already experiencing weather regimes consistent with longer term climate projections, which predict longer and drier summers and stronger and wetter winter storms. Ironically, this combination makes imperative more water storage in one of the most heavily dammed regions in the nation. Although the positive role that beaver can play in watershed enhancement has been well known for decades, no project has previously attempted to re-introduce beaver on a watershed scale with a rigorous monitoring protocol designed to document improved water storage and temperature conditions needed for human uses and aquatic species. While the MBP has demonstrated that beaver can be re-introduced on a watershed scale, it has been much more difficult to scientifically demonstrate positive changes in water retention and stream temperature, given hydrologic complexity, unprecedented fire and floods, and the fact that beaver are highly mobile. This case study can help environmental studies students and natural resource policy professionals think about the broader challenges of diffuse, ecosystem services approaches to climate adaptation. Beaver-produced watershed improvements will remain difficult to quantify and verify, and thus will likely remain less attractive to water planners than conventional storage dams. But as climate conditions put additional pressure on such infrastructure, it is worth considering how beaver might be employed to augment watershed storage capacity, even if this capacity is likely to remain at least in part inscrutable. © 2019 by the Regents of the University of California.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104196589

The main finding is that, although environmental change in the form of seal invasions and dwindling fish stocks directly impacted the fisheries, the introduction of a new vessel quota system decisively changed adaptive capacity and coastal Sami household adaptation strategies. These changes represented a tipping point for the social–ecological system in the period between 1986 and 1990. It is thus important to discuss the ways in which governance systems may facilitate actions to adapt to climate and biodiversity change and foster sustainable rural livelihood systems in coastal Norway. Based on traditional and local ecological knowledge on the state of the ecosystem prior to the tipping point, two relevant actions to increase the resilience of the system were identified: ensuring the possibility of re-entry into fisheries as part of rural livelihood combinations, and ecological restoration of kelp beds.

The objective of our study was to determine the unnatural manner and causes of death in the elderly, defined as individuals at least 65 years of age at the time of death. We conducted a monocentric restrospective study based on police investigation reports and medicolegal autopsy reports collected from the Department of Legal Medicine of Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis, Tunisia between January 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2017. Results: During this period, 3837 autopsies were performed. Five hundred ninety-two (15.4%) were 65 years or older at the time of death. Of these, 264 deaths were categorized as accidental, suicidal, homicidal, or unknown. The mean age of victims was 75.3 years (± 6.7), unnatural deaths were higher in urban areas (64%) and victims were living alone in 24.7% of cases. Accidents accounted for the majority of unnatural deaths (90.5%) and were more common in males. Traffic accidents accounted for 66.9% of accidental deaths; they were more frequent in pedestrians and more frequent on Monday. They were followed by accidental falls which accounted for 17.2% of accidents and occurred in the home especially or in the workplace. Charcoal brazier was incriminated in 11 cases of accidental thermal burns and in all cases of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. Suicide and homicide were uncommon manners of death; they were observed in 16 and eight cases respectively. Hanging was the most used suicidal mean. Suicides were more common in males; they took place especially in the victim’s home, and history of psychiatric disorders was frequently elicited. Conclusions: Autopsies provide important statistical data that can be used for preventive strategies. For instance, actions must be carried out on the maintenance of public roads and raising awareness among public road users. Preventive measures should also include home improvement to help the elderly avoid accidental falls, installing smoke detectors, and the non-use of defective or rudimentary heating. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cause of death; Elderly accident; Elderly homicide; Elderly suicide; Forensic pathology; Unnatural death",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065927019

In many regions, climate services support decision-makers in their adaptation efforts. The range of these services and the number of associated information products have increased dramatically in recent years. However, the relationships between these products and their use and usability for targeted decision-making have rarely been systematically evaluated. Here, we report on the development of a systematic and user-centered approach to assess climate information products and networks of products; and apply it to products covering the nexus of climate, agriculture, and food security in Guatemala and Colombia. Across both countries, we assessed 28 products used for agricultural decision making, outreach, planning research, and design of emergency responses. While climate-only information products play a central role in each network, information products intended to support agriculture and food security need to integrate information from different themes or disciplines and sources at different scales. We find that major improvements in the credibility, legitimacy, scale, cognition, procedures, recommendations, and content of most existing products are required. Brevity and clarity of language are highlighted as desirable in both countries, as well as use of trusted and publicly-available data, and non-paper-based delivery formats. The approach and methodology are valuable for facilitating the prioritization of actions for improvement and/or the development of new products, thereby helping climate services for agriculture and food security to realize their true potential. © 2019 The Authors","Climate services assessment; Climate services usability; Network analysis; User-centered assessment","agriculture; climate change; decision making; food security; information processing; livelihood; prioritization; Colombia; Guatemala [Central America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076035817

These SDGs present a roadmap to a sustainable future and a challenge to the science community. To guide activities and check progress, targets and indicators have been and are still being defined. The soil science community has published documents that describe the primary importance of soil for SDGs addressing hunger, water quality, climate mitigation and biodiversity preservation, and secondary relevance of soil for addressing several other SDGs. Soil scientists only marginally participated in the SDG discussions and are currently only peripherally engaged in discussions on targets or indicators. Agreement on several soil-related indicators has still not been achieved. Involvement of soil scientists in SDG-based studies is desirable for both developing solutions and increasing the visibility of the soil profession. Inputs into policy decisions should be improved as SDG committee members are appointed by Governments. Possible contributions of soil science in defining indicators for the SDGs are explored in this paper. We advocate the pragmatic use of soil–water–atmosphere–plant simulation models and available soil surveys and soil databases where “representative” soil profiles for mapping units (genetically defined genoforms) are functionally expressed in terms of several phenoforms reflecting effects of different types of soil use and management that strongly affect functionality. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","genoforms; phenoforms; SDG indicators; SDG targets; soil survey; soil system modelling","global perspective; soil chemistry; soil management; soil science; soil survey; sustainability; sustainable development; United Nations",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067046253

A single GCM from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 with single regional climate model and delta change bias correction approaches combined with SWAT hydrological model were used to project stream flow for the developed scenario over the study periods of 2020s and 2080s including the current conditions. The result indicates that inconsistent increasing or decreasing of water availability was observed. The total annual surface water resource potential of Anger sub-basin estimated at the base period according to this study was about 3.396 BCM/year at current situations. However, the future scenarios in 2020s increasing water availability are shown by 2.71% for RCP 4.5 and negligible decrement shown by 0.14% for RCP 8.5 scenarios. As well as decreasing of water resource was shown by 7.43% and 11.3% at 2080s for both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively.

Fueling options considered include diesel only and dual-fuel applications with diesel and a gaseous fuel (CNG, LNG, and LPG). CIDI ICEs have higher fuel conversion efficiencies than stoichiometric, spark ignition (SI) ICEs, whether DI or port fuel injected (PFI). However, diesel-fueled CIDI ICEs have higher particulate matter (PM) and NOx engine-out emissions. The tail-pipe NOx emissions in real-world driving of diesel-powered vehicles have been, in the past, above the limits requested over the simplified cold start driving cycles used for certification. This issue has recently been resolved. The newest diesel-powered vehicles are now compliant with new laboratory test cycles and real-world-driving schedules and have no disadvantages in terms of criteria air pollutants compared to older diesel vehicles, while delivering improvements in fuel economy and CO2 emissions. Dual-fuel CIDI ICEs offer the opportunity for enhanced environmental friendliness. Dual-fuel CIDI ICEs have lower engine-out NOx and PM emissions compared to diesel-only CIDI ICEs. The latest diesel-only vehicles and vehicles with dual-fuel ICEs deliver dramatic reductions in tail-pipe PM emissions compared to older diesel-only vehicles. Moreover, they deliver tail-pipe PM emissions well below the ambient conditions in most city areas that are highly polluted, thereby helping to clean the air. The diesel-fueled CIDI ICEs may be further improved to deliver better fuel economy and further reduced tail-pipe emissions. The dual-fuel CIDI ICE has more room for improvement to produce similar or better steady state and transient performance in terms of torque, power output and fuel conversion efficiency compared to diesel-fueled CIDI ICEs, while drastically reducing CO2 and PM tail-pipe emissions, and improving NOx tail-pipe emissions. This is due to the ability to modulate the premixed and diffusion phases of combustion with a second fuel that is much easier to vaporize and is less prone to auto-ignition. Further development of the fuel injection system for the second fuel will lead to novel dual-fuel CIDI ICE designs with better performance. © Copyright © 2019 Boretti.","compression ignition diesel engines; dual fuel engines; greenhouse gas emissions; natural gas; particulate matter",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081225920

It is also clear that many local governments are politically and economically constrained in their capacity to implement needed adaptations. These constraints can restrict adaptation options to incremental, or even maladaptive, practices. At the same time, necessary transformational actions may remain out of reach for local actors. Building on five years of collaborative research with the city of Flagler Beach (FL, USA), we draw on political process theories to describe how incremental adaptation activities that are possible within current constraints can serve to build local capacity for instigating reforms at higher scales of social organization. We use the concept of a collective action strategy to conceptualize how context-specific barriers to adaptation can be overcome. From our analysis, an idealized multi-step process for designing collective action strategies is presented. The study advances scholarship on limits to adaptation beyond the diagnosis of barriers to action by taking steps towards developing context-specific strategies for overcoming these barriers. © 2019, The Author(s).","Barriers to adaptation; Incremental adaptation; Scale; Social change; Strategy; Transformational adaptation","Beaches; Barriers to adaptation; Incremental adaptation; Scale; Social changes; Strategy; Transformational adaptation; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; collective action; political process; social change; Flagler County; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075899653

Here we show the usefulness of optically assessed total particle volume below the main pycnocline to estimate carbon export in two systems: the open subarctic North Atlantic and the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Both regions exhibit seasonally high phytoplankton production and efficient export (i.e., a strong biological pump). Total particle volumes in the mesopelagic (200–300 m) were significantly correlated with those in the overlying surface mixed layer (50–60 m), indicating that most particles at depth reflect export from the surface. This connectivity, however, is modulated by the physical structure of the water column and by particle type (e.g., the presence of colonies of the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica versus diatoms). Evidence from both regions show that a strong pycnocline can delay or may even prevent particles from settling to deeper layers, which then succumb to disintegration, and microbial and zooplankton consumption. Strong katabatic winds in the Ross Sea may deepen the mixed layer, causing a rapid transfer of particles to mesopelagic depths through the mixed-layer pump. Independent estimates of seasonally integrated export production in the Ross Sea, based on upper water column carbon mass balance, were significantly correlated (in the order of shared variance) with (1) total particle volumes from images, (2) particulate organic carbon, and (3) chlorophyll fluorescence, all recorded at a depth range of 200–300 m. Carbon export was not significantly correlated with particle abundance measured by a Coulter counter at the same depth range. Measuring total particle volume below the primary pycnocline is therefore a useful approach to estimate carbon export at least in regions characterized by seasonally high particle export. © Copyright © 2019 Bochdansky, Dunbar, Hansell and Herndl.","Antarctica; Atlantic; biological pump; carbon export; particle flux",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077380023

We examined phosphorus inputs, retention, and riverine losses in 62 diverse watersheds that included a wide range of land cover and use (minimally disturbed to human dominated) and human P inputs in Minnesota, USA. Fertilizer inputs from row crop cultivation were the dominant source of P to agricultural watersheds. A large majority of P inputs was retained in watershed soils or removed in agricultural products. However, fertilizer input was the most important factor associated with average annual river transport of total, dissolved, and particulate phosphorus (PP). Mean annual runoff increased total and dissolved P yields and decreased P retention. Dissolved P made up a significant portion of annual river loads at sites with high rates of P inputs and river TP export, with the ratio of dissolved to PP export increasing with crop cover and fertilizer inputs. PP export rose with larger extents of eroding bluffs near channels. Bluffs constitute only a small proportion of watershed area, but make a disproportionately high contribution to sediment loads due to their close proximity to river channels that are increasingly affected by human and climate-driven changes to river hydrology. Together, our results suggest that rising discharge and flow variability due to climate change and agricultural intensification coupled with high rates of P inputs will maintain elevated fluvial P export into the future. Without reductions in P inputs and reductions in both soluble P losses and stream bank erosion, reversal of water quality degradation will be difficult to achieve. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Eutrophication; Legacy; Nutrient budget; Phosphorus; Watersheds","agricultural intensification; environmental degradation; eutrophication; land cover; nutrient budget; pollution exposure; river bank; runoff; transformation; water quality; watershed; Minnesota; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075887309

This study focuses on the incidence of climate variables and indices that are relevant both for climate change assessment and for grape production, with emphasis on grapevine bioclimatic indices and extreme events (e.g., cold waves, storms, heatwaves). Dynamical downscaling of European Reanalysis-Interim and Max Planck Institute Earth System low-resolution global simulations forced with a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenario was performed with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to a regional scale including the Douro Valley of Portugal for recent-past (1986–2005) and future periods (2046–2065, 2081–2100). The number, duration and intensity of events were superimposed over critical phenological phases estimated by using a specific local grapevine varietal phenological model in order to assess their positive or negative implications for wine production in the region. An assessment of the relevance of climate parameters and indices and their progression in recent-past and future climate scenarios with regard to the potential impact on wine production was performed. Results indicate a positive relation between higher growing-season heat accumulations and greater vintage yields. A moderate incidence of very hot days (daily maximum temperature above 35°C) and drought from pre-véraison phenological conditions have a positive association with vintage ratings. However, the mid- and long-term WRF-MPI RCP8.5 future climate scenarios reveal shifts to warmer and drier conditions, with the mean GST not remaining within range for quality wine production in the long-term future climate scenario. These results indicate potential impacts that suggest a range of strategies to maintain wine production and quality in the region. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","agrometeorology; bioclimatic indices; climate change modelling; extreme climate indices; grapevine phenology; regional and mesoscale modelling; wine production","Breweries; Greenhouse gases; Weather forecasting; Wine; Agrometeorology; bioclimatic indices; Extreme climates; grapevine phenology; Mesoscale modelling; Wine production; Climate change; agrometeorology; bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; downscaling; extreme event; phenology; wine; Douro Valley; Portugal; Vitaceae; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069903924

Experiments carried out with lichen- and moss-dominated biocrusts indicate that climate change may dramatically reduce their cover and diversity. Therefore, the development of reproducible methods to monitor changes in biocrust diversity and abundance across multiple spatio-temporal scales is key for evaluating how climate change may impact biocrust communities and the myriad of ecosystem functions and services that rely on them. In this study, we collected lichen-dominated biocrust samples from a semi-arid ecosystem in central Spain. Their α-diversity was then evaluated using very high spatial resolution hyperspectral images (pixel size of 0.091 mm) measured in laboratory under controlled conditions. Support vector machines were used to map the biocrust composition. Traditional α-diversity metrics (i.e., species richness, Shannon's, Simpson's, and Pielou's indices) were calculated using lichen fractional cover data derived from their classifications in the hyperspectral imagery. Spectral diversity was calculated at different wavelength ranges as the coefficient of variation of different regions of the reflectance spectra of lichens and as the standard deviation of the continuum removal algorithm (SD_CR). The accuracy of the classifications of the images obtained was close to 100%. The results showed the best coefficient of determination (r2 = 0.47) between SD_CR calculated at 680 nm and the α-diversity calculated as the Simpson's index, which includes species richness and their evenness. These findings indicate that this spectral diversity index could be used to track spatio-temporal changes in lichen-dominated biocrust communities. Thus, they are the first step to monitor α-diversity of biocrust-forming lichens at the ecosystem and regional levels, a key task for any program aiming to evaluate changes in biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in drylands. © 2019 by the authors.","Biocrusts; Biodiversity; Biological soil crust; Chlorophyll; Continuum removal; Remote sensing; Spectral diversity; Support vector machine; α-diversity","Biodiversity; Chlorophyll; Ecosystems; Fungi; Image classification; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Biocrusts; Biological soil crusts; Coefficient of determination; Coefficient of variation; Continuum removal; Hyper-spectral imageries; Spectral diversity; Very high spatial resolutions; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077865502

In order to overcome the gaps in literature, the model was fitted and validated on long period experimental data. It was based only on the use of climatic conditions as input variables, without making assumptions about the plants. Climatic data were grouped in solar radiation slots; the most significant predictors were selected for each slot. The adoption of this method allowed to obtain, during validation, coefficients of determination (R2) higher than 0.95 and low values of the root mean square error (0.4–0.6 °C). It was found that the vegetated walls recorded surface temperatures lower than the uncovered wall up to 7.7 °C in summertime.

It is well known that the ice in these regions is melting at an accelerated pace each year. As a result, some animals are unable to survive. There are many indicators showing that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the use of fossil fuels is the main culprit contributing to this global warming. With recent advances in technology and renewable sources, it has been demonstrated that power electronics can play an important role in efficiently substituting fossil-fuel-based electrical power production and electrification of transport, thereby substantially cutting CO2 emissions. Consequently, to fully grasp the meaning of climate change, the 10th IEEE Future of Electronic Power Processing and Conversion (FEPPCON X) workshop was held in Troms&oslash;, Norway, close to the polar region.

We here present triple-oxygen isotope analyses of clay-size sediments from 45 rivers worldwide, as well as δ18O analyses of corresponding silt- and sand-rich detrital fractions, which altogether cover about 25% of the continental area that drained into the oceans, extending from the tropics to polar regions.

Overall, bulk clays from across different climatic regions do not vary much isotopically; an observation which we attribute to opposing effects of temperature on clay-water fractionation and hydrologic relationship between temperature and δ18OMW. Mathematical inversion of measured clay δ18O and Δ17O values (corrected for detrital contribution) into MAT and δ18OMW, compiled for each studied watershed, returns satisfactory estimates. Globally, triple O isotopes in clays appear to be water-dominated, being controlled almost exclusively by δ18OMW at respective temperature of weathering, with minor effects related to evaporation. Using sand from rivers, correlation of δ18O silts with detrital proportions, and estimated surface outcrop of different rock types, we additionally arrive at a +11.5‰ estimate for the exposed silicate crust undergoing weathering. Globally-averaged, sediment-flux weighted clay δ18O and Δ17O values are +14.80‰ and −0.164‰, respectively. These values are significantly skewed toward O isotope signatures for the southeast Asia and western Pacific regions, characterized by very high sediment fluxes to the ocean. Using both clay- and silt-size fractions, the total weighted silicate weathering δ18O signature exported to the world's ocean is −2.59‰, almost 50% higher the previous estimate, yielding an ice-free world hydrosphere estimate of −0.78‰. Overall, the modern river clays represent a snapshot of modern weathering conditions on continents, and associated first-order climatic signatures related to MAT and δ18O of the hydrosphere. This implies that measured increase in δ18O and stepwise decrease in Δ17O in shales in the geologic record capture: evolving global hydrologic cycle upon continental emergence, decrease in global MAT or diagenetic conditions, and decreasing ocean mass via rehydrating of the mantle by subduction of hydrated low-δ18O, high-Δ17O slabs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","clay minerals; hydrosphere evolution; triple oxygen isotopes; weathering","Clay minerals; Estimation; Hydrosphere; Isotopes; Oceanography; Oxygen; Rivers; Sediments; Silicates; Silt; Temperature; Climate information; Effects of temperature; Fine-grained sediment; Mean annual temperatures; Silicate weathering; Triple oxygen isotopes; Weathering conditions; Weathering process; Weathering; annual variation; clay mineral; diagenesis; fine grained sediment; hydrosphere; isotopic fractionation; meteoric water; oxygen isotope; sediment transport; weathering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072914618

We used a global chemical-transport model with online aerosol microphysics (GEOS-Chem-TOMAS) to estimate the aerosol health and climate impacts of four emission-control policies: (1) 85% reduction in sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions (Sulf); (2) 85% reduction in SOx and black carbon (BC) emissions (Sulf-BC); (3) 85% reduction in SOx, BC, and organic aerosol (OA) emissions (Sulf-BC-OA); and (4) 85% reduction in SOx, BC, OA, and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (Sulf-BC-OA-NOx). The SOx reductions reflect the 0.5% fuel-sulfur cap implemented by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on 1 January 2020. The other reductions represent realistic estimates of future emission-control policies. We estimate that these policies could reduce fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-attributable mortalities by 13 300 (Sulf) to 38 600 (Sulf-BC-OA-NOx) mortalities per year. These changes represent 0.3% and 0.8%, respectively, of annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities from anthropogenic sources. Comparing simulations, we estimate that adding the NOx cap has the greatest health benefit. In contrast to the health benefits, all scenarios lead to a simulated climate warming tendency. The combined aerosol direct radiative effect and cloud-albedo indirect effects (AIE) are between 27 mW m-2 (Sulf) and 41 mW m-2 (Sulf-BC-OA-NOx). These changes are about 2.1% (Sulf) to 3.2% (Sulf-BC-OA-NOx) of the total anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing. The emission control policies examined here yield larger relative changes in the aerosol radiative forcing (2.1%-3.2%) than in health effects (0.3%-0.8%), because most shipping emissions are distant from populated regions. Valuation of the impacts suggests that these emissions reductions could produce much larger marginal health benefits ($129-$374 billion annually) than the marginal climate costs ($12-$17 billion annually). © 2020 The Author(s).

Since science plays an important role in decision-making, this study examines the thematic landscape of research on sustainable energy, which may contribute to a sustainability transformation. Understanding the structure of the research field allows for critical reflections and the identification of blind spots for advancing this field. Methods: The study applies a text mining approach on 26533 Scopus-indexed abstracts published from 1990 to 2016 based on a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model. Models with up 1100 topics were created. Based on coherence scores and manual inspection, the model with 300 topics was selected. These statistical methods served for highlighting timely topic trends, differing thematic fields, and emerging communities in the topic network. The study critically reflects the quantitative results from a sustainability perspective. Results: The study identifies a focus on establishing and optimizing the energy infrastructure towards 100% renewable energies through key modern technology areas: materials science, (biological) process engineering, and (digital) monitoring and control systems. Energy storage, photonic materials, nanomaterials, or biofuels belong to the topics with the strongest trends. The study identifies decreasing trends for general aspects regarding sustainable development and related economic, environmental, and political issues. Conclusions: The discourse is latently adopting a technology-oriented paradigm focusing on renewable energy generation and is moving away from the multi-faceted concept of sustainability. The field has the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation by optimizing renewable energy systems. However, given the complexity of these systems, horizontal integration of the various valuable vertical research strands is required. Furthermore, the holistic ecological perspective considering the global scale that has originally motivated research on sustainable energy might be re-strengthened, e.g., by an integrated energy and materials perspective. Beyond considering the physical dimensions of energy systems, existing links from the currently technology-oriented discourse to the social sciences might be strengthened. For establishing sustainable energy systems, future research will not only have to target the technical energy infrastructure but put a stronger focus on issues perceivable from a holistic second-order perspective. © 2019 The Author(s).","Research networks; Research trends; Sustainable energy; Text mining; Topic modeling","Climate change; Data mining; Decision making; Energy conservation; Renewable energy resources; Social sciences computing; Statistics; Research networks; Research trends; Sustainable energy; Text mining; Topic Modeling; Sustainable development; alternative energy; climate change; decision making; holistic approach; mining; numerical model; probability; research work; statistical analysis; sustainable development; Scopus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076962539

Among these important prey species, pikas are considered especially vulnerable to rising temperatures that would impede their surface activity and dispersal. We investigated how climatic regimes influence the niche of the Royle’s pika (Ochotona roylei), and which climatic drivers and change trajectories may threaten the species’ future sustenance, thereby prioritizing areas for future conservation of this species across its distribution range. We used Royle’s pika presence locations in the MaxEnt framework, along with biologically relevant climatic and topographical variables, to model the present (2010) and the future (2050, 2070) climatic niche under different future scenarios projected by CCSM4 climatic models. Subsequently, we estimated the climatic niche loss across the elevation gradient, longitudinal gradient, and both inside and outside protected areas for all countries within the species’ range. Niche suitability of the Royle’s pika was substantially determined by precipitation of the coldest quarter (~snow cover) and wettest quarter (~monsoon rainfall). As these parameters are known to be vulnerable to global climatic change, our projection revealed significant loss (102 km2/year) in the species niche availability across all future scenarios, particularly in non-protected low-elevation regions. By identifying areas where species survival may be threatened, we confirmed that the distribution of Royle’s pika, an important prey species, might be reduced by climate change. Our findings can aid in conservation planning strategies for this species and other alpine fauna and contribute to ongoing efforts to monitor change in the Himalaya. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Alpine; Climatic niche; Ecological niche modeling; Himalaya; MaxEnt; Pika",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072098653

We investigated physiological perturbations due to rapid changes of sunlight and air temperature in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana), a desert shrub common within the path of eclipse totality. Leaf gas exchange, water potential, and chlorophyll a fluorescence were monitored during the eclipse and compared to responses obtained the day before in absence of the eclipse.

The trials ran for at least three consecutive years with detailed recording of milk production and input costs. Nitrate leaching per hectare of the milking platform (where lactating cows are kept) was estimated using either measurements (suction cups), models, or soil mineral nitrogen measurements. Post-trial, detailed farm information was used in the New Zealand greenhouse gas inventory methodology to calculate the emissions from all sources; dairy platform, dairy support land used for wintering non-lactating cows (where applicable) and replacement stock, and imported supplements. Nitrate leaching was also estimated for the support land and growing of supplements imported from off-farm using the same methods as for the platform. Operating profit (NZ$/ha/year), nitrate leaching (kg N/ha/year), and greenhouse gas emissions (t CO2-equivalent/ha/year) were all expressed per hectare of milking platform to enable comparisons across regions. Nitrate leaching mitigations adopted in lower-input (less purchased feed and nitrogen fertiliser) farm systems reduced leaching by 22 to 30 per cent, and greenhouse gas emissions by between nine and 24 per cent. The exception was the wintering barn system in Otago, where nitrate leaching was reduced by 45 per cent, but greenhouse gas emissions were unchanged due to greater manure storage and handling. Important drivers of a lower environmental footprint are reducing nitrogen fertiliser and purchased feed. Their effect is to reduce feed flow through the herd and drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and nitrate leaching. Emission reductions in the lower-input systems of Waikato and Canterbury came at an average loss of profit of approximately NZ$100/t CO2-equivalent (three to five per cent of industry-average profit per hectare). © 2019, MDPI AG.

A generalized classification of sources of pollutant emissions into the environment is proposed, while the sources of air pollution in urban areas are classified according to the following main criteria: by origin, by aerodynamic parameters and by the nature of the direction of the emission plume, by spatial position and possible mobility, in terms of size in plan, in height of the spread of the emission plume, taking into account the height of the mouth of the source of the emission of pollutants above the level of the earth's surface, in temperature of air-gas mixture, according to the mode of action. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Aerodynamics; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Industrial research; Aerodynamic parameters; Air pollution sources; Classification scheme; Environmental safety; Methodical approach; Methodological approach; Pollutant emission; Residential areas; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076561595

In comparison to conventional operation with stoichiometric mixture, this itself raises fundamental issues in terms of combustion physics, among which the significant reduction of the laminar flame speed, increase of the laminar flame thickness as well as an increased sensitivity to local fuel/air equivalence ratio variations are all essential to be accounted for. In particular, the effect of modified laminar flame characteristics on flame stretch during the early flame development in a spark ignited engine is of importance. In the present work the cycle-to-cycle combustion variations of ultra-lean burn operation is modeled, by utilizing capability of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). Then results are analyzed after a careful validation of the aerodynamics and spray/flow interactions that have initially been predicted. This aims to simulate direct injection gasoline engine operating in ultra-lean conditions with indicated efficiency of 46%. First, LES predictions of the cold flow are compared to High Speed Particle Image Velocimetry. Second, the injector model is compared against experimental spray measurements. Third, cyclic variability of burn rates from LES results are compared with experimental data. The simulation yielded results highlighted the importance of having accurate modelling of both flame stretch and laminar flame speed in order to capture the early phase of combustion. Therefore finally, the ignition delay, 50% burning point and the burn duration all match well with experimental data. © 2019 SAE Japan and SAE International.",,"Direct injection; Efficiency; Engines; Fuels; Large eddy simulation; Powertrains; Sensitivity analysis; Velocity measurement; Cyclic variabilities; Direct injection gasoline engine; High-speed particles; Improving efficiency; Indicated efficiency; Laminar flame speed; Spark-ignited engines; Stoichiometric mixtures; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084452252

The empirical findings document that the variables under investigation are cointegrated. Short-run Granger causality tests illustrate unidirectional causalities running from: (i) renewable energy to CO 2 emissions and trade; (ii) tourism to trade and FDI; and (iii) economic growth to renewable energy and tourism. In the long run, there is evidence of bidirectional causality between renewable energy, tourism, FDI, trade, and emissions. Thus, renewable energy and tourism are in a strong long-run causal relationship. Moreover, long-run estimates for the whole panel and for the three income panel groups considered (Lower Middle, Upper Middle, High) highlight that tourism, renewable energy, and FDI contribute to the reduction of emissions, while trade and economic growth lead to higher carbon emissions. Therefore, attracting foreign direct investment, encouraging the use of renewable energy, and tourism development, particularly green tourism, are good policies for this region to combat climate change. © 2019, The Author(s).","CO 2 emissions; Foreign direct investment; Panel cointegration; Renewable energy; Tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061788938

We studied elemental and stable isotopic composition of sedimentary organic matter, photosynthetic pigments and carbon stable isotopic composition of Daphnia (Cladocera; Crustacea) resting eggs (δ13CClado) in a sediment record from a small subarctic lake. We examined how regional climate and landscape changes over the last 5800 years affected the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon transfer to zooplankton. Overall, δ13CClado values were well in line with the range of theoretical values of aquatic primary producers, confirming that zooplankton consumers in subarctic lakes, even in the long-term perspective, are mainly fuelled by autochthonous primary production. Results also revealed greater incorporations of benthic algae into zooplankton biomass in periods that had a warmer and drier climate and clearer water, whereas a colder and wetter climate and lower water transparency induced higher contributions of planktonic algae to Daphnia biomass. This study thus emphasizes long-term influence of terrestrial-aquatic linkages and in-lake processes on the functioning of subarctic lake food webs. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"carbon; animal; chemistry; climate change; Daphnia; lake; metabolism; ovum; physiology; zooplankton; Animals; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Climate Change; Daphnia; Lakes; Ovum; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075216373

The activity sectors influencing most the PM2.5 levels in the study area are energy production (22%), agriculture (19%), residential combustion (16%) and road transport (7%). The energy production in inefficient coal-fuelled power plants was identified as one of main source of PM2.5 in the Western Balkans. As for the geographical origin of PM2.5, the transboundary pollution is confirmed as the main origin of PM2.5 (44%) in the investigated cities, while the city own emissions and the national sources outside the concerned city impact on average 22% and 15%, respectively. An association was observed between the long-range transport and the impact of agriculture and energy production, while both local urban emissions and long-range transport were associated with the residential sector. A special attention is given in this study to biomass, a renewable source, which use is often promoted in the frame of climate and energy policies. Nevertheless, the combustion of biomass in inefficient small appliances has considerable particulate matter emissions and therefore this type of practice impacts negatively on air quality. Considering that biomass is traditionally used in South-East Europe as fuel for residential heating, the interpretation of the model results was supported with the estimation of biomass burning contributions to PM2.5 obtained with receptor models and data on biomass fuel consumption from the literature. The analysis of the contributions from biomass burning derived from receptor models suggests that biomass burning is the dominant source within the residential heating sector in the studied area and that the emissions from this source are likely underestimated. This study concludes that more effort is needed to improve the estimations of biomass burning emissions and that policies to improve air quality in the cities should involve a geographic context wider than the city level. © 2019 The Authors",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Air quality; Biomass; Coal combustion; Geographical regions; Housing; Urban transportation; Biomass burning emissions; Geographic contexts; Geographical origins; Long range transport; Particulate matter emissions; Residential combustion; Residential heating; Trans-boundary pollution; Coal industry; air quality; anthropogenic effect; biomass burning; long range transport; particulate matter; pollutant source; transboundary pollution; urban pollution; agriculture; air pollution; air quality; Article; biomass; city; climate; coal power; combustion; energy yield; environmental impact; Europe; geographic distribution; heating; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; priority journal; residential area; traffic and transport; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; Balkan Peninsula; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; procedures; Balkans; coal; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Balkan Peninsula; Biomass; Cities; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Particulate Matter; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073224266

Box 90328, Durham, NC  27708, United States","Mitigation of climate change depends on accurate estimation and mapping of terrestrial carbon stocks, particularly in carbon dense tropical forests. Allometric equations can be used to robustly estimate biomass of tropical trees, but often require tree height, which is frequently unknown. Researchers and practitioners must, therefore, decide whether to directly measure a subset of tree heights to develop diameter : height (D:H) equations or rely on previously published generic equations. To date, studies comparing the two approaches have been spatially restricted and/or not randomly allocated across the landscape of interest, making the implications of deciding whether or not to measure tree heights difficult to determine. To address this issue, we use inventory data from a systematic-random forest inventory across Gabon (102 forest sites; 42,627 trees, including 7,036 height-measured trees). Using plot-specific models of D:H as a benchmark, we compare the performance of a suite of locally fitted and commonly used generic models (parameterized national, georegional, and pantropical equations) across a variety of scales, and assess which abiotic, anthropogenic, and topographical covariates contribute the most to bias in height estimation. We reveal marked spatial structure in the magnitude and direction of bias in tree height estimation using all generic models, due at least in part to soil type, which compounded to substantial error in site-level AGB estimates (of up to 38% or 150 Mg/ha). However, two generic pantropical models (Chave 2014; Feldpausch 2012) converged to within 2.5% of mean AGB at the landscape scale. Our results suggest that some (not all) pantropical equations can extrapolate AGB across large spatial scales with minimal bias in estimated mean AGB. However, extreme caution must be taken when interpreting the AGB estimates from generic models at the site-level as they fail to capture substantial spatial variation in D:H relationships, which could lead to dramatic under- or over-estimation of site-level carbon stocks. Validated allometric models derived at site- or soil-type-levels may be the best way to reduce such biases arising from landscape-level heterogeneity in D:H model fit in the Afrotropics. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","aboveground biomass; allometric equation; carbon stocks; central African rainforest; Michaelis-Menten model; Weibull model","aboveground biomass; allometry; benchmarking; carbon sink; climate change; equation; estimation method; forest inventory; landscape change; model validation; soil type; spatial variation; tropical forest; Weibull theory; Gabon; carbon; biomass; soil; statistical bias; tree; tropic climate; Bias; Biomass; Carbon; Soil; Trees; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071373867

However, because these policy tools are state-driven, the technologies and fuel types included in each state's RPS vary. In this article, I discuss the inclusion of municipal solid waste in Maryland's RPS, and a social movement for environmental justice that has emerged around this decision. Given the prominence of RPSs in both fueling renewable energy adoption in the U.S., as well as in encouraging particular technologies, it is increasingly important to interrogate the types of technologies and fuel sources that climate policies like RPSs incentivize, and how they are received by the communities for which they are proposed.

Carbon isotopic compositions of biomarkers from Polish lignite are reported for the first time. The aim of the study is to improve the chemotaxonomic value of biomarkers by relating the results to existing paleobotanical data, and to gain information about the influencing factors on δ13C of lignite and lipids. Furthermore, biomarker and isotopic proxies are tested for their applicability in paleoclimate studies. The molecular composition of the extracted lipids is highly variable, including leaf-wax n-alkanes in the C23 to C31 range, diterpenoids, hopanoids, and angiosperm-derived triterpenoids, as well as saturated fatty acids, long-chain n-alkanols and n-alkan-2-ones. The relative abundances of mid-chain (C23, C25) n-alkanes and their 1–2‰ higher δ13C values compared to long-chain n-alkanes (C29, C31) argue for a minor contribution of macrophytes (graminoids, etc.) to peat formation, enhanced during periods of raised water level. The presence of ferruginol and dehydroferruginol testifies the contribution of Taxodiaceae. The abundances of pimarane-type diterpenoids and the presence of non-aromatic abietane-derivatives argue for the contribution of Pinaceae. Based on the presence of lupeol and lupane-type triterpenoids, an input of Betulaceae can be concluded. The contribution of further angiosperms cannot be specified based on the composition of pentacyclic triterpenoids. However, the results indicate mixed vegetation, and are in agreement with paleobotanical data highlighting abundant conifers of the Taxodiaceae/Cupressaceae and Pinaceae families, as well as angiosperms of various families (e.g., Nyssa, Quercus, Fagus), including Betulaceae (e.g., Alnus, Betula, Corylus). Based on the relationship between the carbon preference index of n-alkanes and mean annual air temperatures, obtained from a global database of peatlands, an average temperature of 24.5 °C is obtained. This value is significantly higher as estimated from paleobotanical data (15.7–19.7 °C), probably due to the influence of changes in vegetation on carbon preference index. The relative abundances of diterpenoids versus di- plus angiosperm-derived triterpenoids in detrital lignite samples revealed variable contributions of gymnosperms and angiosperms during the middle Miocene. Consistent with these results, a positive relationship exists between the di-/(di- + tri-) terpenoid biomarker ratios and δ13C of lignite samples, indicating the dominating role of varying gymnosperm/angiosperm contributions on the carbon isotopic composition of lignite. The C-isotope data of long-chain n-alkanes, diterpenoids, and angiosperm-derived triterpenoids co-vary within the profiles, arguing for an overall control of changes in δ13C of atmospheric CO2 on δ13C of plant lipids. Fluctuations in δ13C of individual compounds may also be related to changes in carbon cycling within the peat, humidity and air temperature. The influence of local variations in ambient CO2 (e.g., the canopy effect) cannot be excluded. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomarkers; C-isotopic composition; Detrital lignite; Paleovegetation; Terpenoids","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Biomarkers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Isotopes; Lignite; Lignite mines; Organic carbon; Paraffins; Peat; Saturated fatty acids; Vegetation; Water levels; Carbon isotope analysis; Carbon isotopic composition; Isotopic composition; Mean annual air temperatures; Molecular compositions; Paleovegetation; Pentacyclic triterpenoids; Terpenoids; Lipids; angiosperm; biomarker; carbon cycle; carbon isotope; chemical compound; chemotaxonomy; coniferous tree; dicotyledon; isotopic composition; lignite; lipid; macrophyte; Miocene; monoterpene; opencast mining; paleobotany; paleoclimate; paleoecology; peatland; terpene; Konin [Poland]; Poland [Central Europe]; Alnus; Betula; Betulaceae; Coniferophyta; Corylus; Cupressaceae; Fagus; Gymnospermae; Magnoliophyta; Nyssa; Pinaceae; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072614873

In response, Brazil has proposed a massive pasture restoration program that aspires to make ranching more competitive while at the same time reducing associated GHG emissions. Pasture restoration, however, is only one of several intensification options that could be employed to achieve these goals. Here we analyze potential production, economic return and GHG emissions from an intensification strategy based mainly on pasture restoration and compare its productive, economic and GHG emissions performances with intensification options more focused on supplemental feeding (grain-feed supplementation of grazing animals and animal finishing in feedlots). To this end, we developed a multi-sectoral, deterministic simulation model of the ranching system and applied it to Mato Grosso state, the largest producer and earliest adopter of intensive production. To account for GHG emissions, we performed a life cycle analysis of a complete beef production cycle. Our results show that an intensification strategy focused more heavily on pasture restoration does reduce GHG emissions but produces the least favorable economic and GHG emissions outcomes when compared with a range of supplemental feeding alternatives. In view of these results, Brazil should seek a more diversified strategies for cattle intensification in its climate mitigation policy. © 2019 The Author(s).

Here, we demonstrate that emission from VSi defect ensembles can be enhanced by an order of magnitude via fabrication of Schottky barrier diodes, and sequentially modulated by almost 50 % via application of external bias. Furthermore, we identify charge state transitions of VSi by correlating optical and electrical measurements, and realize selective population of the bright state. Finally, we reveal a pronounced Stark shift of 55 GHz for the V1′ emission line state of VSi at larger electric fields, providing a means to modify the single-photon emission.

However, a deep understanding of the phenomena controlling dual-fuel ignition and combustion processes is still needed to further improving engine behavior especially at low load. To this aim, a combined experimental/numerical approach is proposed in this paper, consisting in a detailed experimental test campaign along with a numerical model to represent and then verify the similarities between engine and chamber local thermodynamics conditions. The design and operation of a tailored experimental setup to study the fundamentals of the dual-fuel combustion process at engine-like operating conditions in optically accessible constant volume combustion chamber is a challenging task. In this paper, similar conditions characterizing the engine operation are represented with a first combustion of a lean air-methane mixture. Then, methane is injected into the chamber to mimic low load engine operation condition in terms of overall equivalence ratio. The oxygen left from the first combustion supports the oxidation of the post-injected methane whose ignition is triggered by a diesel pilot injection. Special care is addressed in characterizing heat and mass losses as well as the mass of methane introduced. During experiments, chamber pressure is measured and thus the evolution of the combustion process is characterized. Numerical simulations, carried out by means of the CONVERGE CFD code, are used to check the charge distribution inside the chamber, and evaluate the local thermodynamic conditions after the gas exchange process. A comparison between the experimental and numerical pressure trace profiles has been performed to validate the numerical model. Results obtained confirm the validity of the proposed approach highlighting the need for a careful calibration of the injection parameters to achieve the target conditions close to the spray injection location. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077912107

Two types of alternative management systems were evaluated, spanning twelve treatments: I) tillage, with the incorporation of the green manure biomass into the soil via the subsequent planting of melons into that residue, and ii) no tillage, with the maintenance of the biomass on the soil surface with subsequent planting of melons. Agronomic performance was evaluated by statistical analysis of productivity, while environmental performance was evaluated by analyzing the carbon footprint, according to ISO 14067. Agronomic analysis showed that rotation of melons with maize and Brachiaria resulted in a higher yield of melons for export. Assessment of the carbon footprint of this system in relation to the conventional system showed that the rotation system presented a lower carbon footprint. A scenario analysis showed that the carbon footprint can be further reduced by 42.54%, if: I) production takes place in areas already cultivated for more than 20 years, ii) the amount of inorganic nitrogen applied is reduced by 50%, and iii) commercialization of melons begins in the United States.

However, the majority of previous efforts to characterize potential coastal impacts of climate change have focused primarily on long-term SLR with a static tide level, and have not comprehensively accounted for dynamic physical drivers such as tidal non-linearity, storms, short-term climate variability, erosion response and consequent flooding responses. Here we present a dynamic modeling approach that estimates climate-driven changes in flood-hazard exposure by integrating the effects of SLR, tides, waves, storms, and coastal change (i.e. beach erosion and cliff retreat). We show that for California, USA, the world’s 5 th largest economy, over $150 billion of property equating to more than 6% of the state’s GDP and 600,000 people could be impacted by dynamic flooding by 2100; a three-fold increase in exposed population than if only SLR and a static coastline are considered. The potential for underestimating societal exposure to coastal flooding is greater for smaller SLR scenarios, up to a seven-fold increase in exposed population and economic interests when considering storm conditions in addition to SLR. These results highlight the importance of including climate-change driven dynamic coastal processes and impacts in both short-term hazard mitigation and long-term adaptation planning. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; California; climate change; economic aspect; flooding; human; sea level rise; seashore",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062831671

Such large-scale expansion is leading to higher energy consumption and carbon footprint for the telecommunication industry. Governments are trying to minimize the environmental impact by introducing regulations and taxes; driving companies to use renewable energy. However, renewable energy is still not as cost-effective compared to traditional sources of energy (i.e., brown energy), and their availability varies significantly across time and geographic locations. Therefore, it is a challenge for telecommunication companies to comply with regulations and minimize carbon footprint without significantly increasing their operational cost. In this context, we propose an Energy Smart Service Function Chain Orchestrator called ESSO. ESSO reduces the overall carbon footprint of a telecommunication network by opportunistically adapting Service Function Chain (SFC) locations to utilize more energy at locations with surplus renewable energy. ESSO minimizes brown energy consumption by migrating SFCs across different locations. In addition, ESSO provisions SFC components in a manner that allows switches, switch ports, and servers to be put into low-power consumption state. Our trace-driven simulations on real ISP topologies show that considering the availability of renewable energy sources during SFC embedding even for a small-scale network can result in 2-3 × reduction in carbon footprint. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Energy-aware management; mathematical optimization; network function virtualization; orchestration; service function chaining","Carbon footprint; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Functions; Green computing; Internet of things; Location; Optimization; Power management; Renewable energy resources; Social sciences computing; Telecommunication industry; Energy aware; Internet of thing (IOT); Mathematical optimizations; orchestration; Renewable energy source; Service functions; Telecommunication companies; Trace driven simulation; Network function virtualization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076715168

The study was conducted in the State of Amazonas, which is inserted in the northern region of Brazil. The main types of vegetation are Igapó Forest, Várzea Forest and Terra Firme Forest. Kernel density was used to spatialize fire foci to quantify them in seven classes of land use and cover (forest, pasture, exposed soil, urban area, pastoral agroforestry system, agroforestry system and agriculture). Through the regression analysis, the relation among the number of fire foci and four meteorological variables was obtained: rainfall, evapotranspiration, relative humidity and average air temperature. Forest and pasture classes were those with the highest number of fire foci corresponding, respectively, to 58 and 37% of the total number of foci. This can be explained by the greater representativeness of these classes in the State and by the high degree of soil exposure in the case of pasture. The number of fire foci was higher in the dry season, covering approximately 85% of the total fire foci. The variable that had the greatest influence on the occurrence of fire foci in the dry season was evapotranspiration. The study puts on alert the vulnerability of the State of Amazonas to the occurrence of fires and may also suggest actions to mitigate carbon emissions and biomass stock. Research like this one may provide subsidies to region’s managers in an attempt to preserve forest areas and a greater controlling in priority areas considered very high. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Amazonas; Climate change; Fire foci; Kernel density; Land cover; Multiple linear regressions","agroforestry; climate change; drought; dry season; land cover; land use; multiple regression; relative humidity; spatiotemporal analysis; vulnerability; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046826179

Especially, public spaces intended for use by pedestrians and cyclists, such as parks, squares, residential and commercial streets, and foot and cycle paths will be used and enjoyed more frequently if they have a comfortable and healthy climate. Due to the predicted global temperature increase, urban climate is likely to become more uncomfortable, especially in summer when an increase in heat stress is expected. Urban forestry has been proposed as one approach for mitigating the human health consequences of increased temperature resulting from climate change. The aims of the current research were to (a) provide a transferable methodology useful for analyzing the effect of urban trees on surface temperature reduction, particularly in public spaces, and (b) provide high-resolution urban mapping for adaptation strategies to climate change based on green space projects. To achieve the established aims, we developed a methodology that uses multisource data: LiDAR data, high-resolution Landsat imagery, global climate model data from CMIP5 (IPPC Fifth Assessment), and data from meteorological stations. The proposed model can be a useful tool for validating the efficiency of design simulations of new green spaces for temperature mitigation. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Currently, EVs' users may suffer from distress due to long charging service times and overloaded charging stations (CSs). Critical traffic conditions (e.g., traffic jams) affect EVs' trip time (TT) towards CSs and thus influence the total trip duration. With this concern, Intelligent transport systems (ITS) and more specifically connected vehicle technologies, can leverage an efficient real-time EV charging service by jointly considering CSs status and traffic conditions in the city. In this work, we propose a scheme to manage EVs' charging planning, focusing on the selection of a CS for the energy-requiring EV. The proposed scheme considers anticipated charging slots reservations performed through a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), which has been regarded as a cost-efficient communication framework. In specific, we consider two aspects: 1) the EV's total trip time towards its destination considering an intermediate charging at each candidate CS, and 2) the communication delay of the VANET routing protocol. First, in order to estimate the EV's total trip time, our CS selection scheme takes into account the average road speed, traffic lights, and route distance, along the path of the EV. The optimal CS that produces the minimum total charging service time (including the TT) is suggested to that energy-requiring EV. Then, we introduce two communication modes based on geographical routing protocols for VANETs to attain an anticipated charging slot reservation. Simulation results show that with our charging scheme EVs' charging service time is reduced and more EVs are successfully charged. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Applications; Electric vehicles (EVs); Intelligent transportation systems; Smart charging service; VANET; Vehicle-to-vehicle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072708268

But they are not well understood in double cropping systems. Here, continuous flux data were collected from two rotation croplands in Yucheng (YC) and in Luancheng (LC) to describe the among-year variations in α, Amax, and Rd, and to investigate variation mechanism on an annual scale. The three parameters exhibited marked fluctuations during the observation years. The annual α, Amax, and Rd ranged from 0.0022–0.0059 mg CO2 μmol photon−1, from 2.33–4.43 mg CO2 m−2 s−1, and from 0.19–0.47 mg CO2 m−2 s−1 at YC, and from 0.0016–0.0021 mg CO2 μmol photon−1, from 3.00–6.30 mg CO2 m−2 s−1, and from 0.06–0.19 mg CO2 m−2 s−1 at LC, respectively. Annual α and Rd declined significantly when vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exceeded 1.05 kPa and increased significantly when canopy conductance (gc) exceed 6.33 mm/s at YC, but changed slightly when VPD and gc exceeded 1.16 kPa and 7.77 mm/s at LC, respectively. The fact that the negative effects of VPD and gc on α and Rd at LC were not as significant as they were at YC may be attributed to different climate conditions and planting species. A negative relationship (R2 = 0.90 for YC and 0.89 for LC) existed between VPD and gc. Therefore, the VPD, through its negative effect on gc, inhibited α and Rd indirectly. Among-year Amax variation was mainly influenced by the annual mean surface soil temperature (Ts) of non-growing season of wheat significantly (R2 = 0.59, P &lt; 0.01). Therefore, in future climate change scenarios, these environmental effects need to be included in carbon cycle models so that the accuracy of the carbon budget estimation can be improved. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076312349

Exogenous melatonin stimulated the physiological growth of the stressed seedlings by triggering high accumulation of gibberellic acid (GA) and melatonin via up regulation of the biosynthetic genes like GA3ox, TDC, SNAT and ASMT. The endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) content increased via induction of NCED3 and suppression of ABA8ox1. However, the ABA-dependent genes like TRAB1, WRKY71 and OSBZ8 were down regulated in presence of high endogenous GA and melatonin. High melatonin level led to low indole-3-acetic acid accumulation in the treated seedlings during fluoride stress. Melatonin significantly decreased fluoride bioaccumulation by suppressing its uptake via CLC1 and CLC2, and also restored P–H+/ATPase expression. The damage indices like chlorosis (accompanied by low RuBisCo), malondialdehyde, electrolyte leakage, methylglyoxal (detoxified by glyoxalase II) and protein carbonylation were greatly reduced. Increased proline synthesis, activation of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle and enhanced activity of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and guaiacol peroxidase led to low ROS accumulation and localization in the melatonin-treated plants exposed to stress. Overall, melatonin treatment alleviated fluoride-mediated injuries by restricting fluoride uptake, refining the defence machinery and altering the phytohormone homeostasis. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Antioxidants; Damage; Fluoride bioaccumulation; Melatonin; Phytohormones; Rice","abscisic acid; antioxidant; fluoride; gibberellin; indoleacetic acid derivative; melatonin; drug effect; homeostasis; metabolism; Oryza; oxidative stress; seedling; Abscisic Acid; Antioxidants; Fluorides; Gibberellins; Homeostasis; Indoleacetic Acids; Melatonin; Oryza; Oxidative Stress; Seedlings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074293965

The choice of modeling approach depends on the type of questions being asked. In this paper we discuss a series of approaches with a hierarchical complexity including vertically-integrated single-phase flow approaches, vertically-integrated multi-phase flow approaches (with and without vertical equilibrium assumption), three-dimensional multi-phase flow approaches, and fully-coupled multi-phase flow approaches that couple flow with geochemistry and/or geomechanics. Three spatial scales are used to categorize the questions to be addressed by modeling: regional scale (encompasses CO2 plume extent and majority of area of pressure impact of one or more injection operations), site scale (includes the CO2 plume extent and some of the area impacted by the pressure increase of a single injection site), and well scale (the immediate vicinity of an injection well). A set of guidelines is developed to help modelers choose the most appropriate modeling approach, and show when simpler modeling approaches may be the better choice. Vertically-integrated single-phase flow models are the most appropriate choice at both the site and regional scales, if the pressure impact outside of the CO2 plume is of interest. Vertically-integrated multi-phase flow models should be chosen at the regional scale, if the locations of CO2 plumes are of interest, and at the site scale if vertical segregation of CO2 and brine is fast or vertical heterogeneity in properties can be presented by distinct, continuous layers. Three-dimensional multi-phase flow models are the appropriate choice at the well and site scales for cases with significant vertical flow components of CO2 and brine. Fully-coupled multi-phase flow models should only be chosen if pore-space alteration through geochemistry or geomechanics feeds back to fluid flow. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decision criteria; Geologic carbon storage modeling; Model choice; Model complexity","Carbon dioxide; Flow control; Geochemistry; Geomechanics; Infiltration; Injection (oil wells); Multiphase flow; Decision criterions; Geologic carbon storages; Integrated modeling approaches; Model choice; Model complexity; Multi-phase flow models; Vertical equilibriums; Vertical segregation; Geologic models; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; decision analysis; flow modeling; multiphase flow; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072047533

To this end, quarterly frequency data from 1990Q1 to 2017Q4. Structural break point unit root test like Zivot and Andrews is employed and complemented with traditional non-stationarity tests such as Augmented Dickey Fuller and Phillips and Perron unit tests to investigate the interest variables stationarity characteristics. Recently developed Bayer and Hanck (2013) combined cointegration test is used alongside the Pesaran et al. (2001) bounds testing cointegration to test for long-run relationship among the variables. Finally, we test for causal relationships through Modified Wald test of Tada-Yamamoto (1995) Granger causality tests is employed. Empirical findings show cointegration relationship between the variables while accounting for structural break. Further piece of empirical results suggest that natural gas consumption exerts a significant positive impact on economic output in Iran, and also that there is a one-way causality from natural gas consumption to economic output. Thus, our study corroborates the natural gas-led growth hypothesis; being natural gas consumption a suitable alternative, as a complementary green energy source (IGU, 2015). One important conclusion reached in our study is that there is need for energy portfolio diversification in Iran in order to attain full gains from the energy sector, reducing other energies' emissions.

However, the spatial distribution of suitable habitat may shift over time in response to climate change. Taxa such as migratory forest landbirds are already undergoing climate-driven range shifts. Therefore, patches of climate-resilient habitat (also known as ""climate refugia"") are especially valuable from a conservation perspective. Here, we performed maximum entropy (Maxent) species distribution modeling to predict suitable and potentially climate-resilient habitat in Nova Scotia, Canada, for 3 migratory forest landbirds: Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), and Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis). We used a reverse stepwise elimination technique to identify covariates that influence habitat suitability for the target species at broad scales, including abiotic (topographic control of moisture and nutrient accumulation) and biotic (forest characteristics) covariates. As topography should be relatively unaffected by a changing climate and helps regulate the structure and composition of forest habitat, we posit that the inclusion of appropriate topographic features may support the identification of climate-resilient habitat. Of all covariates, depth to water table was the most important predictor of relative habitat suitability for the Rusty Blackbird and Canada Warbler, with both species showing a strong association with wet areas. Mean canopy height was the most important predictor for the Olive-sided Flycatcher, whereby the species was associated with taller trees. Our models, which comprise the finest-scale species distribution models available for these species in this region, further indicated that, for all species, habitat (1) remains relatively abundant and well distributed in Nova Scotia and (2) is often located in wet lowlands (a climate-resilient topographic landform). These findings suggest that opportunities remain to conserve breeding habitat for these species despite changing temperature and precipitation regimes.

For this reason, accurate long-term monitoring of mangrove ecosystems is vital. However, these ecosystems are extremely dynamic and data frequency is often reduced by cloud cover. The Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) method has the potential to overcome this by utilising every available observation on a per-pixel basis to build stable season-trend models of the underlying phenology. These models can then be used for land cover classification and to determine greening and browning trends. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, CCDC was applied to a 30-year time series of Landsat data covering an area of mangrove forest known as the Sundarbans. Spanning the delta formed by the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna river systems, the Sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world. CCDC achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.5% with a 99% confidence of being between 94.2% and 94.8%. Results showed that while mangrove extent in the Sundarbans has remained stable, around 25% of the area experienced an overall negative trend, probably due to the effect of die-back on Heritiera fomes. In addition, dates and magnitudes of change derived from CCDC were used to investigate damage and recovery from a major cyclone; 11% of the Sundarbans was found to have been affected by Cyclone Sidr in 2007, 47.6% of which had not recovered by mid-2018. The results indicate that while the Sundarbans forest is resilient to cyclone events, the long-term degrading effects of climate change could reduce this resilience to critical levels. The proposed methodology, while computationally expensive, also offers means by which the full Landsat archive can be analyzed and interpreted and should be considered for global application to mangrove monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","CCDC; Change detection; Landsat; Mangroves; Open Data Cube; Sundarbans","Ecosystems; Forestry; Open Data; Sea level; Storms; CCDC; Change detection; LANDSAT; Mangroves; Sundarbans; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076567719

The taxonomical and functional diversity of such soils can be a great source of information about microbial community and genes involved in petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) degradation. In this study, microbial diversity of soils contaminated by RP from urban biome of Pune, India, and CP from agricultural biome of Gujarat, India, were assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on Illumina MiSeq platform. Association between the soil microbial community and the physicochemical parameters were investigated for their potential role. In RP- and CP-contaminated soils, the microbiome analysis showed Proteobacteria as most dominant phylum followed by Actinobacteria. Interestingly, Firmicutes were most prevailing in a CP-contaminated sample while they were least prevailing in RP-contaminated soils. Soil moisture content, total organic carbon and organic nitrogen content influenced the taxa diversity in these soils. Species richness was more in RP as compared to CP soils. Further prediction of metagenome using PICRUSt revealed that the RP and CP soils contain microbial communities with excellent metabolic potential for PHC degradation. Microbial community contributing to genes essential for soil health improvement and plant growth promotion was also gauged.

Catalyst and nutrient supplementation are the option to improve biogas both in quantity and quality by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) back to methane (CH4). Using CSTRs, this study attempted to enhance bio-methane from cassava pulp and its wastewater by readily available reducing agent, Zero Valent Iron, Fe0 (ZVI). M100 iron in micromillimeter size particle was verified and characterized by synchrotron lights (XPS) whether it is in state of valency 0 for optimum reactional kinetic. Introduced ZVI in 0-0.25-0.5-1-2 g/L dosage, it was discovered that 1 g/L ZVI microparticle concentration resulted maximized SCOD removal (up to 95%) generating biogas for 900 ml/day/OLR with highest methane content (85%). Although the presence of ZVI is stimulatory, inhibition started when iron concentration exceeds 1 g/L ending digestion failure by iron toxicity after 5 days along comparative study for 30 days HRT. Meanwhile, the performance of CSTRs in remaining doses functioned stably among which ZVI microparticle in 1 g/L supplemented CSTR processed in ideal bio-methanation.

An algorithm is trained and validated using radar-derived spatial and intensity information from thousands of manually labeled QLCS and non-QLCS event slices. The algorithm is then used to automate the identification and tracking of over 3000 QLCSs with high accuracy, affording the first, systematic, long-term climatology of QLCSs. Convective regions determined by the procedure to be QLCSs are used as foci for spatiotemporal filtering of observed severe thunderstorm reports; this permits an estimation of the number of severe storm hazards due to this morphology. Results reveal that nearly 32% of MCSs are classified as QLCSs. On average, 139 QLCSs occur annually, with most of these events clustered from April through August in the eastern Great Plains and central/lower Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. QLCSs are responsible for a spatiotemporally variable proportion of severe hazard reports, with a maximum in QLCS-report attribution (30%–42%) in the western Ohio and central Mississippi River Valleys. Over 21% of tornadoes, 28% of severe winds, and 10% of severe hail reports are due to QLCSs across the central and eastern United States. The proportion of QLCS-affiliated tornado and severe wind reports maximize during the overnight and cool season, with more than 50% of tornadoes and wind reports in some locations due to QLCSs. This research illustrates the utility of automated storm-mode classification systems in generating extensive, systematic climatologies of phenomena, reducing the need for time-consuming and spatiotemporal-limiting methods where investigators manually assign morphological classifications. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climatology; Hazards; Image segmentation; Precipitation (meteorology); Radar; Storms; Tornadoes; Intensity information; Machine learning methods; Mode classification; Morphological classifications; Ohio River Valley; Quasi-linear convective systems; Radar reflectivities; Spatio temporal filtering; Learning systems; accuracy assessment; climatology; convective system; hazard assessment; image classification; machine learning; meteorological hazard; thunderstorm; tornado; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075159688

Although the same principles to cope with these limitations could be in theory applied to all dryland situations, there is no a universal recipe for sustainable dryland agriculture. In this chapter, the authors recall some of the challenges that have been identified for semiarid rainfed farming systems, namely soil conservation, water use efficiency, nutrient use efficiency and climate change mitigation, as well as some sustainable cropping and management strategies that have been formulated and recommended to address them appropriately. To this end, the authors provide examples supporting those practices mainly from semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems. Among all the strategies discussed in this Chapter, and despite their limitations, the maintenance of a protective crop residue cover and the reduction of tillage operations appear to be the simplest technological options not only to control soil erosion but also to improve water and nutrient use efficiency and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The authors conclude that sustainable agricultural management in drylands should be primarily based on conservation agriculture practices and associated local-based crop residue management systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conservation tillage; Crop residue management; Dryland farming; Greenhouse gas emission; Mediterranean agroecosystems; Nutrient use efficiency; Semiarid lands; Water use efficiency; Wind erosion",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086298355

We investigate the potential of energy storage technologies to reduce renewable curtailment and CO2 emissions in California and Texas under varying emissions taxes. We show that without energy storage, adding 60 GW of renewables to California achieves 72% CO2 reductions (relative to a zero-renewables case) with close to one third of renewables being curtailed. Some energy storage technologies, on the other hand, allow 90% CO2 reductions from the same renewable penetrations with as little as 9% renewable curtailment. In Texas, the same renewable-deployment level leads to 54% emissions reductions with close to 3% renewable curtailment. Energy storage can allow 57% emissions reductions with as little as 0.3% renewable curtailment.

There were several floods events recorded in Chennai, a one of the major metropolitan coastal city in India. The flood incidences were repeatedly reported in recent decades. In this study, the existing state of storm water drains are evaluated under current and future climate scenarios in one of the most flood-prone areas of Chennai viz. Velachery zone. The mitigation measures are recommended to increase its resilience against floods. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) CMIP5 models of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 are used to develop possible future climate change scenarios of the city. The daily rainfall data for the period 1975–2015 obtained from India Meteorological Department are used to find the extremities and to generate Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. The IDF curves are generated for 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 year return period under current and future climate scenarios. The storm drainage network are delineated with Differential Geographic Positioning System (DGPS) survey. The integrated hydraulic and hydrological modelling is carried out to assess the flood carrying capacity of storm drainage under present and future climate scenarios.

The results show that shifts of political authority, notably changes towards majority decision making at the international level and automatic implementation of international decisions domestically, do not, on average, significantly affect citizens’ legitimacy perceptions of global governance institutions. Interestingly, the absence of the presumed negative effect is not due to citizens’ incapacity to understand the implications of increasing international authority in the sense that increasing international authority results in a loss of control over climate policy in Germany and the United States. Rather, legitimacy perceptions appear to be shaped by citizens’ perceptions of procedural and performance quality of such efforts in more general terms, and not by authority levels per se. Overall, these findings suggest that there could be more room for increasing the authority of global governance institutions, provided this can be done in ways that ascertain high procedural and output performance quality. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Authority; Climate governance; International organizations; Legitimacy; Public opinion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058481501

Holistic modeling of DH networks represents one of the most promising tools in this regard, since it is aimed at both identifying the size of new plants and optimizing existing ones, with a significant reduction in the time, costs and complexity of real-field tests. The aim of this work is to present the application of two innovative modeling procedures to a real case, i.e. a branch of the Parma University Campus network with a length of about 2?km, 12 connected buildings and an overall heating requirement of 11.2 MW. The first procedure is based on a dedicated library of energy system components developed by the authors in the Matlab®/Simulink® environment, which can be used to assemble models of systems and grids following different configurations. Power generation, conversion and distribution systems together with buildings and generic users can be simulated, considering the thermal and pressure losses of the heat transfer fluid. Typical disturbances can be considered, e.g. solar irradiance, environmental temperature variations and metabolic heat gain from people. Furthermore, a realistic control strategy has been applied to valve opening and boiler operation, in order to fulfil the heat demand profile of buildings in terms of indoor temperatures. Results show that the simulation tool provides a detailed representation of the real system behavior and allows for a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the main thermodynamic parameters of the heat transfer fluid. The second procedure is based on a tool able to simulate a complex energy distribution network considering the contemporary flows of electrical, thermal and cooling energy. This approach allows both the energy distribution and its generation to be optimized by adopting an optimization procedure based on a genetic algorithm that allows for the load allocation of all the generation systems minimizing the costs of energy production and the associated environmental impact. The results of this second approach, applied to the case study of the Parma University Campus network, show a decrease in electricity consumption for pumping coupled with a reduction in CO2 emissions. The two approaches allow a complete description of a complex smart grid by considering all its aspects from the optimal load distribution of the energy systems up to the implementation of control strategies for the management of the room temperatures at the final users. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077860735

New generations of district heating had introduced the concept of smart thermal grids, consisting in the bidirectional thermal energy exchange between network and final users and aiming at replicating the concept of electric smart grid in the heat sector. With this purpose, the integration between district heating networks and distributed generation systems becomes essential and the optimization of the utility substations is a key point. This study aims at the elaboration of possible solutions for the conversion of an existing utility substation in order to enable a bidirectional thermal energy exchange. Two different configurations will be proposed and analyzed, considering different distributed generation systems to be installed at the final user. The operation model of these cases will be defined with the purpose of optimizing the thermal exchange. Furthermore, the actions required for the conversion of the existing utility substation will be evaluated through a technical analysis, in order to define the novel substation potentialities.

Unlike the AE signals from fixed gear reducer that are steady and have unchanged route, the AE signals from RV reducer have variant propagation paths and strengths. This work investigates the kinematics model using AE techniques to solve the inherent issues of RV reducer performance degradation analysis, such as signal variabilities and inappropriate thresholds. Firstly, the propagation path of AE signals within the crankshaft is developed. Secondly, the attenuation trend of AE signals is exponentially formulated based on the corresponding propagation curve. The proposed method has been evaluated on the developed RV reducer platform. AE signals were collected under various working conditions, i.e., four abrasion states with eight types of loads and five rotation speeds. The experimental analysis on typical parameters (e.g., signal energies) proves the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed method based on AE techniques. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Biomimetics; Crankshafts; Robotics; Acoustic emission techniques; Experimental analysis; Kinematics modeling; Performance degradation; Propagation paths; Rotation speed; Signal energy; Signal variability; Acoustic emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079030091

Proof of this is that air pollution is one of the first environmental concerns of the French population. The purpose of this study was to establish a system for monitoring the actual concentrations of different atmospheric pollutants observed in major French cities. Method: For 13 major cities in Metropolitan France we collected data from the measurement stations of Air Quality Monitoring agencies for various pollutants: NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5. Using these data, we have produced monthly time series of these pollutants covering the period 2008–2015. We also calculated the slopes of these time series as well as the correlation coefficients. Results: The results do not show trends that are decreasing but rather stagnating, for the air pollutants considered. Our work therefore indicates that monitoring and taking steps to reduce air pollution must be increased. © 2019 SPLF","Air pollution; Air quality monitoring; Evolution; Metropolitan France; Urban","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air pollution; Article; environmental monitoring; evolution; France; particulate matter; pollutant; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental exposure; epidemiology; history; human; procedures; public health; time factor; urban population; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; France; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Public Health; Time Factors; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074537753

Mortality rates due to COPD have increased by an estimated 30% between 1980 and 2014, with significant variances among geographic regions. Both acute and chronic ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone have been associated with exacerbations of respiratory diseases in numerous studies, and exposure to air pollutants are considered as the largest health risk factor globally.

The implementation of an MG may offer many benefits, such as capital investments deferral, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in reliability, and reduction in network losses. Future energy networks will contain various forms of energy which are acquired by mixing several sources and energy storages in the concept called multicarrier microgrid (MCMG). In order to draw the most effective performance from MCMG systems, appropriate design and operation are essential. This paper represents a compound co-optimization strategy to find the best type and size of components and the associated optimum dispatch in a grid-tied community MCMG implementing reliability criteria. Here, the required level of reliability is handled within the optimization process to fulfill multiple demands. The mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) technique of general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) and the genetic algorithm of MATLAB software are utilized to solve the co-optimization problem. Additionally, a contemporary time-based demand response program is modeled to reshape the load curve, as well as prevent the undue use of energy in peak hours. Eventually, the proposed strategy is applied to a test case to select the best components while respecting reliability restrictions.

In this study, we conducted a workshop in Selayar Archipelago, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, an area with extensive seagrass meadows. The workshop focussed on seagrass meadows in the context of coastal community livelihood-related activities. The 50 workshop participants came from a variety of backgrounds, mostly related to the marine and fisheries sector (e.g. fishermen, vocational high school students, conservation agency staff, district government fisheries officers, and fisheries extension staff). The workshop revealed that many marine and fisheries stakeholders have a high level of awareness regarding seagrasses and the basic ecosystem services they provide. Some key points were identified from the workshop: 1) seagrasses were recognised as a resource; 2) the most and least frequently mentioned ecosystem service types mentioned were ""provisioning"" and ""cultural"", respectively; 3) threats to seagrass meadows were identified and practical recommendations to minimize the threats were formulated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fisheries; Plants (botany); Coastal communities; District government; Ecosystem services; High school students; Marine environment; Practical recommendation; Seagrass meadows; Workshop participants; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077492640

Most exotic tree plantations support lower levels of biodiversity and have less potential for ecosystem services supply than natural forests, and differencing them is still a challenge using standard tools. We use a novel approach in south-central of Chile to differentiate tree cover dynamics among natural forests and exotic tree plantations. Chile has one of the world's most competitive forestry industry and the region is a global biodiversity hotspot. Our collaborative visual interpretation method combined a global database of tree cover change, remote sensing from high-resolution satellite images and expert knowledge. By distinguishing exotic tree plantation and natural forest loss, we fit spatially explicit models to estimate tree-cover loss across 40 millions of ha between 2000 and 2016. We were able to distinguish natural forests from exotic tree plantations with an overall accuracy of 99% and predicted forest loss. Total tree cover loss was continuous over time, and the disaggregation revealed that 1 549 909 ha of tree plantations were lost (mean = 96 869 ha year-1), while 206 142 ha corresponded to natural forest loss (mean = 12 884 ha year-1). Mostly of tree plantations lost returned to be plantation (51%). Natural forests were converted mainly (75%) to transitional land covers (e.g. shrubland, bare land, grassland), and an important proportion of these may finish as tree plantation. This replacement may undermine objectives of increasedcarbon storage and biodiversity. Tree planting as a solution has gained increased attention in recen years with ambitious commitments to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, negative outcomes for the environment could result if strategies incentivize the replacement of natural forests into other land covers. Initiatives to reduce carbon emissions should encourage differentiating natural forests from exotic tree plantations and pay more attention on protecting and managing sustainably the former. © 2020 The Author(s).

Given the challenge in targeting MYCN directly for therapy, we sought to identify MYCN-dependent metabolic vulnerabilities that can be targeted therapeutically. Here, we report that the gene encoding glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in glycine breakdown with the production of the one-carbon unit 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN. As a result, GLDC expression is markedly elevated in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines. This transcriptional upregulation of GLDC expression is of functional significance, as GLDC depletion by RNA interference inhibits the proliferation and tumorigenicity of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines by inducing G1 arrest. Metabolomic profiling reveals that GLDC knockdown disrupts purine and central carbon metabolism and reduces citrate production, leading to a decrease in the steady-state levels of cholesterol and fatty acids. Moreover, blocking purine or cholesterol synthesis recapitulates the growth-inhibitory effect of GLDC knockdown. These findings reveal a critical role of GLDC in sustaining the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells with high-level GLDC expression and suggest that MYCN amplification is a biomarker for GLDC-based therapeutic strategies against high-risk neuroblastoma. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating); 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate; glycine; glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating); MYCN protein, human; N Myc proto oncogene protein; purine; purine derivative; tetrahydrofolic acid derivative; tumor marker; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal model; Article; binding site; carbon metabolism; carboxylation; carcinogenicity; cell cycle arrest; cell proliferation; cholesterol synthesis; chromosome condensation; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cytokine production; DNA replication; enzyme activation; enzyme degradation; female; gene amplification; gene disruption; gene expression profiling; glycolysis; human; human cell; immunoblotting; lipogenesis; male; metabolomics; morphogenesis; mouse; MYCN gene; neuroblastoma; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; protein analysis; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein function; RNA interference; transcription regulation; tumor xenograft; upregulation; animal; apoptosis; carcinogenesis; cell cycle checkpoint; cell proliferation; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; neuroblastoma; pathology; tumor cell line; xenograft; Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinogenesis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycine; Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating); Heterografts; Humans; Metabolomics; Mice; N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein; Neuroblastoma; Purines; Tetrahydrofolates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071047666

While this was an important step for the global community, much work remains to be done. Based on climate change and technology scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency in the wake of the agreement, the World Bank has developed a set of projections about the amount and kind of feedstock materials that will be required to achieve these targets in the years ahead. So-called “technology minerals”—including metals like lithium and cobalt that are commonly found in rechargeable batteries, or tellurium that is used to make solar cells—figure prominently. An important aspect of the Paris Agreement is the need for the world economy to shift away from fossil fuels towards green energy networks based on stored electricity and renewable energy sources. But achieving the agreement's ambitious goals will necessarily require dramatic increases in global production rates for technology minerals that are far beyond current levels. Despite the urgent need for these feedstock materials, however, the mineral supply sector is not on track to satisfy anywhere near this demand. To put the industry and its supporting institutions on a path more likely to deliver these vital materials, this paper recommends a more integrated, global, system-wide approach to managing the organizations behind technology minerals: the Smart Mineral Enterprise Development (SMED) framework. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Mining; Public-private partnerships; Smart; Technology minerals",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071968456

The California’s cap-and-trade program (California’s carbon market hereafter) allows forestland owners from any part of the contiguous United States to supply carbon credits to compliance entities. In this study, we estimate South Carolina (SC) private forestland owners’ willingness to accept compensations to participate in the California’s carbon market using a contingent valuation method. Results: We estimate forestland owners’ mean willingness to accept as $67 per acre per year. Our results reveal higher probability of participation of forestland owners with interests in preserving forest ecosystems than those who do not. Additionally, forestland owners who trust in information about climate change from scientists or government are willing to participate more than those who do not. Conclusions: Various factors hinder landowners’ ability to participate in carbon markets. Forestland owners in SC consider legislative uncertainty and long-time commitment as the main barriers to participation in California’s carbon market. From this research, average forestland tenure in SC is 27 years, which is far less than the 100-year time commitment of the California’s carbon market. Of those who agreed to participate, choosing between adopting and not adopting any of the three main forest management practices in the California’s carbon market: 28% are likely to adopt improved forest management (IFM) practices, 24% are likely to adopt reforestation due to understocked forestlands, and 14% are likely to adopt avoided conversion. In another development, the concept of aggregation has dominated discussions in the California’s carbon market of late. It is an advocacy to include small-scale forestlands in the California’s carbon market. To aggregate, different forestland owners will combine their forestlands to participate. We find that 79% of SC forestland owners are willing to aggregate to participate. However, this research is unable to determine how much total forestland is available in SC for carbon market. We recommend future research in the State on forestland owners’ participation in carbon market should consider evaluating forestland availability. © The Author(s). 2019.","Carbon markets; Forestland owners; Willingness to accept",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066329540

Carbon emissions of the aviation sector are expected to increase by 3–4% each year due to the rising demand for air travel. The use of bio-jet fuel derived from carinata (Brassica carinata) is a potential solution for mitigating carbon emissions from the aviation sector. This study determines suitable sites for growing carinata across three southeastern states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Suitable edaphic (average soil storage, soil organic carbon, root zone depth) and climatic variables (temperature) along with historical land use trajectories were used for determining the land suitability for carinata production. The weights of the edaphic variables were decided by surveying experts using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. This study also determined the susceptibility of frost events in growing season of carinata from 2010 to 2017. Finally, the composite risk was calculated by multiplying the probability of potential damage risk and probability of land risk. Considering minimum risk level of 5%, about 45.56% (0.77 million ha) of land in Georgia, 0.81% (0.01 million ha) land in Alabama and about 3.04% (0.05 million ha) of land in Florida is suitable for growing carinata. Depending upon the composite risk level and expected carinata yields, the total production potential of carinata was between 1.87 and 3.91 million metric tons which was sufficient for producing between 980 and 2045 million liters of bio-jet fuel sufficient enough to replace 1.4%–2.33% of the current jet fuel consumption in the United States.

Further, ride-sharing allows sharing costs and, hence, reduces the congestion and emission by making better use of vehicle capacities. In this paper, we develop a distributed model-free, DeepPool, that uses deep Q-network (DQN) techniques to learn optimal dispatch policies by interacting with the environment. Further, DeepPool efficiently incorporates travel demand statistics and deep learning models to manage dispatching vehicles for improved ride sharing services. Using real-world dataset of taxi trip records in New York, DeepPool performs better than other strategies, proposed in the literature, that do not consider ride sharing or do not dispatch the vehicles to regions where the future demand is anticipated. Finally, DeepPool can adapt rapidly to dynamic environments since it is implemented in a distributed manner in which each vehicle solves its own DQN individually without coordination. © 2019 IEEE.","deep Q-network (DQN); distributed algorithm; Ride-sharing; road network; vehicle dispatch","Electric load dispatching; Machine learning; Motor transportation; Parallel algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Taxicabs; Traffic congestion; deep Q-network (DQN); Distributed modeling; Dynamic environments; Operating companies; Ride-sharing; Road network; Vehicle capacity; Vehicle dispatch; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077199616

We measured seven leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content, leaf thickness, force to punch, stomatal density, and potential conductance index) in the 163 most abundant epiphyte species recorded across 10 sites located along an elevational gradient between 60 and 2,900 m above sea level in the Colombian Andes. We grouped the epiphyte species into seven hierarchical functional groups according to their most characteristic leaf traits. Along the elevational gradient, the two main independent leaf trait dimensions that distinguished community assemblages were defined primarily by leaf area-photosynthetic (LAPS) and mass-carbon (LMCS) gradients. Mean annual temperature was the main determinant of species position along LAPS. In contrast, local changes in specific leaf area due to variation in the epiphytes’ relative height of attachment was the main determinant of their position along the LMCS. Our findings indicate that epiphytic plant leaves have evolved to optimize and enhance photosynthesis through a leaf area–based strategy and carbon acquisition through investments in construction costs of leaf area per unit of biomass that aim to regulate light capture and tissue development. Given that most studies of plant functional traits neglect vascular epiphytes, our quantification of the multiple dimensions of epiphyte leaf traits greatly augments our understanding of vascular plant function and adaptation to changing environments. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","functional groups; leaf economic traits; leaf spectrum; specific leaf area; stomatal conductance; tropical Andean forests; vascular epiphytes","assembly rule; community composition; epiphyte; functional group; leaf; leaf area; spectrum; stomatal conductance; tropical forest; vascular plant; Andes; Colombia; Tracheophyta; climate; Colombia; photosynthesis; plant; plant leaf; tropic climate; Climate; Colombia; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071394869

In smart electrical system, need arises to deploy more non-conventional energy sources, which include Renewable Energy Sources (RES) as well as non-RES. Though, the RES are getting more encouragement due to several advantages over non-RES. In recent past, there is significant increase in the penetration of small units of local generation in existing distribution system. These small units (RES and non-RES), usually known as Distributed Generation (DG), may offer several technical, economic and environmental benefits like reduction in power loss, improvement in power quality, reliability, system security, reduction in capital cost investment at large level, reduction in emission of green-house gases and many more. However, these advantages are difficult to achieve due to some technical and non-technical barriers. To extract maximum potential benefits from the DG, the optimal planning of such sources in distribution network has always been a topic of great interest. Though, fresh researchers face many problems in carrying out research in this area due to lack of knowledge about suitable research software, standard test networks, types of renewable/non-renewable sources, appropriate literature, etc. This paper uses a systematic approach to discuss the DG and its technologies with advantages, disadvantages and effects on end users as well as on the utility. A comparative study of all optimization techniques for planning of DG in existing power system considering optimal size and location is also included. This paper also involves the details about some standard test systems along with details of useful software’s (licensed & open source) for DG planning.

However, there are several constraints to the sector’s development, including negative impacts of climate change. To mitigate these impacts, farmers implement a range of technical strategies. The extent of farmer’s awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts influences these strategies and hence farmers’ level of adaptation. This study was undertaken to assess farmers’ awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts in Aguie Department, Niger Republic. Descriptive statistics and a regression model were used for data analysis. The results from a descriptive analysis show that the majority of respondents (84.4%) were aware of climate risks, but had differing perceptions of climate change impacts on production and annual revenue. A regression test revealed that climate-related information is highly significant in determining farmers’ awareness of climate change impacts. Most of the respondents reported negative impacts from climate change, and the majority, therefore, adjusted their farming system, albeit at different levels. A probit analysis shows that awareness, perception, education, crop production, soil fertility and annual revenue are highly influential on farmers’ climate change impacts adaptation. This research highlights farmer awareness and perceptions as key factors in the climate change impacts adaptation debate. The findings reveal that effective adaptation to climate change impacts is highly dependent on the extent of community awareness and how farmers perceive the impacts of climate change. The study highlights that institutions targeting households’ livelihood improvement and making decisions concerning climate change adaptation need to focus on media outreach in local languages, improving locally adapted extension services, and developing water use efficiency measures such as improved irrigation for effective and long-term adaptation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Awareness; Climate change; Dryland; Impacts; Perceptions","climate change; climate effect; crop production; decision making; farmers attitude; perception; soil fertility; water use efficiency; Aguie; Maradi; Niger [West Africa]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047254601

Anaerobic digestion and the production of biogas can provide an efficient means of meeting several objectives concerning energy, environmental, and waste management policy. Biogas contains methane (60%) and carbon dioxide (40%) as its principal constituent. Excluding methane, other gasses contained in biogas are considered as contaminants. Removal of these impurities, especially carbon dioxide, will increase the biogas quality for further use. Integrating biological processes into the bio-refinery that effectively consume carbon dioxide will become increasingly important. Such process integration could significantly improve the sustainability of the overall bio-refinery process. The biogas upgrading by utilization of carbon dioxide rather than removal of it is a suitable strategy in this direction. The present work is a critical review that summarizes state-of-the-art technologies for biogas upgrading with particular attention to the emerging biological methanation processes. It also discusses the future perspectives for overcoming the challenges associated with upgradation. While biogas offers a good substitution for fossil fuels, it still not a perfect solution for global greenhouse gas emissions and further research still needs to be conducted. © 2019 by the authors.

Ultimately, photocatalytic processes utilize solar energy to convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels by deploying effective photocatalysts. Among the solar fuels produced from CO2 photoconversion, methanol is a versatile feedstock for producing numerous chemicals in the industry. The success of a photocatalytic conversion process hinges on the type of photocatalyst material. Although TiO2 is considered a very viable candidate due to its availability, non-toxicity, ease of synthesis and affordability, its large band gap and inability to absorb in the visible region has necessitated research into other materials. For several years researchers have reported different viable materials for this process leading to improvements in the catalytic activity. However, actualizing the conversion efficiency desired from the solar energy to produce fuels still requires modification of existing materials and discovery of new ones. The objective of this review is to provide an in-depth systematic information on different photocatalysts that have been used over the years and discuss factors that influence their effectiveness. Various modification methods for tuning the properties and improving the performance of photocatalysts are discussed. Composites or heterostructures synthesized through these modification methods are also evaluated.

To inform policies to mitigate carbon emissions, it is crucial to understand the factors that influence it. While there is a vast literature on the impact of economic growth on carbon emissions, empirical research on the impact of democracy and renewable energy on environmental quality in developing countries remains limited. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to examine the impact of democracy and renewable energy on carbon emissions for 46 sub-Saharan African countries using unbalanced data for the period of 1980–2015. Using an instrumental variable generalised-method of the moment, the study found that democracy and renewable energy reduce carbon emissions. Additionally, foreign direct investment, trade openness, population, and economic growth were the forces behind carbon emissions in sub-Saharan Africa. However, when democracy is accounted for, economic growth turns to reduce carbon emissions. No evidence of Environmental Kuznets curve was found. The results further indicated that the impact of urbanization on carbon emissions is indeterminate. These results are robust when alternative econometric estimation techniques were used. The study further demonstrated that the level of economic development matters when assessing the impact of these variables on carbon emissions. The study, therefore, recommends that democracy and investment in renewable energy should be given priority on Africa agenda to mitigate climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Carbon emission; Democracy; IV-GMM; Mitigation; Renewable energy","Carbon; Climate change; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Investments; Population statistics; Public policy; Urban growth; Africa; Carbon emissions; Democracy; IV-GMM; Mitigation; Renewable energies; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071720118

Although crucial for future climate change predictions, the mechanisms controlling boreal C and N pools are not well understood. Here, using a three-year field experiment, we compare SOM decomposition and stabilization in the presence of roots, with exclusion of roots but presence of fungal hyphae and with exclusion of both roots and fungal hyphae. Roots accelerate SOM decomposition compared to the root exclusion treatments, but also promote a different soil N economy with higher concentrations of organic soil N compared to inorganic soil N accompanied with the build-up of stable SOM-N. In contrast, root exclusion leads to an inorganic soil N economy (i.e., high level of inorganic N) with reduced stable SOM-N build-up.

Both greenhouse gases (GHGs), have a significant impact on the Earth's radiative balance. GHG effluxes of CH4 and CO2 were measured in a warm Mediterranean wetland in south of Spain. The dominant vegetation cover at the site was by common reed (Phragmites australis) and the measurements were done during short measurement campaign in early autumn 2015. Gas-flux measurements were carried out applying two methods, the eddy covariance (EC) technique and the chamber method (CM). These two methods representing different ecosystem subsets, with EC representing the plant/ecosystem subset and CM representing the water/soil subset. In our measurement campaigns using CM, CH4 emissions ranged from 7.2 to 17.7 mg CH4-C m−2 d−1 and CO2 emissions from 0.53 to 1.27 g CO2-C m−2 d−1. When using EC, the average fluxes of CH4 and CO2 were 31.4 mg CH4-C m−2 d−1 and 1.32 g CO2-C m−2 d−1, respectively. Relationships between gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4) measured by the EC method were quite closely correlated with photosynthetically active solar radiation. Our results showed higher CO2 carbon released from the water/soil ecosystem subset in comparison to plants subset. On the other hand, the estimated CH4 carbon balance for the plant/ecosystem subset was about twice that of the water/soil ecosystem subset. Overall, we showed that EC and CM methods cover different areas making EC advantageous for integrated measurements over larger areas, while the CM approach is suitable for local and spatially well constrained flux measurements. Hence, EC and CM methods should be seen as complementary rather than fully comparable methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Emissions; Greenhouse gasses; Photosynthesis; Phragmites australis; Respiration","autumn; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; eddy covariance; greenhouse gas; Mediterranean soil; methane; soil respiration; vegetation cover; wetland; Phragmites australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070287165

For countries located in arid and semi-arid regions, drought monitoring has become important tool. This study aims to evaluate the performances of drought indices and monitor future drought, evapotranspiration and aridity in Hinalo Wejerat, Ethiopia. The baseline climate data (1980–2009) were projected to near (2010–2039) and mid-term (2040–2069) using an ensemble of 20 general circulation models in the mitigation scenario. Drought was estimated using an ensemble of seven indices, namely Standardized Precipitation Index, Percent of Normal Index, Effective Drought Index, Z-score, Rainfall Anomaly Index, Modified China Z-index and Reconnaissance Drought Indexes using Meteorological Drought Monitoring and DrinC software. Time series analyses were calculated using AnClim software. All indices show significant correlation with each other and ensemble at p < 0.05. The frequency of moderately dry condition might be increased from 13.3, 13.3 to 16.7%, extremely dry condition from 3.3 to 6.7, 6.7% during the current, near and mid-terms, respectively. The trends of extremely wet, moderately wet and normal might be similar. The change of drought frequency in the current, near and mid-term is significant at p < 0.05. Potential evapotranspiration is projected to increase from 1645.6 to 1902.4 and 1988.9 mm per year in the near and mid-term when compared with current. Accordingly, aridity in the near and end-term might increase by 9.9 and 22.1%, respectively. Therefore, this study notes that sustainable water resource management and drought policy should be applied to ensure household food security. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aridity; Climate change; Drought; Drought indices; Potential evapotranspiration","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Climate models; Evapotranspiration; Food supply; Time series analysis; Water conservation; Water management; Arid and semi-arid regions; Drought monitoring; Environmental factors; General circulation model; Meteorological drought; Potential evapotranspiration; Standardized precipitation index; Sustainable water resources; Drought; aridity; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate effect; drought; evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087281679

In Ethiopia, where the majority of the population rely on agriculture, climate change has adverse effects. In rural areas, low resilient capacity to shocks exacerbates the impacts of climate change such as production failure, which in turn enormously contributed to food insecurity. In view of this fact, this study assessed the perceptions and practices of climate change and related adaptation and mitigation strategies among farmers in the Konta Special District, Southern Ethiopia, by using a mixed research approach involving a concurrent method of data collection and analysis. Quantitative data for this study was generated from 296 randomly selected survey households; while, qualitative data was collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews. The findings of this study revealed that sample respondents recognized the occurrence climate change and its increasing adverse effects. Regarding its cause, a substantial proportion (46.8%) of the respondents perceived climate change as the wrath of God and a natural phenomenon rather than attributing it to human activities. Participants also acknowledged that anthropogenic factors such as deforestation are the major driving factors for climate change. The study found that farmers affirmatively perceive the feasibility of the majority of the strategies embraced in the Climate Resilient Green Economy initiative endorsed at national level. Understanding that climate change effects are less reversible, farmers were found to practice mitigation strategies such as afforestation, agroforestry and agricultural intensification more than adaptation strategies. Adaptation strategies such as fuel conservation technologies were perceived costly and complex given the economic capacity and skill of farmers. Hence, rural and agricultural development policies should initiate context sensitive adaptation and mitigation strategies to enhance the capability of smallholders to deal with the effects of climate change. © 2019 Copyright by University of Silesia in Katowice","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation; Perception; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077282910

Primary data was gathered from field with the aid of gas sensing device (Gas Sensor By Crown Cone) Outdoor carbon monoxides and Nitrogen Oxides was sensed in four (4) selected local government authorities namely Kano Municipal, Fagge, Nasarawo and Tarauni based on the land uses interactions and 4 major road intersections (junctions) in each local government reading stations was sensed each in a specific days. Monday and Fridays was selected as the busiest day. Friday was used for Kano Municipal and Nassarawo while Fagee and Tarauni Monday was employed the. The study also utilized secondary data obtained from available sources of majorly related journals. The result was tabulated for comparison. The result depict that the study unveiled that, Tarauni local government has the highest average value of carbon monoxides of 21Ppm. The study also indicates that on the other hand, Tarauni local government demonstrates the highest records of Nitrogen Oxides (NO2). This is due to its high volume of traffic. Nassarawa and Fagge local governments relatively portrays very close records of sensed carbon monoxides with 16Ppm and 15Ppm. The result further indicates that Kano Municipal local government maintain the least records of both Carbon monoxides and Nitrogen Oxides of 13Ppm and 00.4. This is due to the facts, the traditional city has less vehicular movements because of its connectivity challenges with the walled city. This therefore affects its rate of emission. Urban plaining towards Low carbon society is to strongly recommend so as to safe guard the environment in sustainable manner. This could be achieved through in-depth study of environmental implications of urban growth within the study area. © IJSTR 2019.","CO and NO2; Gas Sensing; Kano Metropolis; Low Carbon Society; Urban Growth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077306022

In view of this, the processing of steels is greatly affected by their composition, particularly their carbon content. This paper reports on the machinability of three different steels with varying carbon contents. The steel samples were sourced from Owode metal market in Ilorin, Kwara State and their percentage compositional analysis was carried out at Universal Steels Limited, Lagos. The steel samples were classified into high, medium and low carbon steels based on their percentage carbon content. The machining condition was wet and the machining parameters used were depth of cut (0.2 - 0.6 mm), feed rate (0.05 - 0.15 mm/rev), and cutting speed (100 - 150 rpm). The experimental runs were designed using Taguchi orthogonal array of Minitab version 16 and the cutting temperature was monitored with a digital thermometer and k-type thermocouple wires. The experimental results were analysed using Minitab 18 with a focus on percentage contribution of various factors affecting surface roughness, chip morphology, cutting temperature and material removal rate. Results show that surface finish is highest in low carbon steel and lowest in high carbon steel. The responses show that machinability of the steel improved with a reduction in carbon content. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon content; Machinability; Steel; Surface Roughness","Cutting; Machinability; Morphology; Steel; Surface roughness; Thermocouples; Carbon content; Compositional analysis; Digital thermometers; K-type thermocouples; Machining parameters; Material compositions; Material removal rate; Taguchi orthogonal arrays; Low carbon steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077771235

However, the type and location of nets need to be addressed properly to determine the shading method that provides a better cooling effect on the greenhouse air. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of five different shading methods on greenhouse microclimates, and to investigate the cooling potential of each method. Four greenhouse models covered with 200-µm thick plastic film were used for the study: one was kept as control (C), one was whitened with slaked lime (L), and two were shaded with white and black nets (50% shading factor) deployed simultaneously at two locations, in contact (WC, BC) and at 20-cm distance from the cladding film (WD, BD). The microclimatic parameters were measured inside and outside the greenhouse models, and the cooling potential (CP) was predicted for each shading method. The results showed that the black net at 20-cm distance (BD) is desirable as it provides high CP with a reasonable solar radiation transmission. The maximum CP was estimated as 8.5 ◦C, 8 ◦C, 6 ◦C, 3.2 ◦C, and 2.1 ◦C for L, BD, BC, WD, and WC, respectively. Shading with white nets is not recommended because their cooling potential is very low. Based on these results, we developed correlations for predicting the CP for each shading method as a function of the transmitted solar radiation flux (Si). These correlations depend on Si. Accordingly, they can be used for small greenhouses, whitewashed with a slaked lime of any concentration, or shaded with a black net having any shading factor. © 2019 by the authors.","Cooling; Greenhouse; Heating; Hot regions; Shading nets; Solar radiation","Boron carbide; Cooling; Greenhouse effect; Heating; Hydrated lime; Lime; Solar radiation; Cooling effects; Cooling potential; Greenhouse microclimate; Hot regions; Radiation transmission; Shading factors; Shading nets; Solar-radiation fluxes; Greenhouses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076711150

Reproduction of historical atmospheric pollution levels based on global aerosol models and emission changes is crucial to prove that such models are able to predict future scenarios. Here, we analyze consistency of trends in observations of sulfur components in air and precipitation from major regional networks and estimates from six different global aerosol models from 1990 until 2015. There are large interregional differences in the sulfur trends consistently captured by the models and observations, especially for North America and Europe. Europe had the largest reductions in sulfur emissions in the first part of the period while the highest reduction came later in North America and East Asia. The uncertainties in both the emissions and the representativity of the observations are larger in Asia. However, emissions from East Asia clearly increased from 2000 to 2005 followed by a decrease, while in India a steady increase over the whole period has been observed and modelled. The agreement between a bottom-up approach, which uses emissions and process-based chemical transport models, with independent observations gives an improved confidence in the understanding of the atmospheric sulfur budget. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060952160

While torrefaction delivers a carbon content and hydrophobicity comparable to coal, it lowers its density and creates material handling, storage, and transportation challenges. Densification into briquettes would help mitigate these challenges. However, the torrefied biomass is difficult to densify and may require the use of binders, which are expensive and can be incompatible with respect to material and emissions. A cost-effective approach to utilize lignin in-situ of the biomass to promote binding during densification was demonstrated using a pilot-scale briquetter unit during this study. Lignin, a cross-linked polymer, tends to break down and lose its binding ability under high-temperature conditions of torrefaction. In this paper, we investigated the use of a lightly torrefied material as a binder-LTM (biomass torrefied in the transition region of non-reactive and reactive temperature ranges of torrefaction). When mixed with torrefied biomass and densified together under suitable moisture and temperature conditions, the lignin is shown to mobilize and provide binding to the briquettes. The results showed that briquettes produced using LTM as binder and 10% to 11% moisture provided in-situ binding, improved density and durability, and produced hydrophobic briquettes. © 2019 by the authors.

How much regional temperatures are affected by ambitious SLCF emission mitigation policies is, however, still uncertain. We investigate the potential temperature implications of stringent air quality policies by applying matrices of regional temperature responses to new pathways for future anthropogenic emissions of aerosols, methane (CH4), and other short-lived gases. These measures have only a minor impact on CO2 emissions. Two main options are explored, one with climate optimal reductions (i.e., constructed to yield a maximum global cooling) and one with the maximum technically feasible reductions. The temperature response is calculated for four latitude response bands (90-28° S, 28° S-28° N, 28- 60° N, and 60-90° N) by using existing absolute regional temperature change potential (ARTP) values for four emission regions: Europe, East Asia, shipping, and the rest of the world. By 2050, we find that global surface temperature can be reduced by -0:3 ± 0:08 °C with climate-optimal mitigation of SLCFs relative to a baseline scenario and as much as -0:7 °C in the Arctic. Cutting CH4 and black carbon (BC) emissions contributes the most. The net global cooling could offset warming equal to approximately 15 years of current global CO2 emissions. On the other hand, mitigation of other SLCFs (e.g., SO2) leads to warming. If SLCFs are mitigated heavily, we find a net warming of about 0.1 °C, but when uncertainties are included a slight cooling is also possible. In the climate optimal scenario, the largest contributions to cooling come from the energy, domestic, waste, and transportation sectors. In the maximum technically feasible mitigation scenario, emission changes from the industry, energy, and shipping sectors will cause warming. Some measures, such as those in the agriculture waste burning, domestic, transport, and industry sectors, have large impacts on the Arctic, especially by cutting BC emissions in winter in areas near the Arctic. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; air quality; air temperature; climate forcing; emission control; environmental policy; methane; policy approach; potential temperature; shipping; surface temperature; Europe; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076697005
