Available since 1978, multichannel passive microwave data have great potential for long term climate monitoring. In order to ensure consistent data sets for such long term monitoring, the relations between the microwave brightness temperatures from similar sensors on successive satellite platforms must be understood. In this study the 19, 22, and 37 GHz channels of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F8 and Fll Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) instruments are compared. While the analysis shows that the two data sets are highly correlated with correlation coefficients greater than 0.98, the consistency between the two data sets can be improved by applying small corrections in the order of 1 deg K. Two sets, of regression coefficients are provided for adjusting the F11 data to the F8 baseline. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"brightness temperature; ice sheet; SSMI; Antarctica; Greenland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029500874

The target was in contact with a (CH2)n-block for the moderation of secondary neutrons. Small holes in the moderator were filled with either lanthanium salts or uranium oxide. The reaction 139La (n,γ) 140La β- → was studied via the decay of 140La (40 h), and the reaction 238U (n, γ) 239U β- →239Np β- → was studied via the decay of 239Np (2.3 d). In addition, a variety of solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD) were used. Results will be presented. The yields for the formation of (n, γ) products agree essentially with other experiments on extended targets carried out at the Synchrophasotron LHE, JINR (Dubna). To a first approximation, the breeding rate of (n, γ) products, as well as the specific track density, seen with several SSNTDs, doubles when the carbon energy is increased from 22 to 44 GeV. If, however, results at 44 GeV are compared in detail to those at 22 GeV, we observe an excess of (37 ± 9) % in the experimentally observed 239Np-breeding rate over theoretical estimations. Experiments using solid state nuclear track detectors are giving similar results. We also observed in the past such excess in the yield of other secondary particles in relativistic heavy ion interactions above a total energy of approximately 35-40 GeV. © 1995.","enhanced nuclear cross-sections; Relativistic heavy ions","Carbon; Copper; Ion bombardment; Ions; Oxides; Radiation detectors; Solid state devices; Enhanced nuclear cross section; Nuclear chemistry; Solid state nuclear track detector; Neutrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029237938

We analysed published studies of plant responses to elevated CO2 to address whether reproductive and total biomass exhibit similar enhancement to elevated vs. ambient CO2 concentrations, and to assess the patterns of plant response along gradients of CO2 concentrations. In six annual plant species, mean enhancement at double ambient vs. ambient CO2 was 1.13 for total biomass and 1.30 for reproductive biomass. The two measures were significantly correlated, but there was considerable scatter in the relationship, indicating that reproductive responses cannot be consistently predicted from enhancement of total biomass. Along experimental CO2 gradients utilizing three concentrations, there was a great diversity of response patterns, including positive, negative, non‐monotonic and non‐significant (flat) responses. The distribution of response patterns differed for plants grown in stands compared to those grown individually. Positive responses were less frequent in competitive environments, and non‐monotonic responses were more frequent. These results emphasize that interpolation of plant response based on enhancement ratios measured at elevated vs. ambient CO2 concentrations is not sufficient to predict community responses to incremental changes in atmospheric conditions. The consequences of differential response patterns were assessed in a simulation of community dynamics for four species of annual plants. The model illustrates that the final community composition at a future point in time depends critically on both the magnitude and the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2.

Radiation and soot formation models are presented which include the nonlinear dependencies between fluid turbulence effects, soot formation and radiative absorption and emission in the participating medium. The discrete-ordinates method is used to solve theradiation intensity field. Soot formation is predicted with a formation-destruction model based on local volatile content and stoichiometry. The impact of soot and turbulence-radiation coupling was evaluated based on incident surface fluxes and centerline temperature and emission. Result trends were as expected, but suggest that the magnitude of soot effects on radiative transfer may be less than originally thought for the type of furnace and operating conditions modeled in this research. Predicted local soot properties were significantly different when calculated with and without turbulence coupling. Emissive powers and incident wall fluxes were notably higher when nonlinear turbulence effects were not properly accounted for. A three-dimensional combustion model which couples turbulent flow statistics with chemical reactions and radiative heat transfer wasused to evaluate the effects of turbulence coupling and soot on radiative transfer in anindustrial-scale axial-flow furnace. Predicted radiative characteristics were notablydifferent when calculated with and without turbulence coupling. Emissive powers and incident wall fluxes were higher when nonlinear turbulence effects on mean radiative properties were not accounted for. These differences were most pronounced in cases with highsoot concentrations (e.g. rich flames) due to the increase in local absorption and emission. Turbulence coupling reduced the predicted effects of soot on local emission, temperature and incident wall flux. The presence of soot in the furnace increased the centerline emissive power, which increased incident wall flux and decreased centerline temperature for both lean and rich flames. The impact of soot on emissive power was significant, but the effect on. centerline temperature and incident wall flux was less than expected. This suggests that the role of soot in radiative transfer may be less than originally thought for the type of furnace and operating conditions modeled in this research. Future research needs include more advanced soot formation models which can be implemented within the framework of comprehensive combustion models, improved radiative property models which consider spectral effects and scattering due to soot agglomerates, and more detailed soot radiation measurements in large-scale furnaces. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Higher glacial to interglacial δ18O amplitudes of planktonic and benthic foraminifera (1.8 and 1.7%., respectively) indicate an increase in Banda surface and deep water salinity during glacial conditions. Planktonic data is influenced by the precession (23 kyr periodicity) while benthic values reflect intermediate Pacific water fluctuations. The benthic δ13C exhibits a depletion of about 0.3%. for the last glacial maximum (LGM) relative to the Holocene. A still higher depletion of benthic δ13C (0.4-0.6%.) occurs during the penultimate full glaciation (stage 6). The main characteristics of δ13C in the Banda Sea are a direct record of the δ13C global oceanic signal and an evolution similar to intermediate and deep Pacific waters. Banda Sea records indicate a general good ventilation that remained unchanged between glacial and interglacial periods. Variations in the carbon isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera are attributed to the local variability in monsoonal upwelling or changes in throughflow of Pacific intermediate-water masses via Indonesian seas. An increase in the alkalinity and deepening of the lysocline has resulted in higher carbonate content during glacial periods, similar to the results reported in the North Pacific. © 1995.",,"foraminifera; monsoonal upwelling; palaeoceanography; Quaternary; ventilation; hydrography; isotopic record; Quaternary (late); Banda Sea; Cibicidoides; Globigerinoides ruber; Uvigerina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028974642

Four replicated plots of each CO2 treatment were split for irrigation: 'wet' regions received 60 cm of water and 'dry' regions received 30 cm of water through underground tubes. Enriched CO2 concentrations had no effect on in vitro digestion of intact sections of young (26-32-day-old plants) leaf blades except at 24-27 h incubation, at which time enriched leaves were lower in digestibility than control ones. Enriched CO2 concentrations increased the content of acid detergent fiber (ADF) and cellulose of young wet leaves. Sections of main shoots at 26 days tended to have increased digestibility with elevated CO2 levels. Enriched CO2 concentrations did not alter the digestibility of flag leaves from 105-day-old plants or of flag leaves, uppermost stems, and sheaths from plants at full grain maturity. Enriched CO2 levels reduced the acid detergent lignin (ADL) and tended to reduce the protein of leaves from 105-day-old plants.

The simulation results show that an energy saving of about 10% is estimated for fully installed cogeneration in the commercial/residential sector, on average. However, the model analysis reveals that energy conversion efficiency is declining in almost all countries due to electrification. The analysis of the effectiveness of cogeneration in six countries, from the viewpoints of energy conservation and carbon dioxide reduction, shows that the results of estimation on these points are relatively small in Japan and therefore some other policy measures than cogeneration are required to achieve greater reductions in energy consumption in the commercial/residential sector.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Estimation; Mathematical models; Waste heat; Combined heat and power; Commercial and residential sector; Electric power demand trends; Electrification; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029193787

The structure with the tetrahedral CMo3core and fluxional properties of 2 and 3 have been characterized by means of X-ray crystallography and NMR techniques. All of the three η5-C5H4R' rings in the μ3-methylidyne complexes 2a,b project to the same side as does the μ3-CH ligand (conformer A), whereas one of the three η5-C5H4R' rings in the μ3-ethylidyne complexes 3a,b projects to the side distal from the μ3-C-CH3(conformer B). The C3-symmetrical structure (A) of 2 is supported by the three strong semibridging interactions of CO ligands with the adjacent Mo centers, but 3 with the unsymmetrical structure B contains less strong semibridging interactions. In solutions, 2 exists as an equilibrated mixture of two isomers A and B as revealed by variable temperature 1H- and 13C-NMR measurements. The complicated dynamic behavior of 2 can be analyzed as a combination of rotation of one of the three Mo(η5-C5H4R')(CO)2 units of A leading to B (local rotation) and concerted rotation of all the three metal fragments operating for B (gearlike rotation), which are associated with cleavage and regeneration processes of the semibridging interaction. The fluxional behavior of the μ3-ethylidyne complexes 3 can be explained by the gearlike rotation mechanism. Labeling experiments using l-13CO and DSiMe2Ph verify that all the hydrogen and carbon atoms of the μ3-alkylidyne parts in 2 and 3 come from HSiMe2Ph and CO in 1, respectively. Therefore the present system can be viewed as a model system for a crucial step in Fischer—Tropsch mechanism, i.e. deoxygenative reduction of CO giving CH and CCH3 species. The deoxygenative reduction has been realized by using hydrosilane with high oxygenophilicity as an equivalent for H2. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

An existing nonlinear model, which was derived using a density matrix formalism, has been extended in this paper to generate the nonlinear gain coefficient matrix. Properties of the nonlinear gain coefficient matrix, which describes the interaction among cavity modes, are discussed. Using the new nonlinear gain in the steady-state multimode rate equations, conventional Fabry-Perot (FP) and short cavity Fabry-Perot (SFP) semiconductor laser diodes have been numerically simulated. Design issues such as cavity length, cavity volume, facet reflectivity, spontaneous emission factor, mode wavelength, intraband relaxation time, linewidth enhancement factor, and laser structure are also discussed. It is shown that increasing the injection current causes the lasing mode to jump to longer wavelengths. Furthermore, increasing the spontaneous emission factor reduces the dynamic range of laser operation without mode-hopping, and vice versa for short cavity. It has been also shown that the carrier density in the active region shifts to higher values (i.e., experiences a kink) at the onset of mode-hopping.

The in vitro degradation study of three aliphatic polymers—poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC), poly(trimethylene carbonate‐co‐caprolactone) (PTMC‐PCL), and poly(adipic anhydride) (PAA)—revealed that these polymers exhibit degradation times from several years (PTMC) to 1 day (PAA). PTMC degraded unexpectedly slow, accompanied by very small changes in weight loss, molecular weight (SEC), and in morphology (DSC, SEM). The degradation was independent of initial molecular weight, ionic strength of the water solution, temperature, and shaking motions. The copolymer PTMC‐PCL showed a higher degradation rate compared to PTMC, with preferential degradation of amorphous parts leading to an increase in % crystallinity. The surprisingly rapid degradation of PAA showed characteristics typical for a surface‐like eroding system in contrast to PTMC and PTMC‐PCL. The degradation products corresponded to the repeating unit of the polymers. The hydrolysis rate increases in the order carbonate, ester, anhydride, and by combining different molecular structures we achieve specific degradation behavior. A change in hydrolysis rate of the labile bond is predicted by altering the electronegativity of groups near the carbonyl‐oxygen region. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Emphasis in this paper is on Europe. Trends in driving forces of emissions are used to compute anthropogenic SO2 emissions in 13 world regions. These emissions are translated into regional patterns of sulfur deposition in Europe and global patterns of sulfate aerosols using source-receptor matrices. Changes in climate are then computed based on changes in sulfate and greenhouse gases. Finally, we compute ecosystem areas affected by acid deposition and climate change based on exceedances of critical loads and changes in potential vegetation. Using this framework, information from global and regional integrated models can be used to link sulfur emissions with both their global and regional consequences. Preliminary calculations indicate that the size of European area affected by climate change in 2100 (58%) will be about the same as that affected by acid deposition in 1990. By the mid 21st century, about 14% of Europe's area may be affected by both acid deposition and climate change. Also, reducing sulfur emissions in Europe will have both the desirable impact of reducing the area affected by acid deposition, and the undesirable impact of enhancing climate warming in Europe and thus increasing the area affected by climate change. However, for the scenarios in this paper, the desirable impact of reducing sulfur emissions greatly outweighs its undesirable impact. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","acidification; air pollution impacts; climate change; global change; integrated modeling; sulfur deposition","Acid deposition; Addification; Global change; Greenhouse gases; Vegetation; Aerosols; Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Mathematical models; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollution; sulfate; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; acid rain; acidification; air pollution; analysis; conference paper; europe; global climate; model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029634958

A 50% reduction in top-land height produced about 20-25% reduction in HC emissions, at part loads. The effect of top-land radial clearance on HC emissions was found to depend on the value of top-land height, which suggests a complex relation between flame propagation in the piston crevice and crevice geometry. For idle, increasing top-land clearance resulted in an increase in HC emissions. This trend is opposite to the trend at part load. A simple model was developed which predicts surprisingly well the contribution of piston crevices to HC emissions. It was estimated that for the test engine, piston crevices contribute about 50% of the engine-out hydrocarbons.

Most existing models were developed for planning transportation facility improvements and are not well suited for analyzing pricing strategies. Since these models still represent the best available travel database in most urban areas, there is a desire to adapt them to meet a wider range of needs. The Environmental Protection Agency recently commissioned a study on the effects of transport pricing on emissions. This required a planning tool that could analyze many different pricing actions. This project borrowed parts of existing good models to create a pricing-sensitive model set. The resulting model was applied using actual data from one area, for more realistic results. This approach represents an incremental advancement in modeling practice by successfully combining features of the more advanced four-step models. Trip distribution uses a composite definition of impedance that reflects time and cost of all modes. Mode choice is a logit model with some degree of nesting in the carpool mode; it is sensitive to peak and off-peak automobile operating cost, tolls, transit fare, and parking cost. A logit path choice procedure models the effect of tolls on drivers' selection of free and priced paths. All highway paths are based on a combined time and cost impedance.

Kinetics parameters were obtained using steady state measurements with the rotating ring disk electrode (rrde) with electrocatalyst deposited on glassy carbon disks or with the powder incorporated in a disk of carbon paste matrix. Oxygen reduction proceeds mostly via a four-electron transfer reaction (96%) to water as determined by the rotating ring disk electrode technique. The heterogeneous rate constants, k1 (water formation from oxygen), k2 (hydrogen peroxide formation) and k3 (water production from generated H2O2) were evaluated over the potential range of 0.70 to 0V/nhe. Temperature dependence (296 K to 338 K) and kinetic parameters were evaluated. It is concluded that minimising the molybdenum content leads to improved electrocatalysis. © 1995.","chalcogenides; oxygen reduction; temperature dependence; thin layers; transition metal","Catalysis; Catalysts; Electrodes; Molybdenum; Oxygen; Reduction; Ruthenium; Semiconductor materials; Thermal effects; Transition metals; Chalcogenides; Electrocatalysis; Oxygen reduction; Temperature dependence; Thin layers; Reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029292604

Box 17777, United Arab Emirates","The Middle-Upper Jurassic section in the Arabian Gulf basin forms one of the most prolific sequences in the world, in which an excellent combination of source, reservoir and seal rocks was developed within a major sedimentary cycle. The sequence consists of a) relatively quiet deep-water mudstone, wackestone and shale (source facies), b) shallow-water high enery grainstone and packstone (reservoir facies), and c) very shallow supratidal anhydrite (seal facies). The principal factors, which controlled the sedimentation of this sequence, are considered to have been eustatic sea-level change and epeirogenic movement of carbonate shelves. The Jurassic reservoirs of the major oil fields in this region show exceptionally high porosity up to 30% for their relatively old geologic age (some 150 million years old) and depths of burial in the range between 1,200 and more than 2,700 m. Porosity occurs most commonly as intergranular/remnant primary pore spaces, but its distribution is quite uneven and very complicated. To account for the existence of such high porosity (and permeability) in the Jurassic reservoirs, probable geological, physical and chemical factors for preserving and enhancing porosity (and permeability), such as acidic formation fluids, reduced fluid mobility, tectonic forces, ductility of intercalated beds (e.g. anhydrite), and dolomitization were examined. It has been observed in various fields in the region that oilsaturated portions of the Jurassic reservoirs tend to retain higher porosity than the surrounding water-saturated zones. Porosity preservation by hydrocarbons is possible primarily because of excess hydrocarbon pressure and of reduced mobility of water in such oil-saturated zones. To continue sediment diagenesis, a steady supply of minerals by formation water and the mobility of the water may have been essential. Because the entrapment of oil in the Jurassic reservoirs in the region is considered to have been as late as early Tertiary, some other (pre-migration) mechanisms which may have worked in the earlier geologic stages for preserving and creating porosity (and permeability) seem to be necessary. © 1995 Institut für Paläontologie, Universität Erlangen.","Arabian Gulf; Carbonate Porosity; Jurassic","carbonate; diagenesis; permeability; porosity; reservoir characterization; Arabian Gulf; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029529941

At that time, the phenomenon was referred to as the ""Sunday effect."" In the late 1980s, additional papers focused on weekday/weekend differences in air quality in the South Coast (Los Angeles) Air Basin. Analyses of ozone concentrations measured at a number of locations in northern California reveal that average ozone concentrations are frequently higher on weekends than on weekdays. Violations of the California 0.09 ppm 1-hour air quality standard for ozone also occur in disproportionately greater frequency on weekends. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is based largely on the differences between weekday and weekend emission patterns. We believe that the observed differences may provide information regarding which pollutant reduction strategy, NOx or ROG control, may be more effective in reducing ambient ozone concentrations. For the northern California region, the presence of higher weekend ozone concentrations suggests the need for ROG control is greater than for NOx control. If both NOx and ROG are to be controlled, it is important to understand the interdependence of the two pollutants in forming ozone. With the current uncertainty and debate regarding official vehicular emission inventories, this phenomenon emphasizes the importance of using observation-based data to examine ambient pollution and emission relationships. This natural experiment of varying emissions provides an interesting test case for sophisticated air pollution model performance and evaluation. Using a Bay Area emission inventory and an estimate of its change from weekday to weekend, combined with a generic Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA) diagram, we demonstrate the weekend effect. In addition, changes in the Bay Area emission inventory from 1980 to 1990, when combined with the EKMA diagram, also show why the weekend effect is more evident in the 1990s. It is our hypothesis that the presence of the weekend effect, positive or negative, combined with changes in emission changes, provides a simple clue to whether an area is NOxor ROG limited with respect to ozone formation. © 1995 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"Air pollution; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Ambient ozone concentrations; Emissions; Hypotheses; Northern California; San Francisco Bay Area; Weekday concentrations; Weekend concentrations; Ozone; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air pollution; air quality; article; pollutant; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029411944

The proton inventory for k is consistent with sulfhydryl addition to the regulatory pyruvate, coupled to a multiproton process in the transition state for release of the product acetaldehyde.

Based on the Regional Acidification Information and Simulation (RAINS) model, a framework has been constructed for a simultaneous optimization of nitrogen oxides and ammonia emission reductions using nitrogen depositions from both pollutants as side constraints. The paper first demonstrates that the same nitrogen deposition resulting from the currently committed reductions of emissions of nitrogen oxides (without measures for ammonia emissions) can be achieved at only 55% of the costs if measures for ammonia reduction would also be applied. The analysis shows that no large scale substitutions of reductions of nitrogen oxides by ammonia measures occur. The cost savings mainly result from replacing the most expensive (and ineffective) nitrogen oxide abatement at a few places in Europe with inexpensive ammonia control measures. Consequently, the total level of emissions of nitrogen oxides is hardly higher than in the reference case, but substantial ammonia reductions are implemented lowering total cost. The second case explores the potential contribution ammonia control can make to attaining the same nitrogen deposition levels resulting from the maximum application of nitrogen oxide abatement technologies solely. In this case, reductions of ammonia emissions can lower total abatement costs by 23%, basically by modified manure handling, stable adaptations for poultry, and the control of industrial ammonia emissions. © 1995 Academic Press Ltd.","Abatement strategy; Acid rain; Ammonia; Cost-effectiveness; Costs; Europe; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen oxides","ammonia control; cost saving; deposition target; emission control; environmental economics; modelling approach; nitrogen deposition; RAINS control; Europe; ammonia; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; acid rain; agriculture; air pollution; article; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; Europe; exhaust gas; manure; model; pollution control; simulation; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028972357

Engineers have the potential of becoming obsolete within a few short years after they leave academia. Therefore, it is critical that a solid foundation for life-long learning be developed during the university preparation period. Comprehensive approaches to the development of engineering strategies are most often created not in isolation, but through collective minds. Today technical corporations are focused on collaborative, team building strategies that will keep pace with global competition. OMEP has the challenge of preparing students to meet the changing industry climate. Therefore, a program was called for that could reinforce engineering concepts in a team setting to improve academic excellence. Supported by the Foundation Coalition, the OMEP has now begun an Academic Excellence Program that clusters underrepresented minority (African American, Hispanic and Native American) students enrolled in ECE 100, a course designed to teach engineering concepts and computer skills. Non-minority students in the course are also invited to participate in these workshops. The students develop their own community of learners and collectively come to conclusions on how to process information. The Academic Excellence Workshops help to move away from traditional tutoring that is often a short term fix. Rather, these sessions enhance the mastery of engineering concepts as opposed to isolated problems.

Thus, a realistic assessment of emissions, pollution reduction methods and the effectiveness of emission control technologies cannot be carried out without taking into account the actual operating conditions of the vehicles. For that reason, a project has been carried out as part of the EC DRIVE programme to measure engine and vehicle operating conditions during normal driving. 58 private cars were equipped with sensors and data acquisition systems to record details of their use by their owners, each over a period of about one month. Over 8,200 trips were monitored, covering more than 73,000 kilometers of travel, during which the vehicle speed, engine speed, temperatures and other variables were recorded at one second intervals. The data obtained yielded very accurate information on the actual use of the cars, which provided a broad overview of normal European driving, covering aspects such as daily vehicle use, trip characteristics (trip length, duration, and so on), speed and accelerations used, engine running conditions (engine speeds, choke use, etca) and thermal conditions. Traffic conditions have been characterized through splitting recorded speed profiles into ""kinematic sequences"", between successive stops. Factorial analysis and classifying techniques enabled the characterization of these sequences and the ways in which different sequence types were linked. A set of driving cycles for realistic emission measurements has then been drawn up using these data, by recombining real sequences, randomly selected in accordance with the results of the statistical analyses. These cycles represent the European traffic conditions and driving patterns, taking into account the influence of the vehicle type, driver's behaviour and geographical location, as well as the detailed records of engine operations. This paper describes the statistical analysis of the vehicle operation data, and the development of the test cycles. The driving cycles are compared with standard test cycles. The main characteristics of European vehicle use and their influence on fuel consumption are described: short trips, accelerations and more generally urban traffic conditions caused significant increases in fuel consumption. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.","Actual Uses; Driving behaviour; Driving Cycle; Driving patterns; Engine Operating Conditions; Passenger Cars; Pollutant Emissions","Automobile engines; Behavioral research; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Emission control; Fuels; Motor transportation; Passenger cars; Statistical methods; Traffic surveys; Actual use; Driving behaviour; Driving cycle; Driving pattern; Engine operating conditions; Pollutant emission; Speed",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072433966

This was accomplished by using hydrogen selenide as a hydrogen atom donor to trap quantitatively the 1, 4-biradicals formed in each reaction. The quantum yields of cycloadduct formation in the photocycloaddition reactions were measured as a function of alkene concentration. For each reaction the relative rates of formation of the biradicals and the quantum yield data were combined to determine quantitatively how each biradical partitions between closure (or disproportionation) to product and fragmentation to ground state enone and alkene. It is concluded that the regiochemistry of the enone-alkene photocycloaddition reactions studied is dominated by the manner in which the biradical intermediates partition between products and ground state precursors and not by the relative rates at which they are formed. It is also concluded that methyl substitution at the 3-position of cyclopentenone has little effect on either the relative rates of formation of the various isomeric biradical intermediates or the manner in which they partition between products and starting materials. However, methyl substitution at the 2-position of cyclopentenone slows formation of biradicals in which the alkene is bonded to the enone 2-position and also inhibits closure to cyclobutane products of biradicals formed by bonding of the alkene to the 3-position of the enone. These results can be rationalized if it is assumed that the enone triplet excited state possesses a planar carbon at the 2-position and a pyramidalized carbon at the 3-position, and if it is also assumed that in the biradicals, radical centers at the cyclopentanone 2-position are planar and at the 3-position are pyramidalized. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Two schemes, a single compressor scheme and a double compressor scheme in parallel arrangement, are scrutinised and compared to the conventional stand alone column. The investigation includes parametric study, operability assessment and an estimation of the role of heat pump in minimising flue gas emissions. The parametric study of the influences of the column top pressure and the pressure lift of the heat pump on the economics shows, for both schemes at the optimal conditions, practically the same annual total cost, which is about 37% cheaper than the conventional stand alone column. The operability of the system is investigated by degrees of freedom analysis and steady state controllability parameters. The operability considerations show that in the case of the double compressor scheme, the column pressure can be independent of the threshold temperature of the condenser. Thus the column pressure can be determined to satisfy the optimum separation parameters. Due to this operability reason, the double compressor scheme is preferred to the single compressor scheme. The heat pump share in reducing flue gas emissions is estimated. It is found that about 60% of the flue gas emissions can be minimised when using a heat pump. © 1995.",,"Compressors; Controllability; Costs; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Distillation columns; Flue gases; Gas emissions; Industrial economics; Optimization; Pressure effects; Propane; Propylene; Double compressor scheme; Emission control; Heat pump assisted distillation; Propylene propane splitter; Single compressor scheme; Stand alone column; Heat pump systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029283240

The characteristic features of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O on various types of active titanium oxide catalysts were investigated by in situ photoluminescence, UV-Vis, XAFS, ESR, FT-IR and XPS spectroscopic techniques. The reactions on TiO2 powders and Ti/Si binary oxides prepared by the sol-gel method produced methane as the major product while, on the highly dispersed titanium oxide anchored on a porous glass and zeolites, the formations of CH4, CH3OH, C2-compounds, and CO were observed as the major products. The yields of the photocatalytic reactions strongly depended on the type of catalysts, the value of CO2/H2O, and the reaction temperature. In situ spectroscopic studies of the system indicated that the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O is linked to a much higher reactivity of the charge transfer excited state, i.e., (Ti3+-O-)3∗ of the tetrahedral coordinated titanium oxides species formed on the surface. Based on the detection of reaction intermediate species such as Ti3+, H atoms, and C radicals, the reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O has been proposed on a molecular scale. © 1995, The Japan Petroleum Institute.

The proposed function, which is much simpler than the well‐known conduction transfer function, contains three coefficients U, w1 and w2 characterizing the wall and three parameters TM, TC, and Ts characterizing the outdoor conditions (temperature and solar radiation). The wall coefficients U, w1, and w2 may be determined numerically by the use of the finite difference method or experimentally in the case of existing (built) walls of unknown properties. A related experimental set up has been developed. Ready to use values of the wall coefficients are provided for 15 typical wall constructions. The climatic parameters TM, TC and Ts either are available for some locations or may be easily calculated by least‐squares fitting to local climatological data. In a modified form of the proposed function the three climatic parameters are reduced to two, which are available from ASHRAE for about 1000 stations around the world.

However the nature of the sources and the subsequent atmospheric transport and chemistry are very different from other acidifying pollutants.

Very few data are available on insect herbivory in plant communities where insects can choose among species and positions in the canopy in which to feed. Our objectives were to determine the extent to which CO2-induced changes in plant communities and leaf nutritional quality may affect herbivory at the level of the entire canopy. We introduced equivalent populations of fourth instar Spodoptera eridania, a lepidopteran generalist, to complex model ecosystems containing seven species of moist tropical plants maintained under low mineral nutrient supply. Larvae were allowed to feed freely for 14 days, by which time they had reached the seventh instar. Prior to larval introductions, plant communities had been continuously exposed to either 340 μl CO2 l-1 or to 610 μl CO2 l-1 for 1.5 years. No major shifts in leaf nutritional quality [concentrations of N, total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC), sugar, and starch; ratios of: C/N, TNC/N, sugar/N, starch/N; leaf toughness] were observed between CO2 treatments for any of the species. Furthermore, no correlations were observed between these measures of leaf quality and leaf biomass consumption. Total leaf area and biomass of all plant communities were similar when caterpillars were introduced. However, leaf biomass of some species was slightly greater-and for other species slightly less (e.g. Cecropia peltata)-in communities exposed to elevated CO2. Larvae showed the strongest preference for C. peltata leaves, the plant species that was least abundant in all communites, and fed relatively little on plants species which were more abundant. Thus, our results indicate that leaf tissue quality, as described by these parameters, is not necessarily affected by elevated CO2 under relatively low nutrient conditions. Hence, the potential importance of CO2-induced shifts in leaf nutritional quality, as determinants of herbivory, may be overestimated for many plant communities growing on nutrient-poor sites if estimates are based on traditional laboratory feeding studies. Finally, slight shifts in the abundance of leaf tissue of various species occurring under elevated CO2 will probably not significantly affect herbivory by generalist insects. However, generalist insect herbivores appear to become more dependent on less-preferred plant species in cases where elevated CO2 results in reduced availability of leaves of a favoured plant species, and this greater dependency may eventually affect insect populations adversely. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon dioxide enrichment; Feeding preference; Leaf quality; Mesocosms; Spodoptera eridania","Spodoptera eridania; Cecropia peltata; Lepidoptera; carbon dioxide enrichment; feeding preference; herbivory; leaf quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028982419

This study aims at increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms behind the ICP reducing effect of DHE by analysing cerebrovascular effects of a bolus dose of DHE in severely head injured patients (GCS&lt;8). Mean hemispheric cerebral blood flow (CBF) calculated from the clearance of i.v. 133Xenon, ICP, and cerebral arterio‐venous difference in oxygen content (AVDO2), were measured before and after hyperventilation and after a bolus dose of DHE (4 μg/kg). The patients were divided into two groups, one with preserved and one with impaired cerebrovascular CO2‐reactivity to hyperventilation, the latter being predictive of poor outcome. The haemodynamic effects of DHE were compared to those of hyperventilation. Regional CBF and brain volume SPECT measurements were performed in two patients. DHE increased cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) by about 20% and significantly reduced ICP in both groups of patients, resulting in unchanged AVDO2. Hyperventilation with preserved CO2‐reactivity caused a similar decrease in ICP as by DHE but with a much larger increase in CVR (by 70%) and a substantial increase in AVDO2. Hyperventilation with impaired CO2‐reactivity reduced ICP but otherwise had no significant cerebrovascular effects. The study supports the concept that the ICP reducing effect of DHE results more from constriction of the large veins than from arterial vasoconstriction, also implying a relatively smaller risk of ischaemia with DHE than with hyperventilation.

Bituminous coal particles of two distinct sizes, pulverized (75-90 μm) or micronized and beneficiated (mean diameter ∼3.5 μm) were burned. To measure the coal particle temperatures and burn times, combustion traces were recorded for single pulverized coal particles and clusters of micronized coal particles using a three-colour near-infrared optical pyrometer. The volatile and the char phase combustion temperatures of untreated pulverized-grind particles, in air at a gas temperature of 1450 K, were determined to be 2200 and 1800 K, respectively. Particles treated with CMA under the same conditions burned hotter, with the temperature of volatile and char phase being 2400 and 2000 K, respectively. SO2 and NOx concentrations were measured at the exit of the furnace for both the pulverized and the micronized coals. For furnace gas temperatures between 1250 and 1450 K, in a background gas containing 10-50 ppm SO2 and equivalence ratios, π, between 0.4 to 0.7, untreated micronized and pulverized bituminous coal particles produced SO2 emissions in the range 100-200 ppm and NOx emissions in the range 200-450 ppm. In contrast, combustion of pulverized particles treated with CMA, burning under the same conditions, not only did not produce any SO2 but also eliminated the background SO2 concentration. The combustion of micronized coal treated with CMA produced less SO2 than untreated micronized coal, but complete reduction of SO2 was not achieved. Experiments with CMA-treated micronized coal in atmospheres containing 40% oxygen suggested that the primary mechanism for sulfur removal in this virtually ash-free coal was the sulfation of resulting CaO MgO fly ash/aerosols. Experiments in which the effluent of the combustion of pulverized coal was quenched immediately after the heated furnace zone suggest that a fraction of the fuel sulfur (up to 50% of the released SO2) may have been encapsulated by ash during the combustion of treated pulverized coals, with the remaining released SO2 being removed by sulfation of Ca Mg-containing ash or submicron CaO MgO aerosols in the cool-down region of the furnace. © 1995.","catalyst; coal; combustion","Calcium compounds; Catalysts; Coal combustion; Fly ash; Furnaces; High temperature operations; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Sulfonation; Sulfur dioxide; Ash free coal; Calcium magnesium acetate; Coal pretreatment agent; Externally heated drop tube furnace; Micronized coal; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Sulfatton; Sulfur dioxide emissions; Bituminous coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029288719

Using a modification of the method of New (1955) explanted blastoderms of the Japanese quail were cultured for up to 72 h, and the role of ions in the formation of sub embryonic fluid (SEF) investigated. 2. Culture media deficient in either sodium or chloride ions reduced the volume of SEF secreted by up to a quarter. Ionic composition of the fluid was little altered, and sodium was transported against a concentration gradient. 3. Amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+exchange, reduced SEF production by half, whereas ionic composition and osmolality of the fluid was unchanged. 4. Likewise, acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, reduced SEF production by the blastoderm, and left the ionic composition and osmolality of the fluid unaltered. 5. Neither furosemide or 4,4‘-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2’-disulfonic acid at the concentrations used changed the volume of SEF formed or its ionic composition. 6. It is concluded that the secretion of SEF is dependent upon the active transport of sodium across the blastoderm; an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+exchanger and carbon dioxide hydration catalysed by carbonic anhydrase are also involved. 7.

In addition, long‐term and continuous ethanol infusion does not produce a steady‐state BEC, but results in pulsatile BECs and UECs having peak‐peak duration of approximately 6 days and ethanol concentrations ranging from near zero to over 500 mg/dl. In the present study, rats were treated with ethanol (levels reaching 13 g · kg−1· day−1) for 38 days in the presence of compounds reported to block CYP2E1 activity or expression, to study the possible involvement of CYP2E1 in the pulsatile BECs. The inhibitors used were chlormethiazole (CMZ); diallysulfide (DAS); phenethyl isothiocyanate (PET) and dihydrocapsacin (DHC). Hepatic microsomal metabolism of carbon tetrachloride and p‐nitrophenol, as well as mean CYP2E1 apoprotein levels, were significantly greater (P≤0.05) in ethanol‐treated rats than in control rats, whereas rats treated with DAS, CMZ or PET had significantly (P≤0.05) reduced p‐nitrophenol and carbon tetrachloride metabolism and lower CYP2E1 apoprotein levels compared to those of ethanol controls. UECs were variable in all ethanol‐treated groups and there was a typical pulsatile pattern that had a mean interpulse interval (the number of days between the peaks of two consecutive pulses) ranging over 5.4±0.3–6.0±0.7 days and a mean amplitude (nadir to peak UEC) of 415 ± 39–337 ± 33 mg/dl. None of the putative CYP2E1 blockers altered the pulsatile nature of ethanol in urine. Our results suggest that pulsatile UECs are not the result of variations in the amount of CYP2E1.

Experimental data are available for only a few locations, and more measurements in representative regions world-wide are required in order to evaluate the CO global budget more accurately. Our current understanding of the environmental impacts of carbon monoxide is reviewed. CO is a toxic gas which can cause fatal asphyxiation. However, our knowledge of the effects of exposure to moderate doses of CO on the health and behaviour of humans is limited. Carbon monoxide also contributes indirectly to global warming and ozone depletion. So, there is a need for a better understanding of the atmospheric chemical processes involving CO in order to reduce the uncertainties in the estimates of its impact on the global environment. © 1995.",,"carbon monoxide; environmental impact; global budget; sink; Atmospheric chemistry; Environmental impact; Global warming; Heat sinks; Ozone; Parameter estimation; Atmospheric carbon monoxide; Destruction/uptake rates; Fatal asphyxiation; Ozone depletion; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028973752

For example, the number of targets used since 1970 has averaged approximately 560 million a year. A number of acute and chronic tests were performed to determine the toxicity of Remington Arms Company Blue Rock® trap and skeet target fragments upon selected freshwater and marine organisms. These studies were undertaken in support of an environmental impact study of trap and skeet shooting activities at a major gun club in the northeast United States. Targets were composed of approximately 67% dolomitic limestone, 32% petroleum pitch and 1% fluorescent aqueous paint (painted targets only). The majority of samples were painted, new targets obtained from the manufacturer and painted and aged targets collected around a shooting range. Additional tests were conducted using non-painted, new targets and leachates prepared from both painted, new and aged targets. Targets were crushed to small fragments and were either directly added to the test vessels at extremely high concentrations ranging from 670 to 600 000 mgl-1 or used in leachate tests. In direct tests all target materials were essentially non-toxic to marine and freshwater organisms, except for the non-painted new targets which exhibited minimal acute toxicity to Daphnia magna (48 h ec50=2200 mgl-1). In leachate tests, the leachate was not-toxic to mysid shrimp, the only organism tested. Additional samples of crushed targets were analysed for the presence of selected priority pollutants (EP toxicity test) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The targets did not exhibit the characteristics of toxicity as determined by the EP toxicity test but did contain substantial amounts of PAHs. However, results from new and aged targets suggest that PAH are tightly bound in the petroleum pitch and limestone matrix and are unlikely to be readily available in the environment. The potential impact of targets on the environment is further discussed. © 1995 Chapman &amp; Hall.","aquatic toxicity; PAH; trap and skeet targets","clay target; freshwater organism; marine organism; shooting; toxicity test; USA; Daphnia magna; Mysidopsis bahia; environmental chemical; heavy metal; limestone; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; animal experiment; animal model; article; clay; controlled study; Daphnia; diatom; fish; gunshot injury; nonhuman; oyster; priority journal; shrimp; toxicity testing; water pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029415806

W. Ferguson et al. (1993, J. Mol. Spec. 160, 315-325). For each planet, the relatively weak laboratory linestrengths (approximately 30 and 15% less than the theoretical 4-0 S(0) and S(1) linestrengths, respectively) results, when compared to analyses adopting theoretical values, in a ∼30% decrease in the tropospheric methane ratio and a comparable increase in the pressure level of the optically thick cloudtop marking the bottom of the visible atmosphere (Pcld). The increase in the ratio of S(1)/S(0) linestrengths from 4.4 (theoretical) to ∼5.9 (measured) results in a decrease in the range of viable ortho/para ratios; an equilibrium hydrogen distribution is now the best fit for both planets.

Emission engineers are pursuing electrically heated converters HC adsorbers, close-coupled converters, fuel heated converters, warm-up converters and advanced catalyst technologies to meet these regulations. The HC and NOx regulations are the most challenging. With regard to advanced catalyst technologies, recent developments in palladium (Pd) catalyst technologies have demonstrated superior HC and adequate NOx performance compared to production platinum/rhodium (Pt/Rh) catalyst technologies. This paper investigates the application of advanced Pd catalyst technologies in converters that contain a Pd front brick and a Pt/Rh rear brick. Two studies are presented. The first study evaluates the effects of Pd loading, Pd catalyst technology, Pd front brick catalyst volume and air/fuel control when a Pd catalyst is used in front of a Pt/Rh catalyst. Converters having 2.7 liters of catalyst volume were dynamometer aged and evaluated on two engines using the US FTP The second study not only investigated the effects of Pd loading and Pd catalyst technology of the front brick, but also investigated the effects of Pt/Rh loading and catalyst technology of the rear brick. Converters having 1.8 liters of catalyst volume were dynamometer aged and evaluated on a 1.6L European engine using the revised ECE+EUDC driving cycle. The effect of improved fuel injection on converter performance was also evaluated. Within the scope of the experiments it was determined that Pd catalyst technologies have been developed that can significantly reduce emissions. Pd 3-Way converters (no Pt/Rh) should only be applied to vehicles with good to excellent air/fuel control. Pd front brick, Pt/Rh rear brick converters are appropriate for many vehicle applications. Significant reductions in HC and CO emissions can be achieved without increasing NOx emissions. However, the choice of Pd catalyst technology and loading are important. High Pd loadings and active catalyst Pd catalyst technologies can be too selective for HC and CO, making the reduction of NOx difficult. Increasing the Pt/Rh loading and using a high temperature Pt/Rh washcoat can reduce NOx emissions. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957308105

The rate of methane emission from inundated rice fields (cv IR-36) was increased appreciably due to cowdung and farmyard manure application, the emission increasing with increasing doses of these fertilizers. The emission was further enhanced when superphosphate and potash were also added. Treatment of sterile soils with non-sterile cowdung and farmyard manure gave higher rates of methane production than when non-sterile soil was treated with sterile cowdung or farmyard manure, indicating that the methanogens present in cowdung and farmyard manure contribute significantly to methane production in soil.

The latter, a facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacterium, is described for the first time as a microorganism producing 1,3-propanediol from glycerol. The products of glycerol conversion by E. agglomerans were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance. A 20-g/l glycerol solution was fermented mainly to 1,3-propanediol (0.51 mol/mol) and acetate (0.18 mol/mol). Ethanol, formate, lactate and succinate were formed as by-products. Gas production was very low; 1,3-propanediol production perfectly balanced the oxido-reduction state of the microorganism. Acetate was the predominant metabolite generating energy for growth. High-glycerol-concentration fermentations (71 g/l and 100 g/l) resulted in an increase of the 1,3-propanediol yield (0.61 mol/mol) at the expense of lactate and ethamol production. Specific rates of glycerol consumption and 1,3-propanediol and acetate production increased whereas the growth rate decreased. The decreased in ATP yield was linearly correlated with the specific rate of 1,3-propanediol production. Incomplete glycerol consumption (about 40 g/l) was systematically observed when high glycerol concentrations were used. The unbalanced oxido-reduction state, the low carbon recovery and the detection of an unknown compound by HPLC observed in these cases indicate the formation of another metabolite, which is possibly an inhibitory factor. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",,"1,3 propanediol; acetic acid; glycerol; article; bacterial metabolism; biotechnology; Clostridium butyricum; Enterobacter; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; Pantoea agglomerans; Bacteria (microorganisms); Clostridium butyricum; Enterobacter; Negibacteria; Pantoea agglomerans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028792574

The differences between calendar ages and radiocarbon ages that arise from variations in 14C production through time can distort the chronologies of individual records and the interpretations based on them. Misleading impressions of synchrony or diachrony of events among multiple records can result, and estimates of the apparent duration of episodes and rates of sedimentation and local population changes can be biased. Displays of the temporal patterns of migration or extinction may also be affected. Spurious correlations may arise between records with radiocarbon-controlled chronologies and time series of potential controls that are expressed on a calendar time scale. Support for particular explanations of features in a paleoecological record may vary depending on whether radiocarbon ages are calibrated or not. This situation is illustrated using the eastern Beringian Populus subzone as an example. When the radiocarbon ages that control the timing of the Populus subzone are calibrated, the contemporaneous decrease in ice volume and increase in summer insolation are implicated as the ultimate controls of the occurrence of the subzone. © 1995 by the University of Washington.",,"calibration; interpretation; palaeoecological record; palaeoecology; Populus subzone; radiocarbon age; radiocarbon dating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029472046

Part I [1] described an analytical approach to integrating transmission into the IRP framework and set forth the Comprehensive Electrical Systems Planning Model (CESPLAN). The model, a mixed integer, nonlinear, stochastic programming formulation of the planning problem, is solved using the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm with importance sampling to couple the contingency state space. The primary objective of this paper is to report a series of case studies performed with the model. Three sets of case study results are reported. The first set illustrates that optimal resource plans created from the commonly used utility approach of two-step planning, i.e., first planning generation and demand-side resources and then determining the set of transmission resources that “best matches"" the generation and demand-side plan, can lead to higher costs than when a more comprehensive, integrated planning approach is adopted. A second set of case studies illustrates the use of “importance sampling,” a procedure for reducing the number of sample configuration states of the system that must be simulated when estimating the effects of equipment outages on future system operating costs. The third set of studies illustrate not only the optimal generation plan but also the optimal transmission plan is sensitive to planning uncertainties such as emissions allowance costs, customer outage costs, and future natural gas prices. © 1995 IEEE","Demand-Side Planning; Generation Planning; Integrated Resource Planning; Transmission Planning","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Electric load management; Electric power generation; Mathematical models; Nonlinear programming; Outages; Planning; Random processes; State space methods; Benders decomposition algorithm; Demand-side planning; Generation planning; Integrated resource planning; Transmission planning; Electric power transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029354972

We report several important differences between the FR 1 and FR 2 radio galaxies. At the same host galaxy magnitude or radio luminosity, the FR 2's produce substantially more optical line emission (by roughly an order of magnitude or more) than do FR 1's. Similarly, FR 2 sources produce orders of magnitude more line luminosity than do radio-quiet galaxies of the same optical magnitude, while FR 1 sources and radio-quiet galaxies of the same optical magnitude produce similar line luminosities. Combining these results with previous results from the literature, we conclude that while the emission-line gas in the FR 2's is indeed photoionized by a nuclear UV continuum source from the AGN, the emission-line gas in the FR 1's may be energized predominantly by processes associated with the host galaxy itself. The apparent lack of a strong UV continuum source from the central engine in FR 1 sources can be understood in two different ways. In the first scenario, FR 1's are much more efficient at covering jet bulk kinetic energy into radio luminosity than FR 2's, such that an FR 1 has a much lower bolometric AGN luminosity (hence nuclear UV continuum source) than does an FR 2 of the same radio luminosity. We discuss the pros and cons of this model and conclude that the efficiency differences needed between FR 2 and FR 1 radio galaxies are quite large and may lead to difficulties with the interpretation since it would suggest that FR 2 radio source deposit very large amounts of kinetic energy into the ISM Intracluster Medium. However, this interpretation remains viable. Alternatively, it may be that the AGNs in FR 1 sources simply produce far less radiant UV energy than'do those in FR 2 sources. That is, FR 1 sources may funnel a higher fraction of the total energy output from the AGNs into jet kinetic energy versus radiant energy than do FR 2 sources. If this interpretation is correct, then this suggests that there is a fundamental difference in the central engine and/or in the immediate ""accretion region"" around the engine in FR 1 and FR 2 radio galaxies. We note also the absence of FR 1 sources with nuclear broad line regions and suggest that the absence of the BLR is tied to the absence of the ""isotropic"" nuclear UV continuum source in FR 1 sources. We put forth the possibility that the FR 1/FR 2 dichotomy (i.e., the observed differences in the properties of low- and high-power radio sources) is due to qualitative differences in the structural properties of the central engines in these two types of sources. Following early work by Rees et al. (1982), we suggest the possibility that FR 1 sources are produced when the central engine is fed at a lower accretion rate, leading to the creation of a source in which the ratio of radiant to jet bulk kinetic energy is low, while FR 2 sources are produced when the central engine is fed at a higher accretion rate, causing the central engine to deposit a higher fraction of its energy in radiant energy. We further suggest the possibility that associated differences in the spin properties of the central black hole between FR 1 (lower spin) and FR 2 (higher spin) sources may be responsible for the different collimation properties and Mach numbers of the jets produced by these two types of radio-loud galaxies. This scenario, although currently clearly speculative, is nicely consistent with our current picture of the triggering, feeding, environments, and evolution of powerful radio galaxies. This model allows for evolution of these properties with time - for example, the mass accretion rate and BH spin may decline with time causing an FR 2 radio source or quasar to evolve into a FR 1 radio source.","Galaxies: structure; Radiation mechanisms: nonthermal; Radio continuum: galaxies; Ultraviolet: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11944256847

Alston as a petrocrop and renewable source of energy was evaluated. The hexane extract (HE) of the plant was rich in hydrocarbons. The yields of HE from old leaves, roots, flowers and stems were 7.1, 6.2, 4.8 and 3.7% respectively. Methanol extractables (ME) varied from 12.6 to 52.3% and the maximum yield was found in the case of stems. Results obtained through 13C NMR spectral analysis showed an abundance of aliphatic over aromatic hydrocarbons in the biocrude. The hydrocarbon production, i.e. hexane and methanol extraction of T. divaricata was observed to be ∼6.53 barrel/ha/yr and 32.4 barrel/ha/yr average biomass, respectively. The hydrocarbon yield and heat value content of HE and ME of T. divaricata were comparable to other petrocrops, as reported earlier. The spent residue obtained after the recovery of biocrude can be processed to get fermentable sugars and ethanol (a cleaner fuel). The fermentable sugars obtained after biohydrolysis were noticed to be about two folds higher than the value obtained after mild acidic hydrolysis. Present studies have suggested that T. divaricata can be converted to petroleum and ethanol, which can be exploited to produce gasohol fuel. The economics of petrofarming would hinge on the proper management of this renewable energy resource to get value added chemicals and fuels. © 1995.","Biocrude; Petrocrop; Reducing sugars; Solid state fermentation; Tabernaemontana","Crops; Economics; Ethanol; Fermentation; Gasohol; Hydrocarbons; Hydrolysis; Methanol; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Plants (botany); Spectrum analysis; Sugars; Biocrude; Biohydrolysis; Fermentable sugars; Fuel crop; Hexane extract; Methanol extractables; Petrocrops; Petroforming; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029283202

A range of crops grown in on-farm situations during 1986-90 were examined using paired sites to assess the extent of yield decline with time under cropping. The changes in soil chemical characteristics that have occurred during the cropping period were also assessed. All locations showed evidence of a significant reduction in crop growth (50-100%) where continuously cropped sites were compared with sites which had either never been cropped or which had been under grazed grass pasture for >20 years. In the absence of severe late season water deficits, this reduced growth rate was always reflected in lower (21-72%) crop yields at maturity. However, crop dry matter (DM) could interact with crop water use under conditions of late-season water deficit to negate, or even reverse, early growth advantages on previously untilled soil. At least part of the observed yield reduction on continuously cropped soil was due to nutrient deficiencies resulting from depletion of both surface and subsurface reserves during cropping. Long-term cropping has resulted in depletion of soil K and Zn (especially in the subsoil), organic carbon and total N status, and caused significant acidification of both surface and subsoil layers despite the use of lime. The decline in subsoil K status and falling subsoil pH have severe implications for crop performance in dry seasons, when crops rely on subsoil reserves to sustain crop growth. The decline in soil N status has occurred despite a high frequency (>50%) of grain legumes in the crop rotations practised on all farms monitored, and illustrates the small N return from these crops under rainfed conditions. The reduction in soil organic carbon due to cropping was extreme, with continuously cropped areas having organic carbon levels of only 0.9 to 1.5% in the 0-10 cm layer-values which were only 25-40% of levels in untilled soil. Grazed grass leys were only partly successful in restoration of soil organic carbon status. © 1995 CSIRO.

It is well known that, with reference to the conversion efficiency, the most critical period for the catalytic system is the cold-start phase. Several studies recognized in the technical literature showed that, referring to the CARB emission standards, in order to attain the ULEV values, the time required to achieve optimum operating temperature conditions has been decreased. For this reason nowadays remarkable efforts are carrying on in order to reach the light-off condition about 10 to 20 seconds after engine starting during a FTP (Federal Test Procedure). As frequently indicated in technical literature this goal can be reached using a EHC (Electrically Heated Catalyst) system together with secondary air injection in the exhaust manifolds. In the present study a simulation model of EHC and air injection system has been developed in order to compare, starting from the experimental results of a FTP test, the thermal behaviour of this catalytic device configuration during a cold-start period, moreover a comparison with the analogous response of a traditional ceramic converter has been carried out.

Analytical expressions for the kinetic curves Q(t) are derived by solving non-stationary diffusion equations for e-aq and IS. For the IS adsorption Gibbs energy less than -25 kJ mol -1, kinetic curves are exponential over the very wide range of electrode reaction rate constant W, from 1 up to 107 s-1. The dependence Q(t) ∝ t-12 is typical for the case of activated adsorption of IS or their discharge from the non-adsorbed state. Voltammograms of IS generated by pulse radiolysis, modulated photolysis and pulsed or alternating photoemission current are demonstrated to be described by similar expressions. The difference between half-wave and equilibrium potentials depends on the reactant and product lifetimes and rates of desorption. A characteristic trapezoid of Tafel lines is introduced as a new way to characterize completely the kinetics of two-electron electrode reactions. The relations obtained were applied to the analysis of hydrogen evolution reactions and carbon dioxide and formaldehyde reduction, where hydrogen atoms and organic radicals HCO2 and CH2OH adsorbed on a mercury electrode participate as IS. © 1995 Elsevier Science S.A.

The major part of the projects in this theme is focused on the Dutch situation, but the results can be extrapolated countries or regions. The information gained will be used for Dutch policy decisions regarding abatement of greenhouse gases. Section 1 deals with the aim and organization of Causes of climate change, and relates the scope to increased awareness of uncertainties in sources and sinks of greenhouse gases: at the start of the National Research Programme the general consensus of the scientific community was that these uncertainties were not extreme large, it is nowadays accepted that these uncertainties are larger than assumed before. The aim the Cluster CO 2 (Section 2) was devoted to study the exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere to gain more knowledge of the fertilization flux. The research was mainly focused on the development of a CO 2 exchange model for grassland describing diurnal and seasonal fluxes, and on the validation of this local scale model on a regional and national scale. In both the clusters CH 4 and N 2O (respectively Section 3 and Section 4) anthropogenic and biogenic sources were studied. Major criteria to study sources were the source strength, but also the uncertainty in the source estimate and the potential emission reduction, all projected on the Dutch situation. Exception were the projects on CH 4 emission from rice fields, and the sea/air exchange of N 2O in oceans; expertise was available in The Netherlands to carry out these studies. As in the sub-theme CO 2 the study of processes in grasslands was given a high priority in the sub themes CH 4 and N 2O in order to quantify emission the mentioned greenhouse gases. Moreover, in the CH 4-sub theme projects were performed to evaluate and validate the strength of various sources. The two remaining clusters (limited in extend) were aimed at the development of emission databases and geographic quantification of soil processes controlling greenhouse gas fluxes (cluster Database Development, Section 5), and on national inventories (cluster Socio-economic Causes, Section 6). In the framework of the first cluster two databases were developed, one was the World Inventory of Soil Emission potentials (WISE), a global gridded database of the primary soil factors controlling soil greenhouse gas emissions, and the other was Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) aimed to describe the processes as land use, energy consumption etc, which control the emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. The goal of the other sub theme was to develop and apply methodologies to compile national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions in The Netherlands, focused on the compounds CH 4 and N 2O. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957819622

Additional data on the mixing ratios of CO2, O2, N2, CH4 itself and δ13C of the CO2 in the landfill gas were also acquired. Samples taken from several branches of the landfill biogas collection system had methane isotopic compositions in the range δ13C = −62.3 to −55.3‰ VPDB (n = 23) and δD = −327 to −287‰ VSMOW (n = 23). Although the variability of the stable isotope ratios is small, several significant correlations were found between these and the other measured parameters, which provide insight into the microbiological processes occurring within the landfill. Several samples showed evidence of admixture of atmospheric air which occurs when the pumping rate in the collection branch exceeds the local methane production rate. A fraction of the atmospheric oxygen is consumed during the passage through the landfill and CO2 is produced in addition to the CO2 associated with methanogenesis. The consumption of oxygen is correlated with the δ13C and δD of CH4 and the δ13C of CO2. The correlation is consistent with partial bacterial oxidation of CH4 resulting in the progressive enrichment of the remaining CH4 (α(δ13C) = 1.008 ± 0.003 and α(δD) = 1.044 ± 0.020) and in the formation of very depleted CO2. For samples showing no evidence of oxidation, there was a negative correlation between δD and δ13C(CH4)(r = −0.86, n = 14) and between δ13C(CO2) and δ13C(CH4) (r = −0.95, n = 14), which we interpret as originating from slightly varying contributions from the two methanogenic pathways CO2 reduction and acetate fermentation.

However it has been clearly shown that active control of the influx of impurities is essential for a long-burn fusion reactor. Therefore, a single-null pumped divertor has been installed inside the JET vacuum vessel to study impurity control, and it is now operational. It consists of four poloidal coils (manufactured inside the vessel), carbon-fibre composite (CFC) target plates and a toroidal cryo-pump. The new magnetic configuration produces plasma shapes which required a complete redesign of the first wall, including r.f. antennae and limiters. New power supplies were introduced for the divertor coils and for plasma fast vertical position control. Additional cooling systems, a new digital plasma control, a comprehensive machine protection system and new diagnostics to measure plasma parameters in the divertor region were also installed.

The intracellular level of the carrier protein, as well as the level of the AAC2 ‐gene‐specific mRNA, is influenced by the presence or absence of oxygen or of heme, and it is subject to carbon‐source control. In addition, the expression of AAC2 gene requires the products of the HAP2 and HAP3 genes, but not that of the HAP1 gene. The 5′‐flanking region of the gene was isolated, sequenced and fused to the lacZ reporter gene in order to study the effect of carbon sources and of specific deletion mutations on expression of the gene in yeast transformants. The expression of the reporter gene reveals that the AAC2 gene possesses a strong inducible promoter. The promoter analysis, combined with expression studies in the wild‐type as well as in various mutant strains, identified an upstream activation site (UAS) contained within a sequence between −393 bp and −268 bp, and several major initiation sites of AAC2 mRNA between −105 bp and −95 bp. Deletion analysis also shows that the TATA boxes located 45 bp and 104 bp upstream of the 5′‐ends of AAC2 mRNA are not essential for the transcription. The UAS of the AAC2 gene is required for activation by HAP2 and heme and for release from glucose repression. A restriction fragment containing the UAS conferred oxygen and carbon source regulation when placed upstream of another yeast gene encoding ADP/ATP carrier (AAC3), deleted of its regulatory sequences. The UAS of the AAC2 gene contains at least two distinct motifs for DNA‐binding transcriptional activators, including one which is identical with the core HAP2/3/4 binding motif, and a second one with the ABF1 consensus binding sequence. Our results indicate that these sequences mediate the effects of the respective transactivator on the oxygen‐ and carbon‐source‐dependent transcription of the AAC2 gene.

K., and Jefcoate, C. R. (1992) Endocrinology 131, 3067-3076), identified a cDNA clone encoding a partial cytochrome P450 sequence from a rat adrenal cDNA library. Rescreening a second cDNA library yielded several clones up to 5.0 kilobases (kb) encoding a 1629-base pair open reading frame. The deduced amino acid sequence (543 residues) matched completely with five peptides cleaved from P450RAP. The amino acid sequence of P450RAP is 92% identical to a 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-inducible CYP1B1, cloned from mouse C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) embryo fibroblast cells (Savas, Ü., Bhattacharyya, K. K., Christou, M., Alexander, D. L., and Jefcoate, C. R. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14905-14911), which shows nearly the same characteristics in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism. The available 5′-and 3′-noncoding regions show, respectively, 93 and 83% sequence identity. We conclude that P450RAP protein is encoded by a rat CYP1B1 gene orthologous to the mouse CYP1B1 gene. Alignment of rat CYP1B1 amino acid sequences with rat CYP1A1 (39% identical) indicated eight regions of high identity for each (60-78%), interspersed by extensive regions of less than 30% similarity. The CYP1B1 cDNAs hybridize a 5.2-kb mRNA in rat adrenals, consistent with the length of the longest clones and the mRNA recognized in 10T1/2 cells. CYP1B1 mRNA was elevated by a 2-day adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment but much less than CYP11A1 (cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage) mRNA (2-fold versus 4-fold). The lower levels of the 5.2-kb mRNA in other steroidogenic cells (ovary) was consistent with the amount of immunodetectable CYP1B1 protein and, unlike the adrenal, expression in the ovary was stimulated 5-fold by β-naphthoflavone, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, in parallel with CYP1A1 induction. In several other tissues (liver > lung > uterus ≫ kidney), CYP1B1 mRNA and protein were constitutively undetectable but highly induced by β-naphthoflavone, although at much lower levels than CYP1A1.

In the polarizing instrument, the optical path difference is changed simply by rotating a polarizer external to the interferometer. This allows a very simple scanning mechanism, and makes the interferometer very stable against vibration. The PAMI's general behaviour has been modelled in terms of Muller matrices, providing a framework for the analysis of partial polarization states within the Michelson interferometer. A field instrument based on the above concept was designed, built and operated in the field. PAMI is similar to other Michelson interferometers that measure thermospheric winds and temperatures, retaining the benefits of high light throughput, while offering advantages including lower cost, simplicity and portability. PAMI was constructed from readily available components, wherever possible, to facilitate replacement.

A remote sensing program at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) aims to monitor short and medium-term lake volume changes and interpret them in terms of aridity variations, as a measure of regional climate change. The program thus requires the global identification of all potentially closed and climatically sensitive lakes. We review the availability of current global lake (particularly closed lake) information and note its limitations with respect to the requirements of the large lakes study. As a result of this the MSSL Global Lakes Database (MGLD) has been constructed containing locational and lake type information for over 1,400 inland water bodies including, as far as possible, all lakes and reservoirs (but not lagoons), with surface areas ≥ 100km2 (approximately). Of these, the database identifies 857 open lakes (those with outflows), 226 reservoirs, and 320 potentially closed lakes. Approximate areas of the lakes are also noted. The identification of the closed lakes (59% on the Asian continent) is a cornerstone of the remote sensing program which aims to derive lake levels and lake areas using satellite radar altimeters and satellite imaging radiometers respectively. The MGLD therefore also notes the spatial coverage of all large lakes by past and current radar altimeters including that on ERS-1, which overflies almost half of the lakes. With the addition of referenced closed-lake information the MGLD is thus a unique data set which has already been applied to several remote sensing projects. © 1995, International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Rapidly accumulating, physically reworked deltaic sediments characteristic of much of the shelf typically support what appear to be low rates of steady state anaerobic methane oxidation at depths of 5-8 m below the sediment-water interface. Methane oxidation in these cases is responsible for &lt; ∼10% of the ΣCO2 inventory in the oxidation zone and is limited largely by the steady-state diffusive flux of methane into the overlying sulfate reduction zone. In contrast, a large area of the shelf has been extensively eroded, reexposing once deeply buried ( &gt;10 m) methane-charged sediment directly to seawater. In this nonsteady-state situation, methane is a major source of recently produced ΣCO2 and an important reductant for sulfate. These observations suggest that authigenic sedimentary carbonates derived from anaerobic methane oxidation may sometimes reflect physically enhanced nonsteady-state exposure of methane to sulfate in otherwise biogeochemically unreactive deposits. The concentration profiles of CH4, SO 4=, and ΣCO2 in the eroded deposit were reproduced by a coupled reaction-transport model. This area of the shelf was reexposed to seawater approximately 5-10 years ago based on the model results and the assumption that the erosion of the deposit occurred as a single event that has now ceased. The necessary second order rate constant for anaerobic methane oxidation was ≥0.1 mM -1 d -1. © 1995.",,"anaerobic conditions; anaerobic oxidation; carbon dioxide; deltaic sediment; methane; oxidation; sediment/water interface; sedimentation; shelf sedimentation; Atlantic, Amazon Shelf",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029473150

Existing country-specific landfill emissions have been estimated from solid waste statistics and a series of assumptions regarding methane generation and emission rates. There has been no attempt to reconcile the national and global estimates with limited field data on landfill methane emissions which range over six orders of magnitude (Bogner and Scott, 1995). This paper addresses controlled field measurements of methane emissions at sites in Illinois and California (USA) using a closed chamber technique. Overall, observed rates from various controlled monitoring experiments during 1988-1994 ranged from 0.003 to more than 1000 g CH4 m-2 d-1. Rates were related to the presence or absence of gas recovery wells, physical properties of cover soils (texture, moisture, and temperature) relating to their aeration status for diffusional flux, and rates of methane oxidation by indigenous methanotrophs. Surprisingly, at the Illinois site during spring, 1994, the landfill surface was consuming atmospheric methane rather than emitting landfill methane. This was attributed to high capacities for methane oxidation in well-aerated soils which had reduced landfill methane compared to 1993, the result of an effective pumped gas recovery system. Three independent methods confirmed that the landfill cover soils were functioning as a methane sink: (a) static closed chamber measurements yielding negative flux rates (uptake of atmospheric methane); (b) rates of methane oxidation similar to chamber results from in vitro field incubation studies using ambient methane; and (c) a reversal in the soil gas methane concentration gradient at the 25 cm depth. Field verification of landfill cover soils functioning as methane sinks has profound implications for revision of landfill contributions to global methane budgets; furthermore, it should be feasible to develop mitigation strategies incorporating a combination of engineered and natural methanotrophic controls. © 1995.",,"methane; aeration; article; atmospheric dispersion; controlled study; landfill; methanotrophic bacterium; oxidation; soil; solid waste management; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms); closed chamber method; landfill site; measurement; methane emission; methane sink; USA, California; USA, Illinois",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028970578

The topographic characteristics of the area under study influence local breezes. The study of the local breezes regime has been carried out using a vectorial model. The determination of meteorological parameters has been of great importance in examining the relationship with the concentration of SO2 and particulate matter. A decrease in particulate matter and SO2 pollution has been noted during the winter months as a result of stronger winds. An increase was noted when the wind direction was between 180° and 270° during the winter period and between 135° and 270° during the summer months, at all the stations where samples were taken. On the other hand, during the winter when temperatures rise, a decrease in the concentration of SO2 and particulate matter can be seen, whereas no such correlation can be seen for the summer months. The existence of a seasonal cycle was noted, more obviously in the case for particulate matter than for SO2 pollution. This could be due to the characteristic sea breezes which operate in this area. © 1995.","Castellón, Spain; Particulate matter pollution; SO2 pollution; Vectorial model, wind","sulfur dioxide; air pollution; article; environmental temperature; meteorology; model; particulate matter; priority journal; season; spain; summer; urban area; wind; winter; local wind field; particulate pollution; sulphur dioxide; Spain, Valencia, Castellon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028971868

The frequencies of the combination modes of copper(I) carbonyls, e.g. fundamental C=O bond stretching vibrations plus M-C stretching or ∠ MCO bending vibrations, were found to be much more sensitive to the composition and structure of Cu+-CO complexes than those of the fundamental stretching vibrations of C=O bonds. Their analysis proved the formation of polycarbonylic species Cu+(CO)x(x ≥ 2) at room temperature and CO pressures of several kPa. These species, after removal of gaseous CO, were reversibly transformed into the thermally stable monocarbonyls. This finding prompted reconsideration of the literature data on the composition, structure and localisation of Cu+ carbonyls in Y zeolite. It was concluded that: (1) the reduction by CO of the Cu2+ ions to Cu+ proceeds without dealumination of the zeolite framework and creation of true Lewis acidic sites. (2) During adsorption of CO, Cu+ ions migrate from the sodalite cages into the supercages of the zeolite. (3) In the presence of gaseous CO the mean stoichiometry of Cu+ carbonyls differs from 1 CO molecule per 1 Cu+ cation. (4) A significant fraction of Cu+ ions is located in cationic positions, perhaps at SI′ and SI sites, inaccessible to adsorbed CO molecules even at high CO pressures.

New Zealand, in particular, relies on voluntary agreements and planting of trees. Is this approach consistent with the Convention?",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883897405

The motilin 1–12 fragment displays biological effects similar to the native peptide. Selective reduction of the amide carbonyl groups to form CH2NH analogs leads to a significant reduction in activity for the first two N‐terminal positions and to a complete loss of activity for all other positions. The structures of motilin 1–12 and ten reduced analogs were investigated using the temperature dependence of the amide NH chemical shifts. In all the analogs, the structure of the N‐terminal region (residues 1–5) was different from the structure of motilin 1–12, which is characterized by hydrogen bonding between Phe1 and Ile4. The structure of the C‐terminal region of analogs was similar to the structure of moth 1–12 for the first two reduction positions only (1–2 and 2–3), indicating that the C‐terminal portion of motilin 1–12 is more critical for biological activity. Complete structural characterizations of motilin 1–12, [CH2NH]1–2, and [CH2NH]4–5‐motilin 1–12 were performed by two‐dimensional NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. The structural features observed confirm the differences based on the temperature dependence of the amide NH chemical shifts. These results demonstrate that conservation of the amide bond rigidity is essential for the activity of non‐hydrolyzable analogs. © Munksgaard 1995. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

The surface is based on a many-body expansion wherein fragment potentials for the species N2H, HNO, and N2O are incorporated, using either previously developed potentials, or in the case of N2O, a newly developed potential. The three-body parts of these fragment potentials are damped in the four-body region to provide a zeroth order four-body surface, and then additional four-body terms and mapping transformations are applied to make the final four-body potential match the results of ab initio calculations for eight important HNNO stationary points (minima and saddle points) and for several reaction paths. In addition to this ""best fit"" surface (surface I), a second surface (surface II) is developed in which the ordering of the saddle points leading to formation of H+N2O and OH+N2 is reversed, and the energy release during 1,3 hydrogen migration is modified so that the N-N stretch experiences smaller distortions from N2 equilibrium during the reaction leading to OH+N2. Quasiclassical trajectory results on surface I show generally good correspondence with experiment, with a branching fraction of 13±3% for the formation of OH+N2 at 300 K, and relatively low OH and N 2 vibration/rotation excitation. The results on surface II are similar with respect to both branching and energy partitioning, indicating relatively weak sensitivity of the results of key features of the surface. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001276576

In this paper, these conservation constraints are generalized; a Rule of Mixtures is developed that relates the inverse redox ratio of the gas at the ZrO2 sensor switch point (Rs′) to a weighted average of the corresponding switch points for individual oxygen/gas-component mixtures (Rsjo′): where j denotes a specific reductant species, zj is the stoichiometric factor of the j species for complete oxidation, pjâ̂ž is the partial pressure of gas species j in the mixture, and Δ is a well defined property of the O2 and NO oxidizing gases and the sensor electrodes. Within this paper, data is accumulated from the literature to extend this Rule of Mixtures to gas compositions appropriate to automotive exhaust (including N2, O2, NO, CO, H2, C3H6, C3H8, CH4 and/or CHy where y is the average hydrogen-to-carbon ratio for a mixture of hydrocarbons). The Rule is validated by laboratory experiments on simple gas systems and then applied to predict sensor response in several different contexts. It is shown that the Rule of Mixtures can be useful in investigating sensor response to different fuels and in assessing sensor behavior when exposed to different exhaust compositions derived from the same fuel but different engines, engine operating conditions or sensor locations. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Conservation; Engines; Gas mixtures; Oxygen sensors; Zirconia; Complete oxidation; Engine operating conditions; Exhaust gas oxygen sensors; Hydrogen-to-carbon ratio; Laboratory experiments; Mixture of hydrocarbons; Steady-state modeling; Stoichiometric factors; Gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072427174

It uses the local-density-approximation value for the Fermi energy to obtain the Heisenberg uncertainty distance, equates this distance to the distance from the surface at which the image force begins to act, and further assumes that the image force acts as if it were done to an isolated conducting sphere of the same radius as that of the atoms of which the surface is composed. The importance of this result is that it gives a clear physical picture of the emission process that takes into account the microscopic surface structure, and lends credence to the concept of continuous decoherence from quantum to classical states. Variation of work function between crystal faces is plausibly shown to be mainly due to variation with direction of the effective mass of an electron with the Fermi energy inside the crystal. Work functions of optimum electropositive monolayer adsorbates on refractory metal substrates calculated by this method also agree closely with experiment, indicating that the electrons are emitted from exposed substrate atoms. A model for the topological structure of a crystal surface on an atomic scale is proposed for which classical methods indicate that the field at the tips of the atoms is typically 2.5 times that estimated on the basis that the surface is a smooth plane. The consequential effect on thermionic and field emission is discussed.

The objectives of this study were to characterize the distribution of pacemakers within the right atrium and to determine the relationship of pacemaker action potentials to sites of earliest surface activation as well as to local extracellular electrograms. The right atria of six adult mongrel dogs were rapidly excised under deep pentobarbital sodium anesthesia and perfused with 95% O2-5% CO2 Krebs-Henseleit solution. Action potentials from the epicardial surface were recorded throughout the region bounded by the crista terminalis laterally and the atrial septum medially. Simultaneously, unipolar extracellular electrograms were recorded from 250 endocardial sites. The earliest pacemakers preceded the earliest electrogram by 63 ± 84 ms; the latest pacemakers followed the earliest electrogram by 71 ± 40 ms. Primary negativity in the extracellular electrogram did not predict the site of the earliest or dominant pace maker and in some cases was associated with the latest pace makers. We conclude that primary negativity and/or the sites of earliest activation reflect the point at which the impulse engages atrial myocardium, not the site of earliest pacemaker activity. As such, early extracellular activation appears to represent sites of exit from a relatively insulated sinus node.","atrial activation; sinus node","animal experiment; article; dog; heart atrium contraction; heart atrium pacemaker; heart muscle potential; nonhuman; priority journal; sinoatrial conduction; sinus node; sinus rhythm",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029144338

In this paper, precipitation chemistry observations between 1979 and 1990 collected by three different daily/event monitoring networks are combined to study the behaviour of this episodicity in eastern North America. The two main factors examined are (1) the spatial pattern in episodicity and its relationship to emissions and mean concentrations and (2) the temporal pattern in episodicity and episode days (events with large depositions) and their influence on annual depositions. On average, ammonium, sulphate and hydronium depositions are found to be the most episodic with 30% of the deposition between 1985 and 1989 coming from 4.5, 5.1 and 5.3% of the events, respectively. Nitrate is the least episodic with 6.9% of the events contributing 30% of the deposition, which is very similar to the episodicity of precipitation. Variability in episodicity among sites is found to exhibit a spatial pattern with more episodic sites located farther from the main pollutant source regions. This leads to relationships between mean pollutant concentration and episodicity across sites since concentrations tend to be lower at sites farther from the sources. There is also a greater de-coupling of precipitation and deposition episodes at sites farther from the main pollutant source regions (i.e. at sites with lower mean concentrations), with deposition episode days contributing a greater percentage of the total precipitation amount at sites with higher mean concentrations and vice versa. Annual wet deposition totals of H+ and SO42- tend to be larger in years with a greater frequency of episode days (frequency is defined as the number of episode days in a year divided by the total number of episode days during a site's operation). This suggests, assuming that the occurrence of episodes depends mainly on meteorology, that decreases in annual deposition amounts due to future emission reductions could be offset by increases in the frequency of meteorological conditions conducive to episodes. © 1995.","acidic deposition; Acidic precipitation; deposition episodes; emission controls; episodicity; precipitation chemistry","Deposition; Precipitation; ammonia; sulfate; acid rain; air monitoring; air pollution; article; meteorology; north america; periodicity; priority journal; deposition; pollution; precipitation chemistry; wet deposition; Canada, (East)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028989508

Variable temperature electronic absorption (including single crystal polarized and orientationally averaged), variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and variable temperature resonance Raman spectroscopies have been used to assign all of the spectral features present in these complexes. These spectral studies are complemented by both high spin and broken symmetry SCF-Xα-SW calculations. Together, a description of the highly covalent bonding in these complexes has been generated. The unique UV/vis absorption spectra of the Fe-oxo dimer unit is dominated by low energy intense oxo → Fe3+ ligand to metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions. These transitions appear at much lower energy than expected due to the presence of very large excited-state antiferromagnetic exchange in the LMCT transitions from the bridging oxo group. The different spin components of these oxo LMCT transitions can be identified from their large temperature dependence exhibited in the different spectroscopies listed above. The observed excited state splittings have been analyzed using a recently developed valence bond configuration interaction (VBCI) model to describe this bridging-ligand charge-transfer excited-state antiferromagnetism and probe specific superexchange pathways in the ground and excited states. This VBCI model indicates an inverted charge-transfer ordering scheme with the in the Fe(III)-O-Fe(III) plane π CT transition lowest in energy. The low energy of these transitions and the high covalency of the Fe(III)-O-Fe(III) bond are also sources of the higher intensity of the ligand field transitions relative to those of monomelic Fe3+ complexes. The ligand field excited-state splitting for the 6A1 → 4A1 transition, which is ferromagnetic, is analyzed using the Tanabe model of exchange and demonstrates the importance of a mixed π/σ (Fe dyz - Fe dz2) magnetic exchange pathway. The nature of the Fe-oxo bond in the Fe(III)-O-Fe(III) unit is analyzed and its strength is mainly due to strong σ bonding interactions of the oxo pz orbital with the 4s and 4p orbitais of the iron. The high stability of the μ-oxo iron dimer bond provides significant insight into differences in the O2 reactivity among the different binuclear non-heme proteins hemerythrin, methane monooxygenase, and ribonucleotide reductase. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

The monitoring systems to be used on California low-emission vehicles will be unable to detect the small extra amount of loss in catalyst effectiveness that might be caused by higher sulfur levels outside of California. Testing of a mocked-up ultra low-emission vehicle (ULEV) conducted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) confirms that on-board monitoring systems are not tripped even by high sulfur levels (800 ppm). An independent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessment also agrees that ""false tripping"" of monitoring systems of the California cars is not expected to be a problem either for California cars operated temporarily outside of California or for California-type cars sold in other states. However, future evolutions of the provisions in the monitoring regulation and in the technology of catalysts and monitoring systems might affect these conclusions somewhat, especially for cars meeting ULEV standards. The regulatory provisions and the hardware capabilities must continue to be matched, as they are at present, to avoid the potential for ""false tripping"" of the catalyst monitor. In general, the issue of sulfur levels should be regarded more broadly than one of false tripping of on-board monitoring systems. Fuel suppliers, automakers, and regulatory agencies need to work together to balance catalyst costs and fuel costs, and to arrive at approaches that deliver the emissions reductions needed to meet air quality objectives in the most cost efficient manner. The optimization should consider catalyst system costs, performance and costs of on-board monitoring systems and inspection and maintenance (I&M) programs, and costs of gasoline. At present, on-board diagnostic (OBD) tripping does not appear to be the most important factor affecting the balance. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air quality; Catalysts; Costs; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuel additives; Gasoline; Sulfur; California Air Resources Board; Inspection and maintenance; Low emission vehicles; Monitoring regulations; On board diagnostics; On-board monitoring systems; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Ultra Low Emission Vehicles; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072431215

In a Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) human wastes and inedible biomass will represent significant sources of secondary raw materials necessary for support of crop plant production (carbon, water, and inorganic plant nutrients). Incineration, pyrolysis, and water extraction have been investigated as candidate processes for recovery of these important resources from inedible biomass in a CELSS. During incineration CO2 is produced by oxidation of the organic components and this product can be directly utilized by plants. Water is concomitantly produced, requiring only a phase change for recovery. Recovery of inorganics is more difficult, requiring solubilization of the incinerator ash. The process of incineration followed by water solubilization of ash resulted in loss of 35% of the inorganics originally present in the biomass. Losses were attributed to volatilization (8%) and non-water-soluble ash (27%). All of the ash remaining following incineration could be solubilized with acid, with losses resulting from volatilization only. The recovery for individual elements varied. Elemental retention in the ash ranged from 100% of that present in the biomass for Ca, P, Mg, Na, and Si to 10% for Zn. The greatest water solubility was observed for potassium with recovery of approximately 77% of that present in the straw. Potassium represented 80% of the inorganic constituents in the wheat straw, and because of slightly greater solubility made up 86% of the water-soluble ash. Following incineration of inedible biomass from wheat, 65% of the inorganics originally present in the straw were recovered by water solubilization and 92% recovered by acid solubilization. Recovery of resources is more complex for pyrolysis and water extraction. Recovery of carbon, a resource of greater mass than the inorganic component of biomass, is more difficult following pyrolysis and water extraction of biomass. In both cases, additional processors would be required to provide products equivalent to those resulting from incineration alone. The carbon, water, and inorganic resources of inedible biomass are effectively separated and output in usable forms through incineration.",,"element; potassium; water; article; biomass; chemistry; comparative study; crop; government; growth, development and aging; human; incineration; methodology; microclimate; NASA Center ARC; NASA Discipline Life Support Systems; NASA Discipline Number 61-10; NASA Program CELSS; solubility; standard; United States; waste management; wheat; NASA Center ARC; NASA Discipline Life Support Systems; NASA Discipline Number 61-10; NASA Program CELSS; Biomass; Crops, Agricultural; Ecological Systems, Closed; Elements; Humans; Incineration; Life Support Systems; Potassium; Solubility; Triticum; United States; United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Waste Management; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029258251

While nitrogen deposition may cause acidification and excess nutrient effects, the former were considered previously in studies of sulphur deposition. In the UK, work on developing nutrient nitrogen critical loads maps has used several methods and databases. Two approaches are described here, one a steady state calculation using a nitrogen saturation limit for soil systems, the other an empirical estimate of critical loads set to prevent changes to vegetation communities. The empirical method uses national species records and land cover data derived from satellite imagery. Maps drawn from the available data are dependent upon a number of factors which reflect the approach used. To apply the nutrient critical loads to a strategy for future abatement measures, the nutrient nitrogen values for soils have been incorporated within a ""critical loads function"" which takes into account both acidity and nutrient effects as related to deposition loads for sulphur and nitrogen. This function may be used with deposition data to identify the need for sulphur and nitrogen emission reductions. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","abatement strategies; critical loads; Nitrogen deposition; soils; vegetation","Acidification; Critical loads; Great Britain; Nitrogen deposition; Vegetation; Air pollution control; Calculations; Database systems; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Geographical regions; Mapping; Nitrogen; Numerical methods; pH; Soils; Sulfur; Soil pollution; nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; conference paper; methodology; nutrient; soil pollution; united kingdom; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029635817

It has gained acceptance from many scientists and policy makers, bridging the gap between science and policy and proving its use with the acidifying effects of the atmospheric pollutants of sulphur and nitrogen. For this there are examples at local, national and international scales and there appears to be scope for further applications as methods and databases improve. The UN/ECE used the approach to underpin the second Sulphur Protocol; for this, emission reductions were recommended on the basis of environmental effects as well as the costs of control measures. Although limited by a relatively coarse transport modelling scale, the advantages over non-effect-orientated approaches were evident. At a more local scale, the approach has often lacked information linking some of the chemical effects on soils and freshwaters to harmful effects to biota. In addition, the important consideration of rates of change, in particular recovery, of ecosystems with changing pollutant loads has still to be addressed nationally and internationally. The critical loads approach is a first step towards effects orientated pollution control. Already sophisticated methods, based upon similar dose-response data, are being developed; these lend themselves better to economic evaluation of damage. Despite limitations, the critical loads approach has proved a practical method for deriving pollution control strategies whose success will be judged in the years ahead. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Critical loads; pollution control; sulphur","critical load; emission reduction; pollution control; sulphur protocol; Acid deposition; Critical loads; Acids; Air pollution; Costs; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Mathematical models; Nitrogen; Public policy; Soil pollution; Sulfur; Water pollution; Pollution control; nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; air pollution; conference paper; europe; pollution control; soil pollution; united kingdom; water pollution; cellular organisms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029416005

Being the primary element of a trophic chain, PSO play a significant role in the functioning of an ecological system, because they provide an inflow of oxygen into water and the atmosphere and regulate the carbon-dioxide content. Sometimes it is principally necessary to use remote quick-response techniques. In this paper we consider spectroscopic methods that imply an analysis of the optical characteristics of the objects under study and are most convenient in remote regime. Remote methods can be divided into passive and active ones. Passive methods require comparatively simple equipment and, hence, are cheap. They can be used from an aircraft or a satellite providing thus an ability of monitoring large areas. However, results obtained from the Earth's surface albedo can be used only for rough estimations and, as a rule, require calibration on specially selected polygons. Active methods based on exciting and detecting a fluorescent response from the object, are free of these drawbacks.

From the available evidence it appears that the heterolytic mechanism, with the extraction of a proton, is the most likely process on oxide catalysts and this may also apply to metallic catalysts under typical (oxidising) reaction conditions. However, the state of oxidation of a metallic surface under reaction conditions is complex and the degree of oxidation will depend on the metal, the temperature, the oxygen partial pressure, the metal particle size, the support and the choice of hydrocarbon. The importance of coadsorbates in facilitating the dissociative adsorption of saturated hydrocarbons seems to be well established and could explain the unusual enhancement of activity observed for the oxidation of some saturated hydrocarbons when inorganic gases, such as SO2, are added to the reaction mixture. The inhibition by products of the oxidation reaction (CO2 and H2O) can be quite severe, but H2O has by far the greatest effect. This is interpreted in terms of an equilibrium involving the formation of surface hydroxide ions which are considered to be inactive for activation of CH bonds. As a consequence, it is possible, especially at low temperatures, that the rate determining step in CH bond activation could be the regeneration of the active sites, through desorption of H2O, rather than CH bond activation as is commonly assumed. The activation of CH bonds by NO2 is addressed in the context of selective reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons on various types of oxide catalyst and possible similarities with the promotion of the CH bond activation process by SO2 are discussed. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002263863

A significant portion of the total pollutants emitted to the atmosphere by motor vehicles occurs immediately following the startup of the engine when the engine block and exhaust manifold are cold, and the catalytic converter has not yet reached high conversion efficiencies. To meet these stringent, mandated emission levels, new technologies must be created that attack these “cold start” pollutants. One intriguing strategy for handling cold start emissions employs hydrocarbon adsorbers. The sorber scavenges and withholds hydrocarbons from the exhaust gas until the catalyst becomes active, then the hydrocarbons are released and burned on the catalyst. Recent advances in materials technology have uncovered non-carbon-based sorbent alternatives to the classic carbon-based beds. These solids also trap via a physical interaction between the hydrocarbons and the scavenging constituent, but display better thermal stability, especially in the presence of oxygen. To take advantage of these new hydrocarbon scavenging constituents, an auto exhaust system known as the Low Hydrocarbon Emissions System (LHES) composed of a catalyzed heat exchanger and hydrocarbon trap has been designed and tested. The system was custom fitted onto several 1993 vehicles with a variety of engine management strategies. In each case U.S. FTP 75 total hydrocarbon emissions were reduced between 45–75% versus the vehicle's stock exhaust system. The LHES system also proved resistant to an accelerated thermal aging that was equivalent to 50,000 miles. A deactivation factor for all pollutants of 1.0 was calculated for the LHES following a 75 hr engine test bed aging with the heat exchanger inlet gas temperature set at 760°C. © 1995, Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001507941

This instrument has the advantage that the mapping field at this wavelength is about 2.5° wide. However, it has also the severe disadvantage that with only 12 hours to record each image, the brightness distribution is severely undersampled. This difficulty, along with solar rotation and declination motion during each observation, required development of special image correction procedures. The two observing sessions spanned about 25% of the activity range over a solar cycle. Over this range, comparable contributions to the slowly-varying component came from active region sources and a weak emission, widely-distributed over the solar disk.

A change from HEPES to HCO3--buffered superfusate induced an immediate decrease in pH(i) and DT followed by a recovery in which pH(i) and DT stabilized at values slightly higher than in HEPES buffer. Introduction of HCO3- hyperpolarized V(m) by 8 ± 2.3 mV (P &lt; 0.05). SITS (0.1mM) completely abolished the hyperpolarization and attenuated the recovery of both pH(i) and DT. Under steady-state conditions in HCO3- buffered media, SITS induced a depolarization compatible with the suppression of the entry of negative charges. Depolarization by high K(o)+ (45 mM) elicited a rise in pH(i) of 0.07 ± 0.02 (P &lt; 0.05), that was reversed by returning K(o)+ to normal. The depolarization-induced rise in pH(i) proved to be Na+-dependent, SITS sensitive and still occurred after EIPA (μM) blockade. All the evidence strongly supports the existence of an electrogenic Na+/HCO3- cotransport mechanism that participates in the regulation of myocardial pH(i). At pH(i) of 6.94 this mechanism seems to contribute almost equally to the Na+/H+ exchanger to pH(i) regulation. However, acid equivalent extrusion is potentiated when both the Na+/H+ exchanger and the HCO3--dependent mechanism are simultaneously regulating pH(i).","BCECF; EIPA; Intracellular pH; Myocardium; Na+/HCO(*)--cotransport; pH(i) recovery; Resting membrane potential; SITS","4 (2 hydroxyethyl) 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid; 4 acetamido 4' isothiocyanatostilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid; bicarbonate; carboxyfluorescein; potassium ion; sodium ion; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cat; cell pH; controlled study; depolarization; heart muscle cell; heart papillary muscle; hyperpolarization; ion transport; membrane steady potential; microelectrode; nonhuman; priority journal; proton sodium exchange; Animalia; Felis catus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028949414

The engine construction permits illumination of the sprays by a thin sheet of laser light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser frequency tripled to operate at the ultraviolet wavelength of 355 nm. The liquid fuel was decane with TMPD-naphthalene dopant dispersed in it. Upon ultraviolet excitation by the pulsed laser, liquid fuel regions fluoresced with a spectrum centered at the wavelength of 380 nm, while vapor regions fluoresced with a spectrum centered at 470 nm. This approach, called Exciplex technique, was applied to permit simultaneous acquisition of the liquid and vapor fuel regions in the cup-in-head geometry of the combustion chamber. The results from limited conditions suggest that existence of the pilot injection affects the chamber flow field, particularly in the near-wall region, in such a way that less liquid fuel accumulation occurs with pilot injection scheme thus should reduce hydrocarbon emission. The area spreading rate of both vapor and liquid phases within the visualization plane were linear in early stages with former having a higher rate. Close to the impingement time, vapor phase area penetration is reduced to near zero while liquid continues linearly but at slower rate than its initial value. Both air utilization and evaporization are therefore reduced. Also, based on this and works by others, suggestion is made that to achieve optimum simultaneous reduction in soot and NOx, the timing between the pilot and main injections (dwell) should be chosen with due considerations of the interaction between the swirl flow and pilot spray and the relative magnitudes of the ignition delay period with respect to the dwell. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Combustion chambers; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engine cylinders; Flight control systems; Image acquisition; Laser excitation; Liquid fuels; Naphthalene; Neodymium lasers; Pulsed lasers; Ultraviolet lasers; Yttrium aluminum garnet; Compression ignition; Dual injection system; Liquid- and vapor phase; Simultaneous acquisition; Simultaneous reduction; Two dimensional images; Ultra violet excitation; Ultraviolet wavelength; Liquids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072444890

As such, emissions of methane (CH4) from China are of interest in understanding the global CH4 budget. Using a simplified process-based methane emission model and a georeferenced database, CH4 emission rates from 329 defined agricultural zones in China, where rice production occurred, were estimated in this study. The calculated daily CH4 emission rates ranged from 0.12 g m-2 to 0.70 g m-2 with an average value of 0.44 g m-2. The annual CH4 emissions varied between 25 g m-2 and 80 g m-2. On average across the whole rice growing area in China, 59.9 g m-2 CH4 was released annually. Total CH4 emission was 16.2 Tg year-1 (1 Tg = 1012 g).

The extrapolation of CH4 release rates from point measurements to regional level or empirically correlating methane emission rates with a few factors (e.g., temperature and rice primary production) is unlikely to yield reliable results. Reducing the uncertainties in estimates of current CH4 emission and predicting its future change require a process model to simulate CH4 emissions from various paddyland environments. CH4 emission is an ecosystem process closely coupled to plant growth and soil organic matter decomposition. In this study a methane emission model was developed based on supplies of carbon substrate for methanogens by rice primary production and soil organic matter degradation, direct environmental controls on methanogenesis, and the balance between CH4 production and consumption by methanotrophic oxidation. A validation of the model indicated its reasonable ability to calculate CH4 emission rates and their seasonal variations. The model, when coupled with supporting data sets, would complement spatial and dynamic analysis of CH4 emissions from rice paddies in the framework of climate‐plant‐soil interactions.

The model is formulated following the concept of Relative Incremental Reactivity (RIR) developed by Carter and Atkinson. In the OBM, however, observed concentrations rather than emission inventories are used to drive the photochemical simulations and thereby ensure that the calculations are carried out for the proper mix of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. From these calculations, a series of sensitivity factors, or RIRs, are inferred that can be used to (1) determine whether reducing emissions of nitrogen oxide or emissions of hydrocarbons would be most effective in abating ozone in a given urban area, and (2) identify the most critical subset of hydrocarbons present in an urban atmosphere causing ozone exceedances. Because the OBM is relatively easy and inexpensive to operate and makes use of data that are increasingly available, it can be used to analyze a wide array of ozone episodes and, thus, could prove to be a relatively cost-effective tool for the analysis of ozone precursor relationships in an urban atmosphere. On the other hand, because the OBM is diagnostic rather than prognostic, it cannot be used in a predictive mode to estimate exactly how much emission reduction is needed to reduce ozone concentrations. For this reason, the OBM should be viewed as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, more sophisticated gridded, emission-based models. To illustrate the characteristics of the OBM and to demonstrate its applicability, we first compare the results of the OBM to those obtained from a series of simulations of the Atlanta metropolitan area using the Urban Airshed Model (UAM), a three-dimensional Eulerian grid model. The OBM is then used to analyze a dataset obtained from the 1990 Atlanta Ozone Study, an EPA field sampling program conducted during the summer of 1990. Because of limitations and potential flaws in the 1990 Atlanta dataset, the results of this OBM analysis are largely illustrative rather than definitive. Nevertheless, a few important issues are elucidated by the analysis. These include (1) the importance of accounting for biogenic hydrocarbons produced from urban vegetation; (2) the potential flaw in using early-morning VOC-to-NOx ratios to infer whether ozone production is limited by VOC or NOx; (3) the critical need for high-sensitivity nitrogen oxide measurements to quantify the sub-ppbv concentrations of NO during the afternoon hours; and (4) the need to consider a number of individual ozone episodes in studying an urban atmosphere because of the possibility that the degree of VOC- and NOx-limitation may vary from one episode to another. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollution; article; cost effectiveness analysis; observation; ozone layer; photochemistry; priority journal; sunlight; troposphere; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028820181

They include national regulations. provincial and regional fish health protection initiatives, and control of potential hazards related to use of live fish for research, manufacture of feeds, importation and production of biologics, and use of drugs and therapeutics. A strengthened research and development capability supported technological innovation and provided the basis for refining regulations and policies. Programs for training and skill development in the prevention, control, and treatment of fish diseases were also expanded. This integrated strategy created a favorable climate for major investments in salmonid farming and its allied industries. It was considered effective in preventing the introduction of some pathogens as yet unrecorded in Canada and in confining pathogens known to occur in Canada within limited geographic distributions.

Studies were conducted at three different pH levels‐corresponding to the zwitterionic peptide containing a formal positive charge(pH 3. 1).the deprotonated molecule(pH 9. 1), and a situation at neutral pH(pH 7. 2) involving both protonated and deprotonated states of the reduced peptide bond. Analysis of the one‐dimensional1H‐nmr spectra reveals that in solution TIP[Ψ]is in slow dynamic exchange between conformations containing cis and trans configurations of the Tyr‐Tic bond. An nmr pH dependence study of the cis:trans ratio indicated that the exchange process was governed by the protonation state of the reduced bond amine. From the nmr data, reduced peptide bond pKavalues of 6. 5 and 7. 5 were determined for the cis and trans conformers, respectively. It was concluded that conformations containing a trans Tyr‐Tic bond are stabilized at law pH by an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the Tyr carbonyl and the reduced peptide bond protonated amine. This observation was corroborated by molecular mechanics investigations that revealed low energy trans structures compatible with nmr structural data, and furthermore, were consistently characterized by the existence of a strong N+ HO C interaction closing a seven‐membered cycle. The dynamics of cis‐trans isomerization about the Tyr‐Tic peptide bond were probed by nmr exchange experiments. The selective presaturation of exchanging resonances carried out at several temperatures between 50 and 70°C allowed the determination of isomerization rate constants as well as thermodynamic activation parameters. ΔG≠ values were in close agreement with the cis → trans energy barrier found in X‐Pro peptide fragments (∼83 kJ/mol).A large entropic barrier determined for the trans → cis conversion of TIP[Ψ](5. 7 JK−1 mol−1 at pH 3. 1; 6. 5 JK−1 mol−1 at pH 9. 1) is discussed in terms of decreased solvent molecular ordering around the conformers possessing a trans Tyr‐Tic bond. Evidence that the neutral form of the reduced peptide bond gains rigidity upon protonation was obtained from relaxation measurements in the rotating frame. TJp measurements of several protons in the vicinity of the reduced peptide bond were made as a function of spin‐lock field. Quantitative analysis of the relaxation data indicated that chemical shift fluctuations in the 10−4‐10−5s range were more pronounced in the case of deprotonated TIP[Ψ].

Our central hypothesis concerning the aetiology of pith autolysis states that the carbon from the pith is transported to the growth regions of the plant and used at times when the plant cannot meet its carbon needs by photosynthesis alone. According to this hypothesis, accelerated growth should increase pith autolysis. We here provide supporting evidence for the central hypothesis. More pith autolysis was found in faster growing tomato varieties than in dwarf varieties. More pith autolysis was found in both beans and tomatoes treated with GA3 than in controls. More pith autolysis was found in leggy bean plants grown in low light than in normal plants grown under normal light conditions. Pith autolysis decreased in both beans and tomatoes when mechanically perturbed or sprayed with paclobutrazol, both treatments that reduced growth. The stems of buckwheat plants that were flowering showed greater pith autolysis and therefore were more hollow than plants which were not flowering or which had the incipient flowers pinched off. This indicated that carbon from the storage pith may also be used in the formation of reproductive structures which require extra carbon. Also in support of the central hypothesis is the prevention of pith autolysis by the addition of extra carbon to the plant, in the form of an increased CO2 concentration of the surrounding air. © 1995 Annals of Botany Company.","Bean; Buckwheat; CO2; GA; Packobutrazol; Pith autolysis; Thigmomorphogenesis; Tomato",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342919135

Test variables were kiln temperature, ranging from 538 °C to 927 °C; waste feed chlorine content, ranging from 0% to 3.4%; and scrubber pressure drop, ranging from 8.2 kPa to 16.9 kPa. Mercury was among the six hazardous constituent trace metals fed to the IRF’s pilotscale rotary kiln incineration system as part of a synthetic waste feed. This paper focuses on the test results solely with respect to mercury. As expected, mercury behaved as a very volatile metal throughout the tests; it was not detected in any kiln ash samples. Scrubber collection efficiency for mercury ranged from 67% to >99%, averaging 87%; this was somewhat lower than expected and may be attributable to low scrubber loadings. The ability to collect and analyze representative scrubber water samples appears to have been affected by the waste feed chlorine content; detection of mercury at higher concentrations during high waste-chlorine-content tests is thought to be largely the result of the formation of mercuric chloride, a more water-soluble species, during those tests. As a result, no firm conclusions may be drawn regarding the true impact of waste feed chlorine content on mercury partitioning to the scrubber water. As expected, no significant relationship was observed between kiln exit-gas temperature and mercury partitioning, nor was there a significant relationship with scrubber pressure drop. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Air pollution control; Chlorine; Hazardous materials; Mercury (metal); Pressure drop; Refuse incinerators; Scrubbers; Thermal effects; Mercury emissions; Mercury partitioning; Rotary kiln incinerator; Particulate emissions; mercury; air pollution; air pollution control; article; combustion; hazardous waste; incineration; priority journal; scrubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047700126

The mechanisms underlying the exercise hyperpnoea have been difficult to define. Recently it has been suggested that exercise ventilation (VE) changes in proportion to changes in arterial potassium concentration ([K+]a). Similar VE and [K+]a time courses following work rate changes have been cited as supporting evidence. This study compared [K+]a and VE dynamics during moderate exercise in man. 2. We observed VE and gas exchange responses in five healthy men to sinusoidal work rate variation between 25 and approximately 105 W. Tests of approximately 30 min duration were performed at sinusoidal periods of 9, 6 and 3 min and in the steady state. In each test, during two or three sine periods, arterial blood was sampled (24 per test) and analysed for [K+] and blood gases. Response amplitude and phase (relative to work rate) were determined for each variable. 3. [K+]a fluctuated in response to sinusoidal work rate forcing with mean‐to‐peak amplitude averaging 0.15 mmol 1(‐1). However, among tests, VE amplitude and phase were not highly correlated with [K+]a (r = 0.36 and 0.67, respectively). Further, average [K+]a amplitude in the 9 and 6 min sinusoidal studies tended to exceed the steady‐state amplitude, while average VE amplitude fell progressively with increasing forcing frequency. The dissimilar dynamics of [K+]a and VE seem inconsistent with a major role for [K+]a as a proportional controller of ventilation during non‐steady state moderate exercise in man. 4. Among tests, VE and CO2 output (VCO2) amplitude and phase were closely correlated (r = 0.87 and 0.94, respectively). Further, arterial CO2 pressure (Pa,CO2) and arterial pH(pHa) did not fluctuate significantly in ten of twenty and thirteen of twenty studies, respectively. In tests where sinusoidal fluctuation was detected, amplitude averaged 1.1 mmHg and 0.008 units, respectively. Thus VE demonstrated a close dynamic coupling to CO2 output, with consequent tight regulation of Pa,CO2 and pHa. © 1995 The Physiological Society",,"carbon dioxide; potassium; adult; arterial blood; arterial carbon dioxide tension; arterial ph; article; blood gas analysis; breathing mechanics; controlled study; dynamics; exercise; gas exchange; human; human experiment; hyperpnea; male; normal human; potassium blood level; priority journal; steady state; work; Adult; Carbon Dioxide; Cardiac Output; Comparative Study; Exercise; Exercise Test; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Male; Models, Biological; Potassium; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Respiratory Mechanics; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029053155

One system was used when 15N-labeling the ferredoxin uniformly by growing E. coli with 15NH4Cl as the nitrogen source; the other was used in conjunction with auxotrophic host strains to enrich the protein selectively by incorporating 2H-, 13C-, and 15N-labeled amino acids. The labeled ferredoxin samples were studied by 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N NMR spectroscopy. Results from 1H and 2H NMR studies of samples containing [2H(α)]Cys, [2H(β2,β3)]Cys, [13C(β)]Cys, and [15N]Cys have confirmed previous cysteinyl proton resonance assignments (L. Skjeldal, W.M. Westler, B.-H. Oh, A.M. Krezel, H.M., Holden, B.L. Jacobson, I. Rayment, and J.L. Markley (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7363-7368). All four 13C NMR peaks arising from the four cysteinyl β-carbons and all four 15N NMR peaks from the four cysteinyl nitrogens were resolved in spectra of both the oxidized and reduced ferredoxins. The nitrogen resonance of Cys46, which is located in a unique (Ala-Cys) dipeptide, was assigned by detection of 13C(i)-15Ni+1 coupling in a ferredoxin sample with incorporated [13C']Ala and [15N]Cys. The nitrogen signal of Cys41 was assigned tentatively on the basis of its chemical shift and T1 relaxation time. The cysteinyl β-carbon resonances in the reduced state have been assigned to individual residues on the basis of correlations with their (previously assigned) β-protons. The β-carbon resonance from Cys46 in the oxidized state has been assigned by its correlation with the corresponding resonance in the reduced state; this was accomplished by following the progressive air oxidation of a protein sample reduced by dithionite in the presence of methyl viologen. The spin-lattice relaxation times of the β-carbons of the two cysteines coordinated to Fe(III) were similar in the oxidized and reduced states. This suggests that the antiferromagnetic coupling present in the reduced cluster has little influence on the electronic relaxation time of the Fe(III). Studies of the temperature dependence of the 1H, 13C, and 15N signals of the cysteinyl ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster show that the slope of the temperature dependence (Δδ/ΔT-1) can be different for different atom types within a given residue. For example, in the reduced ferredoxin, although Δδ/ΔT-1 is positive for Cys49 1H(β2) and 1H(β3), it is negative for Cys49 13C(β). Although Δδ/ΔT-1 is negative for protons of cysteines ligated to Fe(II) and positive for protons of cysteines ligated to Fe(III), it is positive for all the cysteinyl nitrogens. Nearly complete assignments for the spin system of Arg42 were derived from NMR studies of three selectively labeled samples: ferredoxin incorporating [U-15N]Arg, [26% U-13C]Arg, and [2H(α,β2,β3)]Arg. The resonance arising from the backbone amide nitrogen exhibited an unusual chemical shift at 201.6 ppm in the oxidized state but was unresolved in the reduced state. The NMR results indicate that the hydrogen bond observed between the Arg42 backbone nitrogen and a sulfide of the iron-sulfur cluster in the X-ray structure of the oxidized ferredoxin crystal (W.R. Rypniewski, W.R. Breiter, M.M. Benning, G. Wesenberg, B.-H. Oh, J.L. Markley, I. Rayment, and H.M. Holden (1991) Biochemistry 30, 4126-4131) is present in solution in both the oxidized and reduced forms of the protein. The results show that the noncysteinyl, hyperfine-shifted peak (peak 'K') in the spectrum of the reduced ferredoxin does not arise from 1H(α) of Arg42 as previously postulated. © 1994 Academic Press.","Anabaena 7120 vegetative ferredoxin; Cysteine NMR; Iron-sulfur cluster; Plant-type ferredoxin; [2Fe-2S]ferredoxin",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028889024

Effective acidity is defined as the direct mineral acidity plus the hydrogen ions generated as a result of receptor-processing of acid-producing substances in deposition, minus the hydrogen ions lost by receptor-processing of acid-consuming substances. This model provides the quantitative relationship between emissions from sources and ambient deposition levels, information required by both the objective setting process and the management of source emissions to meet the objectives. Model predictions of effective acidity resulting from wet deposition agree within 30% of that calculated from observations. Model outputs indicate that a maximum effective acidity of 0.182 keq H+ per hectare per year (keq ha-1 yr-1 is experienced in northeastern Alberta, a region containing sensitive soils. This value lies within the range of 0.1-0.3 keq ha-1 yr-1 which has been suggested as an acidic deposition objective for the protection of the sensitive soils. A scenario with a 40% reduction in emissions of SO2 and NOx from a single source in northeastern Alberta reduces this maximum to 0.146 and significantly shrinks the area with effective acidity in excess of 0.14 keq ha-1 yr-1. © 1995.","acidic deposition; acidic deposition objectives; Effective acidity; manage emissions; modelling effective acidity","nitrogen derivative; proton; sulfur; acid rain; article; canada; environmental protection; model; ph; pollution control; pollution transport; prediction; priority journal; soil; acid rain; acidic deposition; deposition objective; effective acidity; mesoscale deposition model; modelling approach; pollution control; Canada, Alberta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028971775

In a minimum bias sample of 1100 interactions, 4730 helium nuclei and 2102 heavy nuclei were emitted as fragments of the incident gold projectiles. The emission angles of these fragments have been measured and pseudorapidity distributions constructed. The multiplicity distributions have been considered separately for the light and heavy target nuclei in the emulsions and found to be relatively independent of the nature of the target, when studied in terms of the total charge remaining bound in the multiply charged fragments. These distributions have been compared with those reported by experiments that studied the multifragmentation of 0.6 and 1.0A GeV gold nuclei, and show relatively small but statistically significant differences that may be attributed to the differing energies or, possibly, to detection biases in the low energy data. We have also looked for evidence of phase changes in the description of multifragmentation and compared our conclusions with those of a study of 1.0A GeV gold nuclei interacting in a carbon target.

The overall objective of the study effort was to show how the cost of seawater desalination can be reduced through the use of an alternate technology, the VARI-ROTM system (VRO), which is more energy efficient and environmentally attractive than existing methods. The VARI-ROTM technology is a highly efficient, low cycle speed, low pulsation, variable flow, positive displacement pumping and energy recovery system suitable for large capacity SWRO and BWRO projects. As compared to a centrifugal pump, energy recovery turbine, and variable speed drive system (CT); the following savings were projected for a 30 mgd SWRO facility: electric power savings 8 mW, percent savings 43 %, five year cost savings $26 million, thirty year straight line savings $156 million. As compared to the California State Water Project (SWP), power savings of 5 mW (megawatts) were projected. This means that desalting seawater can be less energy intensive that importing natural water. Also, substantial environmental benefits were projected, including: air emission reductions and lowering of reject brine concentrations. © 1995.",,"Centrifugal pumps; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Seawater; Turbines; Variable speed drives; Air emission reductions; Desalting technology program research; Energy recovery system; Low cycle speed; Low pulsation; Positive displacement pumping; San Diego region; Variable flow; Desalination; Desalination; Low Energy; Sea Water; Water Supply; Water Treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029407558

The former model simulates the traffic flow conditions, whereas the latter estimates the concentration of five main traffic pollutants at receptor points around road junctions. Actual vehicle exhaust emission rates are input into the dispersion model, as a function of fuel type, fitting of catalytic converters and typical driving operating patterns. Changes in pollutant concentrations are estimated from the implementation of a pedestrianisation scheme in the central area.

It was found that the PL properties of undoped GaN epilayers are strongly affected by the growth conditions such as nitrogen pressure, growth temperature and ECR plasma power. The intensities of the donor-to-acceptor (D-A) pair emission peak at about 3.2 eV and of the deep-level emission peak at around 2.3 eV change with the variation of these three growth conditions. Assuming that the D-A peak and deep-level emission peak are related to native defects and carbon impurities, respectively, the systematic change of the PL spectra with growth conditions can be reasonably interpreted. At the optimum growth conditions, the PL spectra at 77 K are dominated by excitonic peak at 3.47 eV and the intensity of deep-level emission peak is one order of magnitude less than that of the excitonic peak.

First, quadrupling the estimated total organic gas (TOG) and tripling the CO emissions from light-duty gasoline vehicles in the air quality model increases the predicted peak ozone, as expected. The percent increase in peak ozone for the test fuels, about 25% of total ozone, is essentially the same as the percent increase in TOG emissions, about 25% of the total emissions from all sources. However, there is no important effect on the ranking of the test fuels from lowest to highest in predicted ozone formation. Second, replacing the original biogenic emission inventory with an alternative inventory having substantially lower biogenic emissions reduces the predicted peak ozone. The percent decrease in peak ozone, about 6% of total ozone, is considerably less than the percent decrease in TOG emissions, about 34% of total emissions. Fuel rankings are unchanged except for a reversal of two test gasolines in the ranking based on peak ozone. However, this reversal is not found in fuel rankings based on other measures of ozone formation. Third, replacing the Carbon Bond Mechanism version IV (CBM-IV) in the air quality model with an alternative representation of atmospheric chemistry, the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center (SAPRC) mechanism, increases the peak ozone by about 9%. There are also important changes in fuel rankings. For one research test gasoline, the contribution of light-duty gasoline vehicles to ozone is similar with both chemical mechanisms, but for another test gasoline that gives the lowest ozone with the CBM-IV, the contribution of light-duty gasoline vehicles to ozone is substantially higher with the SAPRC mechanism. With the CBM-IV mechanism, the most promising of the test gasolines studied has lower predicted ozone than any of the cases representing use of methanol fuels in prototype, flexible/variable fuel vehicles. With the SAPRC mechanism, the most promising test gasoline studied has lower predicted ozone than one methanol case and higher ozone than the other methanol case. These changes in fuel rankings are probably due to known differences in the reactivity of toluene and formaldehyde in the two mechanisms. © 1995.","Auto/oil Program; fuel/vehicle systems; photochemical modeling; sensitivity tests; urban ozone","automobile emission; photochemical modelling; urban ozone concentration; carbon; carbon monoxide; formaldehyde; fuel; gasoline; methanol; organic compound; ozone; toluene; air pollution; air quality; biogenesis; conference paper; exhaust gas; model; priority journal; united states; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028971283

No significant sequence homologies exist between TGT and any of the proteins in the GenBank database. However, an unusual arrangement of cysteine residues was observed upon manual examination of the TGT sequence. Comparison of this sequence (residues 302-321) revealed similarities to structural zinc-binding motifs in proteins of known structure [Jaffe (1993) Comments Inorg. Chem. 15, 67-93]. Within this region of the TGT sequence, there are six residues (four cysteines and two histidines), any four of which could serve as the ligands to the zinc. We report here that wild-type TGT contains ca. 0.8 mol of zinc/mol of subunit, determined by atomic emission spectrometry. In order to determine which enzyme residues are serving as the ligands to the zinc, site-directed mutagenesis studies have been performed. Gross structural probes (native PAGE and CD spectra), enzyme activity assays, and tRNA-binding assays indicate that cysteines 302, 304, and 307 and histidine 317 are the ligands to the zinc. These results also suggest that the zinc site is necessary for TGT homotrimer formation and for tRNA binding. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

If the local mixture is too rich or too lean, then incomplete combustion occurs. This can play a major role in unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Fuel-air mixture distribution depends on in-cylinder swirl and turbulence, and is directly related to intake-manifold configuration, fuel-delivery-system design and combustion-chamber shape. Understanding the spatial mixture distribution may help improve the design of these aforementioned components. Consequently, a more complete combustion process may result, and emissions reduced. An optical fiber bundle was used to measure the emissions of CH and C2 radicals in this research to map the mixture uniformity in the combustion chamber. The experimental results showed that there exists a relationship between the intensity ratio ( IC2 ICH) and the fuel equivalence ratio. The local fuel equivalence ratios can be obtained after the relationship between the light intensity ratio and fuel equivalence ratio is established. In addition, fuel-rich combustion zones were identified in the vicinity of spark plug and valves. Two fuels, propane (C3H8) and Indolene (CH1.86)7, were used for investigating the effects of different types of fuel on the intensity ratio. A L-head spark-ignition engine was selected for this study since this type of engine uses a conventional carburetor in which the fuel-air mixture is relatively nonhomogeneous which produces high hydrocarbon emissions. Furthermore, the flat cylinder head supplies sufficient space for the installation of the optical fiber bundles. © 1995.",,"Combustion chambers; Engine cylinders; Optical fibers; Propane; Fuel air mixture maldistribution; L head engine; Local fuel equivalence ratio; Combustion; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; fuel; hydrocarbon; propane; article; combustion; exhaust gas; fiberoscope; gas mixing; heat loss; light; machine; motor vehicle; priority journal; sensor; Combustion; Engines - I.C; Fuel/Air Mixtures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029278294

Electrogenerated [L2Ni] reacts slowly with CO2 to produce [Ni(L)(CO)2]; no intermediates could be detected in this reaction. However, the dicarbonyls with both L = Phen and L = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (Me2Bipy) react with trace water to give [Ni2(μ-H)(CO)6]-, providing a route that is operative at relatively high potentials. At more negative potentials (below -1.6 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE)), where a catalytic current due to CO2 reduction is seen, spectroscopic evidence for the transient formation of [Ni(Me2Bipy·-)(CO)2] has been found. It appears that [Ni(Me2Bipy·-)(CO2] reacts sufficiently fast that its steady state concentration in the thin layer is very low. In contrast, [Ni(Phen·-)(CO)2] is more stable. For both complexes, electrogenerated CO, which cannot escape from the thin layer, attacks the radical dicarbonyl species to form [Ni(CO)4], which is then ultimately reduced to nickel carbonyl cluster anions. [Ni(Phen)(CO)2] also reacts to produce a metalloformate species, not observed with the Me2Bipy analogue. The OCNiCO angle was calculated for each of the four [Ni(L)(CO)2] and [Ni(L·-)(CO)2] species and was found to be 104° ± 2°, in agreement with the expected tetrahedral geometry of a Ni(0) complex. © 1995.","Electrocatalysis; Electroreduction; Fourier transform; IR spectroscopy; Ni complexes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542509311

A technique has been developed to perform Simultaneous Transmission Emission Protocol (STEP)(TM) imaging using a line-source of radioactivity positioned at the focal line of a fan-beam collimator. The line-source yields a transmission scan of the patient's chest to measure individual points of body attenuation which provides an attenuation correction technique for radionuclide imaging. This investigation measured the increase in patient and occupational radiation dose due to the transmission source. Methods: Using a 19.4-mCi 99mTc transmission source and thermoluminescent detector (TLD) crystals at various locations on a phantom, we measured radiation dose to a simulated patient and to the technologist. Results: For a 2-hr exposure period, the maximum dose equivalent was 20 mrem which occurred at the lateral aspects (both left and right) of the chest. The regions of the anterior and posterior mid-chest, thyroid and umbilicus, each measured 10 mrem. The gonads and symphysis pubis doses were less than 3 mrem. All occupational locations measured less than 3 mrem for the 2-hr exposure period. Conclusion: The maximum radiation surface dose equivalent received by the patient, in a normal 30-min scanning period, would be no greater than 5 mrem. The occupational dose equivalent for the same period is less than 1 mrem from the transmission source. The addition of a transmission source of approximately 20 mCi does not appreciably increase either the patient or technologist radiation dose.","Attenuation correction; Radiation exposure; Spect","technetium 99m; article; clinical protocol; collimator; gonad; human; occupational exposure; phantom; pubis symphysis; radiation dose; radiation exposure; single photon emission computer tomography; thermoluminescence dosimeter; thorax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029149990

It is thought that emissions from paved and unpaved roads in Spokane contribute three-fourths of the anthropogenic PM10 (neglecting wind-blown dust from agricultural areas). A study was conducted in the summer and fall of 1992 and again in the spring and summer of 1994 to measure PM10 emission rates from paved and unpaved roads in Eastern Washington state using a novel tracer technique. A known amount of an inert tracer (SF6) was released and concentrations of PM10 and SF6 downwind of the road, along with meteorological parameters and traffic volume, were measured. The results of the tracer experiments showed that within experimental uncertainties the PM10 and the tracer gas disperse in the same manner, suggesting that the use of a tracer in a line source to simulate roadway PM10 emissions can provide a tool for improving the existing emission inventories from roads. The emission factors obtained from two unpaved road experiments (136 g per vehicle per kilometer traveled, or g VKT-1, and 336 g VKT-1) were similar in magnitude to those predicted using currently accepted empirical algorithms. The factors determined from six paved road experiments were approximately 80% higher than that predicted using current formulae (6.7 ± 3.7 g VKT-1 compared to 3.7 g VKT-1) for two-lane roads with daily traffic less than 10,000 vehicles. For major highways (4 + lanes and traffic in excess of 10,000 vehicles per day) the emission factors obtained from the tracer experiments were, on average, 44% lower than those predicted using standard formulae (1.0 ± 0.5 g VKT-1 compared to 1.8 g VKT-1). The calculated emission factors for paved roads exhibited a wide range of variability, suggesting that in order to quantify PM10 emission rates from paved roads, more investigation is warranted. © 1995.","Aerosol; atmospheric tracer; dispersion model; emission factor; fugitive dust; particle; particulate matter; PM10; SF6","aerosol; fugitive dust; nonattainment area; particulate matter; PM10 emission rate; road; tracer method; USA, Washington, Spokane; air monitoring; air pollution; airborne particle; algorithm; article; concentration (parameters); dust; exhaust gas; highway; measurement; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution transport; priority journal; simulation; summer; traffic; united states; wind; Air Pollution; Particles; Tracers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028975345

The isolates were distributed into two species, Pseudomonas fluorescens (45.1%) and Pseudomonas putida (40.4%), plus an intermediate type (14.5%). P. fluorescens was the species with the greatest proportion of isolates in the root compartments and the greatest proportion of dissimilatory and denitrifying strains. According to their ability to dissimilate nitrogen, the isolates have been distributed into nondissimilatory and dissimilatory strains, nitrate reducers and true denitrifiers with or without N2O reductase. The proportion of dissimilatory isolates was significantly enhanced in the compartments affected by flax and tomato roots (55% in uncultivated soil and 90 and 82% in the root tissue of flax and tomato, respectively). Among these strains, the proportion of denitrifiers gradually and significantly increased in the root vicinity of tomato (44, 68, 75, and 94% in uncultivated soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and root tissue, respectively) and was higher in the flax rhizoplane (66%) than in the uncultivated soil. A higher proportion of N2O reducers was also found in the root compartments. This result was particularly clear for tomato.

Kadiri-3) were investigated. CO2 exerted significant effects on stomatal frequency only in irrigated plants. The effects of drought on leaf development out weighed the smaller effects of CO2 concentration, although reductions in stomatal frequency induced by elevated atmo-spheric CO2 were still observed. When stands of groundnut were grown under irrigated conditions with unrestricted root systems, an increase in atmospheric CO2 from 375 to 700 ppmv decreased stomatal frequency on both leaf surfaces by up to 16% in droughted plants, stomatal frequency was reduced by 8% on the adaxial leaf surface only. Elevated atmospheric CO2 promoted larger reductions in leaf conductance than the changes in stomatal frequency, indicating partial stomatal closure. As a result, the groundnut stands grown at elevated CO2 utilized the available soil moisture more slowly than those grown under ambient CO2, there by extending the growing period. Despite the large variations in cell frequencies induced by drought, there was no treatment effect on either stomatal index or the adaxial/abaxial stomatalfrequency ratio. The data suggest that the effects of future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration on stomatal frequency in groundnut are likely to be small, especially under conditions of water stress, but that the combination of associated reductions in leaf con-ductance and enhanced assimilation at elevated CO2 will be important in semi-arid regions © 1995 Oxford University Press.","Arachis hypogaea L; CO2; Drought; Groundnu; Leguminosae; Stomatal frequency","Arachis hypogaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028888502

This evidence derives from studies of lung cancer trends, studies of occupational groups, comparisons of urban and rural populations, and case-control and cohort studies using diverse exposure metrics. Recent prospective cohort studies observed 30 to 50% increases in lung cancer rates associated with exposure to respirable particles. While these data reflect the effects of exposures in past decades, and despite some progress in reducing air pollution, large numbers of people in the United States continue to be exposed to pollutant mixtures containing known or suspected carcinogens. It is not known how many people in the United States are exposed to levels of fine respirable particles that have been associated with lung cancer in recent epidemiologic studies. These observations suggest that the most widely cited estimates of the proportional contribution of air pollution to lung cancer occurrence in the United States based largely on the results of animal studies, may be too low. It is important that better epidemiologic research be conducted to allow improved estimates of lung cancer risk from air pollution among the general population. The development and application of new epidemiologic methods, particularly the improved characterization of population-wide exposure to mixtures of air pollutants and the improved design of ecologic studies, could improve our ability to measure accurately the magnitude of excess cancer associated with air pollution.","Air pollution; Ambient air; Coal workers; Combustion; Diesel; Exposure; Fossil fuels; Lung cancer; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Steel mill workers; Sulfur dioxide; Urban","fossil fuel; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfur dioxide; accuracy; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; coal worker; combustion; comparative study; conference paper; human; iron and steel industry; lung cancer; measurement; particulate matter; priority journal; rural population; United States; urban population",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029609557

Namely, peaks falling around 9.8 and 11.3 μm have been isolated. This property is not a peculiarity of P/Halley as also other comets such as Bradfield and Levy present similar features. There is a wide debate on the identification of the specific silicate components able to simulate the observations. In the present work we report the results of laboratory experiments performed on various kinds of submicron grains which can be considered as representative of different classes of silicates. Infrared spectra have been obtained which are free from effects possibly produced by matrices, commonly used to embed dust to perform spectroscopic measurements. These data have been used as input in a computational code to fit quantitatively emission spectra from comets P/Halley and P/Levy in the 10 μm band region. Our results confirm previous findings that mixtures of olivine-type and pyroxene-type grains are able to provide satisfactory fits of observations. Moreover, from the simulation it appears that the relative amounts of the various silicate species are different in the two comets considered. In the future, the extension of the simulation to other comets could provide useful information so that the variations in the spectral profile of the 10 μm band could be correlated with different intrinsic and/or evolutionary properties of the comets. © European Southern Observatory.","Comets: P/Halley; Dust; Infrare d: Solar system; P/Levy","Dust; Emission spectroscopy; Silicate minerals; Comets: P/Halley; Computational codes; Emission spectrums; Infrared spectrum; Laboratory experiments; Spectral components; Spectral profile; Spectroscopic measurements; Silicates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030767025

An alternative which is being explored in many countries is the use of unmanned autonomous underwater vehicles to gather data. In this context the paper describes the progress made in the Autosub project of the Natural Environment Research Council. © 1995, IEE.

This paper discusses how the European Union (EU) faces a fundamental problem in addressing the climate change issue in that it has to date failed to establish a common energy policy. Hence the energy elements of the EU's carbon dioxide strategy, such as the SAVE programme, are weak. Under a general climate of subsidiarity, Member States are reluctant to cede sovereignty in this economic policy area, yet cannot necessarily be relied on to integrate environmental concerns into their own energy policies. Nevertheless, the climate change concern together with other issues, such as liberalization in the energy sector, are giving a new impetus to the development of an EU energy policy, as exemplified by the publication of the recent Commission Green Paper. However, despite these advances, the paper argues that the prospects for a ‘green’ and common energy policy in the EU still remain faint.

From our FIR maps we calculate the dust temperature and optical depth at 100 μm. Cepheus A has moderate optical depths (τ100 μm ≤ 0.6), and its dust temperature ranges from 30 to 55 K. The two-dimensional map of the 100 μm optical depth indicates that there is a region of lower dust column density near the peak of the FIR emission. A radiative transfer code was used to model the available photometry and the FIR data of Cepheus A. A spherical dust cloud with a central young star was assumed, and the input parameters in this model were varied in order to reproduce the spectral energy distribution and the high angular resolution profiles at FIR wavelengths. The model that gives the best fit to the observations requires a dust cloud of the following characteristics: Router = 0.5 pc, Rinner = 0.07 pc, τ100 = 0.15, α = 1.5, where Router, Rinner, τ100, and α are the outer radius, inner radius, optical depth at 100 μm, and the exponent of the power law in the emitting-dust density gradient: nd(r) = n0(r/r0)-α. The inner radius used in this model (Rinner = 0.07 pc) is similar in size to the ""cavity"" derived from the two-dimensional map of the dust optical depth at 100 μm. For small distances (r ≤ 0.15 pc) from the infrared peak, a second density gradient is derived from the distribution of the near-infrared (NIR) polarization. In this inner region of the dust cloud the NIR polarization distribution indicates that the density of the scattering dust should remain constant or increase slightly with distance. Our results are consistent with current star formation theories: a young stellar object surrounded by an infalling envelope with a characteristic density distribution of: nd(r) ∝ r-1.5, a circumstellar disk, and a cavity (Rinner ∼ 0.07 pc) in which nd is constant, created by the dispersal of the initial dust cloud by a strong stellar wind.","Dust, extinction; Infrared: ISM: continuum; ISM: clouds; ISM: individual (Cepheus A); ISM: jets and outflows; Polarization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11944261425

Shallow groundwater samples from 17 sites perpendicular and 11 sites parallel to the lakeshore were analyzed for major ions. The shallow groundwater contains remnant solutes from higher lake stands, which are transported toward the lake by lateral flow and surface runoff. The flow system appears to be segregated into two different regions: a concentrated, highly saline groundwater underlying much of the northeast shore and pockets of more localized lower‐salinity groundwater. The saturation state of the groundwater with respect to certain minerals was determined, and simulations for both evaporative concentration of inflow and mixing of lake water with inflow coupled with mineral precipitation were performed. Solute trends in the shallow groundwater result primarily from the degree of mixing with historical lake water; however, evaporative concentration and redissolution cycles along with various chemical fractionation mechanisms including Ca, Mg, and Na carbonate precipitation, sulfate reduction, ion exchange, and potentially Mg silicate formation are also important controls.

However, in many cases the emission rates are not well characterized. This study describes a methodology to determine such rates with application to a hexavalent chromium plating line under production conditions. Area concentrations were determined from particulate samples collected on open-face filters using calibrated personal sampling pumps. Twelve sets of 1-hour samples were collected at six locations at different distances from the plating tanks and in the hood of the local exhaust system. The filters were analyzed using proton-induced X-ray emission spectroscopy. For each 1 -hour period, measurements of area concentrations were transformed to emission rates by using a multipoint diffusion mass balance model in conjunction with measured ventilation rates. In addition, source activities such as area plated, ampere'hours consumed, and total power usage were recorded simultaneously with concentration measurements. Comparison of the emission rates with source activities allowed us to determine emission factors as well as the emission rates. The hood emission results were in good agreement with hood emissions measured in a California Air Resources Board study of hard chrome plating (which did not measure workroom emissions). The workroom emissions were related to plating line throughput such as total area plated or ampere’hour of plating current, which was consistent with results from a previous study on another hexavalent chromium line. The emission factors for hood and workroom were 0.0805 and 2.57 • 10-4 mg/A • h, respectively. The methods provide a first estimate for determining workroom emissions when no other data are available, and are a useful way to extend field test measurements. For systems with local exhaust ventilation the approach also allows determination of mass-based collection efficiency, in this case an average of 99.1 percent based on hourly average emission rates. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"chromium; air monitoring; air sampling; article; diffusion; electroplating industry; exhaust gas; filter; flame photometry; methodology; priority journal; workplace; workroom air",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029151586

What are the ability and the accuracy of the available models? How should the models be used for this regulatory purpose? For the latter question, there is the problem of the knowledge and integration into the procedure of large-scale meteorological forecasts; this means that one must know in advance the meteorological conditions over the urban zone of interest.

First, the surface of lanthana can be reduced in carbon monoxide by forming the carbonate which decomposes above 650 K. Reduced lanthana adsorbs significant amounts of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, both of which desorb in a similar temperature region to that found for rhodium and platinum. Substantial amounts of the nitric oxide on reduced lanthana react to form nitrogen and nitrous oxide. The addition of rhodium and platinum significantly promotes the reduction of lanthana, and a significant fraction of the carbon monoxide adsorbed on freshly deposited metal films forms carbon dioxide. Based on suppressed adsorption of nitric oxide on thin metal films, it appears that the metals are oxidized and the lanthana reduced immediately following deposition. The TPD curves on the reduced Rh/lanthana and Pt/lanthana appear to be a simple sum of the desorption from reduced lanthana and small metal particles, so that there is no evidence for new adsorption states which might indicate changes in the metal properties due to the presence of lanthana. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model, CORAL+, was used to simulate more than 3.6 million combinations of five system parameters, including sewer channel slope, relative depth of flow, pipe diameter, Henry's law coefficient. and headspace ventilation rate. Lumped results were analyzed using a graphical frequency array approach to identify parameter combinations that lead to potential VOC emission hot spots. Additional modeling was completed to provide examples of passive VOC emission reductions through control of system parameters. Computational results provide information related to combinations of parameters that either never or always lead to potential VOC emission hot spots, independent of the values associated with all other parameters. Results indicate that the common assumption of infinite ventilation can lead to significant overestimates of VOC emissions, and that controlled beadspace ventilation can be used to reduce VOC emissions by an order of magnitude or more. This may be of significance with respect to reducing emissions from on-site industrial sewers by maintaining biodegradable VOCs m solution prior to discharge to a downstream biotogtcal treatment system. Results also suggest that VOC emissions are highly sensitive to wastewater flow rate, increasing as flow rate decreases. This is an important observation with respect to the fact that some municipalities encourage industrial discharges at night for purposes of flow equalization. © 1995, International Association on Water Quality.

The development of a temporal variability model to match the resolution of the Navy's standard climatologies (nominally a 30′ grid, but sometimes as fine a resolution as a 10′ grid) was beset by many problems, the most serious being the scarcity of data, data quality, and removal of spatial variability. Since individual editing of the more than 4 million vertical profiles in NAVOCEANO's data bank is unrealistic, semi-automated techniques were employed. Spatial variability was estimated using the Navy's standard temperature climatology, the Generalized Digital Environmental Model. These estimates were used to allow the sampling space to increase in regions of low spatial variability and to decrease in areas of high spatial variability, resulting in realistic estimates of variability. As new data are added to the master data bank, the variability model will be used to tag anomalous data for further editing and ultimately used to make periodic updates to the variability model itself.",,"Bathymetry; Climatology; Database systems; Geophysics; Mathematical models; Temperature measurement; Integrated data base management system; Littoral regions; Salinity; Spatial variability; Oceanography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029513561

The dragging on of the European carbon/energy tax stresses the divergence between targets and policy options in several member states. This leaves national and regional policy-makers with a troublesome task of developing additional policy strategies to realize their objectives. This is particularly true for Belgium. The Belgian government has agreed to go further than the European stabilizing target. These policy circumstances raise some interesting issues with regard to the interaction between policy-making and decision-making on the part of energy investors. To a certain degree, depending on the credibility of the policy debate, precautionary actions are taken in advance of the date that the constraint is actually scheduled to take effect. This anticipatory behaviour will lead to a downward shift of the CO2 emissions.

The population includes 2,930 small, hand-fired boilers and 227 larger traveling grate stoker-fired boilers. These boilers are important contributors to air quality problems in Krakow, and an assessment of their efficiency and emissions characteristics was recently undertaken. For the larger, stoker-fired boilers, efficiency was measured using a stack-loss method. In addition to the normal baseline fuel, the effects of coal cleaning and grading were evaluated. Testing was done at two selected sites. Boiler efficiencies were found to be low - 50% to 67%. These boilers operate without combustion controls or instrumentation for flue gas analysis. As a result, excess air levels are very high - up to 400% - leading to poor performance. Emissions were found to be typical for boilers of this type. Using the improved fuels yields reductions in emissions and improvement in efficiency when combined with proper adjustments. In the case of the hand-fired boilers, one set of cast-iron boilers and one set of steel boilers were tested. Efficiency in this case was measured using an input-output method for sets of three boilers taken together as a system. Emissions from these boilers are lowest when low volatile fuels, such as coke or smokeless briquettes, are used.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; District heating; Dust; Electric heating; Geographical regions; Particulate emissions; Performance; Stoves; Surveys; Air quality problems; Coal cleaning; Combustion control; Stack loss method; Coal fired boilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029226459

A combined microsensor for O2 and N2O was used to record microprofiles of these two species in biofilms where the reduction of N2O was inhibited by acetylene. Nitrification in T. pantotropha was not affected by the addition of acetylene and by using a diffusion-reaction model to simulate the N2O profiles it was possible to calculate depth profiles of both nitrification and denitrification. The validity of the calculations when both nitrification and denitrification were operating in concert was confirmed by performing identical calculations on data obtained for a P. denitrificans biofilm. At high NO3- concentrations, part of the NO3- reduced by T. pantotropha biofilms was reduced only to NO2- and N2O production thus did not reflect total NO3- reduction.

It appears that the insertion of the phenylalanyl side chains into the lipid hydrocarbon region causes a significant increase in the order parameters near the carbonyl region and a decrease in the water penetration in the head group region, rendering this region gel-like. The negatively charged C-termini helps to anchor the peptides at the bilayer-water interface and this enhances the ordering capability of the peptide.

Application of factor analysis to the spectral changes in the Soret region allowed us to resolve two particular pressure-induced processes in 2B4 oligomers. The first process was identified as the conversion of the low-spin P450 into the P420 state. At 25°C it was followed by decay (bleaching) about 50% of the newly formed P420. The second process was a pressure-induced high- to low-spin shift. Both transitions were reversible, except the hemoprotein bleaching. The applitude of the P450 → P420 transition accounted for 67 ± 5% of the total hemoprotein content. Furthermore, the fraction of the hemoprotein exposed to spin equilibrium was not affected by the P450 → P420 conversion and was estimated to be only about 31 ± 5% of the total hemoprotein content. After the dissociation of the oligomers by 0.2% Triton N-101, the inhomogeneity vanished: 95% of the monomers were involved in the P450 → P420 transition (Δ V° = -86 ml/mol) followed by intense bleaching of the hemoprotein. This agrees with our earlier observations on the reduced carbonyl complex of P450 2B4 and suggests some conformational difference between subunits in P450 LM2 oligomers. The parameters of the P450 → P420 conversion (ΔV° = -32 ml/mol, P1 2 = 1560 bar) show no dependency on the substrate concentration. Analysis of the pressure-induced spin shift versus benzphetamine concentration shows this transition to be caused mainly by changes in the spin equilibrium of both substrate-bound (ΔV° = -49 ml/mol) and substrate-free (ΔV° = -21 ml/mol) hemoprotein, whereas the substrate binding step itself has a very weak pressure dependency (ΔV° = -8 ml/mol). © 1995.",,"cytochrome p450; microsome enzyme; article; conformational transition; enzyme analysis; enzyme conformation; enzyme structure; pressure; priority journal; structure analysis; Algorithms; Animal; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Microsomes, Liver; Pressure; Protein Conformation; Rabbits; Solutions; Spectrophotometry; Steroid Hydroxylases; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029077745

Here we test the idea by looking at natural levels of productivity in regions of the Southern Ocean with differing iron abundance. In the southerly branch of the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC), upwelling of deep waters supplies sufficient iron to the surface to sustain moderate primary production but not to permit blooms to develop. In contrast, within the fast-flowing, iron-rich jet of the polar front (PF), spring blooms produced phytoplankton biomass an order of magnitude greater than that in southern ACC waters, leading to CO2 undersaturation. The plankton-rich PF waters were sharply delineated from adjacent iron-poor waters, indicating that iron availability was the critical factor in allowing blooms to occur. © 1995, Nature Publishing Group.

In this study, we investigate and dissect the relative contributions and mutual interactions of these regulators in transcriptional control. Transcription was analyzed both under steady‐state conditions and during nutritional shifts, in hapΔ mutants and after site‐specific mutagenesis of the various binding sites in the chromosomal context of the QCR8 gene. We present evidence for both direct and indirect interactions between ABF1 and HAP2/3/4, and show that HAP2/3/4 is essential for a rapid transcriptional induction during transition from repressed to derepressed conditions. However, the activator is not the only determinant for carbon‐source‐dependent regulation, and we observe a functional difference between HAP2/3/4 and the HAP2/3 subcomplex. ABF1 is required for maintainance of basal repressed and derepressed transcription in the steady state of growth. The repressive action of the negative modulator CPFl during escape from glucose repression is overcome through the cooperative action of ABF1 and HAP2/3/4.

Without significant policy change, fuel consumption is projected to grow from a 1990 level of 6.3 million barrels per day (Mbd) to 9 Mbd by 2010. Five policy-driven scenarios are analyzed, ranging up to a new vehicle fuel economy improvement rate of 6% per year. For the 6%/yr scenario, the analysis projects gasoline savings of 2.9 Mbd and emissions reductions of 147 million metric tons per year (carbon equivalent) of greenhouse gases and 495,000 metric tons per year of evaporative hydrocarbons by 2010. The sensitivity of the projections to various factors is also examined. The most critical assumption is the baseline (i.e., the extent of fuel economy change in the absence of stronger standards). Other factors examined, such as growth in vehicle miles of travel (VMT), VMT rebound, credits toward regulatory compliance, rollbacks of standards, upper and lower bounds on a percentage increase standard, possible vehicle market shifts and fuel economy shortfall, were found to have smaller effects. Fuel economy standards are projected to be a reliable mechanism for controlling future gasoline consumption and associated pollution emissions in the United States. © 1995.",,"automobile stock; emission reduction; fuel consumption; light-duty vehicle; modelling approach; pollution level; stock turnover; vehicle emission; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029503505

The model structure is composed of three compartments (plasma, free, and bound ligand) and five parameters (including the benzodiazepine receptor concentration). The arterial plasma concentration, after correction for metabolites, was used as the input function. The experimental protocol, which consisted of three injections of labeled and/or unlabeled ligand, allowed the evaluation of the five model parameters in various brain regions from a single experiment. In particular, the concentration of receptor sites available for binding (B′max) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KDVR, VR being the volume of reaction) were estimated in five brain regions, including the pons, in which these parameters are identified for the first time (B′max = 4.7 ± 1.7 pmol/ml and KDVR = 4.4 ± 1.3 pmol/ml). Due to the large range of measured receptor concentrations, a linear correlation between B′max and KDVR was pointed out (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.0005) and was interpreted as a linear relationship between B′max and VR, the parameter KD being assumed constant. This result and its concordance with the published data are discussed. Simulation of the usual two-experiment Scatchard analysis, using the pons as a reference region, showed that the bias on the receptor concentration estimates introduced by this method is significant (from 20 to 40%) but can be corrected using an estimate of the receptor concentration in the pons. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental protocol, based on a Scatchard analysis of the PET data obtained with a partial-saturation experiment. This single-injection protocol is entirely noninvasive, and thus the estimation of the benzodiazepine receptor concentration and of the flumazenil affinity is now possible in human patients using a single 1-h experiment without blood sampling.","Benzodiazepine receptors; Compartmental model; Positron emission tomography; Scatchard analysis; [14C]Flumazenil","benzodiazepine receptor; brain receptor; carbon 11; flumazenil; adult; article; brain region; clinical trial; dose response; drug receptor binding; human; human experiment; intravenous drug administration; ligand binding; male; normal human; positron emission tomography; priority journal; receptor affinity; receptor density; scatchard plot; Adult; Brain; Computer Simulation; Flumazenil; Human; Ligands; Male; Pons; Receptors, GABA-A; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028888459

In order to determine the former isotope effect, [6, 6-2H2]dideuteriopenicillanic acid has been synthesized. In alkaline solution, the former isotope effect (corrected to the effect of a single hydrogen orthogonal to the plane of the carbonyl group and for the inductive effect of deuterium) was found to be 0.95 ± 0.01 and the latter 0.76 ± 0.01. These values support the BAC2 mechanism of hydrolysis with rate-determining formation of the tetrahedral intermediate that has been proposed for other β-lactams. The measured /3-secondary kinetic isotope for the acid-catalyzed reaction was 1.00 ± 0.01. This represents a value averaged from experiments in 0.45 M HCl, 0.97 M HC1, 4.5 M HC1, and 33.3 wt % H2SO4. All precedent suggests that this result would be very unlikely for an associative mechanism, such as that commonly observed (AAc2) for amide hydrolysis at these acid concentrations. Semiempirical AMI calculations suggest that bicyclic β-lactams are not only very weakly basic (in accord with previous experiment) but also protonate preferentially on nitrogen. This likelihood, taken with the secondary isotope effect, indicates that a likely pathway of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis would be that of an AAcl mechanism with an intermediate acylium ion. If this weee so, the calculated β-secondary isotope effect per hydrogen coplanar with the breaking C-N bond and corrected for the inductive effect of deuterium would be 1.06 ± 0.01. This suggests an early AACI transition state, which would be reasonable in this case because of destabilization of the N-protonated amide with respect to the acylium ion because of ring strain. The absence of specific participation by solvent in the transition state, as would be expected of an AACI but not an associative mechanism, is supported by the strongly inverse solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 0.25 ± 0.00 in 1 M HCl and 0.22 ± 0.01 in 33.3 wt % H2SO4. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a mouse cDNA clone encoding monomeric 17β-HSD of the liver. This clone had an entire coding region for a protein of 323 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 37,055. The deduced sequence of the protein aligned with a high degree of identity with rat and rabbit 20α- HSDs, rat and human 3α-HSD/dihydrodiol dehydrogenases, and bovine prostaglandin F synthase, which are members of the aldoketoreductase family, but was distinct from human 17β-HSD and carbonyl reductase, members of the short chain dehydrogenases. The expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli resulted in synthesis of a protein that was active toward androgens, estrogens, and xenobiotic substrates. The recombinant and mouse liver 17β- HSDs also exhibited low 20α-HSD activity toward progestins, which is similar to bifunctional activity of human placental 17β-HSD. Therefore, the mouse enzyme was given the designation of estradiol 17β-dehydrogenase (A- specific). Northern analysis of mouse tissues revealed the existence of a single 1.7-kilobase 17β-HSD mRNA species in the liver, kidney, testis, and stomach.

However, most elevated CO2 studies have documented changes (generally increases) in microbial biomass and total infection by symbiotic organisms, which is only a first step in the understanding of the modification of soil processes. Using a Mediterranean model ecosystem, we complemented these variables by analyzing changes in enzymatic activities, hyphal lengths, and bacterial substrate assimilation, to tentatively identify the specific components affected under elevated CO2 and those which suggest changes in soil organic matter pools. We also investigated changes in the functional structures of arbuscular mycorrhizas. Most of the microbial variables assessed showed significant and substantial increase under elevated CO2, of the same order or less than those observed for root mass and length. The increase in dehydrogenase activity indicates that the larger biomass of microbes was accompanied by an increase in their activity. The increase in hyphal length (predominantly of saprophytic fungi), and xylanase, cellulase and phosphatase activities, suggests an overall stimulation of organic matter decomposition. The higher number of substrates utilized by microorganisms from the soil under elevated CO2 was significant for the amine/amide group. Total arbuscular and vesicular mycorrhizal infection of roots was higher under elevated CO2, but the proportion of functional structures was not modified. These insights into the CO2-induced changes in soil biological activity point towards potential areas of investigation complementary to a direct analysis of the soil organic matter pools. © 1996, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The effects of elevated [CO2] on the relationships between single plant species and root symbionts are considered first. There is some evidence that plant infection by and/or biomass of root symbionts are stimulated by elevated [CO2], but growth enhancement of the host seemingly depends on its degree of dependence on symbiosis and on soil nutrient availability. Second, the effects of elevated [CO2] on the relationships between plant multispecies assemblages and soil, and likely impacts on above-ground and belowground diversity, are analysed. Experimental and modelling work have suggested the existence of complex feedbacks in the responses of plants and the rhizosphere to CO2 enrichment. By modifying C inputs from plants to soil, elevated [CO2] may affect the biomass, the infectivity, and the species/isolate composition of root symbionts. This has the potential to alter community structure and ecosystem functioning. Finally, the incorporation of type and degree of symbiotic dependence into the definition of plant functional types, and into experimental work within the context of global change research, are discussed. More experimental work on the effects of elevated [CO2] at the community/ecosystem level, explicitly considering the role of root symbioses, is urgently needed. © 1996, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

All these undesirable products except NOx are the result of incomplete combustion in the cylinders. Various approaches to achieving more complete combustion in diesel engines have included different fuel compositions, use of catalysts, fuel additives, engine modifications, and oxygen-enriched intake air. The present study shows that injecting minute quantities of primarily platinum group metal catalysts into the intake air of a Deutz/MWM D916-6 mine diesel engine substantially reduces emissions in the exhaust. The catalyst injection system, which was developed by National Fuelsaver Corporation (Robinson, 1981), transfers catalyst compounds in solution to a stream of air bubbles by a process called Bubble Fractionation (Lemlich et al., 1966, 1968, 1970). The amounts are so minute that concentrations in the engine exhaust should be well below OSHA/NIOSH Time Weighted Average (TWA) exposure limits at steady state, a fact that was confirmed by analysis of collected particulates in the exhaust. When the catalyst injection was used along with a pleated paper filter to remove exhaust particulates, the filter operating life was shortened greatly. Therefore, this system is not recommended for use on diesel engines equipped with a water scrubber and a filter. It does offer a practical and relatively economical way of reducing exhaust emissions from other diesel engines, such as those in outby mine service.",,"Carbon monoxide; Catalytic converters; Combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Exhaust gases; Fuel additives; Fuel injection; Intake systems; Nitrogen oxides; Bubble fractionation; Catalyst injection systems; Diesel engine emissions; Time weighted average; Mining machinery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029429903

A new snow hydrology scheme has recently been developed at Météo-France for use in the ARPEGE climate model and has been successfully tested against local field measurements in stand-alone experiments. This study describes the global validation of the parameterization in a 3-year integration for the present-day climate within the T42L30 version of ARPEGE. Results are compared with those from a control simulation and with available observed climatologies, in order to assess the impact of the new snow parameterization on the simulated surface climate. The seasonal cycle of the Northern Hemisphere snow cover is clearly improved when using the new scheme. The snow pack is still slightly overestimated in winter, but its poleward retreat is better reproduced during the melting season.

Box 20907, 2500 EX The Hague, Netherlands","The major part of the Netherlands consists of a low-lying river delta which is very sensitive to hydrological conditions in the North-Western part of the European continent. The rivers Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt carry through this delta to the North Sea annually nearly 100 km 3 of fresh water. This water originates from a drainage basin of about 185 000 km 2, which is 6 times the country area. The present geography of the Netherlands has largely been shaped by this river inflow and by the sediments which are carried along. Interaction of these fluxes with North Sea hydrodynamics in a period of rising sea level has produced large lowlands, which in the past millennium have been reclaimed for agricultural, urban and industrial purposes. At present an extended hydrological infrastructure is required to contain high waters and to keep ground water and surface water tables permanently under control. Otherwise more than half of the Netherlands would be permanently or frequently flooded. In the Netherlands water management is a matter of permanent concern. The abundance of water is at the same time source of prosperity and source of vulnerability. Waterways for shipping and water supply for agriculture, industry and domestic use are essential resources for economy. The Dutch wetlands also represent a great environmental value. Changes in water supply and river discharge therefore have important impacts. More frequent occurrence of low discharge is detrimental to fluvial transport and agriculture. More frequent occurrence of high river discharge affects the safety of population against flooding and causes economical damage. Additional sedimentation raises the river beds with respect to the surrounding lowlands with possible consequences for safety and river management. The previous considerations form the basis for the sub-theme REGIONAL HYDROLOGY of the Dutch climate change research programme NRP. Seven research projects dealing with different aspects of the hydrological system have been selected in order to study the vulnerability of the Netherlands to climate related hydrological change. Although not all components of the hydrological system could be studied, the most important processes and relationships in the hydrological system have been addressed (see Figure 1). In the present phase of research most of the results still have an indicative character. Some projects have been completed, but others have started only recently. Nevertheless several important conclusions already emerge, which are summarized below:Recent scenarios indicate greater regional climate changes than assumed in the past. Most remarkable are the strong expected increase in winter precipitation and the increased drought in summer.With increasing CO 2 concentrations forests will become more resistant to droughts. If biomass does not increase, the evapotranspiration will decrease, causing an increase in drainage to ground water and run-off.Drought damage to crop production will increase. Agriculture will be less affected in the low lying river delta than in neighbouring regions. This may yield a comparative advantage for the Dutch economy.In coastal lowlands no substantial increase in saline seepage is expected, even if the sea level rises more than one meter.The discharge regime of the Rhine will change drastically. The annual variability of the discharge will strongly increase; winter discharges will increase and summer discharges will decrease.Periods of low river discharge will become more frequent and more prolonged. This will diminish the transport function of the Rhine, with serious economic consequences. The availability of cooling water for power plants will also be affected. A shortage of Rhine water will cause further intrusion of saline water in the lower river delta.The frequency of high discharges will increase. This causes more frequent inundation of the embanked floodplains in the Netherlands. It is not yet clear to what extent this will change safety from flooding.Sensitivity of soils to erosion is more affected by the expected changes in land use than by climate change. The production of sediment by soil erosion may be substantially increased by changes in precipitation.Sedimentation rates on the embanked floodplains in the Netherlands will increase. As a consequence, polluted sediments will become an increasing environmental concern. Pollution in the catchment basins of Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt has to be kept under control. A general conclusion from the different sub-theme studies is that the most serious impacts of climate change result from a shift in extreme conditions more than from a shift in average climate conditions. At present no reliable indications can be given regarding changes in frequency of extreme conditions. This question should be addressed with priority in the future NRP. It appears that, in particular, a more frequent occurrence of periods of drought will have significant economical consequences. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957039706

In this study, the total elemental concentrations and their spatial distribution in the surface soils of the Sudbury region are presented. Concentrations of Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, S, and Zn in the studied soils were elevated above background levels. Copper and Ni were the primary metallic contaminants in Sudbury soils, with concentrations from 11 to 1890 and 5 to 2150 mg kg-1 for Cu and Ni, respectively. Seventy-five and 62% of the soil samples had concentrations of Cu and Ni, respectively, higher than a 'critical' value of 60 mg kg-1. Also, high concentrations of Cd and S occurred in a large proportion of the studied soils. A strong decline in the soil concentrations of Cu and Ni was found as compared to earlier results. The elemental concentrations show great spatial variability, which is related to the effect of the main point sources of contaminants, namely smelters. The spatial distribution of Cu and Ni concentration in the studied soils was strongly correlated. Spatial distribution of Cd concentration in the soils did not follow those of other elements.

It is suggested that non-planar structures containing pentagonal rings, which are closely related to fullerenes, can arise in amorphous carbons, and free radical material, in particular, probably odd-alternate n-radicals, may be trapped by the cage environment provided by non-planar carbon networks. Such an occurrence leads to a density of states profile by which the electrical behaviour of carbons can be rationalized. A half-filled band of localized mid-gap states is predicted to give rise to a metal-insulator transition at a spin concentration and minimum metallic conductivity of the same magnitude as is measured experimentally. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Decomposition; Electric conductivity of solids; Electric properties; Fullerenes; Magnetic properties; Molecular structure; Percolation (solid state); Pyrolysis; Amorphous carbons; Free radical materials; Metal insulator transition; Mid gap states; Non planar structures; Voids; Amorphous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029208885

We studied the effects of catheter position on intraluminal CO2 concentration profiles and gas transport resistance during intra-airway insufflation at 0.15 l · kg-1 · min-1 in six anesthetized paralyzed mechanically hypoventilated dogs. The two positions of the distal tip of the insufflation catheter were 0.5 cm proximal to and 4.0 cm distal to the carina. Local airway CO2 concentrations were measured via a sampling catheter passed through the tracheobronchial tree. Resistance to gas transport was calculated from the measured data. Arterial PO2 and arterial PCO2 remained constant with carinal and bronchial insufflation. Distal positioning of the insufflation tip resulted in a redistribution of ventilation between the lungs, with the ipsilateral lung being relatively hyperventilated and the contralateral lung being relatively hypoventilated. Intraluminal CO2 concentrations were markedly reduced in the ipsilateral lung compared with the profile in the contralateral lung during fresh gas delivery into the main-stem bronchus. The region of peak transport resistance was found to be in the second-generation airways during carinal insufflation and in the fourth-generation airways with intrabronchial insufflation. We conclude that gas exchange during low-flow insufflation occurs by the same mechanisms responsible for CO2 elimination in constant-flow ventilation.

Truly two-dimensional algorithms are developed for the radiative source term in the governing equations, whereby the determination of the specific intensity field is obtained by means of a numerical integration over directions of propagation of radiation. The one-dimensional slab approximation is lifted, and the analysis presented allows the determination of the radiative characteristics of the entire flowfield, rather than being limited to the stagnation streamline, thereby providing an accurate assessment of two-dimensional relieving effects in the stagnation region. A few preliminary results are presented for the Mach 47 flow over a cylinder, including a comparison of the two-dimensional algorithm with the onedimensional approximation and an emission-dominated case.

The quantum yields for the direct and sensitized formation of the phenylthiophenes following the photocleavage of the carbon-halogen bond were determined in the 293-343 K temperature range. The transient species (triplets and free radicals) originated by laser excitation were investigated by laser flash photolysis; their spectral and kinetic properties and their formation quantum yields were determined at room temperature. The halogen atoms were detected through their interactions with the solvent to form benzene-X• complexes that were identified by absorption spectra and decay lifetimes. The characteristics of the triplets were also determined in methylcyclohexane/ 3-methylpentane (9:1, v/v) at 77 K. Phosphorescence measurements at low temperature gave the spectral and kinetic charactertistics of the lowest triplet states of halothiophenes. Through the effect of the solvent polarity on the triplet energy (ET), evidence was obtained of the n,π* nature of the lowest triplet. Results obtained by steady state and pulsed techniques gave strong indication that the sensitized photosubstitution takes place through an upper triplet state (likely σ,σ* in nature) localized on the carbon-halogen bond.

An existing algorithm for system reliability evaluation and the corresponding production simulation program were modified and extended to more accurately account for the mode of operation and intermittent features of solar systems. The preservation of fossil fuels and installed capacity of the conventional plants, and the reduction of emissions are determined by implementing solar thermal stations. Sample computations for a real system in Jordan are carried out to define the substitution potential of solar stations with respect to conventional generation alternatives.

Certain of their components stimulate further superoxide production by competent cells, as shown with cytochrome c assay in previous work. In the present study, we report CF formation after ischemia reperfusion in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Plasma ultrafiltrates, collected 20 min after reperfusion, had clastogenic properties in contrast to those collected before ischemia. We also show that the luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence response of neutrophils from healthy persons is increased when these cells are exposed to CF-containing postreperfusion samples from patients. Light emission was reduced to control values in the presence of superoxide dismutase. The burst of oxyradicals upon reperfusion is probably the initiating event of CF formation, which in turn leads to further oxyradical generation. This amplification process may explain why detectable levels of CF need a delay of at least 10 min. The activated state of neutrophils in ischemia reperfusion is at once a consequence and a source of CFs. Individual variation in the persistence of this clastogenic and leukocyte-activating material was observed. Therefore, antioxidants for prevention of ischemia reperfusion injury should be continued during the postoperative course. © 1995.","Chemiluminescence; Clastogenic factors; Free radicals; Ischemia reperfusion","clastogen; free radical; reactive oxygen metabolite; arachidonic acid metabolism; article; chemoluminescence; clinical article; coronary artery bypass graft; electron spin resonance; heart infarction size; human; ischemia; leukocyte activation; oxidative stress; priority journal; reperfusion; ultrafiltration; Antioxidants; Chemiluminescence; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Coronary Artery Bypass; Human; Inosine Nucleotides; Kinetics; Luminol; Mutagens; Myocardial Reperfusion; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Neutrophils; Superoxide Dismutase; Superoxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029088579

With theoretical considerations about the localized corrosion behaviour of substrate-coating systems it is possible to evaluate the porosity, the relative number of coating defects and their mean diameter. Their dependence on the process parameters gives an insight into the initial stages of film growth and shows that the energy deposition in the near-surface region is the most important factor for modifying coating defects and therefore the corrosion properties of the steel-aluminium system. The modification potential of each parameter of IBAD is studied in comparison to pure vapour deposition for the corrosion in acetate buffer. In chloride-containing aqueous solutions the depassivation behaviour of aluminium can be improved by use of alloying elements. Aluminium and magnesium were deposited on inert glass substrates; the magnesium concentration and the bombarding energy were varied. The resulting alloys have equilibrium potentials less noble than pure aluminium and increased passive regions. The passive region decreases with increasing magnesium concentration.

Except for different local pollution sources, the overall environmental problem is eutrophication. The eutrophic situation is caused by increased external load of nutrients during decades. Since nitrogen (N) is generally considered the main limiting nutrient for primary production in the Baltic Sea, the countries within the Baltic Sea drainage basin have agreed to reduce the anthropogenic waterborne input of N by 50% between 1987 and 1995. Furthermore, N emissions to the atmosphere are to be frozen at the level that existed at the end of the 1980s. A number of countries have also declared their intention to reduce N emissions to the atmosphere by 30% between 1980 and 1998. Presently, the annual N load to the Baltic Sea totals 1,409,000 tonnes, of which 980,000 tonnes (69%) are waterborne discharges (rivers, point and non-point sources), and 134,000 tonnes (10%) are caused by N2 fixation. The rest, 296,000 tonnes (21%) is atmospheric deposition on the sea surface. Some 60% of the atmospheric deposition is caused by emissions from sources in the drainage area and the rest is emissions from areas outside the drainage area. The highest acceptable future N load to the Baltic Sea is estimated at 600,000 tonnes/year. This means a necessary reduction of 57%, compared to the present load. Therefore, comprehensive load reductions must be conducted from anthropogenic sources, e.g. agriculture, forest and forestry, industry, and municipal sewage treatment plants and rural living. The atmospheric N deposition must be reduced by almost 40%, and the measures must focus on emission reductions in traffic, combustion, and agriculture. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","atmospheric deposition; Baltic Sea; critical load; eutrophication; load; Nitrogen; sources","anthropogenic effect; atmospheric deposition; eutrophication; nitrogen load; sea pollution; Baltic Sea; Ecology; Environmental impact; Industrial emissions; Mass transfer; Nitrogen; Surface waters; Water pollution control; Atmospheric deposition; Baltic sea; Drainage basin; Europlication; Marine environment; Water pollution; nitrogen; air pollution; conference paper; eutrophication; futurology; sea; ussr; water pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029633573

Carbon cycle models are readily used for 'forward' calculations of future CO2 given specified emissions and the 'inverse' problem of deducing the emissions required to achieve specified concentration profiles. However these approaches (a) are each geared to only one side of the problem; and (b) each requires the specification of a particular pathway in terms of either emissions or concentrations. These limitations can be avoided by analysing the relations between future emissions and concentrations of CO2 using a formalism that optimises over all possible future emission profiles, subject to relevant constraints on both emissions and concentrations. We present specific calculations indicating which combinations of upper bounds on concentrations and lower bounds on emissions are mutually inconsistent and which are consistent. We also calculate the (smaller) consistency regions that apply if emission reductions are restricted to less than 0.5% p.a. or less than 1% p.a.

Motivated by this observational result, we examine the possibility that all LINERs are powered by photoionization from a nuclear source, which is, however, active only for 20% of the time. We show that the decay times of low-ionization species can be of the order of one to a few centuries, and we demonstrate through time-dependent photoionization calculations that if the nuclear ionizing source is active for only a fraction of the time, this would not be readily noticeable in the emission-line spectrum. We suggest that the activity cycle is related to episodic accretion events which are associated with the tidal disruption of stars by a central black hole. The time interval between tidal disruptions is of the same order as the emission-line decay time, with the accretion episode following each disruption lasting a few decades. These estimates appear to support the duty cycle hypothesis.

The workshop was held at the Texas Medical Center on 4 February 1994 and featured presentations by distinguished academic, government, and industry scientists. This one-day session explored the impact of various environmental factors, including air toxics, on asthma incidence and exacerbation; an emphasis was placed on future research directions to be pursued in the asthma/air toxics area. A key research presentation on the association of air toxics and asthma, based on the study sponsored by NUATRC, was given by Dr. George Leikauf of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Additional presentations were made by H.A. Boushey, Jr., Cardiovascular Research Institute/University of California at San Francisco, who spoke on of the Basic Mechanisms of Asthma; K. Sexton, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, who spoke on hazardous air pollutants: science/policy interface; and D.V.

Yeung, of the Respiratory Division/University of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, discussed occupational health impacts on asthma. Doyle Pendleton, Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, reviewed air quality measurements in Texas. The information presented at the workshop suggested a possible association of asthma exacerbations with ozone and particulate matter (PM10); however, direct relationships between worsening asthma and air toxic ambient levels were not established. Possible respiratory health effects associated with air toxics will require considerably more investigation, especially in the area of human exposure assessment. Two major recommendations for future research resulted from this workshop and an accompanying NUATRC Scientific Advisory Panel meeting: a need for more complete individual personal exposure assessments so that accurate determinations of actual personal exposures to various pollutants can be made; and a need for field experiments utilizing biomarkers of exposure and effect to more accurately assess the extent and variability of the biological effects, if any, of individual air toxics.","Air pollution; Air toxics; Asthma; Respiratory disease","environmental chemical; ozone; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; asthma; conference paper; human; particulate matter; priority journal; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028820359

Since this program began, there have been numerous changes to the local, state and regional air quality regulations under which Edison operates. As a result, the program has evolved and expanded to include most of the fossil fuel generating units within the Edison service territory. Edison has attempted to meet these regulatory changes in the most cost effective manner. Using a variety of NOx control mechanisms, implemented throughout the period, Edison has taken a flexible approach to incorporating the latest technological developments. At the same time, lessons learned during each phase have been factored into succeeding phases of the program. Now that most of the NOx control devices have been installed and several years of operating experience have been gained, Edison would like to share that experience so that others might gain additional knowledge which may help in their NOx control programs.

Very recent γ(-ω; ω, ω, —ω) dispersion data for C60 are also simulated. The five all-carbon molecules studied are available in sufficient quantities to allow for direct experimental measurements. All the Orr Ward diagrams are included in the calculation. Both the real and the imaginary part of the response are calculated. The results show good agreement with the experimentally available data for C60 and C70. The calculated static second order hyperpolarizabilities of the five molecules studied scale with the fourth power of the mass of the cluster. At energies lower than the one-photon absorption, the calculated γ(—3ω; ω, ω, ω) dispersion of the five fullerenes shows at least major resonances. The analysis of the differences between computational theory and experiment is used to refine the prediction of the third harmonic generation dispersion of C76, and the two stable isomers of C84 for which no experimental data are as yet available. We estimate that the two lowest lying resonances for C76 and the two isomers of C84 should occur slightly above 1500 and 1100 nm. A “missing state” scheme is used to identify the electronic states responsible for the resonances. The two- and three-photon absorption spectra are also calculated. Further comparison of the calculated γ{—3ω; ω, ω, ω) dispersion with the two- and three-photon simulated spectra together with the calculated γ{—2ω; 0, ω, ω) dispersion allows one to fully ascertain the nature of the resonances. The simple picture based on the SOS model limited only to the resonant states is found to account well for the response in the THG dispersion of C60. Such a picture is nearly as successful for C70 but fails for higher fullerenes. A source of higher nonlinearity in C60 is also explored. This is the possibility of the absorption to Si and its subsequent NLO response.

Total plant WUE of A. vulneraria increased in elevated CO, and under water deficit: the UW plants in elevated CO., had higher WUE and reduced water loss. By contrast, thee was only an effect of water supply on S. minor: total plant WUE increased and water loss decreased in the UV plants in both CO2, treatments. Total apparent root length (ARL) of both species increased with CO2, enrichment and in UW S. minor total ARL was increased. By contrast, for A. vulneraria, total ARL of UV plants increased in ambient CO2, but decreased in elevated CO2 as compared with well‐watered (WW) plants. Shoot dry weight (SDW) and root dry weight increased in both species (WW and UW) with CO2. enrichment. For UW S. minor, SDW decreased relative to WW plants in both CO2 treatments. By contrast, ANOVA showed no significant effect of water supply on SDW of A. vulneraria. Leafier length increased in both species in elevated CO2, and decreased following drought.

Decreased leaf conductance has important implications for a number of components of CO2 responses, from the plant to the global scale. All of the factors that are sensitive to a change in soil moisture, either amount or timing, may be affected by increased CO2. The list of potentially sensitive processes includes soil evaporation, run‐off, decomposition, and physiological adjustments of plants, as well as factors such as canopy development and the composition of the plant and microbial communities. Experimental evidence concerning ecosystem‐scale consequences of the effects of CO2 on water use is only beginning to accumulate, but the initial indication is that, in water‐limited areas, the effects of CO2‐induced changes in leaf conductance are comparable in importance to those of CO,2‐induced changes in photosynthesis. Above the leaf scale, a number of processes interact to modulate the response of canopy or regional evapotran‐spiration to increased CO2. While some components of these processes tend to amplify the sensitivity of evapo‐transpiration to altered leaf conductance, the most likely overall pattern is one in which the responses of canopy and regional evapotranspiration are substantially smaller than the responses of canopy conductance. The effects of increased CO2 on canopy evapotranspiration are likely to be smallest in aerodynamically smooth canopies with high leaf conductances. Under these circumstances, which are largely restricted to agriculture, decreases in evapotranspiration may be only one‐fourth as large as decreases in canopy conductance. Decreased canopy conductances over large regions may lead to altered climate, including increased temperature and decreased precipitation. The simulation experiments to date predict small effects globally, but these could be important regionally, especially in combination with radiative (greenhouse) effects of increased CO2.

Often, only the amounts of solid wastes have been noted. This is unsatisfactory since treatment of solid waste, e.g. by landfilling or incineration, is an operation, requiring inputs and producing outputs, which should be described in the inventory of an LCA, in parallel to other operations. However, there are difficulties in describing emissions from solid waste treatments and there is a need for development of such methods. In this paper an approach for describing emissions from incineration and landfilling is outlined. Methodological questions concerning the time-frame and allocation principles are discussed. Methods for estimating potential emissions from landfilling of municipal solid waste and industrial wastes are suggested. The methods are used for calculating potential emissions from landfilling of some typical wastes. These emissions are compared with the emissions from other stages in the life cycle for some materials and wastes. it is shown that the potential emissions from landfilling are, for some products, of importance for the final results. Hence, if emissions from landfilling are neglected, or underestimated, results and conclusions in an LCA may be misleading. © 1996.","emissions; life cycle assessment; solid waste treatment","emission measurement; life-cycle assessment; methodological evaluation; solid waste; waste management; Calculations; Gas emissions; Land fill; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Life cycle assessment; Solid waste treatment; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029415398

The analysis demonstrates that emission controls on motor vehicles sold in the United States have been very effective in reducing commuter CO exposure. It is recommended that future studies of this kind be done routinely in cities nationwide to provide a more robust database for accurate estimates of commuter exposure. Such studies should relate human exposure measurements to estimates of emissions at study sites to document the progress of motor vehicle emission control programs.

Controls received aqueous sodium chloride (10 mL kg-1, 0.9% m/v) fol lowed by either HCP (180 mg kg-1) or vehicle alone. 4 Urine pH, body mass and body temperature were moni tored during the study and, at the conclusion of the experiment (12 h post-HCP dose), organ mass (liver, kidney, brain), and plasma, urine and tissue HCP concentrations were measured. 5 No clinical features of toxicity were observed in any group. However, sodium bicarbonate significantly reduced median HCP in liver — median plasma and kidney HCP concentrations were also reduced but not significantly. Conversely, ammonium chloride signifi cantly increased median HCP concentrations in liver and kidney — median plasma HCP was also increased but not significantly. 6 The results provide some support for the hypothesis that blood pH influences the tissue distribution of uncou plers of oxidative phosphorylation containing an acidic moiety.

In 1989, an east-west group of scientists initiated a multi-institutional research project on Acid Rain and Emissions Reduction in Asia, funded for the past two years by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Phase I, covering 23 countries of Asia, focussed on the development of PC-based software called the Regional Air Pollution INformation and Simulation Model (RAINS-ASIA). A 94-region Regional Energy Scenario Generator was developed to create alternative energy/emission scenarios through the year 2020. A long-range atmospheric transport model was developed to calculate dispersion and deposition of sulfur, based upon emissions from area and large point sources, on a one-degree grid of Asia.

The effects of temperature, pore size, and thermal motion of the adsorbent atoms are studied for a slit pore mouth model. Adsorption followed by surface diffusion to the pore mouth makes a significant contribution to the mass transfer when the temperature is low or, equivalently, when the adsorptive potential is strong. Thermal vibrations of the adsorbent atoms have little effect on the adsorption/surface diffusion mechanisms but cause fluctuations in the effective pore mouth area which can significantly affect transport rates. Perhaps the most important observation is that when the pore size approaches the kinetic diameter of the gas molecules, changes of a few percent in the pore size cause order-of-magnitude changes in the resistance. Therefore, it is possible that the surface barrier effect observed in zeolites and carbon molecular sieves is governed by highly localized (single atomic layer) structural details. © 1995 American Chemical Society.",,"Computer simulation; Mass transfer; Molecular dynamics; Molecular sieves; Simulation; Surface phenomena; Thermal effects; Zeolites; Dilute gas limit; Kinetic diameter; Molecular simulation; Surface barrier effects; Porous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029345532

This development is of considerable interest to the neurosurgeon planning procedures near brain regions involving specific functions. In the present study, rolandic and visual cortices were imaged with a conventional 1.5-tesla clinical MR imager using a spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state sequence. Two patients, one with a right frontal astrocytoma and the other with a left parietal meningioma, underwent MR imaging of rolandic cortex while performing a repetitive finger apposition task. Two patients with complex partial seizures referable to the temporal and occipital regions underwent MR imaging of visual cortex while exposed to repetitive photic stimulation (8.3 Hz). Significant signal intensity changes up to 15% between the activation and rest conditions were observed near the surgical targets at the expected anatomical location of the rolandic and visual cortices. In two of these cases activation measured by MR was compared and found similar to the activation measured at the same plane by H215O positron emission tomography (PET). These results suggest that functional MR and PET techniques can be used to obtain preoperative brain mapping in individual patients considered for neurosurgical procedures.","electrical stimulation; functional magnetic resonance imaging; motor cortex; positron emission tomography; rolandic cortex; visual cortex","adult; article; brain function; case report; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; female; human; male; motor cortex; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photostimulation; positron emission tomography; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; visual cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028848205

Air Waste Man. Ass. 41, 937-941) was tested for its ability to provide realistic microclimate descriptions within a deciduous forest in Canada. The microclimate description within plant canopies is required because isoprene emission rates from plants are strongly influenced by foliage temperature and photosynthetically active radiation impinging on leaves while monoterpene emissions depend primarily on leaf temperature. Model microclimate results combined with plant emission rates and local biomass distribution were used to derive isoprene and α-pinene emissions from the deciduous forest canopy. In addition, modelled isoprene emission estimates were compared to measured emission rates at the leaf level. The current model formulation provides realistic microclimatic conditions for the forest crown where modelled and measured air and foliage temperature are within 3°C. However, the model provides inadequate microclimate characterizations in the lower canopy where estimated and measured foliage temperatures differ by as much as 10°C. This poor agreement may be partly due to improper model characterization of relative humidity and ambient temperature within the canopy. These uncertainties in estimated foliage temperature can lead to underestimates of hydrocarbon emission estimates of two-fold. Moreover, the model overestimates hydrocarbon emissions during the early part of the growing season and underestimates emissions during the middle and latter part of the growing season. These emission uncertainties arise because of the assumed constant biomass distribution of the forest and constant hydrocarbon emission rates throughout the season. The BEIS model, which is presently used in Canada to estimate inventories of hydrocarbon emissions from vegetation, underestimates emission rates by at least two-fold compared to emissions derived from field measurements. The isoprene emission algorithm proposed by Guenther et al. (1993), applied at the leaf level, provides relatively good agreement compared to measurements. Field measurements indicate that isoprene emissions change with leaf ontogeny and differ amongst tree species. Emission rates defined as function of foliage development stage and plant species need to be introduced in the hydrocarbon emission algorithms. Extensive model evaluation and more hydrocarbon emission measurement;: from different plant species are required to fully assess the appropriateness of this emission calculation approach for Canadian forests. © 1995.","biogenic hydrocarbons; hydrocarbon emissions; isoprene; Microclimate; terpenes","biogenic isoprene emission; deciduous forest; field measurement; hydrocarbon emission; microclimate modelling; model; model evaluation; Canada; hydrocarbon; isoprene; terpene; algorithm; biomass; canada; conference paper; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; forest; humidity; microclimate; model; nonhuman; ontogeny; plant leaf; priority journal; season; species difference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028971272

In moderate to severe hypertensive patients, cerebral oxygen metabolism was diminished, although the patients were neurologically intact. In elderly hypertensives, white matter vascular lesions on brain imaging were more frequent and cognitive function was impaired, compared with age-matched normotensives. In non-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), local cerebral blood flow was decreased in the cortex and thalamus, compared with normotensive rats (NTR). Spatial memory and learning in maze tests were more impaired in aged SHR than in old NTR or young SHR. This inpairment was related to decreased cerebral glucose utilization in the medial septal nucleus, hippocampus, and other regions of the brain. Reduced cerebral blood flow, increased media thickness of the cerebral arteries and impaired cognitive function in SHR were improved by long-term antihypertensive treatment.

For sudden changes of feed rates of the reactant, it was shown possible to rapidly and efficiently transfer the heat of reaction by heat conduction to the catalyst wall, and to attain a stationary state in an extremely short time. Further, the rectangular wall reactor gave a uniform and stable temperature distribution in the reactor at the transient state. This effect was particularly remarkable in the case of combustion of methane. Thus, it was inferred that the rectangular wall reactor could be operated in safe and stable conditions for catalytic reaction systems with large heats of reaction. © 1995, The Japan Petroleum Institute.

The steady-state, end of test operation was 1500 rpm, 2.6 bar BMEP (25% load) and stoichiometric mixture. Four fuel systems were employed pintle-type port-injected gasoline, air-forced port-injected gasoline, port-injected propane, and premixed propane. These fuel systems were chosen to separate effects of fuel atomization, vaporization, and fuel-air mixing. Each system was optimized with respect to injector targeting, injection timing, mixture enrichment, and spark advance. Open-valve injection timing increased UHC emissions more with the pintle-type injector than with the air-forced, system. UHC emissions with propane injection were minimized with open valve injection. With gasoline, the air-forced (SMD < 10 μm) injector reduced, by 25% the total UHC emitted during the first two minutes of operation as compared to the pintle-type (SMD - 150 μm) injector and in terms of brake specific hydrocarbon emissions (BSHC). In terms of brake specific ozone forming potential (BSOFP), the reduction was 13%. With propane, additional reductions of 40% BSHC and 32% BSOFP were obtained. With all fuel systems, the additional UHC emissions during cold-start consisted of unburned fuel components and occurred mostly during the first 10 seconds, when the engine load had not yet stabilized. The main, difference between the UHC mass emissions from gasoline and propane was the absence of aromatics for the latter. It is argued that the causes of cold-start UHC emissions are primarily crevices and cold walls for premixed propane, to which mostly cycle-to-cycle injection variation must be added for injected propane. To those mechanisms, we must add oil layer and deposit effects for the air-forced injector, which acted as net sinks, rather than sources, in our case because clean oil was used. Finally, to all of the above sources, the required enrichment and the coarse spray must be added for the commonly used pintle-type injector. The most important overall conclusion is that cycle-resolved control of the equivalence ratio may be the most effective way of reducing cold-start UHC emissions. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Atomization; Brakes; Diesel engines; Fuel systems; Mixing; Mixtures; Propane; Vaporization; Equivalence ratios; Fuel atomization; Fuel-air mixing; Hydrocarbon emission; Injection timing; Ozone-forming potential; Separate effects; Stoichiometric mixtures; Gasoline",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072414871

The strategy for synthesis of these amphiphilic molecules involves incorporating CO2-philic segments that, for this study, are perfluorinated alkyl chains. These CO2-philic regions function like the hydrocarbon tails of conventional surfactant molecules used in liquid organic solvents. Synthesis and characterization of three different CO2 amphiphiles are reported. Subsequent small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements weee used to characterize the aggregation of these materials in supercritical CO2. Each of the three amphiphiles studied showed a different type of aggregation behavior. A graft copolymer consisting of a C02-philic backbone and CO2-phobic grafts associated into a micellar structure in the presence of water to promote hydrogen bonding. These aggregates contain approximately 600 grafts in the core. The commercially available surfactant perfluoroalkylpoly(ethylene oxide), or F(CF2)6-10CH2CH20(CH2CH20)3-3H, forms classic reverse micelle structures having radii of about 84 A under the conditions of high pressure required to solubilize the material. A third amphiphile, the semifluorinated alkane diblock molecule F(CF2)10(CH2)10H, may form small aggregates of at most 4 unimers per aggregate. The improved understanding of amphiphile aggregation in CO2 will aid in the development of new routes for polymer and organic synthesis in this relatively benign solvent. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Their market share in passenger cars, however, varies considerably between countries; depending on fuel prices, local fuel/car taxation and acceptability to private motorists. Pressures to reduce fuel consumption (CO2 emissions) and operational costs have increased the market share of diesel engines in new car sales to over 40% in some countries. At the same time diesel engine technology for trucks, buses and passenger cars has improved considerably with significantly higher performance, lower emissions and excellent customer acceptance. To reach all these goals, fuels, lubricants and coolants must meet high quality standards. In this respects fuel additives can contribute considerably to such performance aspects, and improve fuel quality in a cost effective manner. For example, ignition improvers lead to better combustion which results in lower exhaust emissions, better fuel economy and improved cold start performance. Similarly detergent additives keep vital engine components (particularly the fuel injectors) clean so that performance, fuel economy and emissions levels do not deteriorate over the life time of the engine. Both additives also lead to lower engine noise emissions. As another example, the conflicting demands for optimum combustion (which means high cetane quality paraffins) and low temperature operability, i.e. avoidance of paraffin waxing can be resolved by tailored cold flow additives. Additives can be used to enhance the lubricity of low sulphur fuels to protect rotary injection pumps and unit injectors. Finally, the handling aspects of diesel fuels can be improved for the customer through the use of anti foam additives to reduce filling times and fuel spillage. Diesel fuel additives therefore have the potential to improve the quality of diesel fuels with regard to emissions, noise, engine performance and customer perception whilst offering flexibility in the optimisation of refinery production costs. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Automobile drivers; Commerce; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Fuel economy; Ignition; Paraffins; Sales; Taxation; Temperature; Trucks; Additive technology; Anti-foam additives; Customer acceptance; Customer perceptions; Detergent additive; Engine performance; High-quality standards; Performance aspects; Fuel additives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072418460

In the work described in this article, four of the most important ICP operating parameters are optimized automatically: radio frequency (rf) power, intermediate Ar flow rate, nebulizer flow rate and sample uptake rate. Optimization of these parameters is based first on the response of the Ca II net signal and, independently, on the response of the Ca II net signal-to-background noise ratio ( S NB). Since the best height and off-axis positions of the designated response are known from the optimal two-dimensional response image, two spatial parameters are indirectly optimized through use of a CCD camera.

The geotherm was adjusted back to 2.5 Ga by keeping the surface temperature constant and calculating the temperature change at the top of convecting upper mantle. The reduced or mantle heat flux, which was treated as an adjustable parameter, was 20.9–21.3 mW/m2 at 1–2.5 Ga. Comparison of the calculated steady‐state geotherm with the available P‐T data of the Archaean (c. 2.5 Ga) charnockites and granulites from southern India suggests that the granulite facies metamorphism in this region had resulted from a major thermal perturbation, which was c. 400° C at 25 km. Seismic tomographic and gravity data essentially preclude any significant magma underplating of the granulitic crust in southern India. Previous workers have suggested that the formation of charnockites in this region was associated with copious CO2 influx from a deep‐seated source, possibly the mantle. In this work, we have evaluated both the transient and steady‐state thermal effects of the heat convected by CO2 outgassing from upper mantle. It is shown that the thermobarometric array of charnockites and granulites can be produced by the convective perturbation of the steady‐state geotherm, and that a flux of CO2 of ±90 mol/m2 yr (corresponding to Darcy velocity of ±0.30 cm/yr) for a period of ±30 Ma was needed to produce the required perturbation. This is c. 150 times the average CO2 flux through the tectonically active area of the Earth's crust at the present time. There is, however, an uncertainty of a factor of 3 in this value. Seismic tomographic and gravity data independently suggest thickening of the crust beneath the granulite terrane compared with the adjacent Dharwar craton. This suggests thermal perturbation due to overthrusting as a major potential cause for the granulite facies metamorphism in south India. Overthrusting of a 30–35‐km‐thick thrust block was needed to produce the required thermal effect. The estimated thickness of the original crust from geobarometric and seismic tomographic data south of the orthopyroxene isograd or ‘transition zone’is compatible with the emplacement of a thrust block of this magnitude. However, the latter fails to match the estimated pre‐uplift crustal thickness at the transition zone, if it is assumed that the crust has not thinned by non‐erosional processes since the Archaean. Thus, we propose a combination of overthrusting and CO2 fluxing from a deep‐seated source as the cause for the formation of charnockites in this zone. The required focusing of CO2 in this case is c. 40% of that estimated in the model where CO2 fluxing was considered to be the sole reason for thermal perturbation. This combined thrusting—CO2 fluxing model also helps explain the development of patchy charnockites in the transition zone from amphibolite facies rocks. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

However, there are regional changes between 1 × CO2 and 2 × CO2 runs which are similar for the mixed-layer and coupled models. These changes include shifts of centers of variability in the Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the Northern Hemisphere that are similar to changes in persistant height anomalies or ""blocking"" noted in a previous study. Changes in model configuration give rise to more extensive changes in the overall pattern of variation, with variability in Northern and Southern Hemispheres more tightly linked in the coupled model than in the mixed-layer model. We also computed EOFs using only model data for the tropics (between 30°N and 30°S). In these EOFs, differences between the two model configurations in terms of geographic centers of variability and time series power spectra are greater than between 1 × CO2 and 2 × CO2 cases. This is because the coupled model simulates some aspects of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) while the mixed-layer version does not. Consequently, different model configuration has a stronger effect on simulated interannual variability globally than does altered CO2 forcing. Because ENSO is not represented in the mixed-layer model, CO2-induced changes in variability are not credible in that model. For the coupled model, regional increases in variability, such as over the monsoon region of south Asia, are consistent with results from other analyses. We also evaluated CO2 sensitivity of the coupled model's seasonal cycle of surface air temperatures using a harmonic analysis. Strongly different seasonal cycles appear in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in the coupled model under different CO2 conditions. This phenomenon, noted in earlier studies with mixed-layer models, is apparently mostly due to snow and ice reductions with increased CO2 that contribute to a smaller-amplitude annual harmonic and larger-amplitude half-year harmonic of surface air temperature. Similar reductions in amplitude of the annual harmonic at high northern latitudes are noted in observed surface air temperature data in a recent period compared to an earlier period in this century. © 1995.",,"atmospheric circulation; carbon dioxide; climate modelling; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029538987

Bory which grows in the Central Negev Highlands of Israel is grazed by the black dwarf goat of the Bedouins. In order to study the role of R. maciformis in the cycling of metals in the Negev Desert, epilithic thalli growing on flintstones on western aspects of a hill were detached, put in fiberglass window-screen litterbags, and secured on the soil surface of western, southern, and northern aspects of the hill. Simultaneously, flintstones carrying lichen thalli were transferred from west-facing slopes of the hill to adjacent south-facing slopes, where epilithic thalli of R. maciformis were observed to grow in very small quantities. The concentration of the heavy metals were determined in the original lichen material at the beginning of the experiment, and in in situ and relocated thalli after a period of 14 months. The concentrations of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, and Pb in the upper soil layer on the different aspects were determined at the end of the experimental period. A comparison of the concentration of heavy metals in epilithic thalli of R. maciformis examined in the same study site a decade ago, and of present findings, reveals a regional increase of airborne Mn and Zn derived from local traffic. The concentration of heavy metals in thalli detached from stones and kept in litterbags was higher than in epilithic thalli. Thalli detached from stones and exposed on northern aspects of the hill contained less heavy metals than those kept on south-facing slopes. It is suggested that detached thalli derive heavy metals from the upper soil layer in addition to elements derived from airborne dust. The decreased concentration of Fe and Mn in epilithic thalli in the experiment period is explained by the enhanced number of washing and freezing actions in the two unusually cold and wet winters of 1990/1991 and 1991/1992. It is suggested that extreme climatic fluctuations regulate the accumulation of minerals in in situ epilithic thalli of desert lichens. © 1995 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",,"metal; article; biological monitoring; carbohydrate metabolism; desert climate; ecosystem; lichen; nonhuman; priority journal; soil pollution; Capra hircus; Ramalina; Ramalina maciformis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029034008

Using the annual proportional flow deviation as a measure of river regulation, the Paroo River catchment was assessed as unregulated, the Darling River catchment as mildly regulated and the Murrumbidgee River and River Murray catchments as highly regulated. A total of 11010 fish, representing nine native and three alien species, was caught during high and low flow seasons in the four catchments. Native species, such as golden perch Macquaria ambigua (Percichthyidae), bony herring Nematalosa erebi (Clupeidae) and spangled perch Leiopotherapon unicolor (Teraponidae), dominated fish communities in the Paroo and Darling catchments, but alien species, mostly carp, Cyprinus carpio (Cyprinidae), were also abundant. Both native and alien species were more abundant in these catchments after flooding, but there was little change in species composition between high and low flow seasons at the catchment level. Carp dominated communities in the Murray and Murrumbidgee catchments. There was a significant trend for reduced species diversity in increasingly regulated catchments. River regulation may alter the relative abundance of native and alien fish by desynchronizing environmental cycles and the reproductive cycles of native species. Ordination of species abundances showed discrete fish communities that reflect the geographical separation between catchments. Differences between communities are related to opportunities for dispersal, the environmental tolerances of dominant species and the modifying effects of river regulation. Fish communities in lakes exhibited less seasonal variation than riverine communities within the same catchment, indicating the greater seasonal stability of lakes compared with regulated and unregulated river reaches. Management of fish resources needs to include catchment‐specific strategies within current State and basin‐wide management programmes.

Due to the interaction with the core hole the lowest unoccupied n level splits from other empty levels. The energy position of this state is defined by the renormalized Coulomb interaction with the core hole and by the width of the unoccupied n band. The ratio of these two quantities determine whether the x-ray state is excitonic or not. It is shown that the conditions for excitcnic character are qualitatively different between occupied levels (x-ray emission) and unoccupied levels (x-ray absorption). From the specified normalization we find that only half an electron density of the unoccupied molecular orbital can be localized to the atom with the core hole, while in the x-ray emission case the electron density of the lowest occupied jr orbital can be totally localized. The degree of localization of the lowest unoccupied it level decreases when the length of the molecule increases. Contrary to lowest occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals the electron density of higher occupied (emissi on) and higher unoccupied (absorption) it orbitals is pushed out from the core excited atom for sufficiently large Coulomb interactions between core hole and valence shell. Strong site and size dependences of the intensity and frequency of excitonic peaks in x-ray absorption spectra are predicted, the site dependency being alternant for conjugated molecules. The model predicts strong depression of the absorption intensity for the it * levels along the polyene series in good accord with ah initio data. © 1995 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ab initio; Absorption intensity; Conjugated molecules; Core hole; Degree of localization; Energy position; Excited atoms; Excitonic peak; Orbitals; Size dependence; Valence shells; X-ray absorption spectrum; X-ray emission; X-ray exciton; X-ray spectra; Carrier concentration; Coulomb interactions; Electromagnetic wave emission; Electron density measurement; Electrons; Excitons; Molecular orbitals; Molecules; X ray absorption; X ray scattering; Conjugated polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010682207

The models are based on two existing general circulation models (GCMs) of the atmosphere, complemented with tracer formulations (sources, transport, mixing, deposition, etc.). The seasonal and shorter term variability of desert dust, sea salt,222Rn,210Pb, and7Be has been studied at the South Pole in Antarctica and at Summit in Greenland. This choice of tracers and test regions serves to focus on the interactions between atmospheric parameters (e.g. the strong and durable surface inversions characteristic of the ice sheets) and tracers, and to limit other influences such as source variability and chemistry. Comparison with available observations is not consistently favorable. Short-term variability in the atmosphere (222Rn and210Pb) appears qualitatively reasonable. Seasonal cycles are in some instances opposite to those observed, and mean deposition is clearly too high. The coarseness of model resolution at the high latitudes and the difficulty of setting up efficient formulations for microphysical tracer processes (e.g. dry and wet deposition) are major sources of problems. If these obstacles are overcome, the combined tracer/climate modelling approach can offer quantitative interpretation of the observed features of atmospheric contaminants, or sensitive tests of GCM simulated atmospheric circulation. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Since forest tree species are the primary emitters of BVOCs, it is important to develop reliable estimates of their areal coverage and BVOC emission rates. A new system is used to estimate these emissions in the Atlanta area for specific tree genera at hourly and county levels. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data and an associated urban vegetation survey are used to estimate canopy occupancy by genus in the Atlanta area. A simple canopy model is used to adjust photosynthetically active solar radiation at five vertical levels in the canopy. Lraf temperature and photosynthetically active radiation derived from ambient conditions above the forest canopy are then used to drive empirical equations to estimate genus level emission rates of BVOCs vertically through forest canopies. These genera-level estimates are then aggregated to county and regional levels for input into air quality models and for comparison with (1) the regulatory model currently used and (2) previous estimates for the Atlanta area by local researchers. Estimated hourly emissions from the three approaches during a documented ozone event day are compared. The proposed model yields peak diurnal isoprene emission rates that are over a factor of three times higher than previous estimates. This results in total BVOC emission rates that are roughly a factor of two times higher than previous estimates. These emissions are compared with observed emissions from forests of similar composition.

Based on the infrequency of plume contact at sites in the valley (as determined by SO2 measurements), it was believed that the contribution of the MPP to primary PM10 was minimal and that fugitive dust was the primary source of ambient particulate matter. To evaluate the magnitude of source contributors, PM10 measurements were made using a medium-volume sampler along with ancillary meteorological and air quality measurements in the Mohave Valley at Bullhead City, Arizona, for a period of longer than one year (September 1988 through mid-October 1989).

In the case of C+ + HD, the two components were found to have very similar rovibrational distributions as with the products from C+ + H2 and C+ + D2. In the P+ case, however, the rotational, although not the vibrational, distributions were found to be significantly different for the isotopically mixed and the pure reactions. The cross-sections showed an intermolecular isotope effect only for C+ + H2 vs. C+ + D2 at high energies. However, both with C+ + HD and P+ + HD, a very strong intramolecular isotope effect, i.e. an energy-dependent branching ratio, was observed: at low energies deuteride formation prevails, at high energies hydride. This behaviour is discussed in terms of an impulsive collision model, assuming the ""pairwise"" relative kinetic energy between the reacting atoms to be the determining factor. On the basis of the measured cross-section curves for the H2 and D2 reactions, the energy-dependent hydride/deuteride ratio in the HD reaction can then be predicted. The agreement with the experimental results is excellent in the P+ case, but only moderate for the C+ reactions. Even the P+ reaction, however, does not occur via the spectator stripping mechanisms. The spectra show an energy-independent vibrational excitation, contrary to the stripping model assumption. The impulsive model was also extended to an analysis of the relative mean product angular momenta. Again it performs well for P+ + H2, D2, HD, but cannot fit the C+ + HD case. © 1995.","Carbon ion reactions; Chemiluminescence; Ion/molecule reactions; Isotope effect; Phosphorus ion reactions",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001789396

Recently, it has been postulated that the Cenozoic increase in the seawater 87Sr86Sr isotopic ratio was associated with the uplift of the Himalayan and Andean mountains at that time. These orogenies may have changed the Sr isotopic ratio of the continental rocks undergoing weathering (as a result of extensive metamorphism), increased the river flux of Sr through enhanced weathering in these regions and possibly caused the global climatic cooling trend of the Cenozoic. A model of the major geochemical cycles coupled to an energy balance climate model is used to explore the possible causes of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic fluctuations in the seawater 87Sr86Sr isotopic ratio. The contribution of the mantle exchanges at mid-ocean ridges, of the recycling of seafloor carbonates through plate margin volcanism and of the alteration of seafloor basalts to the fluctuations of the seawater 87Sr86Sr isotopic ratio are studied. Finally, this model tentatively describes the impact of the Himalayan orogeny on the geochemical cycles of Sr and C. Some possible effects of the extensive metamorphism associated with the India-Asia collision and of the Himalayan uplift are modelled. The model reproduces the Cenozoic increase of the seawater 87Sr86Sr isotopic ratio. However, the impact of the Himalayan orogeny on the C cycle appears to be limited and insufficient to generate the global climatic cooling of the Cenozoic. Rather, in the model, the Cenozoic cooling is mostly due to the reduction of the CO2 emission from mid-ocean ridge volcanism and to changes in the chemical weathering rates in the rest of the world excluding the Himalayas. © 1995.",,"Cainozoic; carbon; climate model; continental erosion; geochemical cycle; mantle exchange; mantle exchanges; palaeochemistry; seawater; strontium; strontium isotopes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029476380

The expected Pt(II) products of these reductive elimination reactions, dppePtMe2 (2) and dppePtMeI (3), are also observed. In the presence of added iodide (in acetone-d6), the carbon–carbon bond forming reductive elimination reaction is substantially inhibited, and an equilibrium is established between 1 and the carbon–iodide reductive elimination products, 2/MeI. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the reductive elimination of methyl iodide from 1 were measured under these conditions (ΔH = 66 ± 3 kJ/mol, ΔS = 153 ± 7 J/(mol·K); ΔHre‡ = 104 ± 1 kJ/mol, ΔSre‡ = –12 ± 1 J/(mol·K)).

Mechanistic studies of the solution thermolysis support the involvement of a common five-coordinate cationic intermediate (formed by dissociation of iodide), from which both carbon–carbon and carbon–iodide elimination products result.

Carbon monoxide chemisorption measurements show that a loss of exposed metal area occurs during the activation procedure, even though the conditions do not favour platinum sintering. Following activation (and subsequent exposure to air at ambient temperature), the surface ceria is left in a highly reducible state, which is characterised by a subambient peak during temperature-programmed reduction. We envisage that the strong interaction arises according to a traditional SMSI model, by the migration of partially reduced ceria over the surface of the platinum particles (at ≥ 600°C). The resultant high degree of contact between the metal (with high work-function) and the metal oxide (with high band gap) promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies on the ceria surface. Although the presence of this highly reducible ceria-covering blocks conventional three-way sites on the platinum, it provides new sites that are active even at low temperatures. Therefore, unlike most previous explanations of promotion caused by a strong interaction, we propose that the 'support' becomes the active phase. Re-oxidation at elevated temperatures causes the ceria covering to coalesce, leading initially to its partial thinning, and subsequently to the re-exposure of the platinum particles. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

The ratio in this reduction is somewhat less than in that of the previously reported monoaza N-oxide 2-0, which is attributed to the effect of hyperconjugation in the initial state of 3-0. If the parent diaza ketone 4 is reduced first to the corresponding diaza alcohol 5 and if this is then oxidized to 6-0, the Z-isomer is the principal product.

Prediction of sunspot numbers in advance of the actual event has proven problematic with most methods failing due to nonlinearities in solar activity. An approach using the generation of a feedforward neural network may resolve some of the difficulties inherent in currently utilized statistical and precursor approaches since feedforward networks offer a useful and practical method of approximating nonlinear relations and their derivatives without knowing the actual underlying nonlinear function.

Climatic change not only affects the potential yield levels, but it may also modify the effects of pests and diseases. Modelling can serve as a tool to integrate these processes, ranging from simple removal of plant material to subtle toxic and hormonal effects. Modelling can help to quantify different modes of action such as on photosynthesis, root activity, assimilate partitioning, morphology, and their interactions. As to climatic change, little is known about pests, diseases and weeds. If climatic change causes a gradual shift of agricultural regions, crops and their associated pests, diseases and weeds will migrate together, though at different rates maybe. To a limited extent, new outbreaks can be foreseen given the changed environmental conditions. Methodology is available, and some interesting results are on record. Specific changes such as an increase in the CO2 content in the air and in UV radiation are not likely to have large effects. Increasing atmospheric CO2 reduces crop nitrogen content, which may retard many pests and diseases, and change the composition of the weed flora which accompanies crops.

The function of the linker region connecting the C-terminal end of the heme domain to the N-terminal end of the reductase domain has been studied by deleting parts of the linker and changing the sequence of the linker. Deleting three or six residues or changing an Arg-Lys-Lys stretch in the middle of the linker to Ala-Ala-Ala does not alter the functional properties of either domain. The mutants retain full cytochrome c and ferricyanide reductase activities characteristic of the P450 reductase domain. The heme domain in the mutants retains its ability to bind a fatty acid substrate giving the full low-to-high spin shift and exhibits the normal 450 nm absorption band characteristic of the reduced carbon monoxide complex. However, the six amino acid deletion mutant exhibits nearly undetectable levels of fatty acid hydroxylase activity, the three amino acid deletion mutant about 10% activity, and the three Ala substitution mutant about 50% activity. The mutants also exhibit slower rates of reductase-to-heme electron transfer rates that correlate with the loss in fatty acid hydroxylase activity.

Modifications were made to the existing 1.8 ML facultative pond in order to further optimize methane fermentation and to demonstrate the recovery of methane using a submerged gas collector. Methane production rates were determined over a range of in-pond digester loadings and temperatures. The feasibility of submerged gas collection was proven, and the advantages of in-pond digestion in terms of BOD5 and VSS removal as well as biogas scrubbing were quantified. Biogas methane concentrations increased by more than 50% as the biogas emerged through the overlying water column and most of the carbon dioxide fraction was utilized by microalgae. Electrical power requirements for mixing two 0.1 hectare algal High Rate Ponds (HRPs) were measured over a range of channel depths and velocities, and electrical power requirements for daily recirculation pumping were also measured. Oxygenation and total treatment energy requirements for the second generation AIWPS prototype at Richmond were compared with oxygenation and total treatment energy requirements for the fast generation AIWPS at St. Helena, California and for two mechanical wastewater treatment plants of comparable capacity and effluent quality at Pinole and Brentwood, California. Using preliminary methane production and recovery rates achieved at Richmond the cogeneration potential was estimated and projected for larger second generation AIWPSs of 2 MLD and 200 MLD capacities. By incorporating methane recovery and electrical power generation together with efficient HRP mixing using paddle wheels, full-scale second generation AIWPSs will be able to produce as much energy as they require for primary and secondary treatment. Additional energy would be required to produce a tertiary disinfected effluent suitable for unrestricted reuse in California, including recreational and indirect potable reuse.

In the present paper, we examine the daily (interdiurnal) variability of surface temperature and precipitation in Europe simulated by a version of the UK Meteorological Office (Hadley Centre) general circulation model, having 11 levels in the vertical and a horizontal resolution of 2.5°latitude × 3.75° longitude, coupled to a slab ocean, in the current climate and the equilibrium climate for a doubled atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. We evaluate the simulation of current conditions by comparison with climatologies and time‐series of observed data. In the modified climate, we find reductions in temperature variability in winter, related to a lessened land‐sea temperature contrast, and increases in summer, caused by changes in the surface heat balance. Precipitation in all seasons shows significant tendencies both to more dry days and to heavier events, with less frequent moderate daily amounts; this is connected with an increase in convective activity. We conclude that simulation of daily variability is strongly dependent on particular local physical processes and hence on the parametrizations used to represent them. While acknowledging deficiencies in the model's performance, we consider that our results are indicative of possible changes for a future climate.

The distribution of Babesia follows the dissemination of the tick vector. Seroepidemiological studies showed that enzootic instability exist in herds i several areas of the region. However, clinical cases occurred less frequently than expected. The babesial tick infection rate is related to the vector abundance which in turn is regulated by climatie. Bos indicus cattle, because of tick resistance, are less likely to be infected by the vector. This can results in herd instability, but clinically is partly compensated by the resistance of Bos indicus and their crosses to babesiosis. Excessive use of acaricides and rotational grazing appears to be related to outbreaks of babesiosis especially in dairy cattle. Factors involved in the epidemiology and transmission of anaplasmosis are not well defined. The role of ticks, haematophagous diptera, iatrogenic and intrauterine transmissions needs to be investigated under local conditions. Therefore, the knowledge of this disease in meager.

The instances of severe ground-level fumigations that caused acute damage to vegetation in an area of approximately 1,000 km2 have been nearly completely eliminated. Significant improvements in water quality have also occurred in many of the estimated 7,000 acid-damaged lakes. Several species of acid-sensitive phytoplankton, Zooplankton and insects have invaded lakes where improvements have occurred. Epiphytic lichens have reinvaded the former ""lichen desert"" that once extended out 7 km from the smelters. Sensitive species such as Evernia mesomorpha and Usnea hirta now exist throughout the area. The vascular plant communities have been relatively slow to recover in the most severely damaged terrestrial areas. Metal-tolerant grasses (e.g. Agrostis scabra. Deschampsia caespitosa) were the first species to invade the barrens. Acid- and metal-contamination of soil, severe microclimate conditions, and the damaging effects of insect pests appear to delay recovery of terrestrial ecosystems.

In control animals breathing room air and animals exposed to an elevated level of inspired CO2, steady‐state CSF/plasma ratios for all permeability markers were proportional to their free diffusion coefficient. Steady‐state CSF/plasma ratios in newborn animals were significantly higher than in adult animals, and at all ages the ratios for animals exposed to CO2 were higher than the ratios in control animals. In contrast to the increased steady‐state CSF/plasma ratios in animals exposed to elevated levels of inspired CO2, there was no significant difference in short‐term (10 min after i.v. injection) CSF/plasma ratios for [14C]L‐glucose between 10‐ to 20‐day‐old control rats and rats of similar age exposed to 10% inspired CO2.

The lack of effect of raised CO2 on short‐term CSF/plasma ratios indicates that the significant increases in steady‐state CSF/plasma ratios, in animals exposed to elevated levels of inspired CO2, are not due to a general increase in the permeability of the blood‐CSF or blood‐brain barriers; they are likely to be accounted for by CO2‐induced reductions in the rate of CSF secretion. © 1995 The Physiological Society",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029164062

The method is based on the isolation of one or more components of remanent magnetization within the core. These provide records of the direction of magnetic north, either for recent times (carried by magnetic overprints in the recent geomagnetic field at the drill site) or at the time of formation of the sediment (carried by the primary magnetization). Provided that any spurious components of magnetization associated with drilling are removed by appropriate analysis in the palaeomagnetism laboratory, then the magnetic components of interest can be separately isolated. The mean direction of stable remanent magnetization, averaged over several tens of centimetres of core, defines the direction of geographical north in that core section. For a recent component, the direction of north is specified directly, whereas for an ancient component this is given by reference to the direction predicted from published apparent polar wander curves for that plate or geographical region. An important attribute of the palaeomagnetic core reorientation method is that the measurements are made on samples from the cores themselves, rather than by downhole instruments such as multishot orientation tools, dipmeters or imaging tools. This makes the technique particularly cost-effective and frees it from reliance on the proper performance of downhole tools or the correlation of planar features observed in the cores with those in the well. Consequently, there is no requirement for the well to be deviated or for there to be a significant natural dip to the formation (although this does help in fitting adjacent core pieces together to allow extrapolation of the reorientation data to longer intervals of core). Furthermore, as the determinations are made directly on the cores, the precision of palaeomagnetic reorientation is inherently greater than for methods based on measurements made in the well. It is possible to apply the method to cores for which the need for orientation was not apparent at the time of drilling, but for which this need arises as a result of later developments. The technique can be applied equally well to recently drilled cores or cores which have been stored for many years. An account is given of the palaeomagnetic reorientation method and its applications to (1) defining fracture orientations and (2) establishing sediment transport directions in a channel sand body. The transport directions are inferred from magnetic fabric measurements and the principles of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility technique are briefly reviewed. © 1995 The Geological Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052683659

Episodes of apnoea are accompanied by hypoxaemia as well as hypercapnia. As CO2 constitute a major regulatory factor controlling cerebral blood flow, it is likely that changes in cerebral perfusion are to be found in patients with SAS, which may be related to nocturnal stroke. A computer‐assisted pulsed (2 mHz) Doppler ultrasonography system has been modified for continuous long‐term and on‐line recording of cerebral haemodynamics together with simultaneous polysomnography, continuous blood pressure recordings, and measurement of the end‐expiratory CO2. The dynamics of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) during sleep were measured in the right middle cerebral artery in 10 SAS patients. CBFV showed a characteristic nocturnal pattern with decreases during non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and increases during REM sleep. Changes in sleep stage patterns as well as awakenings from NREM sleep were not regularly accompanied by corresponding changes in CBFV. Dramatic increases in CBFV could be observed during apnoeic episodes, with maximum increases during REM sleep. CO2 reactivity and changes in CBFV related to apnoea duration were markedly increased during sleep compared with the waking state in SAS patients. The dynamic feature of CBFV in relation to sleep patterns reflects quantitative uncoupling between cerebral electrical activity and cerebral perfusion during sleep in SAS patients as has been previously reported for normal subjects (Hajak et al. 1994). It supports a dissociation in the activity of central regulatory mechanisms during human sleep which might cause abnormal cerebral perfusion under certain circumstances. The increased CO2 reactivity during sleep in SAS suggests a ‘hypersensitivity’ of intracranial vasoactive receptors and/or disturbances in the central autonomic control of cerebrovascular functions. It may be concluded that, under certain conditions, the interaction of decreased cerebral perfusion in SAS patients with sleep‐related cerebral perfusion patterns and haemodynamic changes during apnoeic episodes might lead to a critical reduction in cerebral perfusion. © 1995 European Sleep Research Society","cerebral blood flow velocity; sleep apnoea syndrome; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography","adult; brain blood flow; clinical article; conference paper; controlled study; doppler flowmetry; human; priority journal; sleep apnea syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029056381

Traditional regulations require installation of specified emission control equipment that varies among power plants. These regulations do not specify that utilities first dispatch the cleanest power plants as demand varies from peak to off-peak periods. This empirical analysis shows, for 2 years out of 20, that demand-side management (DSM) programs increase air pollution. One reason for this result is that regulations require installation of specific emission-control technology but do not provide the incentive to take actual emissions or their air quality impacts into account when operating the system. For certain types of air pollutants and in some regions, regulatory programs now include markets for tradable emission credits. Such programs may alter this incentive. © 1995.",,"Air Pollution; Power Stations; Air pollution control equipment; Air quality; Energy efficiency; Nitrogen oxides; Power plants; Demand side management; Emission control; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029159678

When produced in an efficient and sustainable manner, biomass energy has numerous environmental and social benefits compared with fossil fuels. These include waste control, nutrient recycling, job creation, use of surplus agricultural land in industrialized countries, provision of modern energy carriers to rural communities of developing countries, improved land management, and a reduction of CO2 levels. Using biomass to substitute for fossil fuels is afar more effective use of available land than simply growing trees as a carbon store. Biomass fuels can form part of a matrix of renewable fuel sources that increases the energy available for economic development in developing countries. In OECD Europe it is calculated that a potential of 9.0–13.5 EJ could be produced in 2050 on available land, which represents 17–30 per cent of projected total energy requirements. © 1995, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Plant biomass can be used to absorb carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, or it can be converted into modem energy carriers such as electricity, and liquid and gaseous fuels. Biomass supplies 13% of the world's energy consumption (55 EJ, 1990), and in some developing countries it accounts for over 90% of energy use. There is considerable potential for the modernisation of biomass fuels through improved utilisation of existing resources, higher plant productivities and efficient conversion processes using advanced technologies. The interest in bioenergy is increasing rapidly, and it is widely considered as one of the main renewable energy resources of the future due to its large potential, economic viability, and various social and environmental benefits. In particular, biomass energy is among the most favourable options for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Most of the perceived problems such as land availability, environmental impact, economic viability, and efficiency can be overcome with good management. The constraints to achieving environmentally-acceptable biomass production are not insurmountable, but should rather be seen as scientific and entrepreneurial opportunities which will yield numerous advantages at local, national and international levels in the long term. © 1995, All rights reserved.",,"Carbon dioxide; Charge carriers; Economic and social effects; Energy conversion; Energy management; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Renewable energy resources; Biomass energy; Biomass fuels; Biomass production; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy carriers; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029352498

The exist gas NO emissions were found to be affected by the addition of sulphur to the fuel to an extent which was dependent on the fuel sulphur to nitrogen ratio, burner operating conditions and fuel type. The increase in fuel-NO emission, at a particular operating condition, due to sulphur addition, was in most cases linearly dependent on the sulphur concentration in the fuel. When the burner was operated in low NO, mode by staging the combustion air, the interactions were found to be dependent on the primary-zone fuel/air equivalence ratios, with greater enhancement observed for fuel-rich conditions. A practical consequence of these results is that the possible reductions in the NO emission by staging are dependent among other factors on the sulphur content of the fuel since the sulphur appears to be reducing the efficiency of the NO reduction processes in the locally fuel-rich regions of the air-staged flame. Thermal-NO emissions were reduced with sulphur addition for fuel-lean operation of the primary stage but were relatively unaffected when operating fuel-rich. Comparative studies using SO2 as the sulphur additive produced similar results, but the magnitude of the changes in the NO emission was less than that found using tetrahydrothiophene. The effect of sulphur on the NO emissions from combustion of other liquid fuels (containing natural, rather than added fuel nitrogen) was also studied using tetrahydrothiophene, tert-butyldisulphide and SO2 as the sulphur dopants. © 1995, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

From this enrichment a sulfate- reducing, demethylating, spore-forming organism, classified as Desulfotomaculum orientis, was isolated. It cleaves the phenylether bonds of methyxylated aromatic compounds, producing the corresponding hydroxylated derivatives. The organism ferments the carbon of methoxy-groups as well as methanol to acetate using carbon dioxide as electron acceptor. In the presence of sulfate, methoxy carbon and methanol are completely oxidized to CO2 coupled to the formation of hydrogen sulfide. Growth yields under fermenting conditions are 4.0 to 6.4 g of dry cell mass per mol of methanol or methoxy-carbon consumed. Under sulfate reducing conditions the corresponding values are 4.8 to 8.2 g for methanol and methoxy-carbon. The acetyl-CoA pathway is proposed as the main metabolic route for assimilation and dissimilation of these C1-substrates. Acetate added to the culture medium cannot be utilized and it is not needed to promote growth in solely C-1 substrate containing media neither under sulfate-reducing nor under fermenting conditions. The ability of Desulfotomaculum orientis to endure unfavorable environmental conditions through sporulation, its versatility with regard to substrate utilization and its metabolic flexibility make it well adapted to be a member of transient anoxic fresh water sediment communities. © 1995, Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena GmbH.

Since that review, a number of papers describing calorimetric measurements examining plant growth, stress responses and effects of temperature have appeared. This recent work is reviewed here. In addition to the experimental work, a mechanistic model linking respiration rates to growth has been published. This model is derived from both mass and enthalpy balance equations. It describes specific growth rate and substrate carbon conversion efficiency as functions of the metabolic heat rate, the rate of CO2 production, the mean oxidation state of the substrate carbon produced by photosynthesis, and enthalpy changes for conversion of photosynthate to biomass and CO2. Application of this model to understanding the basis for variation in growth rates among individual genotypes in plants is reviewed. The effects of environment on the plant respiration-growth relation has been an important focus for plant calorimetry studies. Climatic temperature is one of the most important variables determining growth. Extremes of temperature determine limits of growth, and diurnal variation and mean temperature have a major influence on growth rate. Calorimetric measurements of respiratory rates as a function of temperature can be used to relate the temperature influence on respiratory metabolism to the temperature influence on growth rate. These studies have also discovered the existence of an isokinetic point within the range of normal growth temperatures. Studies of temperature dependence are reviewed and the results analyzed in terms of the recently published mechanistic model. © 1995.","Calorimetry; Climate; Model; Plant; Respiration; Temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001031760

The discussion will start with a review of shifting market profiles as defined by API performance categories and proprietary original equipment manufacturer (OEM) requirements in North America. New performance specifications include API CG-4, CF-2, CF and PC-7. The key elements of these upgrades are changing lubricant quality to meet the design changes necessary to comply with greatly reduced exhaust emissions and modern engine technology. Such design changes bring higher operating temperatures, reduced oil consumption and higher levels of oilborne soot which combine to require higher performance lubricating oils. Following the same format, the current market profile and technical issues surrounding diesel engine technology in Europe will also be reviewed. This will include recent industry (OEM) developments, as well as new Association des Constructeurs Europeenes d' Automobiles (ACEA) diesel specifications such as TD1, TD2, TD3 and TD4.

Physiol., 91: 207-226, 1993). Ventilatory and circulatory responses to manipulation of peripheral vascular pressures in the hind limbs of anaestetized (sodium thiopental) sheep were examined. Inflatable balloons were placed at the caudal ends of the abdominal aorta and the vena cava (Vc). Aortic (Ao) occlusion induced a consistent normocapnic decrease in minute ventilation (V̇e). In contrast, V̇e increased significantly during vena cava obstruction, leading to hypocapnia. Small changes in systemic blood pressure were observed (+ 7 mmHg for Ao occlusion and -12 mmHg during Vc obstruction). Moreover, inflation of the caval balloon superimposed on a previously established Ao occlusion, preventing venous drainage of an astomotic inflow, resulted in a significant rise in distal vascular pressures with trivial changes in systolic blood pressure. This led to a gradual rise of V̇e, despite further reduction of the CO2 flux to the lungs. The subsequent deflation of the aortic balloon, exposing the hindlimb vasculature to aortic pressure, resulted in an even more profound hypocapnic hyperpnea. The concurrent arterial blood pressure changes were too small to possibly involve the ventilatory component of the arterial baroreflex. We therefore hypothesize, that perfusion-related afferent signals within the muscles could contribute to respiratory homeostasis by maintaining ventilation of the lungs commensurate with the circulatory state of the muscular apparatus. © 1995.","Blood pressure, muscle, effects on ventilation; Control of breathing, muscle afferents; Mammals, sheep; Perfusion, muscle, effects on ventilation","animal experiment; aorta occlusion; article; breathing muscle; controlled study; female; lung ventilation; nonhuman; priority journal; respiration control; vasodilatation; Afferent Pathways; Animal; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessels; Female; Hindlimb; Muscle, Skeletal; Respiration; Sheep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028821146

The sites cover a variety of Arctic types: snow covered, bog and arid. The measurements show a comparatively small variation of the driving variables: solar radiation, wind and humidity, but a large variation in the net radiation and surface fluxes. The net radiation is much reduced in the snow covered areas because of the high albedo, ameliorated to some extent by a reduced longwave emission. The turbulent fluxes are also small over the snow covered areas, an effect of the smooth surface and low surface temperature. The sensible heat flux at these sites is downward. The evaporation fluxes in the snow‐free areas are strongly affected by the availability of soil‐water, thus in the arid, eastern site the evaporation is small. Simple flux‐gradient equations appear to be able to describe the surface fluxes adequately, especially considering the comparatively large error in these types of data. The relevance of these data to the parameterization of Arctic surfaces in global models is discussed.

The fuel used to produce the deposits minimized the development of deposits in the intake system, so that primarily the effect of combustion chamber deposits were considered in this study. The six chemically defined fuels investigated were based on an iso-octane and toluene mix (base fuel). Methyl tertiary butyl ether, cyclohexane, diisobutylene, 1,2,4 trimethylbenzene and ethylbenzene were added to this base fuel to form five tertiary fuel mixtures. Engine-out emissions of speciated hydrocarbons, NO x, CO and CO2 were measured for the base fuel and five tertiary fuel mixtures in both the deposit-free and deposited state. NO x emissions were seen to increase relative to the base fuel for the cyclohexane and ethylbenzene tertiary fuel mixtures. Nine major hydrocarbon emissions were found with engine runs on the base fuel, representing the partial oxidation products of iso-octane and toluene. The five tertiary fuel mixtures affected the distribution of the hydrocarbon emissions and in some case added new emissions. Most oxidation products were found to decrease with increasing load. Unburned fuel represented one-third to one-half of the hydrocarbon emissions. After the development of combustion chamber deposits approximately a 30% increase in NOx emissions was observed. Also, unburned hydrocarbon emissions were found to increase approximately 25% with combustion chamber deposits. The extent to which combustion chamber deposits affected hydrocarbon emissions was found to be dependent on fuel structure. These findings indicate that the interaction of fuel structure with combustion chamber deposits should be considered in the development of reformulated gasolines if targeted emissions are to be maintained over the life of a vehicle. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Combustion chambers; Cyclohexane; Deposits; Engines; Ethylbenzene; Hydrocarbons; Ignition; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum deposits; Polyols; Toluene; 1 , 2 , 4-trimethylbenzene; Combustion chamber deposits; Engine-out emissions; Hydrocarbon emission; Methyl tertiary butyl ether; Oxidation products; Partial oxidation products; Unburned hydrocarbons; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072410747

The fungi colonize the cortex of the root to obtain carbon from their plant host, while assisting the plant with the uptake of phosphate and other mineral nutrients from the soil2–5. This association is beneficial to the plant, because phosphate is essential for plant growth and development, especially during growth under nutrient-limiting conditions2,6–8. Molecular genetic studies of these fungi and their interaction with plants have been limited owing to the obligate symbiotic nature of the VA fungi, so the molecular mechanisms underlying fungal-mediated uptake and translocation of phosphate from the soil to the plant remain unknown. Here we begin to investigate this process by identifying a complementary DNA that encodes a trans-membrane phosphate transporter (GvPT) from Glomus versiforme, a VA mycorrhizal fungus. The function of the protein encoded by GvPT was confirmed by complementation of a yeast phosphate transport mutant. Expression of GvPT was localized to the external hyphae of G. versiforme during mycorrhizal associations, these being the initial site of phosphate uptake from the soil. © 1995 Nature Publishing Group.",,"carbon; complementary dna; mineral; mutant protein; phosphate; protein; article; crop; fungus; glomus versiforme; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nutrient; phosphate transport; plant growth; plant root; priority journal; soil; yeast; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Carrier Proteins; DNA, Complementary; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression; Genes, Fungal; Genetic Complementation Test; Kinetics; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phosphate-Binding Proteins; Phosphates; Plant Roots; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Symbiosis; Transformation, Genetic; Zygomycota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028885499

Irrespective of metabolic interventions, a change in CO2 from 1 to either 11 or 5% of the gas mixture perfusing the muscle bath with 15 mmol·l-1 HCO-3caused a drop of intracellular pH from 7.4 to either 6.5 or 7.0, respectively. An elevation of CO2 to 11% diminished the rate of anaerobic lactate formation and slightly lowered anaerobic energy degradation. The further addition of 1 mmol·l-1 iodoacetate to inhibit glycolysis strongly enhanced the tendency of acidosis to lower energy degradation. Moreover, iodoacetate induced a parallel decrease in ATP and total concentration of phosphorylated adenylates and an increase in resting tension. These effects were all substantially dampened by acidosis and could not immediately be related to tissue content of ""energy-rich"" phosphates. Tentatively, the depression of resting tension was the prime effect and a cause of the other effects acidosis. However, these were not affected by an inhibition of resting tension development with 2,3-butadione monoxime. The results suggest that glycolysis protects the anaerobic myocardium also by means not immediately related to tissue energy state. Acidosis exerts a similar protection, which is marginal as long as glycolysis is fully active, but substantial with an inhibited glycolysis. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Acidosis; Energy turnover; Glycolysis; Metabolic inhibition; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Rainbow trout",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028835841

It was under strict redox control. In spinach leaves, high intensity flashes given every 50 s on top of far-red, but not on top of red background light decreased the activity of Photosystem II (PS II) in the absence of appreciable linear electron transport even when excitation of PS II by the background light was extremely weak. Downregulation of PS II was a consequence of cyclic electron transport as shown by differences in the redox state of P700 in the absence and the presence of CO2 which drained electrons from the cyclic pathway eliminating control of PS II. In the presence of CO2, cyclic electron transport comes into play only at higher photon flux densities. At H+/e=3 in linear electron transport, it does not appear to contribute much ATP for carbon reduction in C3 plants. Rather, its function is to control the activity of PS II. Control is necessary to prevent excessive reduction of the electron transport chain. This helps to protect the photosynthetic apparatus of leaves against photoinactivation under light stress. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","9-aminoacridine fluorescence; chlorophyll fluorescence; cyclic electron transport; light scattering; photosynthesis; transthylakoid proton gradient",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000553464

Analysis of the FBP1 promoter revealed two upstream activating elements, UAS1(FBP1) and UAS2(FBP1), which confer carbon source-dependent regulation on a heterologous reporter gene. On glucose media neither element was activated, whereas after transfer to ethanol a 100-fold derepression was observed. This gene activation depended on the previously identified derepression genes CAT1 (SNF1) (encoding a protein kinase) and CAT3 (SNF4) (probably encoding a subunit of Cat1p [Snflp]). Screening for mutations specifically involved in UAS1(FBP1) derepression revealed the new recessive derepression mutation cat8. The cat8 mutants also failed to derepress UAS2(FBP1), and these mutants were unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. The CAT8 gene encodes a zinc cluster protein related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4p. Deletion of CAT8 caused a defect in glucose derepression which affected all key gluconeogenic enzymes. Derepression of glucose-repressible invertase and maltase was still normally regulated. A CAT8-lacZ promoter fusion revealed that the CAT8 gene itself is repressed by Cat4p (Mig1p). These results suggest that gluconeogenic genes are derepressed upon binding of Cat8p, whose synthesis depends on the release of Cat4p (Mig1p) from the CAT8 promoter. However, gluconeogenic promoters are still glucose repressed in cat4 mutants, which indicates that in addition to its transcription, the Cat8p protein needs further activation. The observation that multicopy expression of CAT8 reverses the inability of cat1 and cat3 mutants to grow on ethanol indicates that Cat8p might be the substrate of the Cat1p/Cat3p protein kinase.",,"fructose bisphosphatase; protein kinase; zinc finger protein; article; fermentation; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; gluconeogenesis; growth regulation; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein synthesis; reporter gene; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028930777

We argue that the orbitals obtained in local density theory form an excellent basis for discussing excited states and that the self‐energy operator (or optical potential) associated with one‐electron‐type excited states is closely diagonal in such a basis. This diagonality often leads to considerable simplifications. We also discuss the reasons for the successes of the “GW‐approximation” for the optical potential in predicting excited states. We further discuss a recent approach to calculate spectroscopic data. In particular, we present explicit results of this approach to photoelectron emission. The approach treats correlations within the target exactly but neglects some terms in the coupling between target and probe electron (= the photoemitted electron). This leads to closed expressions which exhibit a number of qualitative features. One is the cancellation of intrinsic and extrinsic losses at threshold excitation. Another is the broadening of the quasi‐particles; we have energy‐broadening for the occupied states but broadening through decaying wave functions for unoccupied states. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

To reach that aim the wastewater treatment plants discharging to the river Elbe were subjected to more severe discharge standards. In our case the company could also use the publicly owned treatment plant of Hamburg and so we were in direct competition with that plant. After several conferences with the client and the water authority we began the planning. The treatment plant also includes removal of nitrogen in the last stage and phosphorus in the biological stage (not only with chemicals). Another difficulty was that only a small area between the dam of the Elbe with a street alongside and the offices was available. So we had to plan a very compact treatment plant. To avoid the emission of odours the plant was completely housed. As in other factories we also bad the problem that on weekends and during the holidays very little water is flowing to the plant. The sewage system collected the wastewater in one system and stormwater in another. Since the area is flat, several pumpstations transport the water. So we planned a modular system with sieve screen and three SBR reactors to use it further as cascaded activated sludge tanks with pre-denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal. The sludge treatment was realized as an aerobic thermophilic process in a separate tank. To improve matters we also installed a computer for process control. The influent concentrations are higher than municipal wastewater which is conditioned by the separate system of transportation without infiltration water. For example COD influent concentrations are about 1500 mg/l, NH4-N about 130 mg/l and total phosphorus Ptot about 17 mg/l. The results we obtained in the plant are presented in this paper. © 1996, International Association on Water Quality.

In order to reduce the level of these emissions, many traffic engineers are considering the application of a variety of ATIS/ATMS strategies. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to determine the relative impact of one ITS strategy, versus another, or of ITS strategies versus non-ITS approaches. As a result, traffic engineers have also begun to search for appropriate methods for estimating changes in the generation and dispersion of pollutants as a result of different ATIS/ATMS strategies. The standard approach, to modelling emission dispersion, relies on the use of Air Quality Standard (AQS) models. However, these models generally require as input a spatially correlated time series of the magnitude of the pollutant input sources. An accurate estimate of this input data stream, or of changes to this input stream due to the deployment of ATIS/ATMS, has been to date difficult to obtain. This paper describes the development and sample application of an extension to a standard traffic network modelling approach, that can be used to develop either the point, line or area source emissions that are required as inputs to AQS models. The application of this modelling approach is illustrated for a network representing Orlando, Florida to demonstrate its functional capabilities and its applicability to realistic sized urban centres.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Dispersions; Environmental impact; Highway traffic control; Information technology; Monitoring; Particulate emissions; Performance; Standards; Strategic planning; Time series analysis; Advanced traffic management systems; Advanced traveller information systems; Atmospheric dispersion; Emission dispersion; Emission standards; Environmental plume dispersion; Mitigation; Traffic network modelling; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029192391

Smaller scale liming efforts are performed as research or experimental programs in other countries. Yearly, approx. 300,000 tons of fine-grained limestone (CaCO3) is spread in lakes and streams and on wetlands to raise the pH in surface water at a cost of approximately 40-50 million $US. The chemical target is set by the biological goals and objectives. A total of over 11,000 lakes and streams are treated on a continuing basis. Dose calculations consider pH, inorganic monomeric Al, dissolved organic matter and the necessary buffering. Lake liming, limedosers at streams and terrestrial liming are used. A mix of different liming techniques is often preferred to get an optimal result. The vast majority of changes are desirable and expected Undesirable effects may appear and damaged wetlands are probably the most serious ones. Cost-benefit analysis show that liming may be profitable for the society. Recovery of the systems can take up to 10-20 years. Liming will in the long run restore the ecosystems but will not make them identical to what may be the original ones. In some cases, complementary measures, e.g. facilitation of recolonization, are necessary to enhance recovery. Reduced emissions of acidifying pollutants according to signed protocols will decrease the need for liming, but still liming is needed for several decades in large regions to preserve biodiversity. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"acid precipitation; freshwater ecosystem; lake acidification; liming; Norway; Sweden; Calcium compounds; Calculations; Costs; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Lakes; Limestone; pH; Recovery; Surface waters; Water treatment; Calcium carbonate; Freshwater liming; Neutralization; Streams; Wetlands; Water pollution control; calcium oxide; fresh water; river water; surface water; acid rain; acidification; alkalinity; conference paper; lake; norway; pollution control; sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029415575

The equations are solved in the conservative finite-difference form on a nonuniform rectilinear grid of sufficient resolution to accurately capture the momentum/thermal boundary layers and, with somewhat lower accuracy, the flame structure. The chemistry is represented by a finite-rate reduced methane-air mechanism involving seven species. The computed flame shapes for different cavity lengths and mixture equivalence ratios are compared to those determined experimentally by OH (A) chemiluminescence. Except for the leanest mixture studied, the computed and experimental flame lengths agree to within a few percent. In general, the computed flame lengths depend more strongly on equivalence ratio than does the experimental. The dependence of computed flame shape on cavity length generally agrees with that determined from experiment. Computations indicate that the structure of the recirculation zone is similar to that of a nonreacting flow for short cavities, but is qualitatively different for longer cavities. These differences are a consequence of the heat release in the flame front. Simulations with additional fuel (representing a hydrocarbon waste) injected into the recirculation zone show two stages of heat release. The first is associated with premixed burning of the primary fuel-air mixture, while the second is associated with a diffusion flame at the interface between the oxygen-starved recirculation zone and the comparatively oxygen-rich combustion products from the primary flame. These simulations indicate that excess oxygen from a lean primary flame can be effectively utilized for waste destruction, even for very lean core flames resulting from oxygen enrichment.

Critical loads, i.e. maximum allowable depositions which do not increase the probability of damage to forest soils and surface waters, have been computed and mapped for Europe by means of the Steady-state Mass Balance Method, using national data and, if national data were unavailable, using a European database. Results show that areas with low critical loads are located mostly in northern and central Europe. The reduction of the excess of sulfur (S) deposition over critical loads was a starting point for negotiations leading to the Oslo Protocol on Further Reduction of Sulphur Emissions (the ""Second Sulphur Protocol""). The new protocol protects about 81%, 86% and 90% of the ecosystems' area in 2000, 2005 and 2010, respectively. In addition, the total European area in which sulphur deposition exceeds critical loads by more than 500 eq ha-1 yr-1 will be reduced from about 19% in 1980 to practically zero in 2010. Besides these results, a methodology is presented which allows the combined assessment of the acidifying effects of S and N as well as the eutrophying effects of N deposition on ecosystems (so-called critical load functions and the protection isolines derived from them). This methodology is well suited to integrate ecosystem sensitivities into future negotiations on the reductions of nitrogen (N) compounds, taking into account present or anticipated S emissions. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","acid deposition; air pollution impacts; critical loads; ecosystem sensitivity; emission reductions","Critical loads; Emission reduction agreements; Europe; Mass balance method; Nitrogen protocol; Sulfur protocol; Air pollution control; Database systems; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Nitrogen compounds; pH effects; Public policy; Sulfur; Air pollution; nitrogen derivative; sulfur derivative; acid rain; acidification; computer model; conference paper; europe; forest; methodology; pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029635910

The methodology involved the Steady-State Mass Balance (SSMB) method, originally developed for Europe. In contrast to Europe, where critical loads were computed for forest soils and surface waters, in Asia critical loads for 31 different vegetation types have been computed. Critical chemical limits as well as soil stability criteria were derived for each of these vegetation types, which include both natural and managed ecosystems. Results show that low critical loads in Asia occur in Bangla-Desh, Indo-China, Indonesia and the southern part of China. Uncertainties of the results are mainly due to uncertainties in base cation deposition. The critical loads are part of the impact module of the Asian version of the Regional Air pollution INformation and Simulation model (RAINS-Asia), a model used to assess abatement strategies for sulfur emissions which are rapidly increasing in this part of the world. The difference in the level of detail between European and Asian critical load maps enables different applications. In Europe, critical loads for sulphur were used in comparison to actual sulphur deposition with the aim of decreasing the excess of sulphur deposition over critical loads through optimal emission abatement. In Asia in general and China in particular the geographical distribution of critical loads of sensitive ecosystems, with some emphasis on crops, is likely to be used as a basis for future emission (re-)allocation. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","acid deposition; air pollution impacts; critical loads; ecosystem sensitivity; integrated modeling","Base cations; Critical chemical limits; Critical loads; Ecosystem sensitivity; Regional air pollution information and simulation model; Southeast asia; Steady state mass balance method; Uncertainty; Vegetation; Acid rain; Air pollution control; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Maps; Mathematical models; Mathematical techniques; Plants (botany); Soils; Sulfur; Particulate emissions; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; acid rain; acidification; air pollution; asia; bangladesh; china; conference paper; india; indonesia; japan; korea; model; nonhuman; philippines; plant growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029635856

They have been attributed to the presence of impedance discontinuities on the basilar membrane which might be caused by hair cell irregularities. To test this hypothesis we have investigated the possible relationship between transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and anatomical integrity in the organ of Corti. Click-evoked TEOAEs have been measured from the ear canals of normal, pigmented guinea pigs using an Otodynamics ILO88 analyser. Emissions were present in 18 out of 19 animals tested and the major frequencies observed were consistently present in different measurements over periods of up to ten weeks provided recording conditions were satisfactory. The frequency spectra of the TEOAEs resembled those measured in humans but the latencies of the responses were considerably shorter. In one acute experiment, the TEOAEs were shown to be dependent on metabolic energy as they were lost rapidly following termination with an overdose of anaesthetic. In another case, evoked emissions of long duration (sustained) at about 1 kHz were obtained from both ears. All cochleae examined showed irregularities, especially patches of mainly apical outer hair cell loss of differing extents. However, there was no evidence that substantial lesions coincided consistently with the frequency regions corresponding to the major emissions. Nevertheless, it was noted that the total energy level of emissions was proportional to the total outer hair cell loss, except in one case, where the outer hair cell loss was substantial and the energy level of TEOAEs was considerably lower. Although there is no clear relationship between TEOAEs of specific frequencies and abnormalities at the corresponding cochleotopic location in the organ of Corti which could represent impedance discontinuities, the degree of irregularity may determine the overall emission level. This finding is consistent with the idea that emissions arise as a result of irregularity producing variations in the reflection coefficient. © 1995.","Cochlea; Evoked otoacoustic emissions; Guinea pig; Hair-cell","animal experiment; article; cochlea; corti organ; evoked otoacoustic emission; guinea pig; hair cell; nonhuman; priority journal; Acoustic Stimulation; Animal; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Fourier Analysis; Guinea Pigs; Hair Cells, Outer; Organ of Corti; Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous; Overdose; Pentobarbital; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tissue Fixation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028923342

The pelA gene contains two short introns, 68 and 49 bp in length, and encodes a peptide of 326 amino acids. Five transcriptional start sites are clustered between 65 and 79 bp upstream of the start codon as determined by primer extension. Comparison of the aminoacid sequences of pectate or pectin lyases from bacteria, fungi and plants revealed less than 30% overall identity. However, five regions within these enzymes, in particular domains associated with the active site, are highly conserved with amino-acid similarities greater than 50%. Phylogenetic analysis using the principle of parsimony (PAUP 3.1.1) showed that pelA is most closely related to pectate lyases from plants rather than pectin lyases from other fungi. Previously, pelA was shown to be induced by polygalacturonic acid and repressed in the presence of preferred carbon sources, such as glucose. Gel mobility shift analysis indicates that a PstI-SphI fragment from the pelA promoter binds to a fusion protein composed of the N-terminal part of CREA, a protein involved in carbon catabolite repression, and glutathione-S-transferase. This result suggests CREA may contribute to the regulation of pelA expression. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon catabolite repression; Gel mobility shift; Pectate lyase gene","pectate lyase; pectin; polygalacturonic acid; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; article; aspergillus nidulans; catabolite repression; cell metabolism; comparative study; controlled study; dna sequence; gene sequence; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein domain; sequence analysis; transcription initiation; Amino Acid Sequence; Aspergillus nidulans; Base Sequence; Conserved Sequence; Fungal Proteins; Genes, Fungal; Molecular Sequence Data; Polysaccharide-Lyases; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Repressor Proteins; Restriction Mapping; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Aspergillus; Emericella nidulans; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028898476

Model equations were solved using a two-step, explicit, finite difference approximation technique, and solutions were tested on simplified problems with known analytical results. Experimental data were compared with the predictive model solutions for steady-state and non-steady-state regimes. The effects of adsorption were separated from the effects of biodegradation by experiments using varying input contaminant concentrations. Laboratory experiments used compost, granular activated carbon, and a mixture of compost and diatomaceous earth as biofilter packing materials to treat ethanol vapors. While the adsorptive capacity of the granular activated carbon was substantially reduced by water and microbial growth, it remained highest for the three media. The compost microbial community had a higher degradation rate constant.

Measured on the basis of standardised machine-smoking conditions, the sales-weighted average 'tar' and nicotine deliveries in the smoke of US cigarettes have decreased from 38 mg and 2.7 mg in 1954 to 12 mg and 0.95 mg in 1993. The lower emissions have been primarily accomplished by utilising efficient filter tips and highly porous cigarette paper, and by changing the composition of the tobacco blend. The latter included the incorporation of reconstituted and expanded tobaccos into the blend. Concurrent with the reduction of 'tar' and nicotine in the smokestream there also occurred a reduction of carbon monoxide (CO), phenols, and carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These reductions were partially tied to an increase in the nitrate content of the tobacco blend used for US cigarettes. Utilisation of tobacco blends that are rich in nitrate was initially targeted at decreasing the smoke yields of PAH; however, that this would also cause a gradual increase of the carcinogenic, tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA) was not recognised until there was awareness of those compounds as smoke constituents in the 1970s. It is important to note that the above described observations were based on measurements of yields from cigarettes that were smoked under standardised laboratory conditions, initially established in 1936, and adopted by the US Federal Trade Commission in 1969. These conditions do not reflect the smoking patterns of the smokers of filter cigarettes, who presently account for the consumption of 97% of all cigarettes produced in the US. The current filter cigarette smoker tends to smoke much more intensely and to inhale deeply. Thus, the exposure to toxic and tumourigenic agents in the inhaled smoke of filter cigarettes is not necessarily in line with the machine-smoking data.","Carcinogens; Cigarette constituents; Filters; Nicotine; Tar","carbon monoxide; carcinogen; nicotine; nitrate; nitrosamine; phenol derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; tar; awareness; cigarette smoking; filter; human; lung cancer; paper; review; tobacco; United States; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029042955

Detailed spatial and temporal sampling was conducted on one lake, Wallywash Great Pond. Chemical data, together with D/H, 18O/16O, 13C/12C and 87Sr/86Sr ratios confirm that the karstic spring waters entering the lake evolve chemically through degassing, mixing with rainfall and runoff, biogenic decalcification (resulting mainly from bicarbonate assimilation by the high biomass of submerged macrophytes), and evaporation. Modern carbonate sedimentation in Wallywash Great Pond is largely of high-Mg calcite. This is consistent with Mg/Ca molar ratios &gt;2 within much of the lake. However, aragonite forms on the adaxial leaf surfaces of Potamogeton spp. This may be explained either as a result of locally elevated Mg concentrations or a high degree of supersaturation favouring very rapid carbonate precipitation. Two small lakes to the north of Wallywash Great Pond show minor influence of the Na-Cl dominated coastal aquifer, suggesting that coastal lakes are sensitive to variations in the boundary between fresh and brackish groundwater caused by changes in climate or sea level. Their 13C/12C ratios are strongly influenced by biogenic CO2 derived from plant respiration or decay. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","aquatic chemistry; aragonite; calcite; limnology; stable isotopes","aragonite; calcite; chemical composition; karstic lake; stable isotope; West Indies, Jamaica, Wallywash Great Pond",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028995730

Most deadlines will come within the next year. Lessons learned from the first set of application submittals will save mills considerable time and effort in preparing their own applications. The backbone of a Title V permit application is a comprehensive air emission inventory that comprises all regulated pollutants for all emission sources. Based on our experience, many problems may arise in preparing the Title V emission inventory because many formerly unpermitted emission units must be included.

The IBSNAT crop models use daily weather data, ie, maximum and minimum air temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation, as inputs. One of the applications of DSSAT is, therefore, to study the potential impact of climate change on agricultural production.

With an impactor with rotating impaction plates producing a homogeneous deposit, it is possible to extend this technique to size segregated aerosol samples. A simultaneous determination of the mass size distribution is possible. Test measurements with black carbon aerosol have shown the feasibility of this method. Samples of the atmospheric aerosol have been taken in and near Vienna, in Naples and near Bologna. The light absorption of the aerosol is always highest for particle diameters between 0.1 and 0.2 μm. Only in the humid environment of the Po valley it had a slightly larger peak size, whereas the size of the nonabsorbing particles increased considerably. The light absorption of the atmospheric aerosol is always higher in an urban environment. 'The mass absorption coefficient of the aerosol at all four locations was very similar, and completely different from values which could be. expected using effective refractive indices which are frequently used in models. Using the data measured in this work two alternate models for the effective refractive index and black carbon content of the aerosol are suggested: (a) a size-dependent refractive index, where the imaginary part varies from -0.25 for particles smaller than 30 nm to - 0.003 for particles larger than 2 μm; this could especially be applied if an internal mixing of the aerosol is to be expected, or (2) a size-dependent fraction of elemental carbon in the case of external mixing with 43% of carbon particles for sizes below 30 nm decreasing to 10% for sizes up to 0.4 μm. © 1995.",,"aerosol; black carbon; light absorption; mass size distribution; Austria, Vienna; Italy, Bologna; Italy, Naples; carbon; aerosol; air sampling; airborne particle; article; austria; humidity; italy; light absorption; particle size; priority journal; refraction index; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028990324

By measuring the extinction coefficient in different directions, possible influences of local sources could be determined easily. A region, undisturbed by local sources usually had a variation of extinction coefficient of less than 10% in different directions. Generally good visibility outside population centers in Europe is considered as 40-50 km. These values have been found independent of the location in central Europe, thus this represents the average European ""clean"" air. Under rare occasions (normally rapid change of air mass) the visibility can be 100-150 km. In towns, the visibility is a factor of approximately 2 lower. In comparison to this the visibility in remote regions of North and South America is larger by a factor of 2-4. Obviously the lower visibility in Europe is caused by its higher population density. Since the majority of visibility reducing particulate emissions come from small sources such as cars or heating, the emissions per unit area can be considered proportional to the population density. Using a simple box model and the visibility measured in central Europe and in Vienna, the difference in visibility inside and outside the town can be explained quantitatively. It thus is confirmed, that the generally low visibility in central Europe is a consequence of the emissions in connection with human activities and the low visibility (compared, e.g. to North or South America) in remote location such as the Alps is caused by the average European pollution. © 1995.","background aerosol; box model; pollution; remote aerosol; urban pollution; Visibility","aerosol; urban pollution; visibility; Europe; Air Pollution; Modelling; Visibility; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; article; city; comparative study; europe; exhaust gas; model; north america; photometry; population density; priority journal; rural area; south america; spectrometer; visibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028976945

The model is driven by 3 1 2 years of hourly meteorological data obtained directly from the output of double-CO2 experiments (2 × CO2) conducted with a regional climate model nested in a general circulation model. The regional atmospheric model is the climate version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Pennsylvania State University mesoscale model, MM4. Average annual surface temperature of Pyramid Lake for the 2 × CO2 climate is 15.5 ± 5.4°C (±1 σ), 2.8°C higher than the control. Annual overturn of the lake ceases as a result of these higher temperatures for the 2 × CO2 climate. Evaporation increases from 1400 mm yr-1 in the control to 1595 mm yr-1 in the 2 × CO2 simulation, but net water supplied to the Pyramid Lake basin increases from -6 mm yr-1 in the control to +27 mm yr-1 in the 2 × CO2 simulation due to increased precipitation. For the open water periods, the average annual surface temperature of Yellowstone Lake is 13.2 ± 5.1°C for the 2 × CO2 climate, a temperature 1.6°C higher than the control. The annual duration of ice cover on the lake is 152 days in the 2 × CO2 simulation, a reduction of 44 days relative to the control. Warming of the lake for the 2 × CO2 climate is mostly confined to the near-surface. Simulated spring overturn for the 2 × CO2 climate occurs earlier in the year and fall overturn later than in the control. Evaporation increases from 544 mm yr-1 to 600 mm yr-1 in the 2 × CO2 simulation, but net water supplied to the Yellowstone Lake basin increases from +373 mm yr-1 in the control to +619 mm yr-1 due to increased precipitation. The effects of these climatic changes suggest possible deterioration of water quality and productivity in Pyramid Lake and possible enhancement of productivity in Yellowstone Lake. © 1995.",,"carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; lake; productivity; thermal regime; water balance; USA, Nevada, Pyramid Lake; USA, Wyoming, Yellowstone Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029516709

The patients were anesthetized with fentanyl and ventilated with oxygen in air. Hemodynamic and TEE measurements were obtained before and after the introduction of N2O in oxygen (60%/40%), before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). N2O reduced mean arterial pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output both before and after CPB. Left ventricular global area ejection fraction (GAEF) was not changed by the introduction of N2O, either before or after CPB. N2O induced a significant change in regional wall motion after, but not before CPB, as assessed by the relationship between segmental area ejection fraction (SAEF) and GAEF. Analysis of the mitral flow profile indicated an increase in early diastolic relaxation in the pre-CPB period after introduction of N2O, that was absent in the post-CPB period.

The representation of the large-scale dynamics is based on a grid point model developed and used at Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique for climate studies. The code also includes an accurate representation of radiative heating and cooling by molecular gases and haze as well as a parametrization of the vertical turbulent mixing of momentum and potential temperature. Long-term simulations of the atmospheric circulation are presented. Starting from a state of rest, the model spontaneously produces a strong superrotation with prograde equatorial winds (i.e., in the same sense as the assumed rotation of the solid body) increasing from the surface to reach 100 m sec-1 near the 1-mbar pressure level. Those equatorial winds are in very good agreement with some indirect observations, especially those of the 1989 occultation of Star 28-Sgr by Titan. On the other hand, the model simulates latitudinal temperature contrasts in the stratosphere that are significantly weaker than those observed by Voyager 1 which, we suggest, may be partly due to the nonrepresentation of the spatial and temporal variations of the abundances of molecular species and haze.

This is especially the case in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which is dependent on vehicular transport manufactured outside the continent. Although SSA exhibits both the least incidence of and greatest need for cheap forms of nonmotorized transportation (NMT), paradoxically it has one of the most hostile policy climates for its use. A lack of physical infrastructure in the urban areas and negative attitudes among decision makers and influential members of the public discourage NMT usage. The damaging policy constraints on the promotion and use of NMT are illustrated through an examination of the recent history of the bicycle in Africa. The roles of import and pricing policies are outlined, demonstrating that governments have tended to suppress ownership by overtaxing imports. The conclusions make proposals for policies to encourage wider use of NMT by seeking a new, international basis for their production and finance, and by removing all taxes to stimulate demand.",,"Bicycles; Mass transportation; Public policy; Research; Road construction; Technology transfer; Deagrarianization; Mass mobility; Motor vehicle operation; Motorization; Road networks; Nonmotorized transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029333855

With the advent of CNG as a viable transportation fuel, the development of advanced computer controlled fuel delivery systems is imperative in order to ensure acceptable emission performance. At present, the majority of light and medium duty engines operating on natural gas are primarily gasoline automotive engines which have been retrofitted to allow for the use of CNG. The Mobile Sources Emissions Division of Environment Canada and the Canadian Gas Association have conducted a joint test program in order to develop a database of exhaust emissions from vehicles typically converted for operation on either gasoline or natural gas at various operating temperatures. The four light duty trucks selected for the program represented current commercially available natural gas fuel metering technologies designed for bi-fuel mode applications utilizing computer controlled electronic feedback fuel injection. Gaseous tailpipe exhaust measurements of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, non-methane hydrocarbons, and aldehyde/ketones were determined over the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule at 24°C and -18°C at 10,000 km, odometer reading and again at 24°C at 50,000 kilometers.

When the radical is produced in low yields, hydrogen abstraction from solvent appears to be sufficiently efficient to compete with dimerization and only chloromethane is observed; however, at higher concentrations, the chloromethyl radicals couple to produce dichloroethane. Photoreaction is observed only with near-UV excitation of the LMCT absorption manifold of W2Cl4(PR3)4.

The mutation maps in the 3′‐terminal region of ccpA, where an in‐frame duplication of 84 nucleotides located between two 9 bp direct repeats leads to an insertion of 28 amino acids near the C‐terminus of CcpA. An in‐frame deletion of 501 bp in ccpA exhibits the same phenotype as the 84 bp duplication. Deletion of ORF1 and ORF2 does not yield an apparent phenotype. A single‐copy ccpA::lacZ transcriptional fusion is constitutively expressed, independent of whether the growth medium triggers catabolite repression or not. The ccpA mutation leads to relief of catabolite repression exerted by glucose, fructose, mannitol, glucitol and glycerol, whereas only smaller effects were found with ribose, citrate and glutamate. The respective growth rates on these carbon sources are uniformly reduced to a generation time of about 90 min in the ccpA mutant. Catabolite repression of a plasmid‐encoded xylA::ccpA fusion is less efficient than that of a xylA::lacZ fusion in the same vector. Furthermore, overproduction of CcpA decreases catabolite repression of a singlecopy xylA::lacZ fusion approximately twofold. Thus, overexpression of CcpA may be counterproductive for catabolite repression, supporting the hypothesis that CcpA by itself may not bind sufficiently strongly to the cis‐active catabolite‐responsive element to exert catabolite repression.

This variability can be manifest regionally as severe droughts on yearly time-scales or as more prolonged desiccation over one or more decades. The nature of future climate change for Africa is not known with any great confidence. Climate change scenarios have been constructed here in a systematic manner making clear their assumptions and uncertainties, but it remains impossible to attach specific probabilities to them. There is a paucity of detailed climate change impact case studies for Africa. The level of vulnerability of African societies to climate change depends on their present-day vulnerability which is determined by their economic, political and institutional capabilities. Future demographic changes in Africa and the development path the continent pursues will determine the eventual significance of global warming for Africa. The scope for alternative African emissions trajectories to significantly alter global warming rates over the next 100 yr is very limited. -from Authors",,"anthropogenic emission; climate change; climatic change; developing region; forecasting problem; global warming; human impact; man-environment relations; rainfall variability; uncertainty; vulnerability; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041153118

The Quaternary record shows that migration has been the usual response of organisms to environmental change. This record also reveals that forecast future climate changes are of a magnitude and in a direction unprecedented in recent earth history: the rate of these changes is likely also to surpass that of any comparable change during the last 2.4 million years. The relationship between a species' geographical distribution and present climate may be modelled by a surface representing the probability of encountering that species under given combinations of climate conditions. This ‘climate response surface’ then may be used to simulate potential future distributions of the species in response to forecast climate scenarios. Such simulations reveal the magnitude of the impacts of these forecast climate changes. Although to date this approach has been applied in Europe only to plants, it promises to be valuable also for other groups of organisms, including birds. Some bird species, however, may respond more directly to either habitat structure or presence of specific food plants; such factors may be incorporated into the models when required. The magnitude of likely vegetation changes necessitates a global approach to conservation if there is to be any hope of long‐term success. Successful conservation of global biodiversity will depend upon conservation of the global environment and limitation of the human population much more than upon parochial efforts to conserve locally rare organisms or habitats.

The results of simulated distillation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of extracts represented that the earlier extracts contained lighter compounds and the latter extracts contained progressively heavier compounds. As the extraction proceeded, relatively greater amounts of paraffinic compounds and lesser amounts of naphthenic and aromatic compounds were extracted. This compositional change occurring during a dynamic extraction was also ascertained by phase equilibrium calculations using the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state and a component-lumping procedure. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Methods: Regional MBF, perfusable tissue traction (PTF) and arterial blood volume (V(a)) were measured using 15O-water and dynamic PET on five healthy volunteers based on previously published models. Calculated values were compared for the following three tracer administration protocols: 15O-water bolus injection, 15O-water slow (2 min) infusion and 15O- carbon dioxide slow (2 min) inhalation. For the two slow administration protocols, the three parameters MBF, PTF and V(a) were computed by fitting the model equations to the myocardial regional time-activity curve. For the bolus injection of 15O-water, only two parameters, MBF and PTF, were fitted by using a fixed V(a) value obtained by a carbon dioxide blood volume scan. Results: All protocols provided consistent MBF values, and the calculated values were homogeneous throughout the whole myocardial segments for all subjects. PTF values were also homogeneous and consistent in the anterior and lateral wall regions, but were significantly greater in the septum (~20%) when the slow 15O-carbon dioxide inhalation protocol was used. MBF and PTF values obtained from the bolus injection protocol showed the smallest intersubject and interregional variations. The simulation study also showed that the magnitude of error was smallest when the bolus injection protocol was employed. Conclusion: The data suggest that the 15O-water bolus injection protocol together with the two-parameter fitting procedure provides the most accurate results for MBF and PTF. However, it requires arterial cannulation and a separate carbon monoxide scan. For clinical studies, however, the 15O-water infusion protocol would be a good alternative, providing MBF and PTF results with an acceptable degree of accuracy and without the need for arterial cannulation.","myocardial blood flow; oxygen-15-water; perfusable tissue fraction; PET","carbon dioxide; oxygen 15; adult; article; coronary artery blood flow; female; heart muscle perfusion; heart scintiscanning; human; human experiment; male; normal human; positron emission tomography; priority journal; Administration, Inhalation; Adult; Blood Volume; Carbon Dioxide; Comparative Study; Coronary Circulation; Female; Human; Infusions, Intravenous; Injections, Intravenous; Male; Middle Age; Oxygen Radioisotopes; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tissue Distribution; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028877928

An activated carbon was loaded by impregnation from an excess solution of metal nitrate. The NO-carbon reaction was studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor at atmospheric pressure, using two types of experiments: (i) a temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) in a NO/He mixture; and (ii) an isothermal reaction at 300-600 °C. The products of the reactions were monitored allowing detailed oxygen and nitrogen balances. All the metals used catalyze the NO-carbon reaction, causing an important decrease in the activation energy and a substantial shift of the NO reduction curves toward lower temperatures. The TPR curves, the isothermal reactivity data, and the distribution of the products can be explained by means of an oxidation/reduction mechanism that implies a different oxidation states of the metal and the carbon matrix. The results show that, at low temperatures, iron, cobalt, and nickel are the most effective, as they are metals able to chemisorb NO dissociatively; at high temperatures the activity is larger for cobalt and copper, metals whose oxides are reduced by carbon at a lower temperature. This order of activity seems to indicate that, at low temperatures (T < 400 °C), the controlling step in the process is the NO chemisorption, whereas at high temperatures (T > 500 °C), the reduction of the intermediate oxidized metal species is the rate-limiting step. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

The samples were characterized by CO2 chemisorption at 250 °C and NO chemisorption at 60 °C. The catalytic effect of potassium in NO reduction was evaluated at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow reactor. Two types of experiments were performed: (i) temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) in a NO/He mixture; and (ii) isothermal reaction at 300-600 °C. Both TPR and temperatureprogrammed desorption experiments were also conducted subsequent to NO chemisorption. The reaction products were monitored in all cases, thus allowing detailed oxygen and nitrogen balances to be determined. Three characteristic reactivity regions were found in the TPR profiles: (a) high catalytic activity at low temperatures due to dissociative NO chemisorption, accompanied by N2 and N2O evolution and oxygen accumulation on the catalyst surface; (b) severe catalyst deactivation at intermediate temperatures as the catalyst becomes fully oxidized; (c) recovery of high catalytic activity at high temperatures as the catalyst is reduced by the carbon, accompanied by the evolution of CO2 and CO. An increase in potassium loading was found to affect only the first region, extending the period of high activity. A good correlation was found between steadystate isothermal catalytic activity and the amount of oxygen accumulated on the surface upon NO chemisorption at 60 °C, especially for NO reduction at low temperatures (e.g., 300 °C). Therefore, dissociative NO chemisorption seems to be a promising technique for titrating the active sites in potassium-catalyzed NO reduction by carbon. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

A coal-derived carbon was loaded with iron using different methods and different precursors. A brief exploratory study was also conducted with pitch-derived carbon fibers. The iron-loaded and/or parent carbons were characterized by physical adsorption of CO2 (at 0 °C) and N2 (at -196 °C), X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS), and chemisorption of CO at 25 °C. The NO-carbon reaction was studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor at atmospheric pressure using two types of experiments: (i) temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) in a NO/He mixture, and (ii) isothermal reaction at 300-600 °C. The reaction products were monitored in both cases, thus allowing detailed oxygen and nitrogen balances to be determined. Iron was found to catalyze NO reduction by carbon through an oxidation/reduction (redox) mechanism similar to that reported previously for potassium- and calcium-catalyzed reaction. Nevertheless, the iron species present on the carbon surface before NO reduction (FexOy or FeO) are less effective than the potassium species (elemental potassium or potassium suboxide) in chemisorbing NO, as a result of which they transfer less oxygen to the carbon active sites. The results show also that the nature of the catalyst precursor, the catalyst preparation conditions and the reducibility of the catalyst by the carbon determine the chemical state of the catalyst, its dispersion and catalyst/substrate contact, and hence control the catalytic activity of iron in NO reduction by carbon. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

One feature of the LEV standards is the increasingly tighter regulation of non-methane organic gases (NMOG), taking into account ozone formation, in addition to the existing control of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC). Hydrocarbons and other organic gases emitted by S.I. engines have been identified as a cause of atmospheric ozone formation. Since the reactivity of each chemical species in exhaust emissions differs, the effect on ozone formation varies depending on the composition of the exhaust gas components. This study examined the effect of different engine types, fuel atomization conditions, turbulence and emission control systems on emission species and specific reactivity. This was done using gas chromatographs and a high-performance liquid chromatograph to analyze exhaust emission species that affect ozone formation. It is shown that the chemical species present in engine-out emissions differ depending on the engine design, thereby affecting specific reactivity. To investigate the effect of fuel atomization conditions, evaporation of the fuel was improved. Improved evaporation was found to promote the formation of alkene HCs having high maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) values, which resulted in higher specific reactivity. On the other hand, it had the effect of reducing NMOG mass emissions, there by reducing the quantity of ozone formed. Changes in such engine control parameters as the air-fuel ratio, ignition timing, cooling water temperature and EGR rate were found to affect the specific reactivity of engine-out emissions. The use of a palladium noble metal catalyst systém reduced the specific reactivity of tailpipe emissions owing to the different reaction selectivity of this catalyst system. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atomization; Catalyst selectivity; Chromatography; Control systems; Cooling water; Emission control; Evaporation; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel additives; Gas emissions; Machine design; Methane; Ozone; Precious metals; California Air Resources Board; Cooling water temperature; Engine control parameters; High performance liquid chromatographs; Low emission vehicles; Maximum incremental reactivities; Noble metal catalysts; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Exhaust gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072423744

Nb and Ta are highly (50-200-fold) enriched in vein amphibole and mica relative to primitive mantle compositions, whereas Th and U are depleted. Some disseminated amphiboles do not have such extreme NbTa enrichments, but NbTa partition coefficients between amphibole and clinopyroxene are remarkably high, ranging from 10 to 85. In apparent contrast with the results on natural mantle amphiboles, recently reported Nb and Ta partition coefficients between amphibole and melts are very low [1,2]. The reason for the apparent contradiction may lie in either the composition of the amphibole or the fluid phase (silica-rich aqueous fluid rather than silicate or carbonate melt). In either case, our observations show that amphibole and mica can be important hosts for Nb and Ta and cannot be ignored in identifying the underlying cause of the nearly universal relative NbTa depletion of subduction-related volcanic rocks. We propose a metasomatic model for creating source regions that are depleted in Nb and Ta relative to Th, U and the LREE. Fluids generated by dehydration of the subducted slab ascend through the overlying mantle wedge and precipitate amphiboles. Highly incompatible elements including Nb and Ta are transferred with the fluid into the wedge where the 'open-system' precipitation of amphibole fractionates the trace elements and thus generates low (Nb,Ta)/(Th,U,LREE) ratios in the residual fluid. As this fluid travels further it either directly induces partial melting in hot regions of the wedge or is consumed through 'closed-system' crystallization of disseminated amphibole in host peridotite that can later undergo partial melting. In either case the resulting source regions of subduction-related magmas are enriched in highly incompatible trace elements but not in Nb and Ta. This model may be considered either as a complement or as an alternative to published models explaining the chemistry of arc magmas. © 1995.",,"amphibole; fractionation; metasomatism; mica; niobium; tantalum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028881424

In May 1993 the 40th Conference of Environment Ministers (Umweltministerkon-ferenz) adopted the guide document subject to further trial. Based on the guide document it will be possible to define water quality requirements in the field of water resources management, e.g., protection of aquatic communities and safeguarding of drinking water supply, as a complementing approach to existing statutory emission control regulations. The quality targets derived on the basis of the guide document define concentrations of hazardous substances in water, suspended particulate matter or sediments which should not be exceeded (guide values). According to current scientific knowledge, compliance with the quality targets ensures that a hazard to the protection-meriting uses considered need not be feared. Where quality targets are found to be exceeded, the causes should be explored. On that basis water pollution control and sanitation priorities can be defined more appropriately. In addition, the outlined approach to deriving quality targets provides a basis for characterizing water quality and is helpful in priority-setting with respect to analytical methods to be optimized. © 1995 Academic Press.

Proponents argue that allowing joint implementation of the objectives of the Convention will increase the cost-effectiveness with which those objectives are achieved. Opponents argue that allowing trade in carbon emission credits will reduce the incentive for domestic greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and may undermine the commitments of the developed nations to take the lead in achieving climate stabilization. This paper examines the argument for joint implementation from the standpoint of cost-effectiveness. It addresses the determination of incremental costs for abatement options, and the assessment of cost-effectiveness under complex systemic conditions. Using national greenhouse gas abatement costing studies from four different nations - two developed nations, on economy in transition and one developing nation - the paper examines both the general claim for cost-effectiveness of joint implementation and the implicit assumption that emissions reductions will be easier and cheaper in developing nations and economies in transition than they are in developed countries. The results indicate firstly that benefits from joint implementation may be highly dependent on the level of associated transaction costs and secondly that greenhouse gas emission reductions may be considerably cheaper for some developed countries than they are for developing countries. The paper stresses the need for well developed methodological guidelines under which both cost and cost-effectiveness can be assessed, and points to the dangers inherent in allowing ad hoc trading in emissions credits by a heterogenous community of private investors. © 1995.","Climate Change, Framework Convention; Cost-effectiveness; Joint implementation","cost effectiveness; environmental economics; Framework Convention on Climate Change; greenhouse gas; joint implementation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029542161

The evaporation of heavy metalsthereby is of great significance. It is the goal of this work to investigate the fundamental aspects of the evaporation of heavy metals in the heat treatment process and to determine the process parameters leading to complete evaporation of the relevant heavy metals. Evaporation experiments in different atmospheres were carried out with filter ash from municipal solid waste incineration. The quantities of the heavy metals Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cu evaporated as a function of time were measured at temperatures between 670 and 1300 °C; evaporation turned out to be most effective at temperatures just below the melting range of the residue (i.e., at 1000–1100 °C) and decreased drastically above this temperature range. The amounts of evaporation (relative to the contents in untreated filter ash) at about 1100 °C were 98–100% of Pb, Cd, and Cu and 50% of Zn in air and 98–100% of Pb, Cd, and Zn and 10% of Cu in argon atmosphere, respectively. Results of experiments using model systems indicate that the decrease in the Zn evaporation at high temperatures is caused by the formation of compounds like Zn2SiO4 and ZnAl2O4 The results of the experiments in argon atmosphere are explained thermodynamically by the reductive potential of the carbon, contained in the residue. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

The concept we have introduced is designed to enable quantification of the influence of such cultural perspectives on the allocation of fossil CO2 emission rights. A model is presented which allocates future emission rights to world regions. An emission budget which incorporates an historical component is defined for the specific period which is required if climate change policy targets are to be met. Allocation of the budget to regions is based on a weighted mix of indicators such as population size, GNP and energy consumption. Subtracting historical emissions results in future regional emission rights. Uncertainties in the selection of parameter values for the model and in generating scenarios of future developments are here regarded as being related to cultural perspectives. We have assumed that cultural perspectives can be quantified by reference to distributions of preferred parameter values and preferred future scenarios. Distributions of regional emission rights biased towards preferred allocations as determined by the perspectives can thus be described. In fact, the proposed approach envisages an uncertainty analysis based on the characteristics of cultural perspectives. © 1995.","Allocation of emission rights; Climate change; CO2; Cultural perspectives","carbon; carbon emission; climatic change; cultural perspective; planning theory; pollution control; theoretical studies; budget; climate; climate change; energy consumption; fossil; model; planning; policy; pollution control; population size; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028992682

Bowen ratio and eddy covariance technology have been used to measure the net CO2 exchange of deciduous and coniferous forest. Some results from an earlier study on spruce with the Bowen ratio technique are presented. New technology that has been developed to measure fluxes continuously by forest stands is described and data are presented to show the net exchange flux of CO2 by temperate forests. These data support the hypothesis that temperate and boreal are forests are significant sinks for carbon dioxide. An extensive programme of experimental impact studies is being carried out by a network of 12 laboratories in Europe funded by the European Commission. Parallel studies are in progress in North America and elsewhere. These studies indicate that doubling the atmospheric CO2 concentration results in increases in tree biomass of 30-40%. Interactions with nutrition are particularly significant. If nitrogen is added at a commensurate rate, the overall effect is that trees grow larger more quickly in elevated CO2 than in ambient air but they are essentially very similar in structure and physiology. However, if nutrients are in short supply, developmental and physiological changes occur. Then elevated CO2 causes changes in dry mass allocation to roots, in phenology of bud burst and set, in photosynthesis, in respiration, and in tree water relations. These changes are exaggerated in low nutrition situations. Process-based models have been developed to scale-up from leaf and tree to the stand scale. These models contain explicit description of processes affected by CO2, and are parameterised using the data collected in the impact studies. It is concluded that forests in the temperate and boreal region can effectively contribute to the removal of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere and that tree growth and production of long-lived wood products should be encouraged as a major contribution towards off-setting the greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000234927

These massive stoves are fired for short periods once or twice each day, and the stored heat is slowly released into the room by natural convection. Low-quality coal is typically used, and these stoves are therefore a major source of air pollution. A facility has been constructed to study the efficiency and emissions characteristics of these stoves. Stove exhaust gas is directed into a dilution tunnel in which pollutant concentrations and emission rates are measured. Efficiency is determined using a heat loss method. In baseline tests, stove efficiencies were found to be higher than expected - 60% to 65%. Emission factors are high for particulates, carbon monoxide (CO), and organics. Low-volatility 'smokeless fuels' were tested as an alternative to the normal fuels. Using the normal operating procedure, these were found to yield a factor of 10 reduction in particulate emissions but a 50% increase in CO emissions. A new operating procedure was developed with these fuels in which CO levels were lower than with the normal fuel and efficiency increased to 70%. These smokeless fuels are seen as attractive options for improving regional air quality, partly because their use does not require capital investment by residents.",,"Air pollution; Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Coal; District heating; Heat convection; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Stoves; Smokeless fuels; Stove efficiency; Stove exhaust gas; Tile stoves; Coal fired boilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029222843

Methods for reducing emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and sulphur dioxide are discussed more briefly. The scenarios are based on official forecasts of future passenger and goods transport. They indicate that tail-pipe nitrogen-oxide (NOx) emissions from the transportation sector can be reduced by 50% by 2015, compared to 1991, if the average performance of vehicles (with respect to energy efficiency and tailpipe emissions) in 2015 equals that of today's best commercially available technology. Tail-pipe emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be stabilized at today's level. With further technical development and the use of fuels from renewable sources of energy, NOx emissions can be reduced by 75% and CO2 emissions by 80% compared to 1991. The average cost of reducing CO2 emissions, by replacing fossil fuels with biomass-based methanol in all road vehicles, using internal combustion engines, is estimated to $1993 260/tonne C, at current fuel prices. Current Swedish carbon-taxes are some $160/tonne C. More advanced end-use technologies, such as fuel cells, could reduce the cost of using methanol in the future. Electric vehicles are not studied in the scenarios but are found in a comparison to have the potential to reduce not only local air pollution but also total emissions of CO2 and NOx. © 1995.",,"Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Fuel cells; Hydrocarbons; Internal combustion engines; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Renewable energy resources; Strategic planning; Sulfur dioxide; Transportation; Air pollutants; Tail-pipe emissions; Air pollution control; air pollution; emission control; technology role; transport emission; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029416766

The char was very active for N2O decomposition and reduction in inert atmosphere, and especially the char from burning wood chips had a high activity and a large BET-surface area. The addition of O2 or CO to the feed gas had only minor influence on the activity of the chars. Bed material (sand + ash) had a low activity for N2O decomposition in inert atmosphere, although the activity increased at temperatures above 1150 K. However, bed material from all three fuels showed at least a 10-fold increase in activity at reducing conditions. The catalytic activity of bed material decreases if oxygen is present, even if the gas mixture is fuel rich. At stoichiometric conditions (0.5 vol% O2 and 1.0 vol% CO) the activity is low, about the same as in inert atmosphere. It was estimated that char and bed material both contribute to the heterogeneous decomposition and reduction of N2O in a CFBC.

Measurements of emission and anisotropy decay lifetimes of both the five intrinsic tryptophan residues and the fluorescent probe 1-anilinonaphthalene- 8-sulfonate (ANS) during the folding reaction were used to characterize the compactness and development of tertiary structure in transient intermediates formed during the folding of DHFR. Experiments monitoring bound ANS show that a rapidly-formed intermediate (<20 ms) has a rotational time of ~10 ns and, therefore, a compactness similar to that for the native conformation. All of the tryptophan residues in this burst phase species rotate as freely as in the unfolded state. In the set of four intermediates which then appear over the next few hundred milliseconds, the apparent rotational time measured by ANS fluorescence increases to a maximum rotational time of <20 ns. An increase in the average tryptophan lifetime for these intermediates suggests these side chains become excluded from solvent and associated dynamic quenching mechanisms. As the folding reaction proceeds to a set of four native conformers, the bound ANS rotational time then decreases to approach that for the native protein, 10.5 ns, and the average tryptophan rotational time increases to the same value. During these rate-limiting, final steps in folding, the static quenching effects which reflect the formation of specific tertiary contacts involving tryptophans also appear. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Surface air temperature simulations are sensitive to the parameterization of cloud radiative feedbacks and cumulus convection.

The tropospheric flow data, which is input to the model, includes both 500 hPa height and 500 1000 hPa thickness fields which are compressed via an EOF-technique. The regression coefficients are calculated from a 27 year record of analysed flow and locally observed DTR and cloudiness. The regression model has been used to down-scale the large-scale flow produced in a CO2 sensitivity experiment with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model (ECHAM-1). The down-scaled ""high CO2"" DTR is generally smaller than found when down-scaling the corresponding climate model control experiment. The opposite statement applies to cloudiness. DTR-anomalies of the order 2 Kelvin (K) are obtained in the central/northern parts of Fenno-Scandia in the middle of the 21st century while anomalies much closer to zero are found over the Iceland/Southern Greenland region. Consistent with this picture the cloudiness anomalies in the high CO2 case are predicted highest near the central/northern parts of Fenno-Scandia. The results presented here indicate that periods observed to be anomalously warm on a large-scale - corresponding to high CO2 concentrations - are also observed to be more cloudy and it is argued that clouds may have a thermostatic effect. We have calculated DTR and cloud cover trends at the 10 stations used in the regression model in order to assess if they are consistent with the predicted estimates and as such reflect a forcing of the climate system. We find that none of the stations show DTR/cloud cover trends significantly different from zero in the period 1961-1987. We do, however, see a negative DTR trend and a positive cloud trend when we consider a slightly longer time series (1950-1992) at Reykjavik. All statements about trends are, however, very uncertain because the observed records in addition to any trends reflect a large natural variability on decadal time scales as well as possible observational inhomogeneities. © 1995.",,"climate model; cloud cover trend; diurnal temperature range; ocean/atmosphere climate model; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029501584

A rotable cold finger milled of a silver (111) monocrystal optimizes heat conductivity and is connected to a programmable, closed cycle helium refrigerator allowing temperature control of an attached silver wafer between 10 and 340 K (±0.5 K). Oil-free ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions of ≈10-10 mbar are provided by a membrane, drag, and cryopump, hence guaranteeing a vacuum system free of any contamination. Ice layers of defined crystal structures and reproducible thickness of (5±1) μm are achieved by depositing gases, e.g., CH4, CD4, CD 4/O2, and CH4/O2, with a computer-assisted thermovalve on the cooled wafer. These frosts are irradiated at 10 and 50 K with 7.3 MeV protons and 9 MeV α particles of the compact cyclotron CV28 in Forschungszentrum Jülich up to doses of 150 eV per molecule, i.e., simulating the distribution maximum of galactic cosmic ray particles interacting with primordial matter in space during 0.7×10 9 yr. During the experiments, gas phase and solid state are monitored for the first time quantitatively on line and in situ by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) via matrix interval arithmetic and a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) in an absorption-reflection mode at 62.5°. For the first time, a cosmic ray simulator allows detailed and reproducible mechanistic studies on the interaction of cosmic ray particles with frozen gases in space based on pressure conditions (hydrocarbon free UHV conditions, the limitation of condensations of residual gases during an experiment to less than one monolayer), temperature regime (the use of silver monocrystals, FTIR in reflection, optimized ion currents, and target thicknesses &lt;5 μm restrict temperature increasing to 14 K), and defined target systems. In combination with two on line and in situ analyses techniques, i.e., FTIR and QMS, the machine yields unprecedented options such as computing the heating of the ice surfaces directly exposed to the ion beam by a calibrated QMS and a complete quantification of product distribution. Preliminary results indicate a strong temperature-dependent component of the reaction mechanisms in the frosts: surface layers are heated by impinging ions to (14±1) K and yield (70%-100%) of higher molecular weight species, such as C11D 24, whereas 10 K regions produce majority of simpler hydrocarbons, e.g., C3D8. Second, O2 contaminations influence the experiments dramatically by trapping of diffusive H atoms as O2H and, thus, yield oxygen-containing yellow to brown residues after heating to 293 K. Irradiation of pure methane targets, however, produce no residues.

Different techniques for measuring deposit thickness, knock onset and deposit effects on the thermal characteristics of the cylinder have been developed. Deposit growth as measured by deposit weight on the plugs is reasonably repeatable from run to run and cylinder to cylinder. The presence of deposits already in the cylinder does not affect deposit growth on clean plugs introduced into the combustion chamber. Deposit thickness and morphology vary substantially at different locations, the thickness being greatest at the coolest surfaces. Deposits increase the flame speed and reduce the metal temperatures just below the surface. They also reduce the mean heat flux away from the cylinder. There is a good correlation between this mean heat flux and knock-limited spark advance. Deposits in the cylinder head also led to significant reductions in fuel consumption at the operating condition used for deposit build-up. In contrast piston-top deposits have little effect on fuel consumption and on octane requirement increase. DEPOSITS, derived primarily from the fuel but with some contribution from the oil are formed inside the combustion chamber of a spark ignition engine with use. The literature on the deposits that form on all the internal surfaces of a spark ignition engine, including those in the combustion chamber, was reviewed in (1); an earlier source of useful information is (2). Combustion chamber deposits (CCD) have been reported to cause an increase in octane requirement and, to some extent, an increase in emissions, a reduction in volumetric efficiency and power and an improvement in fuel economy-a beneficial effect (1-11). More recently, new field problems like carbon rap (e.g.3,12) attributed to CCD have been recognised. Moreover, fuel and additives technology to ensure satisfactory control of deposits in other parts of the engine viz carburetters, port fuel injectors and inlet valves has matured and is being increasingly mandated. There has been growing concern that some of this additives technology might cause an increase in CCD. The spurt in interest in CCD is reflected in industry initiatives like the 1993 CRC Workshop on Combustion Chamber Deposits (3). This paper describes an experimental study of combustion chamber deposits and some of their effects in a four cylinder engine modified and instrumented for research. Deposit growth was monitored by measuring the weight and local deposit thicknesses on removable plugs in a slice carried between the head and the block. Deposit growth was reasonably repeatable from cylinder to cylinder and test to test. Knock rating was done on individual cylinders by determining the Knock Limited Spark Advance (KLSA) at the trace knock level. Techniques to measure deposit thickness and to detect knock were developed after assessing many options. Flame progress was monitored by ion-gaps in the head. The effect of deposits on heat transfer from the combustion chamber was monitored by using a plug with thermocouples embedded at different distances from the surface particularly during engine warm-up.

Discharge measurements were made and water samples collected for analyses of nutrients and selected herbicides in 19 subbasins along the main stem and tributaries of Roberts Creek. The areal extent of unconsolidated and bedrock units subcropping in each subbasin was quantified. The hydrologic data were correlated statistically with the geologic data to determine relations. Roberts Creek generally gained water and had larger nitrogen concentrations in subbasins in which bess and alluvial material were underlain primarily by low‐permeability till and shale units. Roberts Creek generally lost water and had lower nitrate concentrations in subbasins with subcroppmg karstic units. Nitrogen concentrations decreased in streams underlain by the karstic units because the nitrogen removed by biological processes was not replaced by ground‐water inflow. Seepage from Roberts Creek to ground water in areas of subcropping karstic carbonate rocks reduced the flow, which reduced the velocity, causing increased residence time of water in the stream. The additional residence time may allow additional time for biological processes to remove nitrogen from solution. There was no significant relation between dissolved orthophosphate or atrazine and the underlying geology. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

The basin formed by extension in Late-Middle Eocene to latest Oligocene times and contains thousands of metres of thick marine clastic sediments deposited as turbiditic sequences over a metamorphic and crystalline basement. Among these sequences the Soǧucak and Ceylan Formations (Upper Eocene-Lower Oligocene), Mezardere Formation (Lower Oligocene-Upper Oligocene) and Dani§men and Osmancik Formations (Upper Oligocene-Lower Miocene) contain potential source rocks. Four wells were selected to assess the thermal history of the basin and estimate the source rock potential and the timing of hydrocarbon generation. Cohen's method was used for the computations and the time-temperature indices were calculated with and without the cooling effect of the uplift. The results indicate that of the potential source rocks, the Ceylan and the Mezardere formations are found to have probable source rock potential in the Thrace Basin and that the timing of hydrocarbon generation varies between 22 and 4.5 Ma for these formations in different wells. © 1995.","hydrocarbon generation; mathematical modelling; Turkey","Calculations; Crystalline rocks; Estimation; Hydrocarbons; Landforms; Mathematical models; Metamorphic rocks; Natural gas wells; Oil wells; Rocks; Sediments; Thermodynamic properties; Cohens method; Hydrocarbon generation; Marine clastic sediments; Metamorphic/crystalline basement; Time-temperature indices; Turbiditic sequences; Petroleum geology; hydrocarbon generation; mathematical modelling; source rock; Tertiary; Turkey, Thrace Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029415558

The present study reports the effect of mixed-grinding of the mixture on the reduction of the composite by indirect heating. Mixtures prepared by different combinations of hematite and graphite reagents, iron ores and metallurgical coke were mixed-ground by two types of ball mills. TG-DTA measurements for the composites were carried out under different heating patterns and total pressures. Reaction temperature remarkably decreases by the mixed-grinding operation in any combinations of materials and total pressures. A catalytic effect of iron produced during reaction is observed when using graphite reagents but seems to be inhibited when using metallurgical coke. A simple kinetic analysis suggests that gasification of carbon is promoted through enhancement of the catalytic effect and/or change of rate limiting step from the gasification of carbon to the direct reactions between iron oxides and carbon. © 1995, The Iron and Steel Institute of Japan.

We have been developed ""Oxygen Recovery System"" which decompose carbon dioxide (CO2) and regenerate oxygen(O 2), for the simulation test. The oxygen recovery system consists of a equipment to reduce CO2 using the Sabatier method and a equipment to regenerate oxygen using water electrolysis method (Refer to Figure 1). And this reaction principle is as follows; The carbon dioxide is produced by the respiration of human, animals and plants. The carbon dioxide is reduced to methane and water using hydrogen in the first reaction. about 300°C CO 2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O (1) RU The generated methane is decomposed to carbon and hydrogen by thermal decopmposition in the second reaction. about 1250°C CH4 → 2H2 + C Generated carbon is accumulated inside the reaction tube.

However, the difficult methodological issues involved, and the diversity of analytical techniques so far applied, hinder direct between-study comparability and the drawing of clear conclusions. The APHEA (Air Pollution on Health: European Approach) project is an attempt to provide quantitative estimates of the short-term health effects of air pollution, using an extensive data base from 10 different European countries, which represent various social, environmental and air pollution situations. Within the framework of the project, the methodology of analysing epidemiological time series data, as well as that of performing meta-analysis, are further developed and standardized. Data have been collected from 15 European cities with a total population exceeding 25 million. The exposure data consist of daily measurements of black smoke, sulphur dioxide, suspended particles, nitrogen dioxide and ozone (each available in several, though not all, cities) from already existing monitoring networks. There is substantial variability in air pollution mixtures and air pollutant levels in participating cities. The mean (24 h) levels of SO2 range 27-327 μg·m-3 in the winter season, and those of black smoke range 15-292 μg·m-3. The mean (1 h) levels of ozone in the summer season range 32-166 μg·m-3. The outcome data are daily counts of total and cause-specific deaths and hospital emergency admissions. Data on potential confounders (mainly meteorological and chronological variables) are also used. There is large diversity in the climatic conditions in the different cities. Thus, the mean winter temperature ranges -4 to 10°C (minimum -1 to -37°C) and the mean summer temperature 16° to 26°C (maximum 26° to 35°C). Poisson regression allowing for autocorrelation and overdispersion is used in the analysis, after careful control of seasonality and other periodic patterns, and other confounding effects. The protocol and procedures followed are described, and the advantages and expectations from such an extensive European collaborative effort are presented and discussed.","Air pollution; Emergency admissions; Health effects; Mortality; Time-series","air pollution; data base; emergency medicine; environmental exposure; epidemiological data; europe; human; mortality; priority journal; review; Air Pollutants, Environmental; Environmental Health; Epidemiologic Methods; Europe; Health Status; Human; Seasons; Time Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029058360

Rates of dominant reactions along defined flow paths were estimated from modeled mass transfer and ages obtained from CFC‐modeled recharge dates. Groundwater upgradient from Lake Barco remains oxic as it moves downward, reacting with silicate minerals in a system open to carbon dioxide (CO2), producing only small increases in dissolved species. Beneath and downgradient of Lake Barco the oxic groundwater mixes with lake water leakage in a highly reducing, silicate‐carbonate mineral environment. A mixing model, developed for anoxic groundwater downgradient from the lake, accounted for the observed chemical and isotopic composition by combining different proportions of lake water leakage and infiltrating meteoric water. The evolution of major ion chemistry and the 13C isotopic composition of dissolved carbon species in groundwater downgradient from the lake can be explained by the aerobic oxidation of organic matter in the lake, anaerobic microbial oxidation of organic carbon, and incongruent dissolution of smectite minerals to kaolinite. The dominant process for the generation of methane was by the CO2 reduction pathway based on the isotopic composition of hydrogen (δ2H(CH4) = −186 to −234‰) and carbon (δ13C(CH4) = −65.7 to −72.3‰). Rates of microbial metabolism of organic matter, estimated from the mass transfer reaction models, ranged from 0.0047 to 0.039 mmol L−1 yr−1 for groundwater downgradient from the lake.

The extent to which such interactions have occurred in other ocean basins, and any associated teleconnec-tions between basins, is poorly understood. Here we present high-resolution palaeoclimate and palaeoceanographic records from a 20,000-year sedimentary sequence from the Santa Barbara basin, on the eastern margin of the North Pacific Ocean. The sequence shows oscillations of the benthic environment between low-oxygen conditions (laminated sediments) during periods of warm climate, and higher-oxygen conditions (non-laminated, bioturbated sediments) during cool intervals. Age differences between coexisting benthic and planktonic foraminifers indicate climate-related changes in the age and sourceá-and, hence, oxygen contentá-of basin bottom waters. Relatively young bottom waters are associated with the cooler intervals and are considered to reflect high proportions of intermediate waters derived from proximal sources. Conversely, older bottom waters are associated with the warmer intervals and were derived from more distal sources. These climate-driven variations in ocean circulation appear to be synchronous with the main oceaná-climate fluctuations in the North Atlantic region1á-6, suggesting that a tight coupling mechanism operates between the two basins. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.",,"oxygen; water; benthic environment; bottom water; climate change; ocean circulation; oxygen conditions; palaeoceanography; Quaternary (Late); benthos; climate; climate change; oscillation; paleoceanography; sea; sediment; Pacific, Santa Barbara Basin; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029509059

Methane emissions were monitored continuously until steady states were established. The porous, coarse sand soil developed the greatest methanotrophic capacity (10.4 mol of CH4 · m-2 · day-1), the greatest yet reported in the literature. Vertical profiles of O2, CH4, and methanotrophic potential in the soils were determined at steady state. Methane oxidation potentials were greatest where the vertical profiles of O2 and CH4 overlapped. A significant increase in the organic matter content of the soil, presumably derived from methanotroph biomass, occurred where CH4 oxidation was greatest. Methane oxidation kinetics showed that a soil community with a law methanotrophic capacity (V(max) of 258 nmol · g of soil-1 · h-1) but relatively high affinity (k(app) of 1.6 μM) remained in N2-purged control microcosms, even after 6 months without CH4. We attribute this to a facultative, possibly mixotrophic, methanotrophic microbial community. When purged with CH4, a different methanotrophic community developed which had a lower affinity (k(app) of 31.7 μM) for CH4 but a greater capacity (V(max) of 998 nmol · g of soil-1 · h-1) for CH4 oxidation, reflecting the enrichment of an active high-capacity methanotrophic community. Compared with the unamended control soil, amendment of the coarse sand with sewage sludge enhanced CH4 oxidation capacity by 26%; K2HPO4 amendment had no significant effect, while amendment with NH4NO3 reduced the CH4 oxidation capacity by 64%. In vitro experiments suggested that NH4NO3 additions (10 and 71 μmol · g of soil-1) inhibited CH4 oxidation by a nonspecific ionic effect rather than by specific inhibition by NH4+.",,"methane; article; biomass; landfill; methanotrophic bacterium; nitrification; nonhuman; oxidation; sludge; soil microflora; Bacteria (microorganisms); landfill cover soil; methane oxidation; microcosm; soil amendment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028973568

The index, the ratio of 201T1 uptake in the lesion to the normal brain, was 2.9 which suggested a recurrent tumor. Magnetic resonance images with gadolinium over the next 7 months demonstrated an enhanced mass lesion at the site of primary tumor resection and a new enhanced mass in the right temporal lobe.

Emission trading combined with regulations is a new element in the paper. Calculations using the RAINS (Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation) model suggest that overlaying emission trading on regulations not only reduces the cost savings but has beneficial impacts as well: ecosystem protection is not changed and significant decreases in environmental benefits for countries are largely avoided. Emission trading can also be used to decrease emissions and increase ecosystem protection. If combined with existing legislation, emission trading minimizes losses in expected environmental benefits for some countries, and most countries gain. However, the initial distribution of emission ceilings has to be used so that some countries are not confronted with higher costs. Trade-offs appear to exist between the use of emission trading to achieve cost savings on the one hand, and ecosystem protection and distributional equity on the other. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","acid rain; costs; Emission trading; Europe; sulfur",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042060068

In the first part of the paper the state of the art and the technical and economical development of the different solar thermal power plants (e.g. parabolic trough, central receiver and dish systems) are discussed. It is demonstrated that it is a realistic strategy for power plant producers and utilities to include solar thermal power plants for central and decentral electricity supply in their investment plans. Based on an analysis of the electric power demand in all Mediterranean countries expected for the next 25 years, the second part develops some strategies for the implementation of solar thermal power plants. These strategies take into consideration the expected economic development of different regions, the existing infrastructure and electricity networks, and the necessity to supplement fossil plants with solar thermal power plants. © 1995.",,"Electric load management; Electric power systems; Industrial economics; Marketing; Strategic planning; Technology; Electric power demand; Electricity supply; Market potential; Solar thermal power plants; Solar power plants; alternative energy; economic evaluation; energy demand; energy supply; solar power; technological development; thermal power station; Africa, (North); Mediterranean; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029415939

The region continues to be adversely affected by the environmental degradation associated with these past activities. In addition, companies today are being denied permits at sites where acid generation appears likely. And air emission limitations at power plants now threaten the economic health of many moderate- to high-sulfur coal mines. Thus, when considering the environmental impacts of mining coal in Appalachia, it is important to consider abandoned and active mine issues. For example, abandoned mines generate acidic, iron-rich waters that adversely affect more than 6400 km (4000 miles) of rivers and streams in Appalachia. In contrast, operations that were active after the enactment of the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) cause little water pollution. Subsidence in the region results from the degradation of abandoned, shallow room-and-pillar mines and from high-extraction deep mining. Several field studies revealed that the maximum vertical displacement can be as much as 60% of the extracted thickness. About 1.5 m (5 ft) of coal extracted can produce as much as 0.9 m (3 ft) of vertical movement. This maximum movement occurs over the center of the extracted area and vertical movement decreases laterally outwards. Above the edges of the extracted area, subsidence is generally less than 13 mm (6 in.) and decreases to zero within several hundred feet. Air quality is perhaps the only environmental issue that is associated almost exclusively with active operations. -from Authors",,"air emission; coal; coal mining; environmental effect; mining; subsidence; water quality; Appalachians; USA; Coal combustion; Coal preparation; Computer simulation; Costs; Environmental impact; Structures (built objects); Subsidence; Technology; Water quality; Water supply; Appalachia; Hydrologic impact; Natural amelioration; Residential well remediation; Wellhead protection; Coal mines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029478163

The enzyme seemed to consist of two subunits with almost the same M(r) value of 41,800 and contains two atoms of copper per subunit. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum showed that both type 1 and type 2 copper centers are present in the protein, whereas the visible absorption spectrum exhibited a sole and strong absorption maximum at 595 nm, causing a blue but not green color. The reaction product due to the Cu-NiR was mainly nitric oxide (NO), whereas a stoichiometric amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) was formed when cytochrome P- 450nor was further added to the assay system. Therefore, the denitrifying (N2O forming) nitrite reductase activity that we had detected in the cell- free extract of the denitrifying cells (Shoun, H., and Tanimoto, T. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11078-11082) could be reconstituted upon combination of the purified Cu-NiR and P-450nor. The K(m) for nitrite and specific activity at pH 7.0 were estimated as 49 μM and 447 μmol NO · min-1 · mg protein- 1, respectively. Its activity was strongly inhibited by cyanide, carbon monoxide, and diethyldithiocarbamate, whereas enormously restored by the addition of cupric ions. An azurin-like blue copper protein (M(r) = 15,000) and a cytochrome c were also isolated from the same fungus, both of which together with cytochrome c of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were effective in donating electrons to the fungal Cu-NiR. The result suggested that the physiological electron donor of the Cu-NiR is the respiratory electron transport system. The intracellular localization of Cu-NiR was investigated, and it was suggested that the Cu-NiR localizes in an organelle such as mitochondrion. These findings showed the identity in many aspects between the fungal nitrite reductase and bacterial dissimilatory Cu-NiRs.

In addition, marine carbon isotope values decreased substantially in both surface and deep waters. Because carbon is rapidly exchanged between reservoirs at the earth's surface, such as marine surface water, the atmosphere, land plants, and materials that obtain carbon from plants (e.g., soil minerals and herbivores), carbon isotope fluctuations provide time lines linking the marine and continental records. We analyzed the carbon isotope composition of paleosol carbonates and mammalian tooth enamel from stratigraphic sections in northwestern Wyoming. Carbon isotope correlation demonstrates that a short interval of extreme high-latitude warming coincided precisely with the first appearance of several important modern mammalian orders. In addition, oxygen isotope analyses of fossils and paleosol carbonates provide information about climatic conditions on land in the Paleogene. We reconstructed the oxygen isotope composition of local meteoric water using biogenic minerals. Paleocene-Eocene meteoric water was significantly 18O-depleted, indicating substantial loss of water vapor during its transport to the region. Soil temperature was calculated as a proxy for mean annual temperature, assuming oxygen isotope equilibrium between soil carbonate and meteoric water. Calculated temperatures were plausible (≈10-25°C), but highly variable, prohibiting high-resolution analysis of local temperature variations in response to global climatic warming. © 1995.",,"carbon; Eocene; isotope stratigraphy; oxygen; Palaeocene; palaeoclimate; USA, Wyoming, Bighorn Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028830342

When the CO2-fertilisation effect is taken into consideration NPP, standing biomass and soil carbon are increased in a future greenhouse climate. Although there is a considerable shift of the biomes in response to the greenhouse climate within the BIOME approach, the TCC in the investigated northern biomes stayed more or less constant.

Short-range prediction of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions has not been sufficiently successful to prevent casualties, although long-range and middle-range prediction of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions has made much progress in recent years. The Kobe earthquake shockingly showed the risks to society from active faults in urban basement rocks. Extensive studies for earthquake prediction and prevention of geological disasters are in progress, including the assessment of fault activity by direct excavation, drilling, geophysical and geochemical surveys of active faults, in situ stress measurements, groundwater monitoring, continuous measurement of crustal displacement by GPS and VLBI and mapping of crustal deformation by SAR interferometry. Waste is the Achilles' heel of modern human society. The burning of fossil fuels, which is today the main energy source, emits a huge volume of CO2 and causes global warming. Nuclear power, the most promising alternate energy source, produces small amounts of high-level radioactive waste that are extremely toxic for more than several tens of thousands of years. Subterranean disposal of CO2 is the safest effective method to reduce the emission of CO2 while burning fossil fuels. Formation of CO2 hydrate in cool, deep aquifers virtually completely blocks the leakage of CO2 in submarine sediments and land sedimentary basins at high latitudes. Long-range stability of the geological environment is necessary for the safe geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Rapid tectonic deformation occurs near plate boundaries, volcanic fronts and major active faults. There exist few active faults and no volcanoes in stable regions between the subduction zone and volcanic fronts in the island arc region. Geological disposal (""mines for environment"") is the most natural solution for the waste problems that arise from the use of mineral resources extracted from mines. Although many mining technologies are available for ""mines for environment"", safe geological disposal requires the accurate geological prediction of the nonexistence of future abnormal phenomena, instead of prospecting for past products of abnormal mineral concentration. Only the geological evidence from the earth's history of nearly five billion years can verify long-range predictions for subterranean containment of waste that are currently most often based on short-range experiments and numerical modeling. © 1995 International Society for Rock Mechanics.

The engine was equipped with an electronically-controlled common-rail fuel injection system that allowed both single and split (multiple) injections to be studied. The imaging system uses an endoscope to acquire luminous flame images from the combustion chamber and ensures minimum modification to the engine geometry. The system also includes an optical linkage, an image intensifier, a CID camera, a frame grabber, control circuitry and a computer. Experiments include both single and split injection cases at 90 MPa and 45 MPa injection pressures at 3/4 load and 1600 rev/min with simulated turbocharging. For the single injection at high injection pressure (90 MPa) the results show that the first luminous emissions from the ignition zone occur very close to the injector exit followed by rapid luminous flame spreading. For split injection cases, as the amount of fuel in the first injection decreases, ignition occurs further downstream of the nozzle. When only a small amount of fuel is injected, ignition does not occur until the fuel reaches the piston crown. The second fuel injection pulse is injected into a high temperature environment containing the combustion products of the first injection and flame luminosity appears close to the injector exit with almost no detectable delay. Experimental results are compared to numerical computations using a version of KIVA-II code with improved spray, ignition, combustion and emissions models. Good levels of agreement were obtained with measured cylinder pressures, heat release rates, ignition timings and locations and flame shapes. However, the need for some improvement in the vaporization and mixing models is indicated. The present imaging and modeling results are also used to explore the reasons for the significant soot and NOx emissions reductions with multiple/split injections. In this case, a late second injection prevents the high temperatures that promote NOx formation. The combustion products of the first injected fuel set up a sufficiently high temperate for the rapid ignition of the second injection. The second injection may quench NOx being formed from the combustion of the first injection and also entrain air into the first combustion region. This helps in the oxidation of soot. DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL concerns, emissions standards for engines are becoming more stringent. Thus, engine manufacturers are faced with the need to further develop current technology and/or devise new technologies for emissions control while maintaining engine efficiency. However, the development of new technologies can be costly and time consuming unless adequate tools are at hand. A predictive numerical model could serve as such a tool to help the engine designer with performance and emissions predictions. The objective of this study is to develop a combustion diagnostic system which can serve to validate a predictive combustion model for diesel engines. An endoscope based imaging system is used to visualize combustion in a single-cylinder version of a production diesel engine under different operating conditions. The optical access is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible, so as not to alter the engine flow characteristics. The experimental data includes engine cylinder pressures, ignition timings and locations, and flame development and propagation. The experimental data are also useful to help explain observed trends in emissions reduction through the use of different injection schemes, including both single and split injection schemes, and to assess the accuracy of a predictive model. There are many ways to categorize engine combustion diagnostics. Generally, the light sources for flame and spray images come in two ways: natural flame luminosity and laser-induced scattering [1]*. Images can be taken either with a high-speed camera, providing continuous images, or a digital CCD/CID camera allowing a single-shot for a designated engine cycle. The optical access into the engine allows for further classification of combustion diagnostics methods as direct or light-guided imaging. Direct imaging methods usually require major modifications of the engine geometry, which provide a large field of view, but altered engine flow characteristics. For instance, high-speed cinematography was used to record the natural flame luminosity to study the soot distribution in a diesel engine equipped with a transparent piston by Dec [2] and Espey and Dec [3]. The natural luminosity images give a picture of luminous flame emission integrated along the line of sight to a depth dependent on the optical density of the plume. Therefore, the information at a specific layer within the spray cannot be obtained. Laser-induced imaging techniques can be employed to provide temporally and spatially resolved measurements. Generally speaking, both the LIF (laser-induced fluorescence) and Exciplex (Excited-State-Complex) fluorescence methods can be used to image the fuel droplets and vapor of a diesel spray [4], [5]. On the other hand, to image the flame and soot, LII (laser-induced incandescence) and elastic scattering methods are commonly used [2], [3], [4]. The LII and elastic scattering images provide the soot distribution in the plane of the laser sheet, which can be positioned at any desired elevation through the plume. Although the above laser-based measurements can provide valuable in-cylinder information, extensive optical windows using transparent materials are required to introduce the laser light into the cylinder. Such a modification may change the flow and combustion characteristics. Less intrusive measurements without major engine modifications can be done through light-guided imaging systems which use fiber-optics or endoscopic devices. Light-guided imaging systems use relatively small windows for imaging to avoid modifying the engine geometry. However, a more complicated optical linkage is needed to transmit the light from the combustion chamber to imaging devices. For example, a randomized fiber bundle together with the two-color method was used to measure the flame temperature and particulate concentration (expressed as the KL number) by Yan and Borman [6], [7]. An integrated imaging system for flame temperature and soot measurements was developed by Shakal [8] incorporating a fiber optical bundle with an intensified camera. In the present study an endoscope based system [9] was used with an intensified CID camera acquisition system, similar to that of Shakal [8], to study diesel combustion. Luminous flame images were used to better understand the combustion characteristics of various injection schemes and to validate numerical models in KIVA-II code [10]. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Combustion chambers; Computer control systems; Diesel engines; Dust; Elastic scattering; Emission control; Endoscopy; Engine cylinders; Engine pistons; Excited states; Fluorescence; Fuel injection; Fuels; Gas emissions; Geometry; High speed cameras; Image acquisition; Imaging systems; Light; Light sources; Luminance; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical models; Pistons; Soot; Combustion characteristics; Common rail fuel injection; Different operating conditions; High-speed cinematography; High-temperature environment; Integrated imaging systems; Laser induced fluorescence; Laser induced incandescence; Ignition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072428945

Magnetic data are the primary evidence for ocean floor spreading and accurate interpretation of the sedimentary magnetic record depends on an understanding of the conditions under which magnetite is stable. Though chemical reduction of magnetite by dissolved sulfide is well known, biological reduction has not been considered likely based upon thermodynamic considerations. This study shows that marine and freshwater strains of the bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens are capable of the rapid dissolution and reduction of magnetite, converting millimolar amounts to soluble Fe(II) in a few days at room temperature. Conditions under which magnetite reduction is optimal (pH 5-6,22-37°C) are consistent with an enzymatic process and not with simple chemical reduction. Magnetite reduction requires viable cells and cell contact, and it appears to be coupled to electron transport and growth. In a minimal medium with formate or lactate as the electron donor, more than 10 times the amount of magnetite was reduced over no carbon controls. These data suggest that magnetite reduction is coupled to carbon metabolism in S. putrefaciens. Bacterial reduction rates of magnetite are of the same order of magnitude as those estimated for reduction by sulfide.

At the same mean PFD, the assimilation rate and the Jf were lower under the lightfleck regimes than under constant light. The activation state of two, key enzymes of the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle pathway, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and the photosynthetic induction states (ISs) were also found to be lower under flashing as compared to continuous PFD. Under all conditions, the IS measured 120 s after an increase in PFD to constant and saturating values was highly correlated with the Rubisco activation state and stomatal conductances established in the light regime before the increase. Both the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and Rubisco activities established in a particular light regime were highly correlated with the mean Jf in that regime. The relationships between enzyme activation state and Jf and between IS and enzyme activation state were similar in soybean and Alocasia and were not affected either by growth-light regime, and hence photosynthetic capacity, or by flashing versus constant PFD. The common relationship between the linear Jf and the activation state of key enzymes suggests that electron transport may be the determinant of the signal regulating IS, at least to the extent that the IS is controlled by the activation state of key stromal enzymes.",,"Alocasia; Alocasia macrorrhiza; Alocasia macrorrhizos; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028878349

Samples were taken 1, 3 and 7 h later, and at the end of the photoperiod for the following 4 d. Control samples were taken from ungirdled leaves. In the first 7 h after fitting the cold girdle there was (compared to the control leaves) a two to five-fold accumulation of sucrose, glucose, fructose and starch, a 40-50% increase of hexose-phosphates and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, a decrease of glycerate-3-phosphate, a small decrease in sucrose-phosphate synthase activation, an increase of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, increased activation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), but no significant change in photosynthetic rate or stomatal conductance. Steady-state transcript levels for rbcS (small subunit of Rubisco) and atp-D (D-subunit of the thylakoid ATP synthase) decreased 30%, cab (chlorophyll-a-binding protein) decreased by 15% and agp-S (S-isoenzyme of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) and nra (nitrate reductase) rose twofold. On the following days, levels of carbohydrates continued to rise and the changes of metabolites were maintained. Transcripts for rbcS, cab and atpD declined to 20, 70 and 25% of the control values. From day 3 onward the maximum activity of Rubisco declined. This was accompanied by a further increase of Rubisco activation to over 90% and, from day 4 onwards, an inhibition of photosynthesis which was associated with high internal CO2 concentration (ci), high ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, and low glycerate-3-phosphate. When the cold-girdle was removed on day 5 there was a gradual recovery of photosynthesis and decline of ci over the next 2 d. Hexose-phosphates levels and transcripts for rbcS, cab and atp-D completely recovered within 2 d, even though the levels of carbohydrates had not fully recovered. Activity of Rubisco only reverted partly after 2 d, and Rubisco activation state and the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate/glycerate-3-phosphate ratio were still higher than in control leaves.

The n-butane flux is initially low but under steady state conditions is much higher than that for methane. A mathematical model for transient membrane mass transport has been developed using the Maxwell-Stefan formulation. This model is able to predict the observed maximum in the flux of methane, and if we assume that the Fick diffusivity is constant the transient permeation fluxes are predicted to reach their steady state values monotonically. Thus the Fick formulation fails even at the qualitative level to explain the experimental results.

The bglP gene encodes an aryl-β-glucoside-specific enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate sugar:phosphotransferase system, whereas the bglH gene product functions as a phospho-β-glucosidase. Expression of bglPH is regulated by at least two different mechanisms: (i) carbon catabolite repression and (ii) induction via an antitermination mechanism. Distinct deletions of the promoter region were created to determine cis-acting sites for regulation. An operatorlike structure partially overlapping the -35 box of the promoter of bglP appears to be the catabolite-responsive element of this operon. The motif is similar to that of amyO and shows no mismatches with respect to the consensus sequence established as the target of carbon catabolite repression in B. subtilis. Catabolite repression is abolished in both ccpA and ptsH1 mutants. The target of the induction by the substrate, salicin or arbutin, is a transcriptional terminator located downstream from the promoter of bglP. This structure is very similar to that of transcriptional terminators which regulate the induction of the B. subtilis sacB gene, the sacPA operon, and the Escherichia coli bgl operon. The licT gene product, a member of the BglG- SacY family of antitermination proteins, is essential for the induction process. Expression of bglP is under the negative control of its own gene product. The general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system are required for bglP expression. Furthermore, the region upstream from bglP, which reveals a high AT content, exerts a negative regulatory effect on bglP expression.",,"beta glucosidase; glucoside; phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase; article; bacterial metabolism; bacterial mutation; enzyme activity; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; glucose utilization; lactose operon; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; sequence analysis; transcription regulation; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029619251

The two 5'-terminal genes of the operons, cbbLS, coding for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, were sequenced. Mapping of the 5' termini of the 2.1-kb cbbLS transcripts by primer extension and by nuclease S1 treatment revealed a single transcriptional start point at the same relative position for the chromosomal and plasmid-borne cbb operons. The derived cbb operon promoter showed similarity to σ70-dependent promoters of Escherichia coli.

The two corresponding cbbR promoters overlapped the cbb operon promoter and also displayed similarities to σ70- dependent promoters. The deficient cbbR gene located on pHG1 was transcribed as well. A newly constructed double operon fusion vector was used to determine the activities of the cbb promoters. Fusions with fragments carrying the cbb intergenic control regions demonstrated that the ebb operon promoters were strongly regulated in response to autotrophic versus heterotrophic growth conditions.

This trend is directed towards reducing vehicle exhaust emissions and is generally beneficial to fuel quality, ignition ratings, and stability. However, laboratory studies, as well as recent field experience in Sweden and the United States, indicate a possible reduction in the ability of fuels to lubricate sliding components within the fuel injection system. These factors, combined with the trend toward increasing injection pressure in modern engine design, are likely to result in reduced durability and failure of the equipment to meet long-term emissions compliance. The U.S. Army Belvoir Fuels and Lubricants Research Facility (BFLRF) located at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) developed an accelerated wear test that predicts the effects of fuel lubricity on injection system durability. This test now has been widely used by fuel, additive, and equipment manufacturers. Several thousand fuel samples have been evaluated to date, and collectively, they form one of the largest databases on fuel lubricity currently in existence. This range of data permits a good overview of the commercially available fuels and confirms a general decrease in fuel lubricity due to increased refining severity. The results indicate that no high-sulfur fuel (>0.15 mass%) had poor lubricity, while a number of low-sulfur fuels (<0.05 mass%) did produce unacceptable wear. The lubricity of many highly refined fuels is probably being restored using relatively high concentrations of additive. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Automobile manufacture; Diesel fuels; Durability; Fuel injection; Machine design; Sulfur; Emissions compliance; Equipment manufacturers; Fuel injection systems; Injection pressures; Laboratory studies; Research facilities; Southwest research institutes; Vehicle exhaust emissions; Fuel additives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072426995

In the U.S., crop residues produced by 19 principal crops are estimated at 400 million Mg/yr, compared with 2962 Mg/yr produced in the world. Crop residues returned to the soil contribute to the maintenance of and an increase in soil organic carbon content and add plant nutrients and reduce fertilizer requirements. Total amount of principal nutrients in crop residues range from 40 to 100 Kg/Mg. Consumption of fertilizers in 1991 was 116 million Mg of N, P and K in the world and 16 million Mg in the U.S. In comparison, nutrients (N + P + K) contained in crop residues amou8nt to 9 million Mg/yr in the U.S. and 74 million Mg/yr in the world. Therefore, a considerable quantity of fertilizers can be saved by returning the residues produced to the soil. Residue management is also important in soil and water conservation. About 2.5 Mg/ha of crop residue applied as mulch can reduce soil loss by about 60%. Water conservation is an equally important benefit of returning crop residue, especially for rainfed agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions. Water stored in the root zone increases with increasing amounts of residue returned to the soil. There are also snow retention benefits of crop residue mulch. Fuel value is estimated at 18.6 X 109 or 2 bbl of oil per MG of crop residues. Total fuel value is estimated at 7 EJ/yr (1 EJ = Exa Joule = 1 X 1018 Jourles) in the U.S. and 64 EJ/yr in the world. Management of crop residues can also be a useful strategy for sequestering carbon into the soil, and reducing emissions of radiatively-active gases into the atmosphere. About 1.5 Pg (1 Pg = 1 peta gram = 1 X 1015) of carbon is stored in the crop residues produced annually in the world. Crop residues influence agricultural sustainability by enhancing productivity. Productivity increases with residue returned are greater with low rates of fertilizers than with high or recommended rates. Generally, there is a synergistic effect between residue returned and fertilizer use. Innovative cropping systems should be developed to produce the desired amount of crop residue for alternative uses and returning surplus to the soil. In this regard, cover crops and conservation tillage systems can play an important role in designing appropriate cropping/farming systems. © 1995 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

It is therefore essential to incorporate effects of temperature and water supply on carbon partitioning of plants to predict effects of elevated [CO2] on growth and yield of Triticum aestivum. Although earlier papers have emphasized that elevated [CO2] favours investment of biomass in roots relative to that in leaves, it has now become clear that these are indirect effects, due to the more rapid depletion of nutrients in the root environment as a consequence of enhanced growth. Broadly generalized, the effect of temperature on biomass allocation in the vegetative stage is that the relative investment of biomass in roots is lowest at a certain optimum temperature and increases at both higher and lower temperatures. This is found not only when the temperature of the entire plant is varied, but also when only root temperature is changed whilst shoot temperature is kept constant. Effects of temperature on the allocation pattern can be explained largely by the effect of root temperature on the roots' capacity to transport water. Effects of a shortage in water supply on carbon partitioning are unambiguous: roots receive relatively more carbon. The pattern of biomass allocation in the vegetative stage and variation in water‐use efficiency are prime factors determining a plant's potential for early growth and yield in different environments. In a comparison of a range of T. aestivum cultivars, a high water‐use efficiency at the plant level correlates positively with a large investment in both leaf and root biomass, a low stomatal conductance and a large investment in photosynthetic capacity. We also present evidence that a lower investment of biomass in roots is not only associated with lower respiratory costs for root growth, but also with lower specific costs for ion uptake. We suggest the combination of a number of traits in future wheat cultivars, i.e. a high investment of biomass in leaves, which have a low stomatal conductance and a high photosynthetic capacity, and a low investment of biomass in roots, which have low respiratory costs. Such cultivars are considered highly appropriate in a future world, especially in the dryer regions. Although variation for the desired traits already exists among wheat cultivars, it is much larger among wild Aegilops species, which can readily be crossed with T. aestivum. Such wild relatives may be exploited to develop new wheat cultivars well‐adapted to changed climatic conditions. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

There is insufficient information to support the contentention that an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will enhance the CO2 concentration in the soil to an extent that is likely to affect root respiration. Moreover, there is no convincing evidence for a direct effect of elevated atmospheric [CO2] on the rate of root respiration per unit root mass or the fraction of carbon required for root respiration. However, there are likely to be indirect effects of elevated [CO2] on the carbon requirement of plants in natural systems. Firstly, it is very likely that the carbon requirement of root respiration relative to that fixed in photosynthesis will increase when elevated [CO2] induces a decrease in nutrient status of the plants. Although earlier papers have emphasized that elevated [CO2] favours investment of biomass in roots relative to that in leaves, these are in fact indirect effects. The increase in root weight ratio is due to the more rapid depletion of nutrients in the root environment as a consequence of enhanced growth. This will decrease the specific rate of root respiration, but increase the carbon requirement as a fraction of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis. It is likely that these effects will be minor in systems where the nutrient supply is very high, e.g. in many managed arable systems, and increase with decreasing soil fertility, i.e. in many natural systems. Secondly, a decrease in rainfall in some parts of the world may cause a shortage in water supply which favours the carbon partitioning to roots. Water stress is likely to reduce rates of root respiration per unit root mass, but enhance the fraction of total assimilates required for root respiration, due to greater allocation of biomass to roots. Increased temperatures are unlikely to affect the specific rate of root respiration in all species. Broadly generalized, the effect of temperature on biomass allocation is that the relative investment of biomass in roots is lowest at a certain optimum temperature and increases at both higher and lower temperatures. The root respiration of some species acclimates to growth temperature, so that the effect of global temperature rise is entirely accounted for by the effect of temperature on biomass allocation. The specific rate of root respiration of other species will increase with global warming. In response to global warming the carbon requirement of roots is likely to decrease in temperate regions, when temperatures are suboptimal for the roots' capacity to acquire water. Here global warming will induce a smaller biomass allocation to the roots. Conversely, the carbon requirements are more likely to increase in mediterranean environments, where temperatures are often supraoptimal and a rise in temperature will induce greater allocation of biomass to the roots. © 1996, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Box 26732, Tucson, AZ 86726, United States","We analyze the ultraviolet (UV) emission properties of a sample of 13 quasars studied with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The quasars redshifts are in the range 0.165 ≤ z ≤ 2.06, and their absolute magnitudes are in the range -30.1 ≤ Mv ≤ -24.4. The data were obtained with the Faint Object Spectrograph and have a spectral resolution of ∼ 1300 and a signal-to-noise ratio S/N ∼ 20 per resolution element. We include in the analysis optical spectra covering Hβ and the narrow [O III] λλ4959, 5007 doublet for 7 of the 13 quasars. We find that the profile of the O VI + Lyβ blend can be reproduced well using a ""symmetric Lyα"" template. The remarkable similarity of the Lyα and O VI profiles rules out significant line emission from a high-velocity and high ionization level component inner to the broad line region (the very broad line region, VBLR), suggested in a number of earlier studies of active galactic nuclei. The Hβ line profile is in most cases different from the Lyα and C IV profiles, which indicates that Hβ and the bulk of the UV lines are not produced by the same distribution of clouds in the broad line region (BLR). The following previously unobserved emission features were found in our spectra: (1) λ ∼ 832 Å, most likely O II λ833 + O III λλ833, 835 emission. (2) λ ∼ 1070 Å, most likely an Fe II multiplet. (3) λ ∼ 1175 Å, probably due to C III*. Possible implications of these features are briefly mentioned. The narrow [O III]-like components in both Lyα and C III] are generally significantly weaker than expected based on the observed [O III] λ5007 flux. This result is consistent with the 1993 finding of Wills et al. and implies that the narrow line region (NLR) in quasars produces weaker UV/optical emission line ratios compared with the NLR in Seyfert 2 galaxies. A study of a combined sample of 18 quasars observed with HST (including Paper I) suggests that the equivalent widths of all lines, excluding N V, decreases with increasing continuum luminosity. The slopes of the EW versus luminosity relations for the different lines do not clearly favor explanations which invoke either a decrease in ionization parameter, or softening of the ionizing continuum, with increasing luminosity, as the single physical mechanism producing this effect. We verify with our larger sample the conclusions of Paper I concerning the presence of N III λ991, C III λ977, and Lyβ, the similarity of the C IV λ1549 and Lyα profiles, and the generally small velocity shifts of the broad line peaks relative to the peak of [O III] λ5007. In particular, we find a very small average shift for O VI (120 ± 270 km s-1 relative to Lyα), which does not support the suggestion made in earlier studies that the line peak velocity shift increases systematically with ionization level.

Adsorbed 2-propanol was photocatalytically oxidized in the absence of gas-phase 2-propanol, and the species remaining on the TiO2 surface were characterized by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and oxidation (TPO). Nonphotocatalytic decomposition (TPD) and oxidation (TPO) of 2-propanol and acetone were also studied. The initial PCO of 2-propanol at room temperature rapidly forms acetone and water; water can displace acetone into the gas phase. Adsorbed acetone is subsequently oxidized photocatalytically to CO2 and H2O at a slower rate than 2-propanol photocatalytically oxidizes to acetone and it may form a surface intermediate before complete oxidation. Thus, at steady-state, the TiO2 surface is expected to be covered with H2O and strongly bound acetone or an intermediate. The surface reaction steps require near-UV light, but desorption does not. Formation of gas-phase acetone and water are desorption limited, but CO2 and CO formation are reaction limited. The rate of PCO to form acetone is essentially independent of O2 pressure, and acetone forms at room temperature even in 30 ppm O2, apparently utilizing lattice oxygen. In contrast, complete oxidation to CO2 is first order in O2 at low concentrations and zero order at higher O2 concentrations. The coverage of photoadsorbed oxygen is low (less than 1 μmol/ g TiO2), and the oxygen is strongly bound to the surface (∼ 200 kJ/mol binding energy). There are no indications that photoadsorbed oxygen was important for PCO; gas phase O2 is needed to replace lattice oxygen, but this may or may not be photoadsorbed. In the absence of near-UV light, titania is an oxidation catalyst only at much higher temmperatures. Thermal oxidation of 2-propanol also proceeds through acetone formation, but acetone thermally oxidizes faster than 2-propanol. Methanol and ethanol also undergo PCO on TiO2 at room temperature to form aldehydes, CO2, and H2O. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000481785

The project considered the potential for improving emissions from a diesel engine using different blends of methyl soyate. Structural changes such as piston bowl or inejector tip geometry were not to be considered. Only changes in engine calibration were allowed. The chosen test engine was a Navistar T444E HEUI direct injected diesel engine. This engine is a modem, electronically controlled diesel engine that allows considerable flexibility with respect to changing the injection timing and injection pressure calibrations. The following parameters were considered in the evaluation: 1) blends of methyl ester in low sulfur diesel between 0 and 100%, 2) injection timing, 3) Injection pressure, 3) application of an oxidation catalyst, and 4) application of exhaust gas recirculation. During the entire test program, full exhaust gas analysis and particulate emissions testing was conducted. Both gravimetric and Soxhlet extraction (for soluble organic fraction) analyses of the particulate filters were conducted. All testing was conducted on the basis of steady-state test protocols to allow an understanding of the influence of the fuel change as a function of location in the engine map. The results of the program indicate that substantial emissions improvements can be obtained with a relatively small methyl ester fraction within the 13-mode test. In general, it is possible to reduce HC, CO, particulate and NOx emissions (compared to 100% diesel at the standard calibration). Depending upon the particular calibration and blend, fuel consumption similar to the diesel engine is possible on a mass basis. Exhaust gas catalyst, injection timing and pressure variation and EGR results are presented and discussed. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Blending; Calibration; Catalysts; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Esters; Exhaust gas recirculation; Exhaust gases; Fuels; Gas emissions; Particulate emissions; Software testing; Sulfur; Direct-injected diesel engine; Electronically controlled diesel engine; Low sulfur diesel fuel; Oxidation catalysts; Performance characteristics; Pressure variations; Soluble organic fraction; Standard calibration; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072413291

Over a Co-ZSM-5 catalyst, in the absence of added H2O the addition of 53 ppm SO2 slightly decreased the NO conversion at 500°C but doubled the NO conversion at 550 and 600°C. With the coexistence of 53 ppm SO2 and 2% H2O, a substantial decrease in NO conversion was found at T ≤ 550°C but no effect was observed at 600°C. Over a Co-ferrierite catalyst, the addition of 53 ppm SO2 caused a sharp decrease in NO conversion. With both catalysts, CH4 conversion was significantly reduced, and the CH4 selectivity greatly enhanced as the result of SO2 addition.

Measurements were conducted in a controlled environment laboratory at three CO2 concentrations [350 (ambient), 600 and 900 (enrichment) μmol mol-1] and combined with five water regimes [leaf water potential of higher than -0.3 (well-watered), -0.5 and -0.8 (moderate drought), -1.0 and lower than -1.2 (serious drought stress) MPa]. Under well-watered conditions, rates of net photosynthesis significantly (P&lt;0.01) increased with increasing CO2 concentrations; leaf conductance significantly decreased. With drought stress established, leaf conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration decreased. However, leaf water-use efficiency increased with drought stress, with potential transpiration affected sooner than potential photosynthesis. The combined effects of CO2 enrichment and drought stress on water-use efficiency were significant in that the result of net photosynthesis was stimulated while transpiration in CO2 enriched plants resembled that of unenriched plants under conditions of drought stress. The results presented here suggest that if a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration occurs by the mid-21st Century, then the photosynthetic rate of A. firma in drought-affected regions may be expected to increase. A reduction in total water use, however, is not indicated. © 1995.","Alnus firma; CO2 enrichment drought stress; gas exchange; leaf water potential; water-use efficiency","Alnus firma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029187943

Historically, episodes of falling and low lake level associated with regional drought led to the formation of dune-capped beach ridges. The timing of prehistoric ridge formation, estimated by radiocarbon dating of plant macrofossils from early-successional dune species, shows that return periods of inferred drought, averaged for time intervals of 100 to 480 yr, ranged between 17 and 135 yr per drought during the last 2400 yr. In five of ten of these time intervals, the average return period ranged between 17 and 22 yr per drought. These intervals of frequent ridge formation and drought were associated with the development of parabolic dunes, which is indicative of high lake level and moist climate. This seeming paradox suggests that unusually moist decades alternated with unusually dry decades during these time intervals. Regional water balance probably varied less during the time intervals when ridges formed less often and the lake produced no evidence of high level. © 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.",,"beach ridge; drought; dune development; lake level change; palaeoclimate; water balance; climate; drought; fluid balance; lake; paleoclimate; seashore; United States; USA, Michigan, Lake Michigan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029475632

To investigate the cerebrovascular response to changes in arterial CO2 tension during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in normoxaemic and hypoxaemic piglets. Methods. Four groups of six anaesthetized, paralysed and mechanically ventilated piglets: group 1 ‐ normoxaemia without ECMO, group 2 ‐ ECMO after normoxaemia, group 3 ‐ hypoxaemia without ECMO, and group 4 ‐ECMO after hypoxaemia, were exposed successively to hypercapnia and hypocapnia. Changes in cerebral concentrations of oxyhaemoglob in (cO2Hb), deoxyhaemoglobin (cHHb), (oxidized ‐ reduced) cytochrome aa3 (cCyt. aa3) and blood volume (CBV) were continuously measured using near infrared spectrophotometry. Heart rate, arterial O2 saturation, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure (ICP) and left common carotid artery blood flow (LCaBF) were measured simultaneously. Results. Hypercapnia resulted in increased CBV, cO2Hb and ICP in all groups, while cHHb was decreased. No changes in LCaBF were found. Hypocapnia resulted in decreased cO2Hb and increased cHHb except in group 3. LCaBF decreased in all groups except group 2. CBV decreased only in groups 2 and 4. No effect on ICP was observed in any of the groups. The other variables showed no important changes either during hypercapnia or hypocapnia. ECMO after hypoxaemia resulted in a greater response of cO2Hb and cHHb during hypocapnia. The effect of hypercapnia on CBV while on ECMO was greater than without ECMO. Conclusion. Since cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 remains intact during ECMO in piglets, it is important to keep arterial CO2 tension stable and in normal range during clinical ECMO.

Two scenarios are evaluated: the ""baseline,"" in which the MeHg dose results from the combined effects of eating canned tuna fish, various marine seafoods, and freshwater sportfish, and an ""impact"" scenario in which the Hg content of the freshwater sportfish is increased due to local deposition from a hypothetical 1000 MWe coal-fired power plant. Measurements from the literature are used to establish the parameters of the baseline, including atmospheric rates of Hg deposition and the distributions of MeHg in fish. The Hg intake for the impact scenario is then based on linear scaling of the additional annual Hg deposition as estimated from a Gaussian plume dispersion model.

It has been known for some time that, for small paramagnetic species in solution, deuterium NMR can give better resolved spectra than proton NMR. In SSNMR of diamagnetic species in the solid state, it has also been observed that deuterium magic angle spinning (MAS) spectra are often better resolved than proton spectra. This paper reports that many paramagnetic species in the solid state can also have well-resolved deuterium MAS spectra which can be useful in chemical characterizations. In rare examples, such as certain VIII and CuII complexes, the proton MAS spectra are also well resolved at high spinning speeds. In these cases, well-resolved carbon MAS spectra can be measured without need for simultaneous high-power proton irradiation. The MAS line widths we observed for pure microcrystalline coordination complexes are essentially unrelated to the corresponding line widths measured in solution for similar complexes. Compounds with slow electron spin-lattice relaxation times can sometimes exhibit very narrow SSNMR signals due to spin diffusion among the electrons. On the other hand, many paramagnetic compounds, including those that give narrow signals in solution, for example iron complexes and high-valent manganese complexes, can be difficult to detect with solid state carbon or proton NMR experiments. The relatively broad SSNMR signals are presumably due to large anisotropic interactions that are not averaged by MAS alone (e.g., the dipolar hyperfine interaction in the presence of a substantial g anisotropy). However, even for these complexes deuterium MAS spectra are generally very easily detected including deuterons that are within 3 Å of the metal. Because of its relatively high resolution and sensitivity, deuterium MAS NMR of paramagnetic solids lends itself for characterization of the local structure of solid paramagnetic systems. For example, well-resolved splittings are often observed and are indicative of subtle Jahn-Teller or other local distortions. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the sensitivity is sufficient for characterization of paramagnetic biomacromolecules. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

The detection scheme uses Rhodococcus sp. nitrilase to catalyze the hydrolysis of benzonitrile derivatives directly into carboxylic acid and ammonia. The glassy carbon microelectrode surface modification was accomplished by attaching a hydrophilic tether to the microelectrode surface and then, using the free terminal amine at its other end, biotinylating with sulfo-NHS-biotin. Afterward, avidin was attached to the spacer arm, followed by the biotinylated nitrilase through avidin-biotin coupling. Benzoic acid, an enzymatic reaction product, is electrochemically reduced at the glassy carbon microelectrode, producing a steady-state reduction current proportional to the concentration of benzonitrile in the sample. In the temperature range of 25 to -20 °C, the biotinylated nitrilase was found to be stable up to 3 times longer than the native enzyme. The activity of the biotinylated nitrilase was optimum over a pH range of 7-11, while that of the native enzyme was optimum only between pH 7 and 9. The nitrile sensor was stable for at least 7 days at 25 °C. It was demonstrated for the detection of benzonitrile at concentrations of 0.1-5 mM in both simple and benzene/chloroform/nitrobenzene containing samples. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

The role of the IMP2 gene product in the regulation of carbon catabolite repressible enzymes maltase, invertase, alcohol dehydrogenase, NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD-GDH) and L-lactate:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase (L-LCR) was also analysed. The IMP2 gene product is required for the rapid glucose derepression of all above-mentioned carbon source utilization pathways and of all the enzymes except for L-LCR. NAD-GDH is regulated by IMP2 in the opposite way and, in fact, this enzyme was released at higher levels in both imp2 mutants than in the wild-type strain. Therefore, the product of IMP2 appears to be involved in positive and negative regulation. Both deletions result in growth and catalytic defects; in some cases partial modification of the gene product yielded more dramatic effects than its complete absence. Moreover, evidence is provided that the IMP2 gene product regulates galactose- and maltose-inducible genes at the transcriptional level and is a positive regulator of maltase, maltose permease and galactose permease gene expression.","Glucose derepression; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Transcriptional regulation","alcohol; alcohol dehydrogenase; alpha glucosidase; beta fructofuranosidase; carbon; galactose; glucose; glutamate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome); maltose; raffinose; article; carbohydrate metabolism; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; deletion mutant; enzyme repression; fungal genetics; nonhuman; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; transcription regulation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028840396

The Sip1 protein is known to undergo phosphorylation when associated in vitro with the Snf1 protein kinase. We have carried out in vivo studies of the genetic and carbon control of Sip1p phosphorylation. Metabolic labeling reveals phosphorylation of Sip1p under both carbon catabolite‐repressing and non‐repressing conditions and in both SNF1 wild‐type and snf1‐deletion cells. By sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoblot assay, we detect apparent changes in Sip1p phosphorylation states in response to changes in carbon source. At least one dephosphorylation of Sip1p occurs with a shift from non‐repressing carbon source to repressing carbon source. The MIG1 gene, acting through SNF1‐dependent and SNF1‐independent pathways, is required for some Sip1p phosphorylations. REG1 appears to be required for at least one dephosphorylation of Sip1p, whereas SSN6 appears to be required for at least one phosphorylation of Sip1p. These results reveal new complexities in carbon response signaling, and may reflect the involvement of the Sip1 protein in the same complex as the Mig1 and Ssn6 proteins.

In contrast, domestic natural gas, its principal fossil fuel competitor for power generation, is a more limited resource and increases in production cost and decreased availability are projected to occur after the year 2000, thus weakening its ability to compete with coal for power generation in the U.S. Renewable and nuclear energy sources are not expected to displace coal to a major extent during the 1995-2040 time period considered here. For manufacture of liquid and gaseous fuels, coal is projected to become competitive with other resources (petroleum, oil shale and bitumen) in the 2021-2040 time period. Increasingly strict requirements for environmental management of coal-generated waste streams are also anticipated with a growing incentive to reduce CO2 production through increased efficiency. This planning model imposes demanding requirements for conversion of coal to electricity and to clean gaseous and liquid fuels and, thus, for a strategic program of research, development and commercialization to most efficiently utilize coal resources in the 21st century. This review is based on an assessment of DOE's coal research, development, demonstration and commercialization programs for the time period 1995-2040. This assessment was conducted under the auspices of the National Research Council, in response to a request from the Acting Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. For the above time period, electric power generation is expected to dominate the use of coal, although a growing production of merchant medium Btu gas and liquid transportation fuels is anticipated during the period 2021-2040. The current DOE coal program emphasizes activities through 2010 and is focused almost exclusively on power generation technologies with small programs on other uses. Funding for many of the latter programs has been reduced significantly in recent years. The present study, with its longer time horizon, proposes an increasing emphasis on clean fuels research and on advanced research that addresses the barriers to higher efficiency in both power generation and fuels production to reduce CO2 emissions. Improvements will also be needed in control of air pollutants and the discharge of solid wastes. The power generation program addresses both near term goals that do not offer significantly higher efficiency, and also more ambitious goals based on combined cycles utilizing high performance gas turbines or fuel cells to potentially provide a 10-15 point increase in efficiency. These increases in efficiency will require extensive R&amp;D to overcome technological barriers. For fuel cells, high cost appears to be the major problem. For the gas turbine systems, production of a hot gas stream of sufficient purity to allow use of the very high efficiency gas turbines being developed for use with natural gas presents the major challenge. Critical components include: high temperature filters for PFBC systems; high temperature air/furnace heat exchanger for indirect fixed systems; hot gas cleanup system for PFBC and for gasification-based systems; high temperature turbine blades compatible with trace impurities that may escape the high temperature gas cleanup system; and high thermal efficiency gasification. Solution of these challenging problems will require a continued program of advanced research and component development. The choice of winners from the large array of technologies will also require augmented use of systems studies and development of realistic commercialization strategies. As natural gas prices rise, production of cleaned coal-based medium Btu gas for use in existing natural gas fueled-combined cycles and for industrial heat becomes economic and could relieve the pressure on the supply of natural gas for other uses. Conversion of this coal-based medium Btu gas to methane (SNG) might follow towards the end of the 2021-2040 time period. For this use, high efficiency oxygen blown-cold gas clean up gasification is needed. At present, however, the DOE gasification program is concentrated on air blown processes specifically aimed at integration with power generation. Production of medium Btu (synthesis gas) will allow concurrent production of hydrogen or Fischer-Tropsch liquids. The use of simplified once through processes with production of electric power from unconverted feed and low value products (such as methane) could bring costs of premium liquid fuels to a level competitive with 25-30 $/bbl imported crude oil (DOE financing basis). Current projections indicated that the price of imported crude oil could be in this range in the 2021-2050 time frame. Direct liquefaction costs, with continued R&amp;D, are believed to be approximately the same as indirect liquefaction, but with 5-10% higher efficiency and correspondingly less production of CO2. Given the long-term nature of opportunities for production of coal-derived gaseous and liquid fuels, DOE has a special role to play in supporting technology development aimed at cost reduction and efficiency improvement for these potentially important uses of coal. © 1995.",,"Carbon dioxide; Coal gasification; Combined cycle power plants; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Gas fuels; Gas turbines; Liquefaction; Liquid fuels; Research and development management; Coal conversion; Coal generated waste streams; Commercialization; Cost reduction; Efficiency improvement; Environmental management; Fuel research; Liquefaction costs; Coal research",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029514949

To determine the critical load exceedances on the European scale it is necessary to simplify and generalize. The spatial variation on a scale smaller than the 150 × 150 km EMEP grid squares is considered for critical loads, via a cumulative frequency distribution and the 95 percentile for the grid square is determined. The deposition is assumed to be uniform over the area and the exceedance over the 95 percentile critical load is determined. In reality, the spatial variation is considerable for critical loads as well as for deposition. Calculations based on the frequency of local critical load exceedances have been made for two grid squares in southern Sweden. Local critical loads for acidity are compared to local deposition. Deposition variations due to pollution gradients within the square and to ecosystem structure have been considered. The results are similar for the two squares. The calculations based on local exceedances on 50×50 km grid squares and consideration to landuse variability, indicate that in order to protect 95% of the ecosystems in the square, emission reductions 25% greater than the large-scale European approach are needed. The effect of enhanced deposition at forest edges is of relatively small importance for the total exceedance. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","abatement strategy; acidity; Critical loads; sulphur; variability","Abatement strategy; Critical loads; Cumulative frequency distribution; Deposition variations; Forests; Variability; Calculations; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Land use; Nitrogen; pH; Statistical methods; Strategic planning; Sulfur; Water pollution control; Air pollution control; nitrogen derivative; sulfur derivative; acid rain; acidification; conference paper; ecosystem; forest; sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029635926

Rat alveolar type II cells were grown in primary culture on detachable tissue culture-treated Nuclepore filters. Each filter was mounted in a cuvette containing two fluid compartments (apical and basolateral) separated by the monolayer. Cells were loaded with the pH-sensitive dye BCECF and intracellular pH (pHi) measured spectrofluorometrically. Monolayers were studied at ambient temperature on days 3-4 in culture, coincident with the development of high tissue resistance (RT ≥ 1000 Ω·cm2). After the cells were acidified by NH3 prepulse, pHi recovered to baseline when Na+ was present in the basolateral fluid, but did not recover when Na+ was present only in the apical fluid. This basolateral Na+-dependent pHi recovery in the presence of HCO3- CO2 was reduced, but present, in experiments where dimethylamiloride (DMA, 100 μM) or the stilbene derivative DIDS (500 μM) was in basolateral fluid. However, recovery was completely inhibited when both DMA and DIDS were present basolaterally. pHi recovery was not inhibited under Cl--free conditions, indicating that cytoplasmic realkalinization was not effected by Na+-dependent Cl--HCO3- exchange. These data indicate that alveolar epithelial cells express a basolateral Na+- and HCO3--dependent, DIDS-sensitive, Cl--independent pHi recovery process that probably represents Na+-HCO3--cotransport (symport). Basolateral Na+-HCO3- cotransport modulates pHi in alveolar epithelial cells, may contribute to regulation of intracellular volume and osmolarity, and may participate in signal transduction by hormones and growth factors. © 1995.","Acid-base; Cell culture; Epithelium, alveolar; Ion transport, Na+-HCO3- cotransport, alveolar type II cells; Mammal, rat; Pharmacological agent, DIDS, dimethylamiloride","4,4' diisothiocyanatostilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid; 5 (n,n dimethyl)amiloride; ammonia; animal tissue; article; controlled study; ion transport; lung alveolus cell; lung alveolus epithelium; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; 4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid; Amiloride; Animal; Carrier Proteins; Cell Membrane; Cell Size; Cells, Cultured; Epithelium; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Male; Pulmonary Alveoli; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sodium; Sodium Bicarbonate; Sodium-Bicarbonate Symporters; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028939007

Since the regional facility was built in 1977 in Englewood, CO., plant managers have been unable to correct the buildup of sulfur compounds in the rock trickling filters, primary clarifiers, and headworks for more than 10 years. In 1989, Littleton-Englewood's plant managers initiated a long-term program to mitigate, and ultimately eliminate, adverse impacts on the surrounding community. The Littleton-Englewood plant operates with the trickling filter-solids contact process for secondary treatment followed by tertiary nitrifying trickling filters for ammonia control. Both the fixed-film and suspended-growth components of these systems support a variety of microoganisms, some of which can oxidize inorganic sulfides and organic sulfur compounds. To take advantage of the oxidizing capacity, many treatment plants have used aeration basins and rock- or plastic-media trickling filters for combined treatment of wastewater and foul air. Such dual purpose units can achieve significant reductions in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and other odorous compounds, while treating liquid streams of primary or secondary process effluent. Littleton-Englewood's odor control program has resulted in the decrease in the severity of odor emissions and frequency of off-site odor reports. Process modifications to eliminate conditions that generate odors minimized foul air emissions and reduced treatment system costs. Nitrifying trickling filters are an efficient method to treat both ammonia and foul air in a dual purpose process.",,"Activated sludge process; Biotechnology; Filters (for fluids); Hydrogen sulfide; Odor control; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Dual system process; Nitrifying trickling filters; Odor removal tower; Odor removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029324488

The rates of these processes are controlled by the physico-chemical properties of the contaminants, notably vapor pressure, solubility in water and various partition coefficients such as those to organic carbon, lipids, plant matter and snow and ice surfaces. These properties are, in turn, profoundly affected by temperature, especially those involving air to condensed phase partitioning. Calculations of contaminant behavior in generic environments suggest that the unexpectedly high concentrations of certain organochlorine chemicals in polar regions can be explained, at least in part, by the temperature dependence of these partitioning phenomena. At low temperatures, partition coefficients from the atmosphere to condensed phases such as water, soil and biota increase significantly, thus causing higher ecosystem concentrations. Further, the rates of transport from the atmosphere may increase because of partitioning to acrosols and reduced water side mass transfer resistances. The authors propose a simple model to explain the migration and condensation of a contaminant from warm to cold regions, which we hope will represent a hypothesis that can be tested experimentally. We conclude that (1) there is a need to measure and correlate these fundamental properties and partition coefficients over the relevant range of temperatures, (2) the full implications of the effects of low temperatures on chemical fate can become clear only through construction of models describing the multimedia partitioning, transport and transformation in representative ecosystems and validating these models with experimental data, and (3) there is a need to identify the characteristics of the class of chemicals susceptible to what has been termed 'cold condensation' in polar regions. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Only weak electron emission from a few sites with field enhancement factors of less than 30 was observed at 200 MV/m. This progress results from an advanced preparation technique based on ultrapure water rinsing inside a clean room which reduces any kind of surface contamination. Alternatively, the enhanced field emission from microscopic particles and other surface irregularities on Nb can be much suppressed by in situ UHV annealing at 1400 °C followed by a fast cool down.

The diurnal variations of energy and carbon dioxide budget components and related meteorological parameters were obtained. Vertical fluxes of water vapor, sensible heat and carbon dioxide above plant canopies were predominant, compared with the fluxes at the middle layer of the plant canopy. This implies that, in the daytime, the upper part of dense plant canopies (LAI = 5) was an active source region of water vapor as well as an active sink region of carbon dioxide. A moderate and steady wind from the surrounding warmer desert and Gobi areas increased an upward water vapor flux and caused a significant downward sensible heat flux above plant canopies; these phenomena are the so-called oasis effects peculiar to the arid region. The diurnal variations of turbulent fluxes and related quantities observed in a wheat field were compared with the results of Goudriaan's simulation model.

After three weeks of growth in the respective atmosphere we were able to show that chloroplasts from plants grown under 700 ppm C02exhibited an 18% higher photo-system I-mediated electron transport activity. Furthermore, we were able to show that in plants grown under the higher C02 -concentration the peptide composition of photosystem I had been quantitatively changed. It appeared that the CPI-peptides were increased, whereas the LHCPI peptides were decreased. Corresponding to this change in the peptide composition the ratio chlorophyll/carotenoids/protein changes from 1:0.16:3.6 in the control plants to 1:0.23:5 in the “CO2-plants”. The chlorophyll a/b ratio changes from 1.9 in the control plants to 2.3 in the “C02 plants”.

Both lipids are specifically bound in a restricted number onto peptides of the photosystem I complex. Both lipids differ with respect to their binding strength on the peptides of photosystem I.

It is estimated that the country lost 525,000 ha of forests in 1990, with associated committed emissions of 31.5 Mt carbon (MtC), and 7.05 MtC of committed carbon sequestration. The paper then describes the possible response options in the forest sector to mitigate GHG emissions, and evaluates the most stable subset of these-i.e. forest conservation, woodfuel plantations and agroforestry. The conservation options were found to cost an average of U.S.$1.27 per tonne of carbon (tC) conserved. Five options for fuelwood plantations and agroforestry, with two different ownership regimes were evaluated. Each one of the options gives a positive net present value at low rates of discount, ranging from U.S.$1.06 to 3.4/tC of avoided emissions at 0% discount rate. At 10% discount, the eucalyptus and maize option has a highest PNV of U.S.$1.73/tC, and the government plantation gives a negative PNV (loss) of U.S.$0.13 tC sequestered. The options with a private/community type of ownership scheme fared better than government run options. This conclusion also held true when ranking the options by the BRAC indicator, with the government fuelwood plantation ranked the lowest, and the private agroforestry option of eucalyptus and corn performing best. The mitigation options evaluated here show that the forest sector in Tanzania has one of the most cost-effective GHG mitigation opportunities in the world, and they are within the developmental aspirations of the country. © 1995.","carbon emissions and sequestration; economic evaluation; forest sector; mitigation options; Tanzania",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001014072

Connectivity and closure properties of these contours help to overcome some important difficulties in computer vision: (i) edge organization and (ii) region merging. Consequently, using deformable contours brings additional knowledge in the form of curve properties, and thus reduces dramatically the search space dimension. Many researchers described a dynamic contour as a snake curve which is deformed so as to minimize the curvilinear integral of the sum of internal and external local energies. Here to fore, proposals were restricted to using a single deformable curve. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model of multiple dynamic non-parametric curve matching with 2-D images. The model is made up of two parts: (i) image formation, and (ii) high-level interactions, which measure consistency of the reconstructed object with the given image and the relational a priori information of the object, respectively. The model is conceived for a semitransparent scene such as additive projection imaging-planar radio graphical transmission or planar emission imaging. The scene model represents a hierarchical structure of three processes: Lines, regions and relational graphs. Thus, an object is modeled as a set of linked sub objects according to a 3-D relational graph which can be projected from a known viewpoint as a 2-D region relational graph. The graph represents high-level structural knowledge which reduces the search space dimension by conditioning the a posteriori probability to the a priori known graph. The resultant objective function is optimized using a descending search method with randomized sampling.

Marks were made ont he mold cavity to measure shrinkage at various distances from the gate. The results show that holding pressure and packing time are the most significant parameters. Cooling runners, however, could significantly influence local shrinkage values. Calcium carbonate reduces the shrinkage anisotropy as well as the cycle time of the molded parts.

However, a-sexithiophene (αT6) forms highly ordered thin films, and we show here that, by controlling the morphology of the emissive layer in a LED based on αT6, we can achieve polarised electroluminescence. Vacuum-sublimed films of aT6 contain highly ordered grains with the long axes of the molecules standing almost perpendicular to the substrate surface. Fluorescence arises from the decay of excited states localised on individual molecules (Frenkel excitons), and is polarised along the long molecular axis. Excitons diffuse within the film, and can migrate into defects such as grain boundaries and be trapped. In films containing small grains we observe isotropic emission from randomly distributed defects, but when we increase the grain size (to reduce the defect density) emission occurs from ordered regions and we measure polarised electroluminescence consistent with the bulk morphology. © 1995 Les Editions de Physique.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956239950

PAA at high concentrations (5-10%) can cause major loss of optical absorbance and microscopically-visible damage to bacterial spores. Spores killed by lower levels of PAA (0.02-0.05%) showed no visible damage and remained refractile. Treatment of spores of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 19213 with PAA at concentrations close to the lethal level sensitized the cells to subsequent heat killing. In addition, PAA was found to act in concert with hypochlorite and iodine to kill spores. Antioxidant sulfhydryl compounds or ascorbate protected spores against PAA killing. Trolox, a water-soluble form of α-tocopherol, was somewhat protective, while other antioxidants, including α-tocopherol, urate, bilirubin, ampicillin and ethanol were not protective. Chelators, including dipicolinate, were not protective, but transition metal ions, especially the reduced forms (Co2+, Cu+ and Fe2+) were highly protective. The net conclusions are that organic radicals formed from PAA are sporicidal and that they may act as reducing agents for spores that are normally in a highly oxidized state, in addition to their well known actions as oxidizing agents in causing damage to vegetative cells. © 1995 Society for Industrial Microbiology.","peracetic acid; radicals; sporicides; transition metal ions","alcohol; alpha tocopherol; ampicillin; bilirubin; metal ion; peracetic acid; radical; trolox c; antibacterial activity; article; bacillus; bacterial spore; controlled study; disinfection; instrument sterilization; nonhuman; temperature; Antioxidants; Bacillus megaterium; Disinfectants; Metals; Peracetic Acid; Spores; Bacillus megaterium; Bacteria (microorganisms); Paa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029566134

This paper reports the development and testing of a miniature carbon dioxide (CO2) solid-state electrochemical gas sensor (SSEGS) for use in the EGA portion of the instrument. A miniature potentiometric CO2 sensor has been developed that is configured in a planar geometry. The sensor uses solid-state reference and measuring electrodes co-located one one side of a beta alumina electrolyte substrate, and a thick-film platinum heater on the opposite side. Experiments are performed under reduced-pressure conditions to characterize the sensor response in terms of heater power, sensor temperature, total pressure, and gas-composition parameters. The sensor response to carbon dioxide (CO2) is found to be a complex function of these variables, and to act through two separate and independent mechanisms to influence the sensor output. The sensor oxygen sensitivity is also measured in the presence of CO2. A sensor temperature of 530°C is found to result in an oxygen-response slope coefficient of zero. Operation of the sensor at this temperature results in selective carbon dioxide response, and an output that is independent of oxygen partial pressure. © 1995.","Carbon dioxide sensors; Reduced-pressure environments; Solid-state sensors","Carbon dioxide; Differential scanning calorimetry; Partial pressure sensors; Pressure effects; Solid state devices; Substrates; Thermal effects; Carbon dioxide sensors; Oxygen partial pressure; Reduced pressure environment; Solid state sensors; Thermal and evolved gas analyzer (T/EGA); Electrochemical sensors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029288374

(1990). The computations consider the effects of pressure and temperature on the elastic properties of phases involved in the reactions. The maximum stability of moissanite throughout the upper mantle is typically five to six orders of magnitude lower in oxygen fugacity (fO2) than the Fe metal-wüstite oxygen buffer at equivalent temperature and pressure, in agreement with previous calculations. Under conditions of SiC stability, silicates will be Fe-free, Fe metal will contain substantial amounts of Si but little C in solution, and Mg-rich sulfides will be stable. Moissanite from the heavy mineral concentrate of the Mir and Aikhal kimberlite pipes, Yakutia, has been studied. Moissanite crystals are gemmy and vary in color from a characteristic blue-green to pale green to nearly colorless to blue-black. Most exhibit crystallographic faces and are in the size range 0.5 to 1 mm in long dimension. Their compositions include small quantities of Fe, which is ubiquitous, Al, Ca, V, Cr, and Mn, all of which may be present in concentrations &gt; 100 ppmwt. Mineral inclusions are present in some crystals. Silicon metal is the most common; inclusions of ferrosilicite (Fe3Si7), FeTi silicides, REE silicate, and sinoite (Si2N2O) have also been observed. The carbon isotopic compositions of individual moissanite grains have been determined by ion microprobe. The nine analyzed crystals from Aikhal and fourteen from Mir are characterized by a narrow range in δ 13C values of -22 to -29‰; the majority of crystals fall within a more restricted range of -24 to -27‰. Two grains were analyzed for N and found to have a δ 15N of +9.7 ± 4.0 and +5.6 ± 2.0‰. Five mechanisms for the formation of moissanite are considered. Moissanite may be a relict of a reduced, primordial Earth and now present only as a trace phase in an otherwise oxidized mantle. Alternatively, there may be present-day global regions of the Earth that are both highly reduced and characterized by light carbon isotopic compositions. Although these possiblities cannot be disproved, they are not supported by observations. Two other possibilities, namely that moissanite stability extends to more oxidized conditions at pressures of the lower mantle or that it may form metastably, cannot be evaluated with present knowledge. The possibility most consistent with, although not proven by, the isotopic data is that moissanite formed by metamorphism of reduced, carbonaceous sediments during subduction. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001234986

The carbon content is reduced in the plasma core as a result of the screening effect of the ergodic layer, which is due to increased transport in the layer, to increased recycling flux and to a modified impurity source term. Simulations of the C VI and C V intensity ratios require in the ergodic edge both an increased diffusion and a large (in the 1016-10 17 m-3 range) neutral hydrogen isotope density. The nickel burst is not 'screened' and penetrates into the core plasma. The confinement time tau p of the injected elements is always increased when the ED is activated, but there is no modification of the core plasma transport (diffusion coefficients, convection velocities, central reduced transport region extension). To simulate the increased central tau p values, a peripheral transport barrier has to be introduced. Satisfactory nickel brightness simulations can be obtained by modifying the inward convection velocity and/or the diffusion coefficient. If the barrier is taken to be purely diffusive, satisfactory carbon line ratios can be recovered, but the simulated injected impurity confinement time tau p is too short. For a satisfactory nickel brightness simulation it is necessary to add to the barrier some inward convection, pushing also the intrinsic carbon ions inwards, but this hinders correct line ratio evaluations.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001307145

Yet within the Kerikeri district, consistent differences in juice quality can be found between similarly managed orchards subject to the same synoptic weather patterns and inputs of photosynthetic radiation. This study examines possible causes for such differences, using comparative plant and simple climatological measurements taken over two seasons at three orchards located within a 2.5 km radius. Microclimatic differences were largely confined to windspeed and root zone soil temperatures, with the latter having a profound influence on the timing of budburst. In both seasons, delays in budbreak of around 1 month were observed at the orchard with the highest juice quality and this was attributable to a 2°C reduction in spring root zone temperatures. These lags in budhurst resulted in comparable delays in flowering, with the consequence that the season for fruit growth at the tardy site was substantially reduced. Despite these shortened seasons, subsequent juice quality (ratio of total soluble solids to titratable acids) at harvest was significantly higher at this orchard in both years. A number of possible mechanisms for this unexpected result are discussed, and lead to the following conclusion: because of the delay in budbreak, both flowering and the early stages of fruit development took place during periods of higher air temperatures, thereby encouraging higher initial rates of sugar accumulation and improvements in final fruit quality. The importance of early-season flower or fruit temperatures on final fruit quality also emerges from published statistical studies relating fruit quality to climate variables, but the biochemical basis for this influence has never been explored. Future work should concentrate on elucidating the physiological processes occurring during this critical early period of fruit development. © 1995.",,"climate data; microclimate; soil temperature; New Zealand, North Island, Bay of Islands, Kerikeri; Citrus unshiu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028994007

We have examined the spatial structure of changes in the annual mean and annual cycle for surface temperature and precipitation for both experiments; similarly we have examined changes in the variance for these two fields. We have also computed a range of test statistics in order to obtain reliable measures of the signal-to-noise ratio in the climate change signal from each experiment. We have computed test statistics for the entire globe and for five different region and we contrast the global response with the response in the Australian region taken as a representative sample. We find that the highest signal-to-noise ratios in the change from 1 * CO2 to 2 * CO2 are for the change in surface temperature for both experiments with little difference in the global averages between the experiments. Globally averaged precipitation shows a greater noise level but perhaps the greatest contrast between experiments. There are generally significant increases in the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation in the change from the 1 * CO2 to 2 * CO2 and with some differences apparent between the two experiments. The temporal variability of surface temperature does not change significantly in any of the 2 * CO2 cases, and there is little difference between the experiments. There is a significant decrease in the spatial variability of surface temperature in all 2 * CO2 experiments in all cases and with significant differences in the seasonal variations between different experiments. The spatial variability of precipitation increases in all 2 * CO2 cases and also with substantial differences in the seasonal variations between the experiments. There are accompanying significantly different spatial pattern correlations for both surface temperature and precipitation. In general we find that the global changes are fairly robust with the differences associated with convective parametrization schemes being very small. However, at the regional level, there are marked differences between experiments with changes both in the means and in the spatial and temporal variances but often with low levels of significance. © 1995.",,"carbon dioxide; climate modelling; convective parameterisation; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029472732

The more heavily damaged ""barren"" areas, surrounding the three smelter sites, exhibited very little natural recovery during the study period. A municipal land reclamation program was responsible for most of the observed revegetation within the barren area. Between 1978 and 1988 approximately 2000 ha of barrens were reclaimed through soil treatment, grassing and tree planting.

Box 99470, Mombasa, Kenya","An aggregated energy-based coral reef simulation model was developed and used to perform fishing experiments where fishing intensity and catch selection were varied. The model is composed of two groups of primary producers (coral and algae), herbivores (herbivorous fishes and sea urchins) and carnivores (piscivores and predators of invertebrates). Gross and net primary production are calculated from coral and algal production and respiration parameters, while the calcium carbonate balance is calculated from deposition by coral and algae and erosion by sea urchins and herbivorous fish. Simulation results indicate that fishing affects the coral reef's ecology and the benefits of the fisheries yield must be weighted against impacts on reef structure and processes. The model predicts that removing all fish groups will eventually result in reef dominance by sea urchins once their predators have been removed. This results in a rapid and dramatic drop in fisheries yields and reduced algal and coral biomass and productivity. Net calcium carbonate deposition is particularly sensitive to the effect of sea urchins or fishermen on living coral. Fishing only piscivores results in low fisheries yields but high reef accretion by indirectly releasing coral from competition with algae. A management strategy of fishing only piscivores and herbivorous fishes results in the highest and most stable fisheries yields. However, under this management strategy, high levels of fishing results in increased algae that competitively exclude coral and produces a temporary reduction in calcium carbonate deposition. But, at the highest algal biomass, calcium carbonate deposition is high and solely attributable to algal deposition. Nonetheless, this form of calcium carbonate deposition may not provide the reef structure required for fish habitat and shoreline protection. It may therefore prove beneficial, over the long term, to keep fishing below this level. © 1995.","Coral communities; Fisheries; Marine ecosystems; Production, primary","coral reef model; fishery management; marine ecosystem; yield",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028993524

However, recent research on Chesapeake Bay sediment has permitted determination of time of onset of major episodes of Bay degradation, which may be used with census data to derive preliminary estimates of the watershed's carrying capacity. Chesapeake Bay, the United States' largest estuary, is experiencing increasing degradation despite a decade of studies and significant remedial activity. Since 1985, phosphorus emissions declined 18%, due mainly to a ban on phosphate detergent, but nitrogen increased at least 2%. Degrading influences, related to increasing fossil-fuel consumption and relentless population growth, include (1) overharvesting of shellfish and fish species, (2) nitrogen emissions from sewage treatment plants, agriculture, fossil-fueled power plants and motor vehicles, (3) phosphorus emissions from sewage and agriculture, (4) debris, sewage, fuel spills and exhaust from 400,000 registered watercraft, (5) storm-water runoff, (6) sedimentation from land-use changes, (7) industrial discharges, (8) construction of dams and other barriers to anadromous fish migration, and (9) disposal of dredged material. Oyster harvests have declined over 95% in Virginia since the 1950s. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), essential to fish and bottom-dwelling invertebrates, is estimated to cover only 10% of its pre-1950 distribution. Where remediation efforts have resulted in recolonization of SAV, species diversity is reduced 50-90%. Anoxic conditions are persistent in the Bay's deeper waters. New sediment data allow precise determination of time of onset of degration by recognizing changes in ratio of benthic to planktonic diatoms. These data, coupled with analyses of living resource populations, indicate that the most significant episode of Bay degradation commenced in the 1950s, and suggest that the human population carrying capacity for the watershed does not exceed 8 million without substantial changes in energy consumption and lifestyle. The watershed's present population of 16 million is projected to increase at least 20% by 2020. Furthermore, registration of motor vehicles may increase by one-third over the same interval. Goals of 40% reduction by 2000 of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions into the Bay set by the Chesapeake Bay Commission are unattainable without permanent changes in behavior affecting every facet of life in the watershed. The extent to which remediation efforts are successful in the Bay's watershed will help define much of the structure and nature of U.S. society in the twenty-first century. © 1995 Human Sciences Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008758110

Sediment concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, copper and tributyltin (TBT) were elevated at stations inside the marina basin. A 28 day partial life-cycle test with the amphipod Hyalella azteca indicated no significant lethal effects associated with test sediments. However, amphipods exposed to sediments collected from three stations inside the marina basin were significantly larger than amphipods from control sediments, possibly as the result of hormesis. Sediment pore water from two out of the three stations eliciting enhanced amphipod growth caused a reduction in light emission by luminescent bacteria in the Microtox® assay. Furthermore, sediments from these two stations contained the greatest measured concentrations of copper and TBT. Benthic infaunal communities that typically reflect environmental degradation were found exclusively at stations within the marina basin.

Less is known about adverse long-term effects of metals on soil microorganisms than on crop yields and metal uptake. This is not surprising, since the effects of metals added to soils in sewage sludge are difficult to assess, and few long-term experiments exist. Controlled field experiments with sewage sludges exist in the UK, Sweden, Germany and the USA and the data presented here are from these long-term field experiments only. Microbial activity and populations of cyanobacteria, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, mycorrhizae and the total microbial biomass have been adversely affected by metal concentrations which, in some cases, are below the European Community's maximum allowable concentration limits for metals in sludge-treated soils. For example, N2-fixation by free living heterotrophic bacteria was found to be inhibited at soil metal concentrations of (mg kg-1): 127 Zn, 37 Cu, 21 Ni, 3.4 Cd, 52 Cr and 71 Pb. N2-fixation by free-living cyanobacteria was reduced by 50% at metal concentrations of (mg kg-1): 114 Zn, 33 Cu, 17 Ni, 2.9 Cd, 80 Cr and 40 Pb. Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii numbers decreased by several orders of magnitude at soil metal concentrations of (mg kg-1): 130-200 Zn, 27-48 Cu, 11-15 Ni, and 0.8-1.0 Cd. Soil texture and pH were found to influence the concentrations at which toxicity occurred to both microorganisms and plants. Higher pH, and increased contents of clay and organic carbon reduced metal toxicity considerably. The evidence suggests that adverse effects on soil microbial parameters were generally found at surpringly modest concentrations of metals in soils. It is concluded that prevention of adverse effects on soil microbial processes and ultimately soil fertility, should be a factor which influences soil protection legislation. © 1995 Society for Industrial Microbiology.","Cyanobacteria; Metal toxicity; Mycorrhiza; Nitrogen fixation; Rhizobia; Soil microbial biomass","metal; biomass; cyanobacterium; environmental impact assessment; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; ph; plant growth; review; rhizobium leguminosarum; sludge; soil pollution; soil treatment; Bacteria; Fabaceae; Metals; Nitrogen Fixation; Plants, Medicinal; Rhizobium; Sewage; Soil Microbiology; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028997566

The model is able to reproduce the entire range of synoptic circulation types. However, statistically significant differences in the seasonal frequencies and variances of the main circulation types are evident. These differences, which are most pronounced in the winter (at 500 hPa) and in spring and autumn in the MSL fields, are consistent with subtle errors in the predicted fields at the hemispheric scale. The lack of agreement between the NMC climatology and the “control” simulation precludes extension of this approach to investigation of climate change impacts in western north America, and to more meteorologically dynamic extra-tropical regions. The map-typing procedure is shown to be an appropriate GCM synoptic-scale validation tool that permits direct comparison of GCM output and observed fields.

WARMS uses pH, area, dissolved organic carbon, total phosphorus, and presence of fish to calculate estimates of pre-acidification, present and eventual steady-state values for pH, fish presence and waterfowl breeding parameters under proposed SO2 emission scenarios. We used WARMS to estimate chemical and biotic responses to scenarios simulated in three regions of Ontario where biomonitoring studies are underway. For pH and fish presence, WARMS predicts the greatest improvements in the highly damaged Sudbury region, slight improvements in Algoma, and that the strongest proposed emission reductions will be required to maintain current conditions in Muskoka.

Pricing reform also has a much broader impact than physical approaches to demand side management, although several options such as compact fluorescent lighting appear to have great potential. Options to reduce GHG emissions are limited as Sri Lanka lacks natural gas, and nuclear power is not practical until the system reaches a much larger size. Building the few remaining large hydro facilities would significantly reduce GHG emissions, but these would require costly resettlement programs.

They usually represent the weakest region in a molded part in terms of mechanical properties. They are also known to be even weaker in the case of blends. In this work, the mechanical properties and the morphology of injection molded polycarbonate (PC), high‐density polyethylene (HDPE), and their blends (PC/PE) were investigated. This typically immiscible blend was compatibilized by the addition of small amounts (<5% by weight) of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) containing 60% by weight vinyl acetate. The modified and nonmodified blends were injection molded in the presence of weld lines using a double‐gate dogbone‐shaped tensile bar mold. The weld line strength and its morphology were investigated as a function of injection temperature. In the case of pure polycarbonate, the weld line strength was found to be very sensitive to injection temperature whereas for polyethylene no difference was observed between the strength of the nonwelded and the welded specimens. For the 80/20 PC/PE blend, the weld line strength is lower compared to that of the blend components. The addition of less than 1% of EVA increased the strength of the weld line above that of the neat blend. The morphology of the nonmodified blend was similar to that of a typical immiscible blend (i.e., PE spheres dispersed in a rigid matrix of PC). However, addition of the copolymer to the blend resulted in a better phase dispersion and finer PE particles. In addition, the V‐notch in the middle of the sample was greatly reduced by the addition of the copolymer.

Beyond this simple ascertainment, it is now necessary and possible to quantify more precisely the impact of the Oceans in climate global changes. Accurate observations at a global scale and over several decades, jointly used with dynamic models, are needed to solve this problem. One dedicated technique is radar altimetry on-board satellites. Sea surface slopes and derived surface currents can thus be measured with a remarkable accuracy. The TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry mission was optimized to fulfil this objective, this project was jointly conducted by NASA and CNES with support of the associated scientific community involved in the design, the evaluation and the analysis of the system. Two years after the launch (10 August 1992), the results are even better than expected. Sea surface heights and variations are measured at a basin-scale, with an accuracy of 1-2 centimeters over 10 days. Such performances give access to the seasonal changes due to the thermal expansion between the two hemispheres, the interannual variability and the detection and propagation of Kelvin and Rossby waves in the tropical regions.

In order to perform emissions testing on vehicles, a chassis dynamometer capable of simulating expected driving conditions must be employed. West Virginia University has developed a Heavy Duty Transportable Emissions Testing Laboratory to perform chassis testing on trucks and buses. Emissions from the vehicle are monitored and recorded over the duration of a testing schedule. Usually the vehicle emissions from the whole test are reported as mass of emissions per unit distance driven. However, there is interest in relating the instantaneous emissions to the immediate conditions at specific points in the test, and in determining the emissions for discrete segments of the test (modal analysis). Unfortunately, there is significant delay between the point in time when the vehicle experiences a certain operating condition, and the point in time at which the emissions related to that operating condition are measured and recorded. This measurement delay results from a combination of the time due to the transport of exhaust gases from the engine to the appropriate gas analyzers and the response time of the analyzers. During emissions testing, the vehicle exhaust is connected via insulated pipe to the intake of a full size dilution tunnel where fresh air is mixed with the exhaust stream to simulate atmospheric conditions. Sample probes withdraw diluted exhaust gas from the tunnel and this gas is then transported to the gas analyzers via heated lines. Each of these components leads to measurement delays, and the sum of these delays should reflect the shift between expected and measured emissions transients. A mathematical model was developed using analyzer response times and appropriate fluid flow and heat transfer equations to predict the time delay between an engine transient and the resulting emissions response. Actual time delays were determined by cross correlating engine power with each measured emission. The time delays determined using this process on data from heavy duty vehicles are reported. Experimental and theoretical time delays were found to agree. Typical emission delays for a transient bus test for hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitric oxides were found to be 6.2, 12.4, 11.4 and 18.7 seconds respectively. Emissions data were compared piecewise with both speed-time and power-time schedules for the Central Business District transit bus test and the West Virginia University 5 Peak Truck Cycle. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air intakes; Automobile testing; Buses; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Chassis; Dynamometers; Flow of fluids; Heat transfer; Hydrocarbons; Internal combustion engines; Laboratories; Modal analysis; Nitric oxide; Time delay; Trucks; Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric pollution; Central business districts; Chassis dynamometers; Driving conditions; Fluid flow and heat transfers; Heavy duty vehicles; Operating condition; Exhaust gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072442234

Provided that diurnal variation in solar radiation and air temperature occurred, methane fluxes differed during day and night. Diurnal patterns in methane emission rates were found to differ among mire plant communities. In relatively dry plant communities (ridges, minerotrophic lawn), the average nighttime emission rates were 2-3 times higher than the daytime rates during the two periods with high diurnal variation in solar radiation and air temperature. Methane emission was significantly (p < 0.05) related to solar radiation and soil temperature at depths of 5 and 10 cm at all sampling points in the dry plant communities. In the wetter plant communities, no significant difference between daytime and nighttime average methane emission rates were found even though methane emissions were significantly related with radiation and soil temperature at approximately 70% of the sampling points. The increased emission rate for methane at night in the comparatively dry plant communities was probably caused by an inhibition of methane oxidation, owing to the lower nighttime temperatures or to a delay in the supply of root-exuded substrate for the anaerobic bacteria, or by both. The pattern observed in the wet plant communities indicated that methane production were positively related either to soil temperature or light-regulated root exudation. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","diurnal variation; methane emission; peat; weather conditions","bog; diurnal variability; methane; peat; temperature; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028974065

Shock waves generated by projectile impacts were transmitted into pure benzene, and then the shocked samples were analyzed by FID gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The projectile velocity ranged from 100 to 1200 m/s. The physical conditions of shocked benzene in liquid form were estimated by the Hugoniot data. The shock waves caused reactions between benzene molecules to produce PAHs with high-molecular weights ranging from 128 (naphthalene) to 306 (quaterphenyl). Major products were naphthalene, biphenyl, fluorene, trans-stilbene, phenanthrene, and chrysene. Striking aspects emerge from the experiments: (1) the molar yields of products were enhanced exponentially with increasing projectile velocity, (2) the composition of products remained constant independent of the projectile velocity, and (3) the mutual ratios between structural isomers and the ratios of various products to chrysene showed definite values independent of the projectile velocity. These results were identical for experiments at two different temperatures, 77 K (benzene in solid form) and 290K (benzene in liquid form). I propose in this study that thermochemical reactions of ground states play a major role in the shock synthesis, although reactions of excited states cannot be ruled out. Examination of the yield relationships among structural isomers in products suggests that concerted cycloaddition reactions controlled by Woodward-Hoffmann rules explain the formation of some products better than do radical addition reactions. Most species of PAHs reported to be present in carbonaceous chondrites and interplanetary dust particles were synthesized during the present experiment. Furthermore, abundance ratios between some structural isomers in shock-induced PAHs are approximately the same as those in carbonaceous chondrites such as the Murchison meteorite. Shock synthesis must have operated during shock events in cosmochemical environments, and the shock-induced PAHs may be present in the interstellar medium, in atmospheres of Jovian planets, and in carbonaceous chondrites. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006266737

Heynh. increased significantly, with the concomitant accumulation of starch, when whole plants or excised mature leaves were supplied with sucrose. A supply of glucose or fructose, but not of mannitol or sorbitol, to plants also induced the expression of the gene for β-amylase, and the induction occurred not only in rosette leaves but also in roots, stems, and bracts. These results suggest that the gene for β-amylase of Arabidopsis is subject to regulation by a carbohydrate metabolic signal, and expression of the gene in various tissues may be regulated by the carbon partitioning and sink-source interactions in the whole plant. The sugar-inducible expression of the gene in Arabidopsis was severely repressed in the absence of light. The sugarinducible expression in the light was not inhibited by 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea or by chloramphenicol, but it was inhibited by cycloheximide. These results suggest that a light-induced signal and de novo synthesis of proteins in the cytoplasm are involved in the regulation. A fusion gene composed of the 5′ upstream region of the gene for β-amylase from Arabidopsis and the coding sequence of β-glucuronidase showed the sugar-inducible expression in a light-dependent manner in rosette leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis.",,"Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029257520

The dissociation constant, determined by titration of the extent of the binding spectrum, is 7.0 ± 0.6 mM at pH 7.0. In contrast, cyanide does not bind significantly in this concentration range to the reduced form of cytochrome bd. The reduced cyanide compound of cytochrome bo can be laser photolyzed. Typically, less than 20% photolysis was attained with conditions that give essentially full photolysis of the carbon monoxide compound. The subsequent monophasic kinetics of recombination of cyanide at varying cyanide concentrations were used to determine kon, koff, and dissociation constant values at pH 7.0 of 572 ± 43 M-1 s-1, 4.2 ± 0.7 s-1, and 7.3 ± 1.3 mM, respectively. The dissociation constant changes very little in the pH range 6-8, indicating that a proton is bound together with the cyanide anion, as predicted by our recent proposal of a requirement for electroneutrality in the binuclear center [Mitchell, R., &amp; Rich, P. R. (1994) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1186, 19-26]. Competition studies confirm that cyanide and carbon monoxide cannot bind simultaneously, so that their binding sites must overlap. A small fraction of the reduced unliganded enzyme appears to have a distinct photolysis spectrum in the absence of added ligands, and this is transformed into a typical ferrous cyanide compound only at very high cyanide concentrations. Cyanide binding and photolysis were also examined in a number of mutant forms of cytochrome bo, and in a wild-type form which was partially depleted in CuB. Dramatic changes in rate constants and binding constants were found in several cases. Data from several mutants were compared with analogous data on the binding and photolysis of carbon monoxide, and the effects of mutation were quite different with the two ligands. A model is developed to explain the observed effects of point mutations on the recombination kinetics of both carbon monoxide and cyanide. Overall, the results indicate that the CuB site is required for binding of cyanide, but not carbon monoxide, to the reduced enzyme, possibly by providing the site for binding of the associated proton. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

A case study is presented for a jet fuel and diesel fuel spill, which resulted in free phase hydrocarbons on the water table, residual hydrocarbons in the soil and dissolved hydrocarbons in the groundwater. Remedial options were reviewed and a pump and treat system and a vapour extraction system were chosen to meet the main objective of reducing the potential impact on a drinking water well on the property. The pump and treat system and vapour extraction system were designed after completing a conceptual design, feasibility tests and subsequent analysis of the data. The final design consisted of recovery wells in conjunction with a vapour extraction system. The process treatment consisted of an oil-water separator to separate free phase product from the water phase, filter bags to remove particulates and precipitates, an air-stripper to remove volatile hydrocarbon components, and liquid phase activated carbon to polish the water before injection into an infiltration gallery.

Modern climate analogues for the western United States, similar to those patterns of atmospheric circulation of 18,000 and 9000 yr B.P., were examined in order to explain such patterns of spatial heterogeneity. Modern analogues were defined by comparing modern atmospheric circulation patterns with those simulated by general circulation models. Maps of temperature and precipitation anomalies of the modern analogues reveal patterns of spatial heterogeneity, which resemble the patterns of effective moisture compiled from paleoclimatic data. January 1957 was found to be a reasonable 18,000 yr B.P. analogue, and it features isolated areas of increased wetness in the northern Great Basin and increased dryness in the Northwest interior. Analogues for 9000 yr B.P. from a composite of 11 Augusts display patterns of spatial heterogeneity of effective moisture over most of the mountainous areas. The analogues suggest that spatial heterogeneity of climate is the rule rather than the exception over much of the western United States, with the climatic anomalies at any particular time representing the outcome of the mediation of large-scale atmospheric circulation controls by smaller scale topographic features. © 1995 by the University of Washington.",,"climate analogue; comparison; palaeoclimate; Quaternary; Quaternary (late); spatial variability; USA; USA, (West)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029472260

The continental zone is normally characterized by a shallow snowpack, faceted crystal growth, and relatively fewer avalanches as compared to the coastal and intermountain zones farther west. This study illustrates that variations in the avalanche character in the continental zone may, at times, resemble some less continental characteristics that are found farther west as a result of anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns. Results from cluster analyses show that some sites in the southern portion of the continental zone generally represent a less continental character. Anomalies of 500-mb heights explain the variability of avalanche climates for selected sites, particularly for Berthoud Pass, within the continental zone. Negative heights over the southwestern United States during early winter correspond with less continental conditions, but the zone of negative heights tends to shift westward over the eastern Pacific Ocean during February and March. However, generalizations of how synoptic patterns govern avalanche climate variations also vary between different locations as a result of smaller-scale climatic controls that operate over the region. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","500-mb heights; Avalanche climatology; Continental zone; Rocky Mountains",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001032197

The alpine flora of totally 138 species thins out gradually where A has the greatest number (137 species) and G has the fewest (55 species). A drop of 83 species from east to west must be due to ecological barriers which prevent growth on the coastal mountains. Several factors have been taken into account and discussed. Rich Cambro‐Ordovician rocks are present in all the explored areas, but the zone narrows towards the west due to the overlying base‐poor thrusted rocks in the Caledonian nappe system. West of Hardangervidda, the summits of the mountains are almost entirely composed of acid rocks, and habitats for basiphilous species are therefore not present at the highest altitudes. Climate during the season of winter dormancy differs much more than during the growing season between east and west. Alpine plants require climatic conditions conducive to the termination of growth in autumn, a state of quiescence due to cold winters, and stable snow conditions which give a rapid transition from winter to summer. As the oceanic climate does not comply with these requirements, the number of alpine species declines. The alpine flora of Westem Norway is closely related to that of Great Britain.

The area of highest nickel concentrations in water and lake sediments is limited to a 30-km zone around the copper-nickel plants; a similar situation exists for copper. Lake acidification increases the concentration of all metals in water, particularly aluminum.

Travel impacts examined include weekday person- and vehicle-miles saved due to a reduction in commuting, overall weekday travel reductions, and other changes in travel patterns for the telecommuter and the household. Some important issues regarding the estimation of these impacts, their use outside of the pilot programs, and their use in estimating energy savings or reductions in emissions are discussed.

The significant risk is defined as 1 case of cancer in a population of 100,000 persons within a period of exposure of 70 years (State of California, 1992). In this study, a large‐scale climate chamber test of a full set of furniture and fitments was made. The formaldehyde concentration in a test chamber peaked at about 112 μg/m3 within a day after the furniture had been installed. After 8 weeks the concentration leveled out at about 50 μg/m3. Various models were used to predict occupant exposures in homes containing the same furniture and fitments; multi‐compartment models identified a short‐term compartment with a half‐life of between 5.2 and 6.0 h and a relative source strength of between 75% and 30% of the total source strength; a medium‐term compartment with a half‐life of between 14 and 81 days; and a long‐term compartment for which the best estimate of a half‐life was 384 days. The accumulated dose of formaldehyde absorbed by an occupant during 70 years of exposure in the hypothetical home was estimated by extrapolation using the same models. The dose was found to be in the range of 0.13 g to 0.16 g. The concentration in the test chamber showing a maximum value of 112 μg/m3 formaldehyde may cause discomfort among hypersensitive persons during the first couple of days. The risk estimates based on the estimated long‐term dose indicate that the cancer risks associated with the exposure caused by furniture are in the range of 6.9 to 8.9 × 10−8, based on monkey data, and 5.8 to 7.4 × 10−7, based on rat data. In conclusion, a successful draft protocol was established for tests in relation to Proposition 65 and, with the limitations of this exploratory study, the actual furniture equipment is considered to cause no significant cancer risk to the consumer according to the Proposition.

Little is known, however, of their antibacterial activity and their ability to inhibit plaque formation. In this study, 2 mouthrinses containing peroxyborate (Bocasan) and peroxycarbonate (Kavosan) were compared alongside a negative control saline rinse and a positive control chlorhexidine rinse (Corsodyl) for their ability to inhibit plaque reformation. Employing a randomised four replicate 4x4 latin square cross over design and, whilst omitting all other oral hygiene, plaque was measured by area and index after rinsing for 4 days. In a second study, in vivo antibacterial effects of the rinses were assessed by measuring salivary bacterial counts following single rinses with the preparations at various time intervals over 7 h, Plaque inhibition by chlorhexidine was significantly greater than the other rinses. All rinses were significantly better than the saline rinse at inhibiting plaque. For plaque area, the peroxycarbonate rinse was significantly better than the peroxyborate rinse at inhibiting plaque. Salivary bacterial count reductions were significantly greater compared to saline with chlorhexidine at all time intervals up to 7 h. Whilst both peroxyborate and peroxycarbonate rinses produced greater reductions in bacterial counts than saline up to 3 h, at no time interval were the differences significant. The findings of these studies would suggest oxidising mouthrinses may inhibit plaque formation not by a direct antibacterial effect, but by some other mechanism. The magnitude of plaque reductions obtained with the peroxyborate and more so peroxycarbonate rinses would suggst a need for further study of these preparations when used as adjuncts to normal toothbrushing.

Central respiratory chemosensitivity has been intensively examined but some questions remain unsolved; namely, what is the nature of the stimulus (fixed acid and/or CO2) and where is the site of brainstem chemosensitivity (near the ventral medullary surface or structures deeper within the brainstem)? To examine these questions, we used the in vitro isolated brainstem of adult guinea‐pig perfused independently through the basilar artery and the bath. 2. Respiratory motor output was recorded with a suction electrode from cranial hypoglossal (XII) roots. Changes in pH and CO2 in the Krebs perfusate were made by changing either the bicarbonate concentration or the PCO2 saturating the Krebs solution. 3. Changes in basilar artery perfusate consisting of (i) an acidifying increase in PCO2 (hypercapnic acidic Krebs solution), (ii) an increase in PCO2 with no change in pH (hypercapnic Krebs solution), or (iii) a decrease in pH with no change in PCO2 (acidic Krebs solution) evoked increases in respiratory frequency and a concomitant decrease in inspiratory burst amplitude. 4. Bath superfusion with hypercapnic acidic Krebs solution increased the inspiratory burst amplitude with no effect on respiratory burst frequency. 5. Bath superfusion with hypercapnic non‐acidic Krebs solution increased the inspiratory burst amplitude and decreased the respiratory frequency, while normocapnic acidic Krebs solution increased the respiratory frequency with no change in burst amplitude. 6. These results show that respiratory responses to changes in CO2 and pH depend upon the sites of action. While a CO2 increase or a pH decrease affected the respiratory frequency in the deep brainstem structures (perfused through the basilar artery), CO2 respiratory chemosensitivity at the ventral surface could be differentiated from the hydrogen ion chemosensitivity. This suggests that different mechanisms mediated respiratory responses when deep versus superficial brainstem structures were stimulated. © 1995 The Physiological Society",,"bicarbonate; carbon dioxide; proton; animal tissue; article; basilar artery; brain stem; chemosensitivity; controlled study; electrode; guinea pig; hypercapnia; hypoglossal nerve; medulla oblongata; motor nerve; nerve stimulation; nonhuman; ph; priority journal; respiratory burst; respiratory nerve cell; Animal; Brain Stem; Carbon Dioxide; Chemoreceptors; Diffusion; Guinea Pigs; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypoglossal Nerve; In Vitro; Respiratory Mechanics; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028999893

At two intertidal sites situated at mean high tide at North Inlet, South Carolina, porewater drainage was estimated by this method to be 9.4 m-2 d-1 and 16.6 1 m-2 d-1, depending on physical soil properties and assuming that solute losses occur by simple diffusion across the sediment surface, by uptake and excretion by vegetation, and by drainage. Mass balance simulations indicated that sediment physical properties, evapotranspiration, and elevation are important determinants of seasonal salinity extremes. At sites situated mear mean high tide, small differences in elevation significantly affect salinity and drainage rate. As site elevation increases, losses of solutes by drainage and diffusion decrease, and the variability of porewater salinity increases. This is significant because interannual changes in mean sea level, which average ±2.9 cm on the South Carolina coast, can have a great impact on the structure and function of estuaries due to changes in the solute balance of intertidal zone sediments. Mass balance simulations that used reduced evapotranspiration rates typical of colder climates significantly reduced the mean and variability of porewater salinity, which suggests that at lower latitudes salinity becomes a more dominant determinant of biological processes. This should influence a number of processes including primary productivity, strategies of water conservation and osmoregulation, and community structure. This conclusion is consistent with published data that show tropical mangroves to have lower photosynthetic rates, and presumably lower gas exchange rates in general, than mid- and high-latitude salt marsh grasses. © 1995 Estuarine Research Federation.",,"intertidal sediment; mass balance; porewater; porewater turnover; salinity; sea level change; USA, South Carolina, North Inlet; Mass Balance; Salinity; Sediment; Tidal Waters; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029413861

The basic design of some of the air-cooled engines in production today dates back to the 1970s, a time when fuel economy, reliability and durability were the greatest concern. Extremely stringent U.S. and European heavy-duty on-highway standards have been implemented resulting in very clean engines for truck and bus applications that are now in the market. Meanwhile, the U.S. EPA, the State of California and the European countries have developed (or are in the process of developing) exhaust emission regulations for industrial engines. These requirements are being finalized and will be implemented in the mid 1990s. It is very encouraging to recognize that there have been definitive steps towards an international harmonization of the emission legislation between Europe and North America. In anticipation of these upcoming emission requirements, the focus of market priorities for all industrial engine applications is now shifting toward ""clean"" exhaust emissions. For some time now, DEUTZ has been optimizing the design of existing air-cooled engines from the viewpoint of emissions quality while preserving the existing performance levels and reliability.

The rate of chemical decay of these transcripts after adding rifampin to cultures was dramatically reduced by the csrA::kanR mutation. Deletion studies of a glgC'- 'lacZ translational fusion demonstrated that the region surrounding the initiation codon was important for csrA-mediated regulation and indicated that neither csrA-mediated regulation nor stationary phase induction of glgC expression originates at the level of transcript initiation. Cell-free (S-200) extracts containing the CsrA gene product potently and specifically inhibited the in vitro transcription-translation of gig genes. The deduced amino acid sequence of CsrA was found to contain the KH motif, which characterizes a subset of diverse RNA-binding proteins.

In sharp contrast to the situation in S. cerevisiae, the level of expression in K. lactis is not affected when glucose is added to a non-fermentable carbon-source medium. However, the genes are not constitutively expressed, but become significantly induced when the cells are shifted from glucose to a nonfermentable carbon source. Finally, induction of transcriptional activation does not occur in media containing both glucose and non-femmentable carbon sources. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Catabolite repression; Kluyveromyces lactis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Transcriptional regulation","carbon; cytochrome c; fungal protein; glucose; protein subunit; transcription factor; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; article; catabolism; cell nucleus; kluyveromyces; mitochondrion; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; saccharomyces cerevisiae; transcription regulation; Carbon; Comparative Study; Cytochrome c; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glucose; Kluyveromyces; Mitochondria; Promoter Regions (Genetics); RNA, Fungal; RNA, Messenger; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Species Specificity; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Transcription, Genetic; Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-c Reductase; Kluyveromyces lactis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029125357

This study focuses on a 1991 closure that occurred in the rural North Dakota town of Beach that left local residents 40 and 61 miles away from the nearest hospitals. Two hundred residents of the hospital's former service area were selected via systematic random sampling to share their perceptions on the causes and effects of closing their local hospital. According to respondents, this hospital closure was caused by a number of influences, with the most commonly cited being under-utilization of services by local residents, exacting government rules and regulations, doleful economic climate, dwindling population, poor and unstable local physician care, and poor management of hospital matters. Findings further indicated that Beach area residents were most concerned with poor access to emergency medical care as a result of the closing. Area dwellers perceived that the hospital closure's aftermath would include the loss of local jobs, further declines in the local economy, the suffering of elderly and children, transportation problems, and out-migration of some area residents. These concerns, coupled with the notable decrease in hospital care access, motivated many area residents to think of solutions to these problems rather than to place blame on others for the closure. © 1995 Human Sciences Press, Inc.",,"article; community; community hospital; health care access; health care utilization; hospital finance; hospital management; Aged; Child; Community-Institutional Relations; Female; Health Facility Closure; Health Services Accessibility; Hospitals, Rural; Human; Male; North Dakota; Public Opinion; Sampling Studies; Social Perception; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028830104

The steady state strain rate is demonstrated to be highly sensitive to the orientation of the reinforcement relative to the maximum compressional stress, with highest bulk specimen strain rates noted for conditions in which the sliding between the fiber and the matrix is optimized as a kinetic flow response (i.e., a fiber orientation of approximately 40-50° from σ1). One further discovers that the temperature sensitivity (i.e., activation energy) of flow increases as the amount of interface flow/sliding increases. The experimental results suggest that the high-temperature, low-stress interface response in this composite system is related to the ductile flow of the 'planar' SiO2 reaction-layer interphase that exists (in addition to the well-recognized planar carbon interphase) in these materials.

Various innovative technologies have been proposed for the reduction of CO2 emissions and the mitigation of global warming. They include (1) the WENET project, inaugurated in 1993 by the government of Japan, in which electricity produced by photovoltaic systems in vast areas such as the Sahara Desert, or by hydropower systems, is converted to hydrogen for transport to demand sites, and (2) Steinberg's Hydrocarb process, in which fossil fuels and biomass are coprocessed to produce carbon and methanol. While Japan is resource‐poor, it is located relatively close to Southeast Asia and Australia, which are large regions with abundant solar energy. This paper describes an investigation of the prospects for the adoption of these innovative technologies by Japan and surrounding resource regions in the next 30 to 40 years. An optimizing energy model is developed for the purpose, and the simulation results provide several interesting suggestions regarding Japan's future strategy for combatting global warming.

During the six month growing season, changes in community structure were monitored by quantifying species richness and cover. The CO2 exchange of microcosms was measured continuously and the resulting quantity and quality of biomass were evaluated. Species richness and cover did not respond to elevated CO2. After one month of treatment, CO2 exchange measured during the day did not differ between CO2 levels but the night respiration was two‐fold higher under elevated CO2. Stimulations of both day and night CO2 flux by short‐term CO2 enrichment were recorded several times during the growing season. These results suggest that despite some downward adjustment of photosynthesis, net canopy photosynthesis was stimulated by elevated CO2, but this stimulation was compensated for by an increased respiration. The 20% stimulation of final phytomass under elevated CO2 was not significant: it resulted from unchanged live plant matter but a significant, 100% increase in litter accumulation. These results suggest that in low‐productivity Mediterranean herbaceous systems, the greatest effect of CO2 is not on the storage of carbon in biomass but on the turnover of the carbon in the plants.

Vertical concentration profiles of CH4 and O2 showed that the water table essentially represented the oxic-anoxic boundary in the peat. This boundary was usually at the surface in the case of peat-bog hollows, but up to 20 cm of oxic peat occurred above the water table in peat-bog hummocks. Penetration of O2 into the peat increased under illumination when photosynthesis was active, but decreased in the dark. Emission of CH4 from the peat surface was faster from peat-bog hollows than from hummocks, where most CH4 was reoxidized before emission. CH4 emission rates also varied seasonally, being greatest during summer. For most of the year the amount of organic C oxidized to CO2 by SO42- reduction by anaerobic bacteria exceeded that being transformed to CH4 by methanogenic bacteria, except during summer when SO42- reduction became SO42- limited. Laboratory experiments showed that the addition of SO42- to peat inhibited CH4 formation, confirming that there was competitive inhibition of CH4 formation by active SO42- reduction, as demonstrated in other environments. The degree of acid rain deposition of SO42- onto peat bogs may therefore be extremely important in regulating the production and emission of CH4 from peat. CH4 formation was most active in the strata of peat 5-15 cm below the water table, although actual rates of CH4 formation were slower in the peat beneath hummocks than that below hollows. In contrast, CH4 oxidation occurred nearer the peat surface (only 3-7 cm below the water table) where the methanotrophic bacteria could intercept vertically migrating CH4. Surprisingly, the peak for CH4 oxidation potential occurred at about 5 cm below the water table, in peat which was apparently anoxic. This may reflect either a transiently oxic peat environment, in which aerobic CH4-oxidizing bacteria persisted, or the presence of a community of facultatively anaerobic CH4-oxidizing bacteria which, in anoxic conditions, metabolized substrates other than CH4. There was no evidence of anaerobic CH4 oxidation. © 1995.",,"acid rain; bacteria; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; methane; peat bog; TIGER; UK, Scotland, Dumfriesshire, New Galloway, Ellergower Moss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028993666

A stripped-down, intermediate, coupled ocean-atmosphere model is used to provide a prototype problem for the Pacific basin. Here the authors contrast the fully coupled case with the case where flux correction is used to construct the climatology. In the fully coupled case, the climatology is determined largely by feedback mechanisms within the ocean basin: winds driven by gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) within the basin interact with the ocean circulation to maintain SST gradients. For all realistic cases, these lead to a unique steady solution for the tropical climatology. Multiple steady state can be ruled out as a mechnaism for El Nino in favor of oscillatory mechanisms. The important role that coupled feedbacks are suggested to play in establishing tropical climatology is referred to as ""the climatological version of the Bjerknes hypothesis'. -from Authors",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; Bjerknes hypothesis; coupled ocean AGCM; flux correction; modelling; ocean-atmosphere interaction; tropical climatology; tropical meteorology; (Tropical); Pacific",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029476847

In order to influence the fleet consumption significantly, especially inexpensive concepts applied to mass production are required. Considering SI engines, one of the main issues is the reduction of pumping and heat losses during part load operation. This can be achieved on the one hand by shifting the engine main operation range to higher loads and lower speeds during city cycle driving due to long final gear ratios. In order to meet the vehicle acceleration demands simultaneously, a low end torque orientated full load characteristic is indispensible. On the other hand, the traditional way of downsizing combined with higher speeds under city driving conditions offers also potential for improving fuel economy. Based on flow tests, engine investigations and cycle calculations, the potential of an inexpensive fuel economy concept will be demonstrated and evaluated in comparison to a conventional downsizing concept. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Diesel engines; Fuels; Driving conditions; Engine development; Exhaust emission; Higher loads; Mass production; Operation range; Part load operation; Vehicle acceleration; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072417326

The study questionnaire was divided into three parts: the first addressed vehicles; the second, vehicle components; and the third, the impact on the transportation system of electric and hybrid vehicle use. This paper reports selected results from the first round of the survey. This international survey obtained information from 191 expert respondents in the automotive-technology field. The experts' skills predominantly reflected specialization in electric drivetrain vehicles and/or components. The first-stage response provided the following key results: • By 2020, EVs and HEVs using internal combustion engines are projected to have approximately a 20% new-vehicle market share, costs above (but near) the 2020 gasoline car, and technical characteristics comparable to 1993 gasoline baseline cars. • Through 2000, EVs and HEVs are projected to have characteristics inferior to 1993 gasoline baseline passenger cars, with significantly less range, much slower acceleration, and purchase costs 50-100% more than gasoline vehicles. • The AC (alternating-current) induction motor is projected to be both technically and economically superior to the DC (direct-current) and DC brushless motors by 2020, but the DC motor will still be significantly less expensive in 2000, offsetting its declining technical competitiveness. DC brushless motors are projected to be the most expensive throughout the study period. Battery costs will remain high, especially for the high specific power units. • EVs are desirable to help reduce urban emissions; however, the costs of these vehicles must be reduced. Also, they must be ""excellent products,"" developed with adequate R&D support, and must be as reliable as gasoline cars in order to succeed in the marketplace.

The emission quantum yields are in the 1.3 × 10−2 to 7 × 10−5 range, whereas the lifetimes vary between 15 and 0.3 μs, depending on the ligands. The room temperature emission in fluid solution was investigated for the photostable [Ru(X)(R)(CO)2-(a-diimine)] complexes (X = halide; R = Me, Et). Emission quantum yields and lifetimes were found to vary in the ranges 1.8 × 10−3 - 10−5 and 177−40 ns, respectively, according to the nature of X and R. The solution emission of [Ru(I)(Me)(CO)2(iPr-DAB)] is quenched either by energy transfer (anthracene) or by electron transfer with both electron acceptors (N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-bpy cation or N-methyl-4,4′-bpy cation) or donors (amines). Emission properties of this complex are only slightly solvent dependent. In 2-MeTHF solution, both emission quantum yield and lifetime increase with decreasing temperature. Importantly, the nature of the emission (i.e., energy, lifetime, quantum yield, rate constants of both radiative and nonradiative decays) was found to be strongly dependent on the a-diimine ligand used and, especially, on the coligands X and R. However, the nonradiative rate constant does not regularly increase with decreasing emission energy as predicted by the “energy-gap law”. Instead, the emission properties were found to reflect the character of the emissive excited state that changes from metal-to-a-diimine charge transfer (MLCT) for X = Cl to halide to a-diimine charge transfer (XLCT) for X = I and α-bonding to a-diimine (σbπ*) for X = Mn(CO)s. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Five closely linked open reading frames were located immediately upstream of the mvh operon and were designated flpECBDA. The flpCBD genes encode amino acid sequences that are 31, 47, and 65% identical to the primary sequences of the α and β subunits of formate dehydrogenase and the δ subunit of MVH, respectively. Located immediately upstream of the flp genes was the mth gene, which encodes the H2-dependent methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (MTH). In contrast to this mth-flp-mvh-mrt cluster of methane genes, a separate ~5.4-kb genomic fragment cloned from M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH contained only one methane gene, the mtd gene, which encodes the 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (H2F420)-dependent methylene- tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (MTD). Northern (RNA) blot experiments demonstrated that ruth was transcribed only at early growth stages in fermentor-grown cultures of M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH, whereas mtd was transcribed at later growth stages and in the stationary phase.

The engine selected for the program, the Centaur 50 (formerly named Centaur 'H') will be retrofitted with first stage ceramic blades, first stage ceramic nozzles, and a ceramic combustor liner. The engine hot section is being redesigned to adapt the ceramic parts to the existing metallic support structure. The program currently in Phase II focuses on detailed engine and component design, ceramic component fabrication, ceramic component testing, establishment of a long term materials property database, and the development and application of supporting technologies in the areas of life prediction and non-destructive evaluation. This paper outlines the design activities associated with the introduction of a ceramic first stage nozzle and two configurations of ceramic first stage turbine blade.

While the intact polymer structure leads to the emission of negative ions from fragmentation of the repeat unit, the degradation of such a structure under plasma exposure gives rise to production of oxidized fragments. It is demonstrated that this production is highest for a plasma using a mixture of O2 and N2 (20:80), and that as a function of treatment duration, the rate of oxidation of the modified surface layer correlates with adhesive strength, at least in a first step. PD‐TOFMS is used for analysis of the failure patterns of epoxyamine adhesive/PEEK/carbon composite in order to localize the fracture position. It is concluded that the increase of the cohesion of the interphase layer as a function of the plasma treatment duration leads to a shift from the interphase/PEEK interface to the bulk of the matrial.

In this paper we examine the assumptions in Paltridge's model and show that the model can be reduced analytically to a model involving trivial numerical computation. This step exposes the interplay of energy balance, dynamics, and extremum principles. In particular, we highlight the role of a secondary extremum‐principle, related to convective activity, which postulates that cloud cover and surface temperature conspire to maximize the sum of sensible‐and latent‐heat fluxes. We show that this convection hypothesis leads to simple algebraic relations (between cloud cover, surface temperature and horizontal convergence of energy) which could be tested against satellite data. We examine a single‐box version of Paltridge's model that exhibits remarkable temperature‐regulation through adjustment of cloud cover, and show that the regulation follows from the convection hypothesis rather than the maximum‐dissipation hypothesis. Next we investigate the relevance to climate of a theorem on maximum dissipation derived by Ziegler. We reconcile the maximum‐ and minimum‐dissipation theorems of Ziegler and Prigogine in the context of a simple model. Finally, we speculate how the principle of maximum dissipation might be applied in a climate model.

Particulate control was achieved with a trap that incorporated a high-filtration efficiency ceramic honeycomb monolith. Aerodynamic regeneration was used to periodically backflush the monolith filter. Soot was collected in a metallic chamber and was either incinerated by an electric burner or removed by a vacuum cleaner. NOx emissions were reduced by recirculation of filtered exhaust gases (EGR), which was made possible by the high collection efficiency of the employed monoliths. Tests were conducted on the road, driving a diesel vehicle under various loads and speeds. The levels of NO, CO and O2 at the exhaust were continuously monitored using a portable instrument. The particulate filtration efficiency was in the vicinity of 99% using CeraMem and 97-98% using Panasonic traps, respectively, hence the EGR line was effectively particulate-free. At a level of 20% EGR, the NO concentration in the exhaust was reduced by as high as 50% at steady-state freeway speeds (90-100 km/hr) and intermediate loads. At the same time, the measured exhaust O2 concentration dropped by 20 to 25%, while the CO concentration increased by up to 20%. Fuel consumption increased by 5-6% due to the combined effects of EGR and the particulate trap. Only mild effects on the drivability and performance of the vehicle were noticed when a particulate trap and EGR were used, as long as the pressure drop was kept below 250 mbars. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Aerodynamics; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Efficiency; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicles; Ceramic honeycombs; Filtration efficiency; High collection efficiency; Particulate control; Particulate filtration; Particulate traps; Portable instrument; Simultaneous control; Exhaust gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072423086

If other seams surround the mined seam, the quantity of gas emitted from all sources is often sufficient to overcome the ventilation system. This problem occured early in some Australian mines, and ventilation solutions were put in place. Many of these solutions have subsequently required augmentation by gas drainage networks - both in-seam and downhole - to capture and direct gas away from the longwall ventilating district. At the same time, a number of Australian mines have faced the problem of outbursts of gas and coal. In the last 100 years, almost 65 outbursts have occurred, with 15 fatalities. Much research have been conducted to overcome the problem of outbursts. One control technique, developed in the early 1980s, involves the intensive drainage of gas before mining and was initially planned to control gas emissions to facilitate efficient operation of the longwall. But drainage systems are increasingly being used as the prime means of controlling outbursts. This facilitates the rapid rates of advance needed in development panels to support an efficient, high-production retreat longwall. -from Author",,"Coal; Drainage; Gases; Mining; Outbursts; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028873993

We have used a ligation- mediated PCR technique to analyze dioxin-induced changes in protein-DNA interactions and chromatin structure of the Cyp1A1 enhancer-promoter in its native chromosomal setting. Dioxin-induced binding of the AhR/Arnt heteromer to enhancer chromatin is associated with a localized (about 200 bp) alteration in chromatin structure that is manifested by increased accessibility of the DNA; these changes probably reflect direct disruption of a nucleosome by AhR/Arnt. Dioxin induces analogous AhR/Arnt-dependent changes in chromatin structure and accessibility at the Cyp1A1 promoter. However, the changes at the promoter must occur by a different, more indirect mechanism, because they are induced from a distance and do not reflect a local effect of AhR/Arnt binding. Dose-response experiments indicate that the changes in chromatin structure at the enhancer and promoter are graded and mirror the graded induction of Cyp1A1 transcription by dioxin.

There is a continuing need to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. Much of the focus of current work is on engine development as a stand-alone subsystem. While this has yielded impressive gains so far, further improvement in emissions or engine efficiency is unlikely in a cost effective manner. Consequently, an integrated approach looking at the whole powertrain is required. A computer model of the heavy duty truck system was built and evaluated. The model includes both conventional and hybrid powertrains. It uses a series of interacting sub-models for the vehicle, transmission, engine, exhaust aftertreatment and braking energy recovery/storage devices. A specified driving cycle is used to calculate the power requirements at the wheels and energy flow and inefficiencies throughout the drivetrain. The total energy consumed and pollutants emitted is accumulated over the driving cycle. It is shown that for an urban heavy duty driving cycle, up to 20 percent improvement in vehicle fuel economy can be achieved with up to 30 percent possible with more advanced controls. Fuel savings over a representative driving cycle for interstate long haul trucks have not been evaluated yet, but are likely to be substantial. Global positioning systems and known route and terrain can be used to implement a ""look ahead"" control strategy. Further fuel economy improvements are therefore possible. A typical long haul truck consumes about 75 to 150,000 liters of diesel fuel a year. At 1995 fuel prices, a 10 percent improvement in fuel economy results in savings of about $6,000 to $9,000 over a 2 to 3 year period. The added costs of hybrid powertrain should be kept within this target value. It is shown that with the use of a hybrid powertrain, the engine can be run at selected, narrow ranges of speed and load. Such a strategy allows both nitric oxide and particulate emissions to be reduced by over 50 percent compared to current levels. Thus, with a systems approach (rather than concentrating on the engine alone), it is possible to simultaneously reduce emissions and fuel consumption by 50 percent and 30 percent respectively over current levels. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Cost effectiveness; Costs; Diesel fuels; Engines; Fuels; Hybrid powertrains; Nitric oxide; Trucks; Urban transportation; Vehicle transmissions; Wages; Braking energy recoveries; Control strategies; Engine development; Exhaust aftertreatment; Integrated approach; Over-current levels; Transportation fuels; Vehicle fuel economy; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072428297

In streams with catchments &lt;100 km2 a snowpack pH below 4.8 resulted in a stream pH below 5.5. As the snowpack pH in the southern mountain range is 4.0-4.6, lower values to the south and at high altitudes, large areas are affected by acid deposition. The acidity of the snowpack is released almost directly into the streams during thaw, due to the large snowpack, rapid thaw, steep terrain and thin soils. The acidification of the snow has lead to an extensive fauna depletion, especially in smaller streams without upstream lakes. The abundance of benthos in acidified streams in the municipality of Härjedalen (11.000 km2) is today only one tenth of the abundance before acidification. Fish populations have declined to the same extent, and several acid-sensitive species have been lost.

It was shown by the pure tone audiometry that 500 Hz dip and aging change without laterality. The SISI test, self-recording audiometry and speech discrimination tests showed retrocochlear deafness. The ABR recorded no response and there was no canal paresis or no other abnormal findings on ENG. The CM threshold was better than that obtained by conventional audiometry, and the CM amplitude was within normal limits. The AP threshold was much higher and the AP amplitude. much lower than in normal subjects. The adapted AP amplitude was within normal limits.

These 2 Se-associated conditions were defined in the 1930s and 1940s, and the nosology of blind staggers is questionable. Seventeen yearling steers fed 0. 15, 0. 28, and 0. 8 mg Se/kg body weight as selenomethionine or selenite for 120 days were euthanized and examined postmortem. Significant lesions were confined to 4 steers in the medium- and high-dose selenomethionine group and to 1 steer in the high-dose selenite group. Grossly, dystrophic hoof lesions developed in 2 steers, 1 of which had extensive separation of horn from lamellar and coronary epidermis and also lost hair from the tail switch. Histologically, tubules in the stratum medium of hooves from these 5 steers were replaced by islands of parakeratotic cellular debris, separated by more normal hoof matrix. Two of the 5 steers also had hyperplasia, acanthosis, parakeratosis, and disorganized germinal epithelium of varying severity in hoof epithelium, particularly at the tips of epidermal lamellae. These changes may distinguish the hoof lesions of chronic selenosis from those of chronic laminitis in cattle, in which dermal (chorial) changes predominate. In skin from the distal part of the tail of the animal that lost its switch, most follicles were atrophic and devoid of hairshafts and displayed dyskeratosis and mild superficial follicular keratosis. No significant lesions developed in tissues other than integument. Automet-allographic staining for catalytic Se bonds in various tissues, including skin, liver, and kidney, revealed no positive staining of hair shafts; the correlation between stain intensity and dose group was poor. These findings indicate that dietary exposure for 4 months to 0. 28 and 0. 8 mg Se/kg in the form of selenomethionine and to 0. 8 mg Se/kg in the form of sodium selenite reproduces in some cattle mild (subclinical) to severe (clinical) forms of alkali disease. No significant neurological, renal, or hepatic lesions developed, supporting the contention that blind staggers is caused by factors other than excessive dietary selenium. © 1995, American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians.

More specifically the research concentrates on 1) the reconstruction of long-term carbonate production during the last glacial cycle (150,000 years) at 48°N and 25°W, and 2) the determination of regional trends in carbonate production in the Northeast Atlantic during times of rapid climatic change. To estimate past primary productivity using biogenic carbonate accumulation on the seafloor, one needs to quantify the amount of detrital and biogenic carbonate as well as the loss of calcium carbonate by dissolution. We developed a new method to quantify dissolution using recent sediments from a range of oceanic water depths which represent different degrees of dissolution. This can be applied to deep water piston cores to determine temporal variation in carbonate dissolution. Our time series of reconstructed surface ocean productivity of the last 150,000 years, based on biogenic carbonate accumulation at 48°N, 25°W, indicates that during interglacials (warm periods) primary productivity is generally high, whereas during glacials (cold periods) it is low. This corresponds to times of high and low atmospheric CO 2 respectively, as suggested by the VOSTOK ice core record. The regional reconstruction of oceanic primary productivity shows that the contrast in productivity values between warm and cold periods decreases going from 60°N to 45°N. Published reconstruction's at low latitudes (i.e. upwelling off NW Africa) indicate a continuation of this trend, ending in the tropics with high productivity during glacials and low productivity during interglacial periods which is the opposite of the higher latitude situation. This will be of importance when modelling global oceanic carbon flux. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957026203

The detector itself consists of a 215 cm3 high purity n-type Ge crystal kept at cryogenic temperatures by a passive radiative cooler. The geometric field of view defined by the cooler is ∼ 1.8 π steradian. To avoid continuous triggers by soft solar events, a thin BeCu Sun-shield around the sides of the cooler has been provided. A passive Mo/Pb occulter, which modulates signals from within ±5° of the ecliptic plane at the spacecraft spin frequency, is used to identify and study solar flares, as well as emission from the galactic plane and center. Thus, in addition to transient event measurements, the instrument will allow the search for possible diffuse background lines and monitor the 511 keV positron annihilation radiation from the galactic center. In order to handle the typically large burst count rates, which can be in excess of 100 kHz, burst data are stored directly in an onboard 2.75 Mbit burst memory with an absolute timing accuracy of ±1.5 ms after ground processing. The memory is capable of storing the entire spectral data set of all but the largest bursts. WIND is scheduled to be launched on a Delta II launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral on November 1, 1994. After injection into a phasing orbit, the spacecraft will execute a double lunar swing-by before being moved into a controlled 'halo' orbit about the L1 Lagrangian point (∼250 Re towards the Sun). This will provide a 5 light-second light travel time with which to triangulate gamma-ray burst sources with Earth-orbiting systems, such as those on-board the Gamma-Ray Observatory (GRO). The response of instrument to transient γ-ray events such as GRB's and solar flares will be presented as well as the expected response to steady state point sources and galactic center line emission. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000524460

The daily flow of the catchment, which is dominated by spring snowmelt runoff, was simulated by the coupling of the snowmelt and soil moisture accounting models of the US National Weather Service River Forecast System. A low-flow day was defined as a day during which the streamflow did not reach the quarter of the long-term mean daily streamflow. In this case the low-flow components (occurrences, duration, magnitude, etc) were determined. Both representations of climatic instability resulted in more numerous and longer low-flow episodes, as well as smaller mean values of minimum streamflows. Also, all climate cases posted larger low-flow deficits as the precipitation increased.

""Post COBE"" strategy of the Ground-Based small-scale anisotropy is discussed and some details of the next generation experiments with the RATAN-600 radio telescope are given.

About 100 experiments on 3K CMB have been conducted since the discovery of this emission. Ground based and space-based state-of-art observations are very close to mapping the initial inhomogeneities of the Universe at the epoch of recombination. It is shown that only the multi-wavelength approach of the kind we have employed since 1980 can help to subtract the screening backgrounds of noncosmological nature. This approach makes the ground-based observations almost as sensitive as the space-based ones.

In order to investigate boiler performance globally, a relatively simple model which can be processed in a personal computer (PC) is proposed. In this paper, the effects of thermo-physical parameters on the energy and exergy performance of a firetube boiler are studied by using a simple model for the combustion product gas behavior through the boiler passes. For each steady-state condition, the boiler performance is investigated by parametrically changing the degree of inception of nucleate boiling, the tube wall emissivity, the saturation steam pressure, and the fraction of flue gas recirculation (FGR, utilized for NOx emissions reduction).

We also describe new or planned geographically complete climatologies of SST and night MAT for 1961-90. These are expected to be more reliable than existing climatologies in the Southern Ocean and other sparsely-observed areas. The new SST climatology has been used in the construction of an improved geographically-complete data set of sea ice and SST: the techniques used are briefly reviewed, as are other methods of analysis and assessment of worldwide SST. We present global and regional time series of anomalies (i.e. deviations from reference climatology) of SST and night MAT for 1856 to 1994 constructed using the most complete data and best-estimate bias-corrections hitherto available. These series are compared with earlier published series, and are validated by means of comparisons with anomalies of air temperature from coastal and island stations. The sensitivity of the time series to imperfect coverage is assessed by means of frozen grid experiments. The results underscore the need for ongoing development of SST and MAT data bases within GCOS for the detection of climatic change, and for improved methods of analysis to optimally isolate the signals from incomplete data. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"data standardization; GCOS; Global Climate Observing System; marine air temperature; sea ice data; sea surface temperature; SST; temperature measurement; temperature recording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029480465

In Indian coking industry, generally 8–10 types of coals are used as raw material base for carbonization and they differ widely in terms of their grindability characteristics, caking/coking properties, dilatation characteristics, petrographic analysis etc. The Indian coals contain very low percentage of vitrinite (<50%), higher content of middlings and rejects (>1.6 Sp. gr. fraction) and higher ash content (18–23%). Conventional blend crushing of these coals together for carbonization leads to concentration of inerts and middlings/rejects in the coarser size fraction (+6 and 6−3 mm) of the charge leading to heterogeneity in the properties of different size fractions. Difference thermal transformation to plastic state and shrinkage characteristics in the semi-coke state between coarser and finer fractions generates internal stresses in the coke matrix leading to poor strength characteristics. With the use of increased percentage of low ash imported coal in the blend (15–40%), the SAIL plants are trying to contain the coal blend ash to a level of about 17%. The imported coals generally have low mineral matter content, high HGI values and increased proportion of fines (60–65% below 3mm). These circumstances have necessitated development of new coal preparation schemes for carbonization viz. groupwise crushing, blend crushing with prescreening of fines and groupwise crushing with prescreening of fines. The paper discusses in detail the above new coal preparation techniques along with the methodology to determine the degree of homogeneity of the coal blend. © 1995, The Iron and Steel Institute of Japan.

Duplicate EPA FTP emission tests were conducted with each fuel. Hydrocarbon speciation was utilized to determine reactivity-adjusted non-methane organic gases (NMOG) emissions for one test on each fuel. Results showed that all eight fuels could allow the converted vehicle to pass California ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) NMOG and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) standards. Six of the eight fuels could allow the vehicle to pass ULEV carbon monoxide (CO) standards. BUTANE has been an important gasoline blending component for many years. With a road octane number of 92 and a high blending vapor pressure, butane has been used to upgrade the octane of gasoline blends and to aid in wintertime cold starting. Due to reformulated gasoline requirements for lower fuel vapor pressure, industry has had to remove increasing amounts of butane from the gasoline pool. Paradoxically, butane is one of the cleanest burning components of gasoline. This increasing inability to use butane in motor fuel represents both an economic and environmental waste. Other than reformulated gasoline and clean diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is the most widely used alternative fuel in the United States. The primary constituent of LPG used for this purpose is propane. Propane has many attributes which make it an attractive vehicular fuel. Since it is a single relatively simple species, engines and aftertreatment systems can be designed to burn it cleanly. It also reacts very slowly in the atmosphere so it tends to form less ground level ozone in cities. Propane is also stored onboard as a liquid at ambient temperature in a pressurized system; therefore, by definition, it produces no evaporative emissions. As a liquid, it has a good volumetric energy content so vehicle range is improved over many of the other alternative fuels. The road octane number of propane is greater than 100 so vehicle power can be optimized in vehicles equipped to take advantage of this property. There is also a wide distribution system for propane so vehicle refueling is performed more readily than with most of the alternatives. Importantly, however, barriers exist which may inhibit the growth of propane as a motor fuel. There are other developed, mature markets for propane such as its use as a heating fuel or as a chemical feedstock. Propane is produced as a side product from natural gas production or petroleum refinery processing. Additional demand could create shortages and/or price increases, because it is unlikely that either of these two sources would be ramped up solely to produce more propane. Although vehicle range is good, it remains three-fourths that of conventional gasoline vehicles. These constraints have limited LPG vehicle implementation. A thoughtful consideration of the use of butane as a motor fuel shows that it should have many of the positive attributes of propane. Butane is also a single, relatively simple chemical species so theoretically engines and exhaust catalysts could be optimized for low emissions with its use. It also has relatively low reactivity in the atmosphere and like propane, would be stored on-board as a pressurized liquid. Consequently, a butane-fueled vehicle would also have no evaporative emissions, and could also be classified as an inherently low emissions vehicle (ILEV). Butane has a greater volumetric energy content than propane so vehicle range could be extended over that of propane. Since butane storage pressure is lower than that of propane, there is an opportunity to use the same equipment for delivery and refueling of butane as is currently used for propane. Butane tends to be in slight oversupply on a yearly basis in the U.S. and this excess should grow larger as gasoline volatility is reduced. The imbalance is projected to equal as much as 100,000 barrels per day this year and increase by 20 percent by the year 2000.(1)* Although butane is used as a chemical feedstock, it has not been used extensively as a heating fuel as has propane. Like propane, butane production is associated with natural gas production and petroleum refining. However, butane production is more easily swung between gasoline and neat product than propane. This could allow butane supply to more easily balance demand than propane. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Antiknock rating; Automotive fuels; Blending; Butane; Carbon monoxide; Engines; Environmental Protection Agency; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Hydrostatic pressure; Liquefied petroleum gas; Liquids; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Ozone; Petroleum refining; Propane; Reformulated gasoline; Roads and streets; Silicon compounds; Vehicles; Aftertreatment systems; Gasoline volatilities; Hydrocarbon speciation; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Low emission vehicles; Natural-gas production; Ozone-forming potential; Ultra Low Emission Vehicles; Alternative fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072417991

The purpose of CODE is to test, diagnose and improve treatment of dry deposition of ozone and other gaseous species. CODE supports a larger air quality measurement and modeling effort comprised of the San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Study (SJVAQS) and Atmospheric-Utilities Signatures: Predictions and Experiments (AUSPEX) joined as SJVAQS/AUSPEX Regional Model Adaptation Project (SARMAP). However, the CODE data are also applicable to a variety of boundary layer and turbulence problems. This paper describes the field methods and data collected during summer (10 July through 6 August) of 1991 in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California and introduces several related papers. General comparisons and conclusions from all the participants are summarized. The core elements of the CODE field effort consisted of a research aircraft for spatial coverage and three ground sites located in a cotton field, grape vineyard, and very dry (senescent) annual grassland. A major portion of the SJV is represented by these three vegetation types. The eddy covariance method is used to compute the vertical fluxes of ozone, carbon dioxide, water vapor, sensible heat and momentum. For the first half of the study period, flights were made mainly for comparison with tower-based fluxes. Subsequent flights were over other vegetation types and to conduct special studies. In addition to the vertical fluxes, the ground-site data include individual leaf measurements of stomatal conductance, radiative leaf temperature, wetness of surrogate leaves, soil temperature profiles and heat flux, soil composition and water content, mean nitrogen oxide and ozone concentrations, solar and net radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, and vertical profiles of wind, temperature, ozone and water vapor. Aircraft data also include reflected short-wave radiation, surface greenness index and radiative surface temperature. Several factors simplify analyses: a nearly constant synoptic situation, lack of cloud cover, low-level (30 m) flights and land use characterized by extensive homogeneous areas with well defined interfaces. Repeated five-km aircraft runs, necessary for a representative flux calculation, were commonly made over a single crop type. In addition, a partial (60%) solar eclipse on 11 July provides an opportunity to examine the influence of light intensity upon the plant-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide and ozone via stomatal activity. © 1995.","aircraft remote sensing; eddy covariance; Ozone deposition","carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; water; air pollution; air quality; aircraft; airflow; boundary layer; conference paper; cotton; dry deposition; experiment; land use; model; photochemistry; photosynthesis; pollution transport; prediction; priority journal; remote sensing; summer; technique; temperature; troposphere; United States; vegetation; water vapor; wind; Gossypium hirsutum; Vitis sp.; deposition rate data; field method; ozone deposition; USA, California, San Joaquin Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028971278

This structure is best described as a pyramidal complex between singlet methylene and a side‐on hydrogen molecule with Cs symmetry. At the single reference CI level, it lies 105 kcal/mol above the methane Td‐ground state but is stable relative to dissociation into CH2(1A1) and H2 by 13 kcal/mol at 0 K (with harmonic zero point energy (ZPE) corrections for all structures). Dissociation of the transition state into triplet methylene and hydrogen also is endothermic (by 4 kcal/mol), but single bond rupture to give CH 3. and H. is 3 kcal/mol exothermic. Thus, it does not appear likely that methane can undergo stereomutation classically beneath the dissociation limit. Confirming earlier conclusions, side‐on insertion of 1A1 CH2 into H2 in a perpendicular geometry occurs without activation energy. Planar (D4h) methane (130.5 kcal/mol) has four imaginary frequencies. Two of these are degenerate and lead to equivalent planar C2v structures with one three‐center, two‐electron bond and two two‐electron bonds and two imaginary frequencies. The remaining imaginary frequencies of the D4h form lead to tetrahedral (Td) and pyramidal (C4v) methane. The latter has three negative eigenvalues in the force‐constant matrix; one of these leads to the Td global minimum and the other to the Cs (parallel) stereomutation transition structure. Multireference CI calculations with a large atomic natural orbitals basis set produce similar results, with the electronic energy of the Cs stereomutation transition state 0.7 ± 0.5 kcal/mol higher than that of CH 3. + H. dissociation products, and a ZPE‐corrected energy which is 5 ± 1 kcal/mol higher. Also considered are photochemical pathways for stereomutation and the possible effects of nuclear spin, inversion tunneling, and the parity‐violating weak nuclear interaction on the possibility of an experimental detection of stereomutation in methane. © 1995 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

This new approach has led to the definition of three types of system in the context of the dynamic evolution of sedimentary basins. These three types are “initial rift”, “continental platform”, and “orogenic‐deltaic” Petroleum Systems. The richness and efficiency of a petroliferous basin often depends on an association between two, or perhaps all three, of these types of system. Foreland basins are perhaps the best example. Plate‐tectonics theory suggests that a mobile lithosphere is the rule rather than the exception. The transfer of both fluids and materials may occur within a sedimentary basin as a result of horizontal or vertical displacement of the lithosphere. Petroleum Systems therefore appear to be a direct consequence of crustal mobility. When hydrocarbons migrate out of a source rock, they may either be dispersed within another lithological unit and effectively “vanish”, be lost by seepage into the atmosphere, or be trapped by some sort of permeability barrier. In the latter case, the resulting hydrocarbon accumulation can be described as a temporary concentration, whose duration essentially depends on the intensity of the incoming fluid flow and the resistance of the permeability barrier(s). The study of a particular Petroleum System within a global geodynamic framework enables the richness (or otherwise) of the oil province in question to be assessed. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

The earliest known North American coal-ball studies, based on pyritic coal balls from Iowa, were carried out in the late 1890s by W. S. Gresley, a mining engineer from England. He utilized reflected light on polished surfaces to observe the anatomy of coal-ball plant constituents. Sustained development of studies began in the early 1920s at the University of Chicago as a result of calcareous coal-ball discoveries in the Illinois basin, reported by Adolph C. Noè. He was the leading advocate for the discovery and study of American coal balls, receiving assistance from state geological surveys and the coal-mining industry. Interests at the University of Chicago led to the establishment of a chair in paleobotany for Noè and ensuing coal-ball research by his students, J. Hobart Hoskins, Fredda D. Reed, Harriet V. Krick Bartoo, Roy Graham, and others. At the time there were very few paleobotanists in North America. Most pioneers in American coal-ball studies during the 1930s were self taught in paleobotanical research. Consequently, quite diverse perspectives of the significance and use of coal balls were represented. In the 1930s acid etching and the liquid-peel (Darrah solution) technique generally replaced thin sectioning; larger numbers of coal balls were discovered, partly as a result of increased open-pit coal mining. At the Illinois State Geological Survey such discoveries attracted James M. Schopf, who stressed the importance of coal balls as a paleobotanical index for the constitution of coal, a method of identifying the botanical sources of dispersed spores and pollen, as well as their use in a stratigraphic approach to monographic studies of Carboniferous plants. This approach is mirrored in the early monographic works of J. Hobart Hoskins and Aureal T. Cross at the University of Cincinnati. William C. Darrah at Harvard University was particularly interested in the paleofloristic and biostratigraphic information to be gained from coal-ball studies. He instituted mass peel preparations as well as splitting coalball specimens to reveal the morphology of associated foliage taxa. At Washington University in St. Louis, Henry N. Andrews emphasized anatomy and development in the evolution of the pteridophytes and early seed plants. American coal-ball studies in the upper Middle and Upper Pennsylvanian expanded by the early 1940s with collections from Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Texas, Illinois, Indiana, and western Kentucky. Following World War II, research and training continued at Washington University with H. N. Andrews and developed anew at the University of Illinois with Wilson N. Stewart. This research led to new generations of paleobotanists during the following decades. In 1949, James M. Schopf established the U.S. Geological Survey's Coal Geology Laboratory in Columbus, Ohio, and continued his influential role in coal-ball studies, encouraging and directly aiding such studies in the United States. In the 1950s the rapid-peel technique with preformed sheets of cellulose acetate expedited studies. The National Science Foundation became a significant source of support for such research, and paleobotany was more broadly represented in universities. Even into the 1960s, however, no one would have predicted how abundant coal-ball deposits in North America would prove to be, as the first occurrences were reported from the Appalachians and New Brunswick, Canada. In this chapter, these developments are described. An epilogue is also provided, which outlines major initiatives and contributions of recent decades that bridge early- and middle-twentieth-century development of coal-ball studies in North America with those of the century to come.",,"Calcite; Coal; Coal industry; Coal mines; Etching; Geological surveys; Helium; Military operations; Open pit mining; Plants (botany); Pyrites; Seed; Silica; Stratigraphy; Cellulose acetates; Coal mining industry; Illinois state geological surveys; National Science Foundations; U.s. geological surveys; University of Chicago; University of Illinois; Washington University; Coal deposits; anatomy; biostratigraphy; calcite; coal; dolomite; geological survey; peat; pyrite; siderite; silica; student; twentieth century; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880062321

This method is based on Toxoplasma serologic testing and positron emission tomography. Design: Prospective, nonrandomized, criterion-standard clinical study. Setting: An academic center in the mid-southeastern United States. Patients: 20 patients with AIDS and contrast-enhancing brain lesions. Interventions: Positron emission tomographic scanning and Toxoplasma serologic testing. Main Outcome Measure: Diagnoses were confirmed by clinical response, autopsy, or brain biopsy. Results: Eight patients had a confirmed diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, six had lymphoma, four had other diagnoses, and two were not evaluable. Seven of eight patients with toxoplasmosis had positron emission tomographic scans; all of these scans showed hypo-metabolic lesions consistent with a nonlymphoma diagnosis. The six patients with lymphoma all had hyper-metabolic lesions on positron emission tomographic scans. The difference between these two sets of results was statistically significant (P < 0.001, Fisher exact test, two-tailed). The anti-Toxoplasma titer was greater than or equal to 1:4 in all patients with confirmed toxoplasmosis who had serologic testing and in three of six patients with lymphoma. Conclusions: Evaluating contrast- enhancing brain lesions in patients with AIDS by using Toxoplasma serologic testing and positron emission tomography can accurately guide therapy and obviate the need for most brain biopsies in these patients. A larger, national, multicenter study is needed to confirm our findings and to determine the effect of earlier diagnosis and treatment on morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS and primary central nervous system lymphoma.",,"acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; article; brain lymphoma; clinical article; clinical trial; contrast enhancement; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; human; image analysis; positron emission tomography; priority journal; toxoplasmosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028849154

Both approaches rely on the prescribed pattern of vegetation types. Structural, rule-based models can predict such patterns, provided that vegetation and climate are in equilibrium. The coupling of biogeochemical and structural models gives the opportunity of testing the sensitivity of biogeochemical processes not only to climatic change but also to biome shists. Whether the annual mean NPP of a vegetation type increases or decreases depends strongly on the assumptions about a CO2 fertilization effect and nitrogen cycling. Results from a coupled model show that, given that direct CO2 effects are uncertain, 1) average NPP of these northern biomes might decrease under global warming, but 2) total NPP of the region would increase, due to the northward shift of the taiga biome. -Authors",,"biogeochemical model; Boreal forest; carbon dioxide enrichment; fertilization; global warming; net primary production; nitrogen cycling; tundra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029510347

The numerical prediction of NOx-levels in such combustors with multi-dimensional CFD codes has only met with limited success so far. This is at least to some extent due to the complexity of the NOx formation chemistry in lean-premixed combustion, i.e. all three known NOx formation routes (Zeldovich, nitrous and prompt) can contribute significantly. Furthermore, NOx formation occurs almost exclusively in the flame zone, where radical concentrations significantly above equilibrium values are observed. A relatively large chemical mechanism is therefore required to predict radical concentrations and NOx formation rates under such conditions. These difficulties have prompted the development of a NOx post-processing scheme, where rate and concentration information necessary to predict NOx formation is taken from one-dimensional combustion models with detailed chemistry and provided - via look-up tables - to the multi-dimensional CFD code. The look-up tables are prepared beforehand in accordance with the operating conditions and are based on CO concentrations, which are indicative of free radical chemistry. Once the reacting flow field has been computed with the main CFD code, the chemical source terms of the NO transport equation, i.e. local NO formation rates, are determined from the reacting flow field and the tabulated chemical data. Then the main code is turned on again to compute the NO concentration field. This NOx sub-model has no adjustable parameters and converges very quickly.

An attempt is made to extend the results of Narasimha (J. Fluid Meth.12, 294-305, 1962) and Burgan et al. (J. Plasma Phys.29, 139-142. 1983). These authors studied the neutral and electron gas expansion into a vacuum, respectively. Burgan et al. (J. Plasma Phys.29, 139-142. 1953) considered the Vlasov equation, coupled self-consistently with the Poisson equation. The magnetic field effects were omitted. Gunko and Ponomarjov (Vestnik St-Petersburg State Univ. Ser. 1, No. 2. 89-94, 1993; Astron. Nachr.316(1), 17-21, 1995) carried out an analysis of the magnetic field effect for a special case of particle emission. A general method is proposed for simulating the charged-particle cloud expansion and the emission from sources in both electric and magnetic fields based on the kinetic approach. It consists of the representation of any cloud or emission source by the superposition of point-like clouds or sources with the corresponding initial particle distribution. As examples, the expansion of the following spatial domains filled by charged particles are analyzed : the semi-space, the plane layer of finite thickness, the circular cylinder, and the spherically symmetric cloud. In all the cases considered, Maxwell initial velocity distribution has been used for homogeneous magnetic and electric fields. It is found that in the case of the spherical cloud expansion, the cloud configuration at large times tends to an ellipsoid whose major axis expands along the magnetic field. Obtained results support the suggestion that this method has addressed the problem of plasma-cloud expansion into a uniform magnetic. field, with emphasis on the dynamics of lower density parts which appear to be highly structured in the form of field aligned striations (Davis et al., Planet. Space Sci.22, 67-78, 1974). Different specific situations for a small charged-particle source is considered, by assuming that the effect of induced fields is very small compared to that of the ambient magnetic field in rare-lied plasma. It should be noted that the last condition is satisfied, for instance, in the satellite altitude regime (above 200 km), where the source velocity is well above the thermal velocity of ions and very small compared to the thermal velocity of plasma electrons. So that, any polarization electric field is effectively neutralized by faster electrons. The analytical results describe a flute formation along the edges of the charged-particle cloud that have been created by a small source moving parallel or approximately parallel to the ambient magnetic field. For the source in motion perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, developing field aligned striations of surfaces of constant charged-particle concentration are obtained. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001442130

Much traffic on downtown-area freeways seeks merely to get past downtown, thereby worsening the level of congestion for those seeking access to downtown. A number of European cities have begun to develop a new type of transportation facility: congestion-relief toll tunnels in downtown areas. These projects appear to be economically feasible largely or entirely from premium-price tolls paid by users. Hence, they are being developed by private consortia, operating under long-term franchises from government. Other keys to the feasibility of such projects are peak/off-peak pricing structures (congestion pricing), nonstop electronic toll collection, and restriction of use to auto-size vehicles only (to reduce tunnel dimensions and therefore capital investment). Preliminary analysis indicates that congestion-telief bypass runnels for downtown Los Angeles and San Francisco would be economically feasible as private business ventures, if developed along European lines. Similar approaches might be applied to other controversial freeway projects in both cities, and to restructuring Boston's huge and controversial Central Artery/Tunnel project. Congress has already authorized public-private partnerships of this type, permitting private capital and private owner/operation to be used, both for new projects and to rebuild existing highway, bridge, and tunnel facilities. Six states and Puerto Rico have enacted private-tollway legislation under which such projects could be developed and operated. This type of project should be politically feasible, since it offers a way to make significant transportation improvements in impacted downtowns with little or no public funding. While transit proponents may oppose the construction of toll tunnels, highway users are likely to support such projects, and some environmental groups may support this method of implementing congestion pricing in urban areas, because of its potential for reducing air emissions. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","congestion; congestion pricing; tolls; tunnels","Highway traffic control; Project management; Urban planning; Vehicular tunnels; Congestion pricing; Toll tunnels; Toll highways; congestion pricing; road tolling; toll tunnels; transport planning; California; Los Angeles; San Francisco; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029416773

Hansen and Wilson (1993) question their interpretation of temporal changes on the grounds that the microwave observations could be influenced by the opacity of the variable constituents in the atmosphere. This issue has broad interest because of the importance of detection of global climatic change. In order to help resolve this issue, in this study we utilize a radiative transfer model to simulate: (a) the observations of MSU Channel 1 (Ch. 1) at 50.3 GHz, in the weakly absorbing region of the 60 GHz molecular oxygen absorption band; and (b) the observations of MSU Channel 2 (Ch. 2) at 53.74 GHz, in the moderately strong absorption region of the same band. This radiative transfer model includes extinction due to clouds and rain in addition to absorption due to molecular oxygen and water vapor. The model simulations show that, over the oceans, extinction due to rain and clouds in Ch. 1 causes an increase in brightness temperature, while in Ch. 2 it causes a decrease. Over the land, however, both Ch. 1 and Ch. 2 show a decrease in brightness temperature due to rain and cloud extinction. These theoretical results are consistent with simultaneous observations in Ch. 1 and Ch. 2 made by MSU. Based on theory and observations we infer that a substantial number of the MSU observations at 53.74 GHz used by Spencer et al. contain rain and cloud contamination. As a result, their MSU derived global mean temperatures and long term trend is questionable. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

As-cast microstructure of the in situ processed composites reveals a relatively uniform distribution of TiC particles with an average size of a few microns. No preferential particle segregation to the dendritic cell boundaries was observed. In this paper, several aspects associated with evolution of the microstructure including phase formation sequence.

They are potentially very subjective in character. Their main drawback was that they involved the relocation of continents beneath a stable atmospheric circulation modelled upon that of the present. General circulation models (GCMs) use the laws of physics and an understanding of past geography to simulate climatic responses. They are objective in character. However, they require super computers to handle vast numbers of calculations. Nonetheless it is now possible to compare results from different GCMs for a range of times and over a wide range of parameterisations. GCMs are currently producing simulated climate predictions which compare favourably with the distributions of climatically sensitive facies (e.g. coals, evaporites and palaeosols). They have been used effectively in the prediction of oceanic upwelling sites and the distribution of petroleum source-rocks and phosphorites. Parameterisation is the main weakness in GCMs (e.g. sea-surface temperature, orography, cloud behaviour). Sensitivity experiments can be run on GCMs which simulate the effects of Milankovitch forcing and thus provide insights into possible patterns of climate change both globally and locally (i.e. provide predictions that can be evaluated against the rock record). Future use of GCMs could be in the forward modelling of sequence stratigraphic evolution and in the prediction of the diagenetic characteristics of reservoir units in frontier exploration areas. The sedimentary record provides the only way that GCMs may themselves be evaluated and this is important because these same GCMs are being used currently to predict possible changes in future climate. © 1995.",,"Cretaceous; general circulation model; Jurassic; palaeoclimate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029510326

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: NADP oxidoreductase (GAPDH) is one of the two chloroplast enzymes which catalyse this reversible conversion. We report on the engineering of an antisense RNA construct directed against the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) chloroplastlocated GAPDH (A subunit). The construct was integrated into the tobacco genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of leaf discs. Of the resulting transformants, five plants were recovered with reduced GAPDH activities ranging from 11 to 24% of wild-type (WT) activities. Segregation analysis of the kanamycin-resistance character in self-pollinated T1 seed from each of the five transformants revealed that one plant (GAP-R) had two active DNA inserts and the others had one insert. T1 progeny from GAP-R was used to generate plants with GAPDH activities ranging from WT levels to around 7% of WT levels. These were used to study the effect of variable GAPDH activities on metabolite pools for ribulose1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) and PGA, and the accompanying effects on the rate of CO2 assimilation and other gasexchange parameters. The RuBP pool size was linearly related to GAPDH activity once GAPDH activity dropped below the range for WT plants, but the rate of CO2 assimilation was not affected until RuBP levels dropped to 30-40% of WT levels. That is, the CO2 assimilation rate fell when RuBP per ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) site fell below 2 mol·(mol site)-1 while the ratio for WT plants was 4-5 mol·m(mol site)-1. Leaf conductance was not reduced in leaves with reduced GAPDH activities, resulting in an increase in the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 partial pressure. Conductance in plants with reduced GAPDH activities was still sensitive to CO2 and showed a normal decline with increases in CO2 partial pressure. Although PGA levels did not fluctuate greatly, the effect of reduced GAPDH activity on RuBP-pool size and assimilation rate can be interpreted as being due to a blockage in the regeneration of RuBP. Concomitant gas-ex change and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements indicated that photosynthesis changed from being Rubisco-limited to being RuBP-regeneration-limited at a lower CO2 partial pressure in the antisense plants than in WT plants. Photosynthetic electron transport was down-regulated by the build-up of a large proton gradient and the electron-transport chain did not become over-reduced due to a shortage of NADP. Plants with severely reduced GAPDH activity were not photoinhibited despite the continuous presence of a large thylakoid proton gradient in the light. Along with plant size, Rubisco activity, leaf soluble protein and chlorophyll content were reduced in plants with the lowest GAPDH activities. We conclude that chloroplastic GAPDH activity does not appear to limit steady-state photosynthetic CO2 assimilation at ambient CO2. This is because WT leaves maintain the ratio of RuBP per Rubisco site about twofold higher than the level required to achieve a maximal rate of CO2 assimilation. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Antisense RNA; Glyceraldehyde-3-phos-phate dehydrogenase; Metabolite pools Nicotiana(transgenic plants); Photosynthesis; Stomate","carbon dioxide; complementary RNA; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; Glyceraldehyde 3 Phosphate Dehydrogenases; primer DNA; ribulose 1,5 diphosphate; ribulose phosphate; ribulose-1,5 diphosphate; article; biosynthesis; chloroplast; enzymology; genetic transformation; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; plant; tobacco; transgenic plant; Base Sequence; Carbon Dioxide; Chloroplasts; DNA Primers; Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases; Molecular Sequence Data; Plants, Genetically Modified; Plants, Toxic; Ribulosephosphates; RNA, Antisense; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tobacco; Transformation, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029137802

Of the current 31 PET centres in Europe invited to contribute, 15 centres already had data and others expressed interest. Many of the groups were collaborating with local oncologists to measure tumour response to chemotherapy (12 groups) and radiotherapy (three groups) with this technique. Despite variations of methodology, and difficulties in data interpretation, assessment of tumour [18F]FDG uptake was thought to be a reasonable method for the functional imaging of tumours, assessing metabolic rate and providing a measure of tumour response. Broadly, pooling experience, it would appear that changes in [18F]FDG tumour uptake following one or two cycles of chemotherapy treatment was related to ultimate clinical responses. Patients showing most reduction in [18F]FDG uptake achieved the best clinical responses. Data were also available on the effect of chemotherapy on normal tissues and some data on the effect of radiotherapy and tumour response. It was concluded that changes in [18F]FDG uptake as measured with PET may provide useful information on clinical as well as subclinical response of tumours to anticancer therapy. This could be useful as a guide to early response to therapy as well as providing functional assessment of residual masses of disease.

The model has been applied to describing the thermodynamic properties of the binary subsystems and to predict the phase behavior of the ternary systems. For longer-chain alkanols and hydrocarbons a group-contribution approach is implemented, which allows the modeling when no experimental data are available. The model gives reasonable predictions of phase behavior and the correct trends in the calculated phase diagrams in most cases.

VOC emissions from wastewater collection systems have received much less attention. A naturally well-ventilated municipal sewer interceptor that receives significant quantities of VOC-laden industrial wastewater was studied to quantify VOC emissions. Headspace outgassing rates, when summed across four manhole covers, were as high as 2300 m3/h, far exceeding headspace turnover rates previously estimated and published in the technical literature. Individual concentrations of five target VOCs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes, and tetrachloroethene) in the sewer headspace ranged from 0 to 46 ppm during three daytime monitoring events and one 24-hour event. Emissions were greatest for toluene, approaching 100 g/h from a single manhole cover during midday of the 24-hour event. Significant diurnal and weekday/weekend trends were observed for aromatic VOC emissions but not for emissions of tetrachloroethene. Combined emissions of toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene from only four manhole covers rivaled or exceeded those summed over aerated grit chambers and aeration basins at each of four large municipal wastewater treatment facilities in Southern Ontario. Furthermore, average and peak emissions of total nonmethane hydrocarbons (TNMHC) from a single manhole cover were 265 g/h (2300 kg/yr) and 630 g/h (5500 kg/yr), respectively, during a 24-hour sampling event. The primary source of VOC stripping was observed to be a series of two large drop structures, which lead to 29-44% removal of individual VOCs from wastewater. An important conclusion of this study is that large fractions of VOCs may be removed from wastewater and emitted to the ambient atmosphere prior to entering a downstream treatment facility. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"benzene; ethylbenzene; tetrachloroethylene; toluene; xylene; air pollution; air quality; article; circadian rhythm; dangerous goods; priority journal; sewer outfall; United States; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029000149

Curitiba is a city of 1.6 million residents that has grown fourfold in the last 30 years. Unlike in many other cities, quality of life and transportation has not been a casualty of growth. Curitiba's transportation system actively helps residents obtain the benefits of growth, including access to jobs, homes, recreation, and other elements of the urban community. Curitiba's transportation planning process is practical. It recognizes financial and social constraints. Curitiba began with buses because it had buses. It began with a series of small improvements guided by a long-term plan. It first added a modest express route system with dedicated bus lanes. It sought out ways to improve and extend the system. The result is a surface system that provides the high-quality service of well-known underground systems at a much lower capital cost. These low costs mean that mass transit is entirely financed by passenger fares. The present system provides a range of benefits. The systematic approach to urban transportation has reduced travel times and increased convenience. Curitiba's buses now attract more passengers per operating kilometer than in any other Brazilian city. This intensive use occurs even though Curitiba also has one of the highest automobile ownership rates in Brazil. Rider surveys suggest that at least 20% of these new passengers previously used automobiles to commute. With less automobile congestion, the city has replaced several downtown streets with broad pedestrian malls and shopping areas. Reduced traffic appears to result in substantial fuel savings as well as reduced pollutant emissions. Calculations suggest that the reduction in automobile traffic saves 27 million liters of fuel/year. © 1995, International Energy Initiative, Inc..

An apparent paradox in aggregating regional estimates is illuminated, and the risk of misleading results is underscored. The methods are applied to the problem of climate change with two case studies, an historical period and a future scenario, used to illustrate the results.

A generation of strong Lengmuir waves and the following electron acceleration in a plasma resonance region cause an effective transformation of a MW energy into a plasma flare, a creation of high plasma potentials, and production of ions with energies from thermal to as high as tens keV. The second part reflects the first experiments on pulsed MW deposition of diamond-like films on various substrates. Deposition rate up to 0.5 im per 1 sec of a ""net' MW irradiation time was reached, and diamond-like films with good optical characteristics were obtained.

In algae, the periplasmic CA is required for efficient CO2 fixation when the CO2 concentration is low. These two proteins are affected differently by the CO2 level in the environment. The steady-state level of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase transcript was only slightly and transiently affected by a reduction in ambient CO2 concentration, whereas the CA transcript level was strongly induced by air containing ambient (350 parts per million) CO2 (low CO2) conditions. The transcripts for both proteins showed strong oscillations when the alga was grown under a 12-h light/12-h dark growth regime, with the transcripts encoding these proteins present just before the onset of the light cycle. The observation that the CA transcript was made in the dark was surprising, since earlier reports indicated that active photosynthesis was required for the induction of the periplasmic CA. Further experiments demonstrated that the CA transcript was partially induced under low-CO2 conditions even when the switch to low CO2 was done in the dark. Our results suggest that C. reinhardtii might sense the CO2 concentration in a more direct manner than through C2 or C3 cycle intermediates, which has been previously suggested.",,"algae; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029188182

The SO2 reductions, totalling a 40% reduction nationally from 1980 levels or a 10 million ton reduction annually, are achieved largely through an emission trading system, the largest program of its kind designed to date. This trading system has the potential to save up to half of the compliance costs associated with more traditional source-by-source emission limit programs. This paper briefly discusses background on the acid rain issue in the United States, and the principal features of the program, including: a permanent cap on utility emissions of SO2 beginning in 2010, decision to grant up-front allocation of emission credits to reduce individual approvals of trades, the use of continuous emission monitors and automatic penalties to ensure compliance, and integration of the Acid Rain program requirements with other Clean Air Act programs. The paper also discusses the development of the allowance trading market to date, including the types of compliance options chosen and quantity and type of emissions trading being conducted. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","air pollution; cost-effectiveness; costs; Emission trading; sulfur dioxide; United States",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947698503

The work is supported internationally by 13 OECD countries as well as the Commission of European Communities and two sponsors RWE and DMT. The Programme has examined, on a consistent basis, the options available for capturing and disposing of the CO2 product from a range of gas and coal fired power generation plant types, each with an output of 500MW(e). Systems under consideration include PF+FGD, IGCC, NGCC and a CO2/O2 recycle scheme. CO2 capture technologies considered include chemical and physical absorption, solid adsorption, cryogenics, membrane separation and gas separation membranes. Carbon dioxide disposal options considered are; disposal in the oceans, in aquifers, in depleted gas reservoirs and terrestrial storage as a solid. In addition, a number of studies have evaluated the utilisation of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery and the manufacture of chemicals, including a detailed investigation of dimethy carbonate production. Comparison is also made with the alternative stance of compensatory forest plantations and substitution of fossil fuels with biomass. Emphasis has been placed on a requirement to determine the impact of the various technologies on the cost of electricity generation. This has been achieved by analysing the costs of specific schemes, on a common basis, and comparative results are presented for various CO2 abatement options. A number of studies have also been carried out to evaluate transport options and the environmental impact of these technology combinations for carbon dioxide disposal. The results indicate that by combining the most favourable technologies for CO2 capture and disposal to efficient power generation technology, electricity generation costs could be increased by around 40%. Alternative schemes have similar or even greater cost penalties. Analysis shows that the cost of CO2 capture dominates these added figures unless CO2 transport distances are very large. Carbon dioxide disposal is the area where further R&amp;D is urgently required to provide environmental impact data. A further series of studies have recently been completed to examine the implications of considering the full life cycle involved in the power generation process, incorporating carbon dioxide capture and disposal, starting from extracting the fuel to storing the CO2 product, over the natural life of power stations systems. © 1995.",,"Air pollution control; Coal gasification plants; Electric power generation; Enhanced recovery; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Industrial waste disposal; Recycling; Waste utilization; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide recycle schemes; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029325824

Performances were compared for RZMs employing different hydrophytes, planting substrates and climatic conditions. All pathogens were removed by the RZM to some extent. Planted beds generally performed better than unplanted beds although the type of hydrophyte used was not significant. Gravel beds were more efficient than soil beds in the removal of protozoan pathogens and of helminth eggs; numbers of these pathogens were below levels of detection in gravel bed effluents. For faecal coliforms the type of planting susbstrate was not significant, providing hydrophytes were present. Climatic conditions made little difference to treatment efficiency although seasonal variation was observed in temperate climates, where the removal of faecal coliforms declined in the winter months, and in subtropical climates where higher numbers of free-living amoebae were recorded during the summer. It was concluded that the RZM is a suitable method for the treatment of domestic wastewaters in tropical and subtropical regions of Mexico. © 1995, International Association on Water Quality.

The model consists of two parallel plates of known secondary emission properties, across which a time varying voltage is applied, and between which a constant magnetic field is applied. Expressions are derived for the resonant phases at which the RF-driven cascades occur; these reduce to previously derived expressions in the limit of the vanishing magnetic field. In addition, this work obtains the conditions governing the stability of the motion about those phases, as well as a dynamic constraint from imposing the restriction that each impact on a plate is the first impact that is allowed by the equations of motion. Chaotic effects from the random ejection velocities of the secondaries are addressed for the first time. It is proven that the phase focusing effect from the radio frequency (RF) interaction will overcome the dispersive effect from the random emission, provided that the mean square emission velocity is sufficiently small; in that case stability of the multipactor is determined by the stability of an “ideal” multipactor with zero emission velocity. That reduces the multipactor parameter space to only two control parameters: the normalized RF electric and DC magnetic field strengths. The multipactor prone region is mapped over the entire parameter space by applying both dynamic and secondary yield criteria; previous studies have been limited to specific cases. Finally a simplified model is adopted to address collective effects and multipactor saturation from the space charge buildup. In addition to the mutual electron repulsion, we find that the previously neglected interaction of the electron sheath with the induced image charge on the plates is important to saturation. © 1995, American Institute of Physics.

It is, therefore, essential to establish a fundamental basis for fuel injection modeling that involves various atomization processes. A 2-D fuel injection model has been formulated to simulate the airflow within and downstream of the atomizer and address the formation and breakup of the liquid sheet formed at the atomizer exit. The sheet breakup under the effects of airblast, fuel pressure, or the combined atomization mode of the air-assist type is considered in the calculation. The model accounts for secondary breakup of drops and the stochastic Lagrangian treatment of spray. The calculation of spray evaporation addresses both droplet heat-up and steady-state mechanisms, and fuel vapor concentration is based on partial pressure concept. An enhanced evaporation model has been developed that accounts for multicomponent, finite mass diffusivity and conductivity effects, and addresses near critical evaporation. The present investigation involved predictions of flow and spray characteristics of two distinctively different fuel atomizers under both nonreacting and reacting conditions. The predictions of the continuous phase velocity components and the spray mean drop sizes agree well with the detailed measurements obtained for the two atomizers, which indicates the model accounts for key aspects of atomization. The model also provides insight into ligament formation and breakup at the atomizer exit and the initial drop sizes formed in the atomizer near field region where measurements are difficult to obtain. The calculations of the reacting spray show the fuel rich region occupied most of the spray volume with two-peak radial gas temperature profiles. The results also provided local concentrations of unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in atomizer flowfield, information that could support the effort to reduce emission levels of gas turbine combustors.

These processes are mediated by the extracellular matrix as well as the composition of the mineral itself. Initial mineral deposition occurs at the dentine surface, nucleated either by dentinal components or early enamel matrix, possibly non-amelogenin molecules. The early crystals are small in size and rich in magnesium and carbonate resulting in relatively poor crystallinity. This is in spite of the fact that fluoride is high at this stage. Crystal development includes a reduction in magnesium,carbonate and fluoride as crystals increase in length following the retreating ameloblasts from the dentine. The matrix acquires increasing concentrations of amelogenin and albumin. Prismatic structure begins to develop together with some growth of crystals in width and thickness. Degradation of amelogenin and non-amelogenin molecules generates a series of specific molecular fragments possibly concerned with modulating crystal growth and morphology and the creation of prismatic and interprismatic structures. Towards the end of secretion, matrix, now almost completely degraded, is replaced by fluid followed by massive crystal growth during maturation. Degradation of albumin also occurs at this stage, probably as a result of comprehensive destruction of molecules which might impair crystal growth. Selective acquisition of magnesium and fluoride at this stage may reflect the hydrated state of the tissue as well as cell changes. Fluid is displaced as crystals grow and the enamel acquires concentrations of mineral characteristic of mature tissue.","Chemistry; Development; Enamel; Matrix; Mineral","article; biochemistry; enamel; extracellular matrix; human; mineralization; priority journal; tooth development; Ameloblasts; Animal; Dental Enamel; Extracellular Matrix; Human; Minerals; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028917686

Urban shade trees and light-colored surfaces can offset or reverse the heat island and conserve energy. Implementation of heat island mitigation measures is now a prominent part of President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan to control the emissions of greenhouse gases, necessitating a better understanding of the quantitative benefits of these control measures. We present recent measurements of the air-conditioning savings for houses in Sacramento and Florida, and air temperature measurements at White Sands National Monument, New Mexico. We also discuss the results of meteorological and smog simulations for the Los Angeles Basin. The albedo of a city may be increased gradually if high-albedo surfaces are chosen to replace darker materials during routine maintenance of roofs and roads. Such high-albedo surfaces may last longer than their conventional dark counterparts. Utility-sponsored incentive programs, product labeling, and standards could promote the use of high-albedo materials for buildings and roads, and several paint manufacturers have expressed interest in participating in a 'cool surfaces' labeling program. We examine the spectral reflectance of various white coatings and building materials that might be labeled in such a program. © 1995.","Air-conditioning electricity savings; Cool roads; Cool roofs; Smog mitigation; Urban heat islands; Utility programs","Air conditioning; Air pollution control; Buildings; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Houses; Temperature measurement; Smog; Smog mitigation; Urban heat islands; Cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029354552

The dependence of the electron yields on target thickness and charge state of the ions is analyzed within the framework of an extended semiempirical model. Due to the high velocity of the ions, it is possible to distinguish electron production in primary ionization (related to the stopping power and the effective charge of the ions) from secondary electron production due to the transport of so-called δ electrons (cascade multiplication). By combining the experimental results with numerical simulations of electron transport in matter by a Monte Carlo method, we have obtained electron transport lengths of high energy (E100 eV) δ electrons parallel and perpendicular to the ion trajectory, as well as diffusion lengths of slow electrons (E100 eV). In order to study the velocity dependence of these transport lengths, we have not only investigated 13.6 MeV/u Ar ions, but also 1 MeV/u C and 3.9 MeV/u S, for which experimental results are available [Koschar et al., Phys. Rev. A 40, 3632 (1989)].

Complex 5b was characterized by X-ray diffraction. The planar-tetracoordinate carbon center (C2) of 5b exhibits four strong bonds to its nearest in plane neighbors, i.e. to two carbon and two zirconium centers. In solution, complex 5b is dynamic. The C5symmetric planar-tetracoordinate carbon compound 5b undergoes a thermally induced automerization reaction [AG* (250 K) = 11.8 ± 0.5 kcal mol–1] that proceeds through a C2v-symmetric geometry (6b) that has the characteristics of a transition state according to a theoretical analysis of the 5 ⇌ 6 ⇌ 5’ rearrangement process. This means that the extra stabilization energy of planar-tetracoordinate carbon relative to ordinary planar-tricoordinate carbon in the “semi-fenestrane” environment of the complexes 5 amounts to ca. 10–12 kcal mol–1. The 5 ⇌ 5’ equilibrium is strongly influenced by substituents at the μ-η1:η2-RCCCH3ligand and by electronically active Cp substitution. In addition, a strong memory effect is operative in the formation of 5. It can be observed by using suitably substituted pairs of isomeric complexes 5. Thus, the reaction between [Cp2ZrCD3(THF)]+ (8d) and (MeCp)2-Zr(–C≡C–CH3)2(7e) gives only complex 5h, which exhibits the CH3 group at the planar-tetracoordinate carbon center C2, whereas the reaction of the complementary reagent combination [(MeCp)2ZrCD3(THF)]+ (8e)/Cp2Zr-(–C≡C–CH3)2 (7a)] in this double-labeling experiment exclusively leads to the same type of product (5i) that has the CD3 group bonded to C2. This and other examples of this organometallic memory effect indicate that dimetallic intermediates are involved in the formation of the unusually structured stable planar-tetracoordinate carbon compounds 5. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

A modified version of the KIVA code is used for the computations, with improved submodels for liquid breakup, drop distortion and drag, spray/wall impingement with rebounding, sliding and breaking-up drops, wall heat transfer with unsteadiness and compressibility, multistep kinetics ignition and laminar-turbulent characteristic time combustion models, Zeldovich NOx formation, and soot formation with Nagle Strickland-Constable oxidation. The code also considers piston-cylinder-liner crevice flows and allows computations of the intake flow process in the realistic engine geometry with two moving intake valves. Significant progress has been made using a modified RNG k-ε turbulence model, and a multicomponent fuel vaporization model and a flamelet combustion model have been implemented. Model validation experiments have been performed using a single-cylinder heavy duty truck engine that features state-of-the-art high pressure electronic fuel injection and emissions instrumentation. In addition to cylinder pressure, heat release, and emissions measurements, combustion visualization experiments have also been performed using an endoscope system that takes the place of one of the exhaust valves. In-cylinder gas velocity (PIV) and gas temperature measurements have also been made in the motored engine using optical techniques. Modifications to the engine geometry for optical access were minimal, thus ensuring that the results represent the actual engine. Experiments have also been conducted to study the effect of injection characteristics, including injection pressure and rate, nozzle inlet condition and multiple injections on engine performance and emissions. The results show that multiple pulsed injections can be used to significantly reduce both soot and NOx simultaneously in the engine. In addition, when combined with exhaust gas recirculation to further lower NOx, pulsed injections are found to be still very effective at reducing soot. The intake flow CFD modeling results show that the details of the intake flow process influence the engine performance. Comparisons with the measured engine cylinder pressure, heat release, soot and NOx emission data, and the combustion visualization flame images show that the CFD model results are generally in good agreement with the experiments. In particular, the model is able to correctly predict the soot-NOx trade-off trend as a function of injection timing. However, further work is needed in order to improve the accuracy of predictions of combustion with late injection, and to assess the effect of intake flows on emissions. AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS afford such a convenient means of transportation that they will continue to be demanded by our mobile society. As a result, the requirement to meet the challenge of producing cleaner and more efficient power-plants will intensify further in the next years. This challenge requires an increased commitment to research by the transportation industry. The industry has already improved engine performance significantly through the use of new technologies such as ultra-high injection pressure fuel sprays (e.g., to reduce pollutant emission levels) and the use of advanced materials (e.g., ceramics to influence engine heat transfer losses). More recently, advanced computer models are finding increased use in the industry as a tool to accelerate the pace of change. Progress on the development and validation of an advanced CFD model for diesel engine combustion is described in this study. The internal combustion engine represents one of the more challenging fluid mechanics problems to model because the flow is compressible, low Mach number, turbulent, unsteady, cyclic, and non-stationary, both spatially and temporally. The combustion characteristics are greatly influenced by the details of the fuel preparation process and the distribution of fuel in the engine which is, in turn, controlled by the in-cylinder fluid mechanics. Fuel injection introduces the complexity of describing the physics of dense, vaporizing two-phase flows. Pollutant emissions are controlled by the details of the turbulent fuel-air mixing and combustion processes, and a detailed understanding of these processes is required in order to improve performance and reduce emissions while not compromising fuel economy. Much progress has been made in CFD model development for engines in recent years. For example, recent modeling studies have been conducted for direct-injection diesel engines [1]*, stratified-charge rotary engines [2], and homogeneous-charge reciprocating engines [3]. However, considerable work is needed in the development of physical submodels [4]. In spite of the detailed nature of even the most comprehensive of engine codes, they will not be entirely predictive for the foreseeable future due to the wide range of length and time scales needed to describe engine fluid mechanics. For example, to resolve the flow-field around 10 μm diameter drops (typical of the Sauter mean diameter of diesel spray drops) in al 10 cm diameter combustion chamber requires about 1012 grid points. Practical super-computer storage and run times limit calculations to about 105 grid points. The missing 7 orders of magnitude will not be realized soon, even with the most optimistic projections about computer power increases. Thus, it is necessary to introduce submodels for processes that occur on time and length scales that are too short to be resolved such as atomization, drop drag and vaporization, drop breakup and coalescence, drop turbulence dispersion and turbulence modulation effects, spray/wall interaction and turbulent combustion. The use of submodels to describe unresolved physical processes necessarily introduces empiricism into computations. However, the compromise between accuracy and feasibility of computation is justified by the insight which model calculations offer. Confidence in the model predictions and knowledge of their limitations is gained by comparison with experiments. The KIVA code [5, 6, 7] has been selected for use in the present work since it is the most developed of available codes. This code has the ability to calculate three-dimensional flows in engine cylinders with arbitrary shaped piston geometries, including the effects of turbulence, sprays and wall heat transfer. The code has been modified as described below and in Refs. [1, 4, 8, 9 and 10] by including state-of-the-art submodels for the important physical processes that occur in diesel combustion. The model validation experiments have been performed using a single-cylinder research engine that features state-of-the-art high pressure electronic fuel injection and emissions instrumentation. Details of comparisons between measured and predicted engine performance, soot and NOx emissions and combustion visualizations are presented. The model results are generally in good agreement with experiments, indicating that reliable computer models are now available to the industry to help reduce engine development times and costs. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air; Codes (symbols); Combustion chambers; Computational fluid dynamics; Data visualization; Diesel engines; Digital storage; Direct injection; Drag; Drop breakup; Dust; Economic and social effects; Engine pistons; Exhaust gas recirculation; Exhaust gases; Forecasting; Fuel economy; Fuels; Geometry; Heat transfer; Ignition; Intake systems; Mach number; Nitrogen oxides; Pistons; Pollution; Pressure; Rotary engines; Soot; Stratified charge engines; Temperature measurement; Trucks; Turbulence models; Two phase flow; Vaporization; Visualization; Combustion characteristics; Comparison with experiments; Direct injection diesel engines; Electronic fuel injections; Gas temperature measurements; Sauter mean diameter (SMD); Single-cylinder research engines; Turbulent characteristics; Engine cylinders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072420213

Also, to further reduce emission levels, tighter air/fuel ratio control is required. There are many ways to control air/fuel ratio on a CNG engine. It can be performed in a feedforward method, a feedback method or a combination of both. CNG fuel can be introduced to the engine via single-point injection, multi-point injection or with an air/gas mixer. Mixer-type and single-point injection are good candidates for the application of a gas flow sensor for accurate air/fuel ratio measurement. Reduction of valve hysteresis can also be achieved. Fuel delivery and control systems cost can be kept low compared to using multi-point injection where high flow injectors are required for each cylinder. A gas flow sensor is placed in the CNG stream to monitor mass gas flow rate. The gas flow sensor is based on the hot wire anemometry concept, currently used in mass air flow measurement. Topics regarding CNG composition effects on sensor output, temperature effects, pressure effects, high pressure noise management and oil contamination test results are important to the operation of the gas flow sensor and will be described in this paper.

Three important climatic factors were identified as being important determinants of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa ‘Hayward’ (A. Chev) C.F. Liang et A.R. Ferguson) distribution: winter chilling; growing season thermal time; and annual rainfall. Indices for each of these factors were developed to enable mapping of the most suitable areas for kiwifruit production. These were May-July temperatures of 11°C or less as the optimal winter chilling requirement, a thermal time accumulation of 1100 degree-days above 10°C from October to April, and an annual rainfall of 1250 mm or more. Apart from Northland, all the traditional areas of kiwifruit production have a suitable climate. However, there are substantial areas of inland Bay of Plenty to Rotorua, the Waikato, north Taranaki, and northern Hawke's Bay where the climatic requirements are also satisfied. A high frequency of extreme winds may be an additional limiting factor in some of these regions, such as Taranaki. The total area of suitability is enlarged if irrigation is available, particularly in the southern North Island and central Marlborough. Within this climatic range the estimated dates for the average end of dormancy and 50% flowering are spread over 4 weeks, and estimated budburst dates over 11 days. Although use of average climate data to describe kiwifruit distribution provides a valuable first-order assessment, it would be desirable to incorporate analyses of climate variability in future studies of this kind. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 1995.","Actinidia deliciosa; Agroclimatic mapping; Climate; Climate requirements; Kiwifruit; Phenology; Spatial distribution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002725728

The majority of the Case galaxies are energized by regions of active star formation; only 5% of the sample are Seyfert galaxies. The dual selection techniques used (both UV-excess and emission lines) allow the survey to detect star-forming galaxies with a wide range of properties and evolutionary states. In particular, the Case survey selects galaxies with lower levels of activity than most previous surveys. The survey also includes a larger fraction of intermediate and low-luminosity galaxies than would be present in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Although galaxies as faint as mB = 19 are present in the sample, the completeness limit of the UV-excess selected portion of the survey is closer to mB = 16. The luminosity function of the Case galaxies is derived and compared with that of the ""normal"" field galaxies in the same volume of space. The shape of the Case luminosity function is similar to that for the field sample. A surprising result is that 31% of the field galaxy population can be accounted for by galaxies of the type selected in the Case survey. © 1995 American Astronomical Society.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001026092

In the center of the cluster, there are unresolved radio sources associated with the nucleus of the central D galaxy, with the nucleus of the nearby companion galaxy, and another galaxy that appears to absorb part of the cluster X-ray emission. Two small radio lobes are located approximately 12″ on either side of the D galaxy nucleus. We argue that these mark the direction of the emergence of radio jets from the nucleus. A ""bar"" of X-ray emission coincides with these radio lobes. Most of the radio flux from the central region of the cluster is associated with diffuse, amorphous of emission, which is unpolarized and which has a steep radio spectrum. All of the extended radio components in the center have minimum nonthermal pressures that are much lower than the pressure of the X-ray emitting gas. The low pressure and depolarized emission suggest that the radio plasma is mixed with the thermal plasma. The central radio structure, lack of polarization, low nonthermal pressure, and steep spectral index are all similar to the radio source PKS 0745-191, also associated with the central galaxy in a strong cooling flow cluster. We argue that the weak radio jets in 2A 0335+096 and PKS 0745-191 are disrupted at small radii by the high-pressure ambient gas. The radio plasma from the disrupted jets continues to move outward, but as subsonic, buoyant plumes. These plumes may also entrain a good deal of the ambient thermal gas, which produces the X-ray bar in 2A 0335+096. The radio plasma mixes with the ambient thermal plasma, and continue to move outward buoyantly. In 2A 0335+096, the observed radio lobes are oriented nearly perpendicular to the direction from the D galaxy nucleus to the companion nucleus. There are also elongated optical line and X-ray structures in this same direction. We suggest that this gas forms a rotating disk, which is being accreted onto the D galaxy nucleus and which determines the direction of the radio jets. We also suggest that the activity of the two galactic nuclei and that the orientation of this disk may be due to the merger of the companion galaxy with the central D galaxy. The cluster also contains a very long Narrow Angle Tail (NAT) radio galaxy. The minimum nonthermal pressures along the tail are in good agreement with the pressure of the surrounding X-ray emitting gas, which indicates that the material in the tail is confined by this gas. The radio spectrum steepens with distance from the galaxy along the tail due to radiative losses. The tail of the NAT radio source changes direction abruptly about 2′ from the galaxy. We suggest that is due to buoyant motions of the tail rising out of and away from denser regions of the intracluster gas. In fact, the tail is projected against a region of reduced X-ray emission. The NAT galaxy is also observed to be a moderately strong X-ray source. The source is unresolved and fairly bright, which suggests that the X-ray emission is due to the AGN in this galaxy.","Cooling flows; Galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD; Intergalactic medium; Radio continuum: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11944273230

For the purpose, to resolve this problem, partial replacement of coke by auxiliary fuels in the energy source of blast furnaces and the conversion of CO and CO2 in the blast furnace stack-gas into methanol were investigated over 25.7Cu-60ZnO-14.3Al2O3(mol%) catalyst. The performance of a blast furnace fired with natural gas, coal water mixture (CWM), coal oil mixture (COM) and pulverized coal was predicted by a mathematical model, based on heat and mass balances. In the prediction, firing rate of auxiliary fuels was determined to keep the theoretical flame temperature unchanged in the raceway region of the blast furnace. As a result, the auxiliary fuel firing led to hydrogen enriched and lean nitrogen concentration in the blast furnace stack-gas. In the methanol synthesis experiment, forty fold higher yield of methanol on the carbon basis was observed by increasing the H2/(CO+CO2) ratio in the reactant gas from 0.05 to 0.5, where 0.05 corresponds to the value for the conventional blast furnace. The methanol yield was also increased with decreased nitrogen. This implied that controlled firing auxiliary fuels into the blast furnace is advantageous from the view of subsequent methanol synthesis. The greenhouse gas emission was reduced by the auxiliary fuel injection. The exergy consumption was also decreased by the injection of CWM, COM and pulverized coal. In particular, COM was the most effective for the reduction of GHG emission and exergy consumption, and for methanol synthesis from the blast furnace stack-gas.

Total suspended particles (TSP) were collected using a Hi-vol sampler and exracted with methylene chloride by ultrasonication. Pooled seasonal extracts were tested using S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with and without metabolic activation (S9) and TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6 without metabolic activation. Organic extracts of the samples with the highest monthly TSP concentration were also assayed for mutagenicity. All samples collected at São Paulo and Cubatão showed mutagenicity with strain TA98, and in general the addition of S9 did not modify the mutagenic response, suggesting the prevalence of direct-acting frameshift mutagens in the atmosphere of these sites. The mutagenicity detected in the urban areas of São Paulo (mainly downtown) was much higher than in the Cubatão industrial area and similar to the more urbanized cities in the world, where vehicle emissions are the major pollution source. Results obtained with the strains TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6 suggested the presence of mononitro- and dinitroarenes contributed to the mutagenicity of these atmospheric samples. A seasonal variation was observed with higher levels of frameshift mutagens during Spring in São Paulo and Summer in Cubatão. During the Winter, more significant responses were found with strain TA100 in the presence of S9 at all sites. Monthly samples presented high levels of mutagenicity during the period of June to November. Results from this research provide support for Air Pollution Control Programs in the detection of the more potent organic mutagenic compounds in the atmosphere and may help in the establishment of priorities for control and regulatory actions. © 1995.","Airborne particulate matter; Ames test; Complex mixture; Nitroarene; Seasonal variation","aromatic nitro compound; s 9; airborne particle; ames test; animal tissue; article; controlled study; industrial area; metabolic activation; mutagenicity; nonhuman; particulate matter; priority journal; rat; season; urban area; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Brazil; Mutagenicity Tests; Mutagens; Salmonella typhimurium; Seasons; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028832423

Nucleotide sequencing of the promoter-distal part of the operons revealed three open reading frames, designated cbbG, cbbK, and cbbA. Similarity searches in databases and heterologous expressions of the subcloned genes in Escherichia coli identified them as genes encoding the Calvin cycle enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and a class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, respectively. The aldolase could be grouped together with the enzymes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Bacillus subtilis as a new subtype of class II aldolases. A phenotypic complementation analysis with a cbb operon mutant of A. eutrophus showed that the cbbG product is essential for autotrophic growth of the organism, whereas the products of cbbK and cbbA can apparently be substituted by isoenzymes encoded elsewhere on the chromosome. No or only low constitutive promoter activity was associated with cbbK and cbbA, respectively, confirming the two genes as parts of the cbb operon.

As the scope for restructuring energy supply and switching to environmentally friendlier sources is very limited in Germany, strategies for controlling inevitable NOX and SO2 emissions will continue to be directed at further improving the technical systems (besides necessary changes in lifestyle). Since the large-scale retrofit programmes were initiated in the eighties, technological advances have provided some scope for a further tightening of emission reduction requirements for SO2 and NOX.

The carbon cycle is the fluxes of carbon among four main reservoirs: fossil carbon, the atmosphere, the oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere. Emissions of fossil carbon during the 1980s averaged 5.5 Gt y−1. During the same period, the atmosphere gained 3.2 Gt C y−1 and the oceans are believed to have absorbed 2.0 Gt C y−1. The regrowing forests of the Northern Hemisphere may have absorbed 0.5 Gt C y−1 during this period. Meanwhile, tropical deforestation is thought to have released an average 1.6 Gt C y−1 over the 1980s. While the fluxes among the four pools should balance, the average 198Ds values lead to a ‘missing sink’ of 1.4 Gt C y−1 Several processes, including forest regrowth, CO2 fertilization of plant growth (c. 1.0 Gt C y−1), N deposition (c. 0.6 Gt C y−1), and their interactions, may account for the budget imbalance. However, it remains difficult to quantify the influences of these separate but interactive processes. Uncertainties in the individual numbers are large, and are themselves poorly quantified. This paper presents detail beyond the IPCC assessment on procedures used to approximate the flux uncertainties. Lack of knowledge about positive and negative feedbacks from the biosphere is a major limiting factor to credible simulations of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Analyses of the atmospheric gradients of CO2 and 13 CO2 concentrations provide increasingly strong evidence for terrestrial sinks, potentially distributed between Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions, but conclusive detection in direct biomass and soil measurements remains elusive. Current regional‐to‐global terrestrial ecosystem models with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles represent the effects of CO2 fertilization differently, but all suggest longterm responses to CO2 that are substantially smaller than potential leaf‐ or laboratory whole plant‐level responses. Analyses of emissions and biogeochemical fluxes consistent with eventual stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are sensitive to the way in which biospheric feedbacks are modeled by c. 15%. Decisions about land use can have effects of 100s of Gt C over the next few centuries, with similarly significant effects on the atmosphere. Critical areas for future research are continued measurements and analyses of atmospheric data (CO2 and 13CO2) to serve as large‐scale constraints, process studies of the scaling from the photosynthetic response to CO2 to whole‐ecosystem carbon storage, and rigorous quantification of the effects of changing land use on carbon storage.

Plant transport of CH4 was controlled both by CH4 supply and the plant species. Eriophorum angustifolium transported substantially more CH4 than did Carex aquatilis, due to differences in size and structure of the two species. The composition of the plant community was a greater control on CH4 flux from the site than either water table height (which varied only slightly) or CH4 production rates, indicating the importance of species-specific plant dynamics in controlling CH4 flux from arctic wetlands. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","methane; methanogenesis; transport; tundra","Arctic wet meadow; methane emission; methane production; plant transport; tundra; Carex aquatilis; Eriophorum angustifolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028994088

The kinetic parameters of in vitro-activated Rubisco were similar in EK6 and in the wild type. On the other hand, Rubisco appeared to be in a low state of activation in situ in EK6 cells pretreated with an air level of CO2. This was deduced from the appearance of a lag phase when carboxylation was followed with time in cells permeabilized by detergent and subsequently supplied with saturating CO2 and RuBP. Pretreatment of the cells with high CO2 virtually abolished the lag. After low-CO2 treatment, the internal RuBP pool was much higher in mutant cells than in the wild-type cells; pretreatment with high CO2 reduced the pool in mutant cells.

The level of Fru 2,6‐P2 in tobacco plants was elevated by the introduction of a modified mammalian gene encoding 6‐phosphofructo‐2‐kinase (6‐PF‐2‐K). Estimates of the metabolite control coefficient (C) for Fru 2,6‐P2 levels in response to increased 6‐PF‐2‐K activity, suggest that small increases in 6‐PF‐2‐K activity have little effect upon steady‐state Fru 2,6‐P2 levels (C = +0.08 for a 0–58% increase in 6‐PF‐2‐K activity). However, larger changes resulted in dramatic rises in Fru 2,6‐P2 levels (C = +3.35 for 206–268% increase in 6‐PF‐2‐K activity). Transgenic plants contained Fru 2,6‐P2 levels in the dark that ranged from 104 to 230% of the level in wild‐type tobacco. Plants with altered levels of Fru 2,6‐P2 were used to determine the effects of this signal metabolite upon carbohydrate metabolism during the initial phase of the light period. Here we provide direct evidence that Fru 2,6‐P2 contributes to the regulation of carbon partitioning in tobacco leaves by inhibiting sucrose synthesis. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

This requires strong controls on industrial sources of air pollution and a significant influence over transport modes and characteristics. California is perhaps the most extreme example of a car-dominated society. Resultant congestion and air quality problems are now recognized as damaging the physical, social and economic health of the State. Planners and policy makers have become seriously concerned about the future. This paper considers the problems of California, with an emphasis on southern California.

The extent of non-linearity is related to the ratio of the third to second virial coefficients ( B A) of the equation of state of the medium. This ratio can be directly measured by determining the rate of change in sound speed with pressure. Several simple relations are developed that relate acoustic non-linearity to the molecular properties, namely internal pressure, free energy of binding, the effective van der Waals' constants, the translational diffusion coefficient, and the rotational correlation time. Using these relationships and the measured the acoustic non-linearity parameter and the sound speed, the molecular properties are determined for the liquids: water, alcohols and fluorocarbons. In all cases the values obtained from ultrasonic measurements compare closely with the values reported in the literature based on alternative measurements. In conclusion, the non-linear propagation of ultrasound offers an independent means of determining the molecular properties of condensed media. © 1995.","diffusion coefficients; molecular properties; non-linear ultrasonics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001314039

Crop models (CERES-Rice, -Maize and -Wheat) were used to simulate the possible changes in crop yields and growing season lengths under different climate change scenarios derived from three general circulation models (GCMs). Increased temperature resulted in decrease in simulated crop yields and shortened growing season lengths in many regions under the present management systems. While the direct beneficial effects of CO2 may compensate for the yield decreases in central and northern Japan, the effects did not compensate for the yield decreases in Kyushu. The changes in crop yield varied largely among the GCM scenarios. In general, the GISS scenario is very favorable for crop production in Japan, but the UKMO scenario is not favorable, showing a considerable yield decrease. Wheat production would be very vulnerable to any GCMs climate change scenarios. Early planting and irrigation are possible adaptation strategies of the management systems to climate change. In most cases, simulated yields increased under climate change conditions if an early planting date was adopted; however, in Kyushu because of high temperature stress, an earlier planting did not improve simulated yields, and the introduction of new cultivars better adapted to the climate change conditions would be required. © 1995, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Various estimates of dispersion parameters are discussed for low wind conditions. Specifically, schemes viz., standard, split sigma, split sigma theta, segmented plume (I) and (II), short-term averaging and Umin approach are studied through intercomparison. The concentration formula used in this intercomparison is obtained from the steady-state advection-diffusion equation. The results show that with hourly data of wind velocity and standard deviation of horizontal wind direction (σθ), split sigma and split sigma theta schemes perform much better than the traditional standard method as they take into account the wind direction fluctuations for the horizontal dispersion. On the other hand, with high-frequency data of wind velocity and σθ, schemes like segmented plume (I) and (II) and short-term averaging simulate the observations much better especially in terms of the multiple peak nature of the concentration distribution. The influence of wind fluctuations from instantaneous plumes is captured by the high-frequency data. Further, short-term averaging scheme has the advantage of not requiring σθ and still performing well. The difference in these results and those obtained from the Gaussian plume solution has been found to be marginal. © 1995.","diffusion parameters; dispersion modelling; Low wind speed; mathematical model; sigma schemes","air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; atmospheric dispersion; conference paper; mathematical model; priority journal; velocity; wind; Air Pollution; Dispersion; Low; Sigma Schemes; Wind Speeds; air pollutant dispersion; diffusion parameters; low wind condition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028991276

Current requirements are as low as 9 ppmvd in the United States (without the use of selective catalytic reduction). The most cost effective manner by which to accomplish this is through combustion control techniques1. Most of the NOx emitted by combustion turbine engines is known as 'thermal' NOx. Thermal Nox is formed by what is known as the Zeldovich mechanism in the hot post-flame zone of the combustor [2, 3, 4]. When applying combustion control techniques, it is necessary to keep the local flame temperature below approximately 1800 K (below this temperature, the NOx formation rate is negligible) [3]. This can be accomplished by burning a lean, well-mixed fuel/air mixture in the combustor [5]. This paper discusses how computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and laboratory testing are used in the development of combustion turbine combustors. Though these techniques are applied to all Westinghouse combustors, only a two-stage lean premixed prevaporized (LPP), or Ultra Low NOx, combustor will be discussed here.

Box 3092, Houston, TX, United States","Floral character in mires has changed progressively through time. In the Carboniferous, pteridophytes, sphenophytes and lycophytes were dominant but by the Permian gymnosperms were an important component of mire flora. During the early Mesozoic gymnosperms remained the characteristic mire vegetation, together with pteridophytes, and conifers became dominant during the Jurassic. Cretaceous and Paleocene vegetation are similar, with taxodiaceous flora being important in mire vegetation. From the Eocene onwards, however, angiosperms were increasingly dominant in mire communities and in the Miocene herbaceous vegetation began to play a significant role. Together with these changes in floral character at least three aspects of coal character also appear to vary sequentially with time and are distinctive in the Tertiary: (1) proportions and thickness of vitrain banding, (2) coal bed thickness and (3) proportions of carbonised material. A compilation has been made of data from the coal literature comparing older coals with those of the Tertiary, in order to give a perspective in which to examine Tertiary coals. It was found that only Tertiary coals contain significant proportions of coal devoid of vitrain bands. In addition, Tertiary coals are the thickest recorded coal beds and generally contain low percentages of carbonised material (many less than 5%) as compared to older coals. It is interesting to note that Paleocene coal beds are similar to Cretaceous coals in that they tend to be thinner and contain higher proportions of carbonised material than do younger Tertiary coals. The absence of vitrain bands in some Tertiary coal beds is thought to result from the floras dominated by angiosperms, which are relatively easily degraded as compared to gymnosperms. The thickness of Tertiary coals may be related to an increase in biomass production from the Carboniferous through to the Tertiary, as plants made less investment in producing lignin, an energy-intensive process. In addition, with less lignin in plants, easier degradation of biomass may have facilitated nutrient recycling which, in turn, led to greater biomass production. Increased biomass production may have also 'diluted' the carbonised material present in some Tertiary peats, leading to lower proportions in the coal. Another possible cause of decreased carbonised components in Tertiary coal is that decreasing lignin content resulted in decreased charring during fires, as lignin is particularly prone to charring. A third possibility is that the carbonised component of peat may be concentrated during coalification so that Tertiary coals, generally of lower rank than Mesozoic or Paleozoic coals, contain a smaller fraction of carbonised plant material. It is not at present clear which of these mechanisms may have affected carbonised material in peat and coal but it is clear that lignin type and content has had an important role in determining peat and coal character since the Paleozoic. © 1995.",,"angiosperm; bed thickness; biomass production; carbonized material; coal; coal characteristics; Tertiary; Tertiary coal; vitrain; Biomass; Carbon; Coal research; Geology; Lignin; Peat; Plants (botany); Carboniferous; Cretaceous coal; Paleocene coal; Permian; Tertiary coal beds; Vegetation; Vitrain band; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029416058

This paper explores multi-media permitting to limit coal-fired power plant releases of Hg; a pollutant that poses significant risk to human health and the environment. Power plant Hg emissions are a function of fuel, combustion regime and emission treatment. The approach presented is based on consideration of the Hg concentrations in various power plant emissions and the regulations governing these emissions. Multi-media permit development involves conducting a mass balance for Hg across the facility. Where pollution prevention is not an option, the permit should act to transfer the Hg to the waste stream in which it presents the least risk to human health and ecosystems.

The legislation also requires cities to reduce the parking requirements for developments that implement a parking cash-out program. This study estimates how the option to cash out employer-paid parking will reduce commuter parking demand, and recommends a corresponding reduction in minimum parking requirements. To deal with spillover parking problems that may occur if cities reduce parking requirements, the article concludes with a proposal to create “Parking Benefit Districts” where the revenues from market-priced curb parking are dedicated to paying for neighborhood public services. At market parking prices, curb parking revenue could easily exceed the current residential property tax revenue in neighborhoods subject to spillover parking. © 1995 American Planning Association Chicago, IL.",,"car-use reduction; minimum parking; parking requirement; traffic management; transport planning; USA, California",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028845222

The hydrogen and silane reactions are found to proceed without barriers, whereas the methane and propane reactions require activation energies.

As a second instrument, an automated mobile CO2 laser PA system has been employed for in situ air monitoring in industrial, urban and rural environments. A detection limit in the ppb-range can be achieved depending on molecular absorption cross sections and absorption interferences. Despite some cases which demonstrate the feasibility to differentiate even between isomers, the detection selectivity could often be substantially improved by employing a continuously rather than a line-tunable laser source. This is demonstrated by our high-pressure CO2 laser which offers continuous tunability in the common CO2 laser emission branches with a linewidth of only 0.017 cm-1.

The period between 14 and 35 days after anthesis corresponded to active phase of seed development during which period, seed dry weight and oil content increased sharply. Rate of pod photosynthesis and activities of photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle enzymes were maximum in younger pods but sufficiently high levels were retained up to 40 days after anthesis.

In order to characterize this emission in the context of current models, we have begun an archival investigation of such emission using data from the ROSAT Observatory. Here we report on analysis for seven pulsars based upon data taken with the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC). For each pulsar, we derive upper limits for the NS surface temperature as well as luminosity values or upper limits associated with a Crab-like power-law interpretation. Several of the pulsars were detected, and for these we have investigated scenarios for emission associated with the cooling of the hot NS interior as well as with the pulsar spin down. The emission from PSR 2334+61 and PSR 0114+58 appears consistent with a spin-down origin, although we cannot rule out emission associated with cooling of the NS interior. For PSR 1822—09, we find that the surface temperature upper limit implied by the nondetection falls below the predictions of several cooling models, potentially providing constraints on interpretations of the interior equation of state. Emission from the vicinity of PSR 1642—03 may be produced by an extended synchrotron nebula associated with the pulsar, but such models appear problematic.

In the initial stages of economic development the demand for energy, coupled to economic expansion, rises sharply. This increased consumption of power for heating, electricity, industrial processes etc. must lead to an increase of emissions. Dust, SO2and secondary products like sulphuric acid are responsible for severe impairments of human health and large scale damage to nature and buildings. Many developing countries have reached this stage of local air pollution or will be exposed to this type of environmental hazards in the near future. Economically developed countries, like the US, Japan and many countries in Western Europe have passed this stage one to three decades ago.In the next phase of economic development transportation, especially by means of lorries and cars becomes a determining factor in local air pollution and cause high concentrations of ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and other oxidants are present as secondary products of traffic emissions. A number of developing countries are now entering the stage when this “Los Angeles” type of smog starts to become an important environmental problem. Developing countries should benefit from transfer of knowledge obtained in research programs and development of abatement policies in countries, which have been exposed to these problems in the past. But exchange of ideas between developing countries, regarding assessment of air pollution and implementation of emission controls is also very useful to derive optimal abatement strategies. optimized abatement strategy. Estimates of emissions are often quite uncertain, e.g. in estimates of biogenic emissions and car emissions. Effective abatement should be based on a careful evaluation of local conditions regarding oxidant formation. Some control strategies are effective in one place, but not in another. A good example offers control by means of limiting of hydrocarbons. This strategy is not effective in regions where large emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons are encountered. The non—linear chemistry, resnonsible for ozone formation poses problems in developing an have been measured by means of the enclosure sampling method and GC-FID analysis. The measurement results show a diurnal and seasonal variation of the emission with peaks at noon and in summer months, which are closely related to temperature and irradiation. Average emission rates for Pine, Cypress, Poplar and Scholar, the primary trees in Beijing and China, are measured to be 2.7, 0.009, 4.7 and 1.3 μg.g−1h−1respectively. Annular amount of HCs emitted from the 4 type of trees are estimated to be 9.lxl03and 8.3x106 for Beijing city and China respectively. The emission of terpenes and isoprene from 15 types of trees, bamboo, grass and paddy rice means of pumps, can offer attractive possibilities for monitoring ambient air. Comparison of passive samplers with commonly applied monitors indicates that passive samplers can provide cheap methods for ambient monitoring. But insufficient work has been performed to optimise the methodology and to validate the results for most compounds. Diffusive samplers, devices which sample air controlled by diffusion processes and not by predictions. The NAPAP emission inventories have been prepared for modeling acid deposition and regionally elevated ozone in eastern North America but have rarely been evaluated on a regional scale. In the present paper, to evaluate area emission ratios in the NAPAP inventories, a principal component analysis technique was tested against simulated data and then applied to measurement results at a site in rural North America. The test suggests that the technique is appropriate to derive emission ratios given suitable field data. The area emissions have the following ratios: NOy/CO = 0.11 ± 0.04, HCHO/CO = 0.0056 ± 0.0022, HCHO/NOy= 0.05 ± 0.007, and SO2/CO = 0.005 ± 0.003. In comparison, the first three ratios in the NAPAP area emission inventories are in excellent agreement, but the SO2/CO ratio is three times higher than the field results. Accurate pollutant emission inventories are needed in regional air quality models for reliable different materials, copper, bronze, marble etc. under indoor and outdoor conditions. Different corrosion products are formed, depending on the local pollution climate. Especially the ratio between SO2and NOxis important. Rates of damaged have been assessed and are proven to be significant. The impact of local wet and dry deposition of acid compounds was investigated by means of exposure of took place in the former german Democratic Republic after unification with the Federal Republic of Germany (Western Germany), have caused a tremendous shift in emissions of pollutants. Most emissions, notably of SO2, CO, VOC (Volatile Organic Carbon) and dust have been reduced considerably, but NOxemissions are increased, due to traffic. Formerly smog periods of the “London kind”, characterised by high concentrations of sulfur compounds and dust, were frequently observed in the area of the former GDR. This kind of smog is now being replaced with “Los Angeles kind”, caused by high concentrations of oxidants. The large changes in power production, industrial production agriculture and traffic, which Maoer Mountain district during the spring of 1988. The measurement results show that the precipitation is seriously acidified during spring season in this area, and that acidity of precipitation increases with lower altitudes. The average pH value of rainwater and cloud water over Maoer mountain and of Guilin rainwater were 4.85, 4.34 and 3.91 respectively. Sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, calcium and hydronium were the principal ionic species. Sulfate was the major contributor to acidity, while calcium was the important neutraliser in the rainwater samples in this area. Samples of cloud water, rainwater and ambient aerosol were collected in Guilin downtown and coal and of stagnant meteorological conditions is responsible for high pollutant concentrations in Cheng De. As this city is famous for its Mountain Resort, an array of temples and palaces of great historical value, assessment of air pollution and of the contribution of different sources and the development of abatement measures is necessary. Control schemes to prevent health problems and damage to buildings are proposed. The combination of unfavourable sitina of industry and housing areas, of the use of low grade monitoring of both energy consumption and air quality, a detailed quantitative study is made on the influence of different pollutant sources on the air quality. NOxis the main air pollutant with an estimated contribution of about 70%. Vehicles are the main pollutant source contributing 46%, of which NOxis 64% expressed as mass. The contribution of point sources to NOxemissions is of a second order but point sources are responsible for most of the SO2emissions. Area sources have only a limited impact. Key words: Pollutant source, energy structure, air quality. Based on the latest two-years' survey of sources of pollutants and the results of continuous February 1994. Optical properties, meteorological parameters, and particle characteristics were measured. The data indicate that light scattering by particles is the dominant process in light extinction. Fine particle mass concentration and the fraction of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium ions in the particles are the major variables which determine the occurrence and characteristics of a smog episode in Seoul. Characteristics of visual air quality in Seoul have been investigated from March 1993 to Croatia and systematically since 1989 in the cadre of the EUROTRAC subproject TOR (Tropospheric Ozone Research). The results of measurements at different locations indicate that the diurnal behaviour of ozone concentrations is dependent on local air pollution. Urban sites show diurnal variations of a factor 10 or more, rural sites of a factor 2 to 5 and less than a factor of 2 is observed above the boundary layer. The levels of oxidants and precursors have incidentally been monitored for a long period in quality of air has deteriorated substantially, especially in large cities and industrial complexes. In the past the major source was the combustion of fuels, the amount of which rapidly increased with economic development and industrialization, and sulfur dioxide was the major pollutant in the air. However, as the number of automobiles have increased in recent years, automobile exhausts have become the main source of air pollution. Increasing public awareness leads to a consensus of sustainable development in Korean industries. The Government is formulating abatement policies and forces industry to comply to these measures. Investment in the facilities and R&amp;D on environment should be increased, and international cooperation accelerated. During the nast three decades ranid ecnnomic development has taken nlare in Korea and the established in China in 1992. This paper describes the application of AMS in source identification for atmospheric aerosols which was part of the national project of AMS application in environmental research. For comparison, sources were studied using multivariate analysis models such as correspondence factor analysis, principal factor analysis and pattern recognition analysis. The results of the samples collected in suburb of Beijing, analysed by factor analysis, showed that the predominant TSP source was soil which contributed more than 50% to atmospheric particles. However, the AMS results demonstrated that carbonaceous aerosols have quite different emission sources. For carbonaceous aerosols of Beijing, Hunan and Shandong, the contribution to ambient particles from fossil fuel was nearly 2/3, and as human activities (coal-burning, etc.) increases, the fossil part contributes more. Therefore, it is significant to combine the method of factor analysis and AMS in the study of atmospheric aerosols. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) is a new physical technique and it was successfully near Yeochun causes more frequent exceedence of the allowable limit of oxidant concentration. This increase of oxidant concentration is aggravated by local meteorological conditions. Analysis of the trends in oxidant concentration indicates that increased emissions of precursors polluted cities of the world and leading the list is the national capital Dilli. Exponential increase of the number of automobiles, particularly two- and three-wheelers, a number of industries and thermal power plants in the proximity of cities, the high population growth rate, poverty, unawareness and general apathy to the needs of environmental safety measures are mainly responsible for the current scenario. Considering the menace of air pollution which is new compared with other pressing problems such as those related to sanitation, drinking water etc., a significant amount of air pollution monitoring has taken place during the last one and a half decade. Needless to say, that a lot has to be done yet, but at the same time it must be added that currently serious efforts are being made on both government and public levels to meet the challenge of air pollution problems in India. The Indian megacities have achieved the dubious distinction of being some of the most smog. Data from monitoring stations show increased exceedence of the maximum allowable concentration of 80 ppb. Trajectory analysis during photochemical smog episodes show that highways and areas characterised by dense traffic contribute significantly to this problem. The large increase in traffic density in Beijing has created problems regarding photochemical human health and damaging buildings such as the Victoria Memorial Hall in Calcutta. Ambient concentrations have been monitored around this building and a model has been developed which describes concentration and deposition patterns as function of traffic emissions and abatement measures. Planting a green belt is the most effective counter measure to abate the impact of local emissions on Victoria Memorial Hall. Traffic emissions in Calcutta have increased sharply and the resulting impact is threatening matter in Beijing. Increased intensity of traffic contributes to the emission of especially smaller particles at an increasing rate. The fraction of inhalable and respirable particulate matter in the total amount of suspended particulate matter has increased substantially. The use of coal as fuel was. until recently, by far the most important source of particulate induce and other abatement policies which will effectively improve air quality in Guiyang, based on the monitoring data in recent years. The result is that air pollution control in Guiyang should be focussed on area sources with an average height of chimneys of 28m, and that the use of fuel must be changed. Industrial briquet with low sulfur content will be burned in boilers, with a capacity below 4 tons of coal per hour. An assessment of pollution, regarding SO, and TSP in Guiyang is made. This assessment will measured and statistical analysis has been applied to these results in order to assess the contribution of different sources. This approach leads to coherent results and indicates that soil is the major source of particulate material, followed by emissions of coal combustion and, depending on the season, either emissions due to construction or oil combustion. The chemical composition of particulate matter, sampled near Dagang oil field gas been carried out in the Bo Sea in March, 1993 and April, 1994. DMS concentrations in the Bo Sea in the end of winter were between 7 and 163 ng/1, 81 ng/1 on average. A seasonal variation of DMS concentrations was observed in the Gulf of Jiaozhou by a factor of 4 between spring and winter with mean concentrations of 363 ng/1 and 408 ng/1 in the spring seasons of 1993 and 1994 and 87 ng/1 in the 1993 winter season. The flux of DMS from the sea to the air also showed a seasonal variation. Key words: Dimethyl sulfide, Flux, seawater, atmosphere.

Past studies have shown that the stiffness of these materials is readily determined and that consideration of a maximum fiber-direction strain has great utility in correlating failure. While the maximum fiber-direction strain is relatively constant over a wide range of biaxial stress states for these materials, it is lower than that found for similar laminated specimens. Many mechanisms, including textile processes and yarn undulation, undoubtedly contribute to the degraded properties. Their effects alone, however, do not adequately explain the low fiber-direction ultimate strains. Large planar variations in strain have experimentally been shown to exist. Local extreme fiber-direction failure strains may then be much closer to that found for laminates than was previously believed. One- and two-dimensional analytical models are used to study this behavior based on compliance changes resulting from discrete yarn bundles. It is hoped that an increased understanding of the complex strain response of braided composites will allow better failure prediction and an increased understanding of failure mechanisms. © 1995.","biaxial; braid; failure; micromechanics; strength","braided; carbon-fibre-reinforced; composites; Carbon fibers; Composite micromechanics; Epoxy resins; Failure (mechanical); Laminated composites; Mathematical models; Stiffness; Strain; Strength of materials; Textiles; Braided composites; One dimensional; Planar biaxial loading; Textile composites; Two dimensional; Composite materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028992509

Levels are dependent on pulmonary blood flow, ventilation, and CO2 content of blood. When ventilation is kept constant, the end-tidal CO2 closely follows pulmonary blood flow. Methods: Reduction of end-tidal CO2 in the expired air was used to adjust tightness of the pulmonary band in 10 patients with complex cardiac anomalies, all including ventricular septal defect, who underwent pulmonary artery banding. Other parameters were systemic blood pressures and distal pulmonary artery pressures. Results: There were no operative deaths.

While it is possible today to conduct limited diagnostics with the on-board engine computer by performing periodic checks to verify the validity of the signals measured by the on-board sensors, and to measure tailpipe emissions during routine inspection and maintenance, the task of correlating these measurements with each other to provide an on-line, accurate diagnosis of critical malfunctions has thus far proven to be a very challenging task, especially in the case of misfire. A typical automotive emission control system relies on the measurements provided by various sensors, including for example air charge temperature, intake manifold pressure, exhaust gas oxygen concentration, and engine speed, to adjust the air and fuel mixture as closely as possible to the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (AFR). Maintaining the AFR close to stoichiometry allows the catalytic converter to operate in a high conversion efficiency region, and to significantly reduce the emission of the three major pollutants (for gasoline engines), that is, CO, HC, and NOx. Improper operation of any of the sensors, as well as actual component malfunctions (e.g., a fouled spark plug or fuel injector, or a vacuum or compression leak), may sufficiently upset the delicate balance sought by the electronic controller to cause the mixture to significantly deviate from the desired set point. Such a condition results not only in increased emissions, but possibly in further damage to components (e.g., the catalytic converter), with significant cost to the consumer or to the manufacturer. It is clearly important to diagnose malfunctions in the emission control system at the incipient stage. Since in practice the first visible ""symptom"" of a problem with the emission control system may be the measurement of excessive tailpipe emissions during an inspection and maintenance test, it is very important that the exhaust gas measurements be somehow correlated with the health of the emission control system. This is a particularly challenging problem, because the chemistry of exhaust gas production is very complex, and not easily modeled by conventional dynamic system modeling methods. One approach to understanding the correlation between emission control system malfunctions and measured tailpipe emissions is to generate an extensive data base, and to analyze the data to uncover characteristic patterns that may assist in the diagnosis of specific faults. The ultimate aim of the project is to provide a methodology for the development of diagnostic tools that can integrate the information supplied by conventional tailpipe inspection programs with on-board diagnostics to provide fast and reliable diagnosis of misfire. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air intakes; Automobile manufacture; Catalytic converters; Control systems; Diesel engines; Emission control; Fuels; Gas emissions; Inspection; Mixtures; Program diagnostics; Automotive emission control; Dynamic system modeling; Electronic controllers; Exhaust gas oxygens; High conversion efficiency; Inspection and maintenance; On board diagnostics; Stoichiometric Air to Fuel Ratio; Exhaust manifolds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072410900

Snow samples have been taken at the 53 groundwater observation stations in nearly natural state areas, where the impacts of local emission sources have been negligible. Thus the concentrations of impurities in snow can be considered as background levels. Samples were analyzed for conductivity, pH, major ions and trace metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn and Hg). The regional variation of the chemical composition of major ions in the snowpack was outlined by cluster analysis. Sampling sites were divided into six clusters by average linkage clustering method. The largest cluster - considered as the 'mean cluster' - was located in central and northern Finland. The lowest levels of the total amount of dissolved impurities occurred in the cluster formed by the most northern observation site exclusively. Highest rates of the acidifying components, sulphate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4) and hydrogen ions (H+), were encountered in southern Finland. Sampling locations of southern Finland were divided into three clusters. The acidity of snow varies among these clusters that in addition of deposition of SO4 and NO3 is considerably controlled by alkaline deposition. The results of chemical analyses of snow were converted to mean monthly depositions using the water equivalent of snow and the time of deposition. Deposition of SO4 during 1985-1993 was 32% lower compared with the period 1976-1984, which presumably results from 70% reduction of sulphur emissions in Finland since the beginning of the 1980s.

Presently, a great deal of variability exists in the purposes and procedures related to certification processes, thus devaluing its use. CONCLUSION: The lack of consistency among certifying agencies and the lack of documented impact of certified advanced nursing practice can negatively affect the value placed on certification as an advanced practice credential. In the current climate of increased regulation, nursing must maintain control of practice regulation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Inconsistencies between states and among nursing organizations can negatively affect the mobility and career flexibility of APNs. The evaluation of outcomes related to certified advanced nursing practice must be a research priority in the current climate.

Box 1052, Evergreen, CO 80439 USA","The mechanism of precipitation is an important aspect of any genetic model for Mississippi Valley-type deposits. Yet most of the precipitation mechanisms for minerals in the Mississippi Valley-type association have serious flaws. Solution mixing would require an unlikely series of solutions to account for the various minerals in the ores, and it does not account for the universal occurrence of organic matter in the ores nor for the oxidation state of sulfur in pyrite in the ores. Sulfate reduction addresses some of these problems, but is inconsistent with kinetic data and could not be reversed to account for the oscillations between precipitation and dissolution of sulfide minerals in the ores. Carbon dioxide effervescence does not address the precipitation of most minerals in the ores, and all of the evidence for effervescence may be explained in other ways. Cooling of the mineralizing solution could precipitate many minerals, but fluid inclusion data suggest that, in many deposits, the solution did not cool significantly as any particular stage formed. A credible genetic model also must explain why all of the minerals precipitated at the same sites; any combination of the above mechanisms which suggests that unrelated mechanisms occurred at the same sites by coincidence is unlikely. The most reasonable scenario is that a hot, thiosulfate-bearing mineralizing solution reacted in various ways with organic matter at the sites of mineralization to precipitate the ore minerals. The organic matter acted as a reductant, source of carbon dioxide, source of organic acids, and a substrate for bacterial metabolism of thiosulfate in various stages of mineralization. Thus organic matter links all stages of the mineralization to the same sites. © 1995.",,"carbon dioxide; effervescence; Mississippi Valley type deposit; organic matter; precipitation mechanism; reduction; solution mixing; sulphate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029477884

Results for a prototype 1994 DDC Series 60 were reported in SAE Paper 941020. This paper reports the results from a prototype 1994 Navistar DTA-466 engine equipped with an exhaust catalyst. A set of ten fuels having specific variations in cetane number, aromatics, and oxygen were used to study effects of these fuel properties on emissions. Using glycol diether compounds as an oxygenated additive, selected diesel fuels were treated to obtain 2 and 4 mass percent oxygen. Cetane number was increased for selected fuels using a cetane improver. Emissions were measured during transient FTP operation of the Navistar engine tuned for a nominal 5 g/hp-hr NOx, then repeated using a 4 g/hp-hr NOx calibration. To determine models for estimating fuel effects on emissions, multiple linear regression analysis of the emissions data was conducted. For this catalyst-equipped engine, the models indicated that increasing cetane number reduced HC, CO, and NOx emissions. Increased cetane number reduced PM emissions for the 4 g/hp-hr NOx calibration, but had no statistically significant effect on PM for the 5 g/hp-hr NOx calibration. For both NOx calibrations, increasing aromatic content increased PM emissions, and increasing oxygen reduced PM emissions. THE EFFECTS OF oxygenated diesel fuels and other selected fuel properties on engine emissions have been investigated on engines that meet 1991 and 1994 EPA emissions regulations. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7)* By incorporating engine design changes that control both HC emissions and the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of total particulate emissions, most heavy-duty diesel engines meet the 1994 regulations without using an exhaust aftertreatment device, such as a catalytic converter. For those diesel engines that require the use of a catalytic converter to meet emissions regulations, the relationship between fuel properties and exhaust emissions may be different than engines without a converter. The Coordinating Research Council-Air Pollution Research Advisory Committee (CRC-APRAC) developed the VE-10 Project to investigate the effects of cetane number, aromatic content, and oxygen level on regulated and selected unregulated emissions from a Navistar DTA-466 engine equipped with a catalytic converter. This engine was calibrated for 1994 emission regulations limiting NOx emissions to 5 g/hp-hr and PM to 0.1 g/hp-hr. This engine was adjusted to approach 4 g/hp-hr NOx by retarding fuel injection timing to further investigate fuel effects on emissions for combustion processes limited to lower NOx. Under the VE-10 program, similar test work was performed using a Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) Series 60 engine without a catalyst. Test work on the DDC engine was published in SAE Paper 941020. Conclusions about that engine indicated that increasing cetane number decreased CO and NOx emissions, but had no significant effect on PM emissions. Increasing aromatics increased NOx emissions for the Series 60. Adding oxygen to diesel fuel decreased CO and PM levels, but slightly increased NOx emissions. For purposes of this paper, discussions of emission results and the associated statistical analysis are limited to the Navistar engine. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Calibration; Catalysts; Catalytic converters; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Fuels; Linear regression; Machine design; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Software testing; Detroit diesel corporations; Diesel fuel properties; Emissions regulations; Exhaust aftertreatment; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Multiple linear regression analysis; Oxygenated diesel fuel; Soluble organic fraction; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072430755

For three years, 30 %-70 % blends of RNM and diesel fuel, 50 %-50 % blends and pure ester have been tested on regular bus services as well as on fleets of trucks and light vehicles. At present, in about 60 French cities, some 2,000 vehicles are using 30 % RME and more. Such a large-scale program has given extremely accurate information, leading to nation-wide use. Three fleets have been following a stricter control of lubricating oil and engine deposits with reference vehicles performing the same service on diesel fuel. Chassis dynamometer tests have also enabled a more precise comparison of performance and emissions to be obtained. Fuel consumption, emissions, cold performance, long-term behavior of engine parts and lubricating oil are compared.

In this study, a sensitive measure of physician satisfaction is used to compare physicians working in four types of practice settings: private group practice, solo practice, a closed-pant health maintenance organization (HMO), and a hospital-based practice. Methods. A questionnaire was mailed to all physicians in a four-county area in western Massachusetts, from which 1302 practicing physicians were identified. Based on responses to the questionnaire, the physicians were placed into one of the four practice arrangements. Satisfaction was measured by using an index methodology, with six statistically acceptable measures of satisfaction. Results. All physicians surveyed were most satisfied with the personal and lifestyle factors related to their practice, regardless of practice setting. Those in a private group practice were the most satisfied. However, physicians in an HMO setting were more satisfied with medicine as a profession and less dissatisfied with the state's medical practice climate than physicians in the other practice settings. It appears that HMOs provide professional satisfaction by buffering physicians from the external regulatory climate, permitting them to focus more on patient care. Conclusions. Identifying the factors that cause physician satisfaction and dissatisfaction within the various types of practice settings becomes increasingly important as current health-care reform efforts continue to promote more structured practice environments. More research is needed to identify the various organizations physicians are involved with so that physicians' professional level of satisfaction can be maximized.","job satisfaction; personal satisfaction; physician's practice patterns; Physicians, family","article; clinical practice; group practice; health care organization; health care policy; health maintenance organization; hospital physician; human; job satisfaction; life satisfaction; lifestyle; medical practice; private practice; questionnaire; united states; work environment; Comparative Study; Group Practice; Health Maintenance Organizations; Human; Income; Job Satisfaction; Massachusetts; Personal Satisfaction; Physicians, Family; Private Practice; Professional Practice; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029071888

We have found that the FOX1 steady state mRNA level is repressed by glucose, partially induced by ethanol (but not by raffinose) and fully induced by oleic acid as a carbon source. Glucose repression was observed even if cultures were grown to stationary phase; however, if the glucose supply was limited initially then partial induction of FOX1 mRNA occurred upon growth to high cell density. A variety of mutants are known to affect the glucose repression of many genes, including the FOX3 gene which encodes the thiolase activity in peroxisomal β oxidation. However, upon examination none of these mutants showed de-repression of FOX1 expression. Similarly we investigated the role of two inducers of genes encoding peroxisomal enzymes (namely SNF1 and ADR1). No evidence was found to suggest that either of these plays a significant role in the induction of FOX1 mRNA levels. These observations indicate that the regulation of FOX1 is under the control of as yet unidentified genes involved in catabolite repression and suggest that the regulatory circuit influencing acyl CoA oxidase activity, and hence β oxidation and peroxisome function, is significantly different than that which might have been assumed from other studies. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","β oxidation; FOX1; Glucose repression; Peroxisome","acyl coenzyme a oxidase; alcohol; carbon; glucose; glucose regulated protein; messenger rna; oleic acid; article; cell density; controlled study; fatty acid oxidation; fungal genetics; fungus mutant; gene expression regulation; gene induction; gene repression; nonhuman; peroxisome; priority journal; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Carbon; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Genes, Regulator; Genes, Suppressor; Glucose; Mutation; Oxidoreductases; RNA, Messenger; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028942910

Inferential evidence suggests that sulfate reduction was likely to be a critical process in Fe retention over at least half of the wetland length.

The addition of a supplemental carbon source significantly stimulated both the formation of oxidizable Fe and reducible Fe in the middle and lower wetland regions, but not near the inlet.

The first part outlined the changes in methods of measurement and the range of thermodynamic-property determinations made at Bartlesville since the laboratory was initiated by Hugh M. Huffman in 1943. Emphasis was placed on those changes made in the last decade to aid the laboratory in maintaining its position at the leading-edge of research, while remaining relevant to its product users, the process-design industry. As the twenty-first century draws near, the process-design engineer has added burdens. In the past, the process-design engineer's goal was the design of a safe process, which made the product at an economic cost. Today's environmental regulations which restrict emissions, waste production, etc., are added burdens which need careful attention if maintenance of the economic advantage is to be accomplished. In the second part of the lecture, emphasis was placed on the need for accurate and precise measurements as the basis for new intelligence systems designed to aid the process-design engineer of the twenty-first century. Three case studies were given where calorimetric and statistical-mechanical calculations were used in conjunction to delineate the limitations of the measurements. Topics discussed included the limitations of corresponding states, the virial equation, and statistical-mechanical calculations. Using NIPER DOE Fossil Energy Topical Reports, three examples of the application of the thermochemical and thermophysical property measurements to current problems within the refining industry were discussed. The examples discussed were (i), the level of aromatics in diesel fuel; (ii), the relative reactivity of aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds in hydrodenitrogenation (HDN); and (iii), ""hydrogen shuttling"" in coal liquefaction and heavy-petroleum visbreaking. © 1995 Academic Press.

The intake flow and combustion in a heavy duty DI diesel engine with a dual valve port have been simulated using the computational fluid dynamics code KIVA-3. Variation of the in-cylinder flow field has been achieved by varying the intake valve timing. Variations in the in-cylinder flow, including a range of length scales, degrees of inhomogeneity in a number of scalar and vector quantities, and the persistence of various flow structures, are compared, and their significance to combustion and emissions parameters are assessed. The interaction of fuel spray parameters, particularly spray-wall interaction with structures present in the flow field are evaluated. INCREASINGLY STRICT REQUIREMENTS for NOx and soot emissions continue to drive the effort to improve computational models related to diesel combustion. In recent years, experimental studies and computational modeling work have led to improvements in the emissions performance of diesel engines as well as advancements of the models themselves. One particularly interesting and difficult problem in optimizing diesel engines is the simultaneous reduction of NO and soot emissions. Recently, a number of important advancements have been in areas such as the understanding and modeling of high pressure fuel spray behavior, autoignition, fuel droplet combustion, NOx production, and soot production and oxidation. Researchers have been successful using combined experimental and computational approaches to accurately measure and reproduce trends in emissions behavior [1]. Further, modeling efforts have been instrumental in suggesting strategies for simultaneously reducing soot and NO emissions [2]. It has been known for many years that intake flow has important effects on the combustion behavior and emissions performance in diesel engines. For example, in small direct-injected (DI) diesel engines, swirl can increase the rate of fuel-air mixing, reducing the combustion duration at retarded injection timings [3]. Swirl interaction with compression induced squish flow increases turbulence levels in the combustion bowl, promoting mixing [4]. On the other hand, it has been shown that there exists a level of swirl beyond which the fuel-air mixing in the piston can actually be diminished due to adverse swirl-squish interaction [5]. In addition, creation of excess swirl can also diminish engine efficiency due to increased pumping losses. It is now possible to compute intake flow in detail, including the effects of moving intake valves. Examples of such simulations include the modeling of intake flow through a dual valve port in a heavy-duty industrial diesel engine [6] and of flow in a 4 valve per cylinder direct injected gasoline engine [7]. Previous work has also focused on the effects on fuel spray of changes in the in-cylinder flow field generated by changes in the piston bowl geometry [8]. A further step in understanding intake flows through modeling is to study their effect on combustion. The availability of higher performance computers and CFD codes with advanced grid structure has made detailed modeling of intake flow and its effect on fuel-air mixing a reality. In addition, modeling of the effect of intake flow on global combustion parameters, such as heat release rate, average pressure, and average turbulent kinetic energy has been performed in both diesel [9] and spark ignited engines [10]. Pollutant formation and oxidation processes are very dependent on local conditions such as temperature and species densities. For this reason, detailed studies of the effect of intake generated in-cylinder flow on emissions performance need to emphasize local flow details in addition to cylinder averaged quantities. In this work, we attempt to relate the emissions performance of a heavy duty dual port DI diesel engine to changes in the intake flow. Table 1 gives operating parameters for the Caterpillar 3406 single cylinder engine. Differences in the intake flow are accomplished by varying the intake valve lift profiles. Because the formation of pollutants occurs at length scales smaller than the dimensions of the combustion chamber, we compare flow field details at several length scales. Since details of the intake flow field are often dissipated prior to fuel injection, the persistence of structures in the flow field during the compression stroke is also assessed. In the next section, details of the models used as well as the methods used to analyze the flow field details are given. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air engines; Air intakes; Combustion chambers; Computation theory; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational methods; Direct injection; Engine cylinders; Engine pistons; Flow fields; Fuels; Intake valves; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Mixing; Nitrogen oxides; Pistons; Pollution; Soot; Advanced grid structures; Computational approach; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Fuel droplet combustion; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Performance and emissions; Simultaneous reduction; Turbulent kinetic energy; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072433393

However, the results of an emissions inspection program started in British Columbia in 1992 indicate that this is not usually the case. The study reported in this paper addresses two questions which arose from these results: 'Why do propane and natural gas vehicles fail the inspection in such large numbers?' and 'What needs to be done to fix the problem?' The project comprises three phases. Phase one is to establish the profile of the alternative fuel vehicle fleet in the Province; the way in which they usually fail emissions inspection; the types of repairs received after failing; and the effectiveness of those repairs in reducing emissions. Phase two is to formulate general repair stategies which can be applied in the great majority of cases and therefore effectively become recognized by government agencies, the conversion industry, and the repair industry. The desire is to achieve the maximum emissions reduction benefit as effectively as possible, for as many vehicles as possible, all within acceptable costs. Phase three will be full implementation of vehicle upgrade requirements throughout the Province. This is scheduled to start January 1996 in the Lower Fraser Valley, and expand to the whole province in July 1996.

Our goal is to characterize these fundamental properties, which are critical to the understanding of retinal and other ophthalmic damage produced by ultrashort laser pulses. Laser pulses of 5.0 nanoseconds (ns) at less than 5.0 milli-Joules (mJ) per pulse and pulses of 80 picoseconds (ps) at 0.5 to 1 .5 mJ per pulse from a Nd:YAG regenerative amplifier were used to produce LIB in a variety of aqueous media. These include physiological saline solution, triple-distilled water, and tap water. The resulting luminescent plasmas were analyzed using integrated light spectroscopy from a Chromex 0.25 meter (m) spectrograph. Plasmas were recorded in the wavelength region from 300 to 900 nm. Each spectrum obtained was analyzed using a Planck distribution for blackbody emission. The surface temperatures of the plasmas for the two pulse durations were computed to be in the 5000 K to 10,000 K range, depending on the pulse duration and energy. Also, the spectrographs from the saline solution included distinct spectral lines of emission over the broad band spectra, such as the 589 nm atomic emission line of sodium. We will discuss the time-integrated spectroscopy of LIB in the various solutions, and how LIB might mediate retinal damage induced by ultrashort laser pulses. © 1995 SPIE.

Along with the emission regulations comes the difficulty of establishing a set of standard test procedures which allow engine manufacturers and regulatory agencies to compare emissions data based on similar test methods. In order to remedy this problem, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has come up with an exhaust measurement procedure, ISO 8178, that can be applied worldwide to off-highway heavy-duty diesel engines, (2). The ISO 8178 procedure is based on steady-state operating modes combined with weighting factors that together represent a cycle for a specific engine application. The ISO 8178 test procedure allows the exhaust emissions to be sampled with either a full flow dilute or raw sampling system. However, the preferred sampling systems are the raw gaseous and mini dilution tunnel (MDT) particulate measurement methods. The main concern of these sampling systems is the demonstration of equivalency to the full flow dilution system that is currently used for the certification of on-highway heavy-duty diesel engines. Using an in-house full flow dilution system and a recently built raw gaseous emissions bench along with a pre-existing MDT, this research was conducted to find the correlation between the two sampling systems. For the gaseous emissions of HC, NOx) and CO the correlation between the raw and full dilution sampling systems was within 7.0%, 3.0%, and 1.0% respectively.

The authors have studied the vegetational history of this ecosystem in relation to climate change during the late Quaternary through stable carbon isotope analysis of peat deposits as indicators of C3 or C4 plant types. Grasslands (of C4 type) were predominant during the last glacial maximum (20-18 kyr BP) and again during 6-3.5 kyr BP, while forest and possibly C3 grassland expanded during the deglaciation, attaining their peak distribution at 10 kyr BP. The shift in C3 and C4 plant types seems related to changes in moisture and atmospheric CO2, with lower moisture and CO2 levels favouring the later plant types. The oscillating climate and vegetation has influenced the structure and composition of the montane ecosytem. Plant diversity of the near-pristine montane forests is relatively lower than other comparable sites in the neotropics. Implications of global change on the tropical montane ecosystem, in particular the composition of the angiosperm and vertebrate communities, are discussed. In particular, an expansion of montane forest and replacement of C4 with C3 grassland can be expected. Human impact on the natural vegetation such as conversion of grasslands to monoculture plantations of wattle and eucalypts may, however, interfere with natural succession caused by global climate change. Endemic mammals such as the Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius would face increased risk of extinction. -from Authors",,"C3; C4; climatic change; eucalypt; grassland; montane ecosystem; Nilgiri tahr; Quaternary; succession; wattle; India; Western Ghats; Eucalyptus; Hemitragus hylocrius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029510135

One of the principal models used throughout Europe and North America for such assessment is the Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC). All watershed models are simplified representations of reality, and as such require careful testing to establish their veracity prior to use for making policy projections. This is particularly true where the use of these model projections has the potential for serious environmental or economic consequences. During the past five years, we have tested the MAGIC model in a large variety of settings and under quite varying environmental conditions. This work has included comparing model hindcast simulations with diatom-inferences of historical acidification, sensitivity analyses to examine the response of the model to alternative assumptions and formulations, and detailed testing of model forecasts by comparing simulated chemistry with the results of catchment-scale and plot-scale experimental acidification and deacidification. Our analyses have elucidated a number of potentially-important deficiencies in model structure and method of application. These have resulted in changes to the model and its calibration procedures. Our work has included in-depth evaluation of issues related to regional aggregation of soils data, background sulfur deposition, natural organic acidity, and aluminum mobilization. The result has been an improved and more thoroughly-tested version of MAGIC. The process we have followed to improve and confirm the MAGIC model has been iterative and time consuming. It required the availability of large volumes of data from experimental manipulation and paleolimnological studies. We believe that such model testing and confirmation efforts should be a critical prerequisite for regional or national assessment activities that are based largely on the results of environmental models. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","acid deposition; acidification; model testing; modeling","Acid deposition; Acidification; Atmospheric pollutants; Environmental models; Model testing; Paleolimnology; Acid rain; Mathematical models; Nitrogen; Regional planning; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Sulfur; Surface waters; Water pollution; Air pollution control; acid; aluminum; base; sulfur; acid rain; acidification; conference paper; lake; model; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029635836

Regardless of the CO2 concentration during growth, all cells had the capacity to transport both CO2 and HCOinf3su-; however, the activity of HCOinf3su- transport was more than twofold higher than CO2 transport even in cyanobacteria grown at high concentration of inorganic carbon (Ci = CO2 + HCOinf3su-). In low-Ci cells, the affinities of CO2 and HCOinf3su- transport for their substrates were about 5 (CO2 uptake) and 10 (HCOinf3su- uptake) times higher than in high-Ci cells, while air-grown cells formed an intermediate state. For the same cells, the intracellular accumulated Ci pool reached 18, 32 and 55 mM in high-Ci, air-grown and low-Ci cells, respectively, when measured at 1 mM external Ci. Photosynthetic O2 evolution, maximal CO2 and HCOinf3su- transport activities, and consequently their relative contribution to photosynthesis, were largely unaffected by the CO2 provided during growth. When the cells were adapted to freshwater medium, results similar to those for artificial seawater were obtained for all CO2 concentrations. Transport studies with high-Ci cells revealed that CO2 and HCOinf3su- uptake were equally inhibited when CO2 fixation was reduced by the addition of glycolaldehyde. In contrast, in low-Ci cells steady-state CO2 transport was preferably reduced by the same inhibitor. The inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase ethoxyzolamide inhibited both CO2 and HCOinf3su- uptake as well as O2 evolution in both cell types. In high-Ci cells, the degree of inhibition was similar for HCOinf3su- transport and O2 evolution with 50% inhibition occurring at around 1 mM ethoxyzolamide. However, the uptake of CO2 was much more sensitive to the inhibitor than HCOinf3su- transport, with an apparent I50 value of around 250 μM ethoxyzolamide for CO2 uptake.

C1-carbon-13 isotope effects obtained by direct measurement with 99% Relabeled substrate, which permits determination of the isotope effect on both k/B and k, give 13 (k/B) = 1.010 ± 0.008 and 13k = 1.019 ± 0.008. These are similar to the effects with SCPDC and show that decarboxylation is about 20% rate-limiting at low pyruvate levels and about 40% rate-limiting at high pyruvate levels. From these values, the rate constants for individual events in the catalytic cycle can be estimated (to within about a factor of 2) for ZMPDC: addition of pyruvate to the enzyme, 8 x 105 M-1 s-1; off-reaction of pyruvate, 300 s-1; decarboxylation, 1200 s-1; product release, 750 s–1. Solvent isotope effects are small and normal (k/B[HOH]/k/B[DOD] = 1.25 ± 0.05, k[HOH]/ k[DOD] = 1.30 ± 0.01), in strong contrast to those for SCPDC (e.g., an inverse isotope effect of 2 on k/B), which were considered to arise from sulfhydryl-addition reactions coupled to regulation. The proton inventories for ZMPDC are also quite different from those for SCPDC. The overall picture suggests that ZMPDC possesses a similar chemical mechanism but somewhat greater catalytic power than SCPDC because of both stronger uniform binding of all states and greater specific stabilization of transition states relative to reactant states. Thus introduction of the regulatory features of SCPDC is coincident with a reduction in catalytic power. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

The relationships between potential oxidation and probable controlling environmental factors, such as water table depth, soil temperature and pore-water methane concentrations were also examined. Finally, the relationship between potential methane oxidation and the rate of net methane emission was evaluated. Potential methane oxidation ranged between 0.0 and 4.7 μg CH4 g-1 wet peat h-1, and the areal estimates for the 0-40 cm depth interval ranged between 0.04 and 16 g CH4 m-2 d-1. The depth of maximal potential oxidation was correlated with the depth of the water table (r2 = 0.64). Most communities showed a positive relationship between average rate of potential methane oxidation and water table depth (r2 = 0.66), i.e. the greater the vertical extension of aerated surface peat, the higher the methane oxidation capacity. In non-waterlogged communities (water table more than 5 cm below the vegetation surface), a positive correlation was found between the potential oxidation and methane concentration in peat pore-water (r2 = 0.44). These results suggest that the supplies of methane and oxygen largely control the biomass of methanotrophs across plant communities. Overall, net methane emission rates were negatively, but only weakly, correlated with the potential oxidation, suggesting that aerobic oxidation often controls emission rates from comparatively dry communities of Sphagnum peatlands, but that other factors also influence the emission. © 1995.",,"biogeochemistry; greenhouse gas; methane oxidation; oxygen; peatland; sphagnum; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028993634

Demineralization was so effective in enhancing the reactivity in the low-temperature region that 4 wt% iron loading gave a conversion of 90 wt% at 700°C. The increased catalytic effect of iron in the absence of wood ash can be explained by the formation of finer metallic iron particles during the gasification. The loss in the catalytic activity of iron due to calcium and silica as the main ash components was investigated by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is proposed that calcium and silica form calcium iron oxides and iron silicates during carbonization, inhibiting the reduction of iron oxide to metal with catalytic activity at low temperatures. However, the ash plays quite a different role at higher temperatures. Its presence was beneficial for the formation of catalytically active metallic iron, whereas demineralized char rapidly lost reactivity in this region, owing to accelerated sintering of metallic iron particles. © 1995.","hydrogasification; iron catalyst; wood char","Calcium; Carbonization; Catalyst activity; Coal ash; Iron; Low temperature effects; Particles (particulate matter); Silica; Silicates; Sintering; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Birch char; Chemical reactivity; Demineralization; Hydrogasification; Coal gasification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029255241

The potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the ion-pair formation reaction (M + CO2 → M+CO2-) show that the ground state MCO2 complex has a van der Waals (vdW) character (M · CO2) at the entrance region in the reaction and an ionic one (M+CO2-) at short MC distances and that the activation barrier is found at the intermediate region between the vdW and ion-pair states. The wavefunctions of the ion-pair for the low-lying excited states are obtained by the multireference single and double excitation configuration interaction (MR-SD-CI) method.

The cyclic change of ovarian 3α-HSD activity towards 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) as a substrate was characterized by two peaks. The first peak occurred at 0800 h on proestrus; then the reductase activity decreased and reached its minimum at 2000 h on proestrus. Thereafter, it gradually increased, reaching the second peak (170% of the value at 2000 h on proestrus) at noon of estrus. Quantitative analysis by immunoblotting revealed that the alteration in 3α- HSD content in the rat ovary during the estrous cycle was essentially similar to that in 5α-DHT reductase activity. Changes in the reductase activities towards 5α-androstane-3,17-dione and 5α-DHT and in the dehydrogenase activity towards androsterone in the ovary were entirely different from those in the 5α-DHT reductase activity and 3α-HSD content; on the other hand, the change in carbonyl reductase activity towards p-nitroacetophenone was similar to changes in 5α-DHT reductase activity and 3α-HSD content. Therefore, ρ- nitroacetophenone may be a useful substrate, instead of 5α-DHT, for detection of 3α-HSD activity at a high sensitivity, since the ρ- nitroacetophenone reductase activity was 10-fold higher than the 5α-DHT reductase activity.

In the same year, we developed and marketed small and medium duty trucks which were equipped with PM reduction systems that oxidize soluble organic fraction (SOF) contained in the PM, in order to satisfy these new regulations. Prior to their marketing, a catalyst was selected from among several types of candidate catalysts. Durability tests were performed using a catalytic converter-equipped small duty truck to verify the durability of the chosen catalyst. The durability test course was set up combining urban areas and expressways in the southern part of California, U.S.A. The cumulative total distance covered on the test course reached 200,000 km. During the durability test, the catalyst was evaluated by measurement of PM emission using a chassis dynamometer. After the durability tests, the catalyst was taken out of the converter muffler. Then microstructural changes in the catalyst were studied by use of various analytical methods. The results of these tests convinced us of catalyst's durability and ability to maintain SOF reduction. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Catalysts; Catalytic converters; Commerce; Dynamometers; Emission control; Particulate emissions; Trucks; Chassis dynamometers; Diesel emission control; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Diesel particulate matters; Global environment; Microstructural changes; Reduction systems; Soluble organic fraction; Durability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072427656

The activity of Cu-ZSM-5 for NOx reduction with hydrocarbons decreased when heated above 600°C in a simulated net oxidixing exhaust gas.27Al and29Si nuclear magnetic resonance results revealed that a dealumination of the zeolite occurs in the deactivated Cu-ZSM-5. Electron spin reonance (ESR) results indicated that aggregation of copper ions did not occur and copper remained as isolated ions in Cu-ZSM-5 even after the deactivation. The ESR spectra of dehydrated Cu-ZSM-5 suggested the migration of copper ions in the zeolite after the deactivation. To investigate the interactions between copper ions and NO/C3H6, the ESR spectra were measured after exposure to nitric oxide and propene. The ESR results indicated that the oxidation state and coordination structure of the copper ions were changed by the adsorption of nitric oxide or propene in active Cu-ZSM-5. On the other hand, no such reaction was observed in the deactivated Cu-ZSM-5. In the deactivated Cu-ZSM-5, copper ions remain atomically dispersed but cannot interact with nitric oxide or propene. In conclusion, the deactivation of Cu-ZSM-5 is suggested to occur through the migration of copper ions to sites where gas molecules like nitric oxide and propene cannot reach them. This migration is triggered by the dealumination of the zeolite. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

In marine sediments, fine‐grained magnetite with large surface area to volume is thought to be preferentially removed during magnetic mineral reduction. On the basis of new magnetic hysteresis, low‐temperature, and geochemical studies of pelagic sediments from the western equatorial Pacific Ocean, it is proposed that reduction processes increase rather than deplete the ultra‐fine magnetic grain population. At the modern Fe‐redox boundary enhanced superparamagnetism coincides with a coarsening of remanence‐carrying grains. Superparamagnetism also tracks proposed temporal changes in magnetite reduction caused by climatically‐driven fluctuations in organic carbon (Corg) supply. Together with hysteresis characteristics, changes in superparamagnetism may help the identification of paleointensity artifacts resulting from non steady‐state magnetic mineral reduction.

The primary driving forces are lighter weight finished components, integrated designs, improved isolation of engine noise, improved materials systems, and matured manufacturing processes for composite materials. Thermoset-based composite materials, particularly those based on high-temperature resistant epoxy vinyl ester matrices, offer improved performance with respect to thermoplastic and thermoset polyester-based composites and can be manufactured using different processing methods. This paper presents the current state-of-the-art design, engineering and optimization techniques for engine closure systems. The performance requirements of different systems such as valve covers and oil pans are explained in detail. Techniques for long-term structural stiffness evaluation, vibration performance assessment and noise transmission estimation are described. The paper also shows the material characterization required to develop design allowables for long-term, high-temperature composite applications. Definitions of design allowables and examples for thermoset-based composites are also included. COMPOSITE ENGINE CLOSURE SYSTEMS such as valve covers, oil pans and timing chain covers offer several advantages over systems based on traditional materials, including cast aluminum and stamped steel. Composite systems can provide the same design flexibility as cast aluminum at a lower total cost. Unlike stamped steel systems, features such as brackets, bosses, tubes, grooves and lettering may be integrated into the part without additional fabrication or machining. This design flexibility also allows noise emission reduction and parts consolidation opportunities such as providing structural support for other engine compartment components. Since composites typically have half the strength and one-fifth the stiffness of aluminum, the composite closure systems require detailed global and local engineering analyses during the design process to provide acceptable deflections and stresses upon static and dynamic loadings during long-term exposure to under-the-hood conditions.

A tracheostomy, arterial catheter, and epidural electrodes were inserted and pigs were maintained under ketamine anesthesia. After baseline recordings, seizures were induced with a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) bolus and a 20 min infusion (5-6 mg/kg/min). After 10 min of PTZ infusion, randomly assigned animals received diazepam (D; N = 7; 0.5 mg/kg), lorazepam (L; N = 7; 0.2 mg/kg), or 0.9% saline (C; N = 7; controls) by rapid peripheral vein injection. Minute ventilation (Ve), Pa(CO2), and the pressure change in response to airway occlusion at end-expiration (P0.1) were measured at standard intervals. All groups had comparable increases in respiratory drive during untreated seizures. Changes in Ve and P0.1 were reduced to at or below baseline values in groups D and L, but not C, from 2 to 45 min after treatment (P &lt; 0.05). No significant changes were observed in Pa(CO2) after either intervention. Following anticonvulsants, the cumulative duration of seizures was significantly reduced in L and D groups, compared to C (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that increases in respiratory drive occur during tonic-clonic seizures induced with PTZ.

Current methods of land suitability evaluation are qualitative and rely on the experience of the land resource surveyor and local precedent. Consequently, where local precedent is lacking, as in marginal areas, current methods are considered less reliable and quantitative data from simulation studies will be useful. Using this process, the significance of key components of the systems (climate, plant available water capacity, soil nitrate and soil loss hazard) were quantified.

Net photosynthesis at growth CO2 partial pressures increased with increasing CO2 for C3 plants, but not C4 plants. Net photosynthesis of Abutilon at 15 Pa CO2 was 70% less than that of plants grown at 35 Pa CO2, due to greater stomatal and biochemical limitations at 15 Pa CO2. Relative stomatal limitation (RSL) of Abutilon at 15 Pa CO2 was nearly 3 times greater than at 35 Pa CO2. A photosynthesis model was used to estimate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco) activity (Vcmax), electron transport mediated RuBP regeneration capacity (Jmax), and phosphate regeneration capacity (PiRC) in Abutilon from net photosynthesis versus intercellular CO2 (A-Ci) curves. All three component processes decreased by approximately 25% in Abutilon grown at 15 Pa compared with 35 Pa CO2. Abutilon grown at 15 Pa CO2 had significant reductions in total rubisco activity (25%), rubisco content (30%), activation state (29%), chlorophyll content (39%), N content (32%), and starch content (68%) compared with plants grown at 35 Pa CO2. Greater allocation to rubisco relative to light reaction components and concomitant decreases in Jmax and PiRC suggest co-regulation of biochemical processes occurred in Abutilon grown at 15 Pa CO2. There were no significant differences in photosynthesis or leaf properties in Abutilon grown at 27 Pa CO2 compared with 35 Pa CO2, suggesting that the rise in CO2 since the beginning of the industrial age has had little effect on the photosynthetic performance of Abutilon. For Amaranthus, limitations of photosynthesis were balanced between stomatal and biochemical factors such that net photosynthesis was similar in all CO2 treatments. Differences in photosynthetic response to growth over a wide range of CO2 partial pressures suggest changes in the relative performance of C3 and C4 annuals as atmospheric CO2 has fluctuated over geologic time. © 1995 Springer Verlag.","Abutilon theophrasti; Amaranthus retroflexus; Low CO2; Photosynthesis; Rubisco",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029168699

The ML intensity is maximum for 20% CdS contents in the (Zn, Cd)S phosphors due to increase in hardness which may in turn increase the fracture stress and subsequently the piezoelectric field strength. The wavelength corresponding to the peak of both the ML and PL spectra shift towards longer wavelength with increasing CdS contents.

The associated reduction of the damage due to conventional air pollution is higher in the richer countries in both absolute and relative terms. The costs of climatic change are relatively higher (but absolute lower) in the developing countries. Prime impacts are on agriculture (in the developing world) and human health (highly valued in the developed world). Costs of emission reduction and climatic change are joined in a nine region, quasi-Ramsey, integrated climate-economy model, called FUND, The first calculations with this model show that the (hardly known) dynamics of climate change and the great uncertainties play a critical role, that free riding behaviour need not be as prominent a problem as is generally believed, and that international capital transfers do not seem to substantially influence the optimal emission control, as the regions most interested in climate change do not have much capital to transfer.

NO emission is highly dependent on stoichiometric ratio of air to the fuel while the large dead volume in the pressure vessel tends to interfere the quick load change. Therefore, 2MWth PFBC combustion test unit has been operated to investigate load change characteristics of PFBC power generation plants. 1) In the steady-state operations, a wide variety of coal was successfully burned by the 2MWth PFBC test unit. Coal burnout and SO2 capture exceeded 99% and 90%, respectively while NO emission was kept less than 150ppm. 2) In order to meet more stringent NO reduction, NH3 was injected into the freeboard of the fluidized bed combustor. NH3 injection reduced NO emission to as low as 70ppm at the full load. 3) Delay of air feed response was realized by the on-line calculation of the pressure vessel model by the work station. This work station also calculated the performance of the PFBC test unit as a power generation plant. 4) PFBC combustion model including NO reaction kinetics was proposed. The model was demonstrated by comparing the calculated results with the observed data. 5) During the load change, the amount of NH3 injected was controlled by two different method. In one method, the amount of NH3 was controlled based on the actual NO measurement at the stack while, in the other method, based on the estimated NO emission by the combustion model.",,"Air; Ammonia; Desulfurization; Fuels; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Pilot plants; Pressure vessels; Pressurization; Reaction kinetics; Sulfur dioxide; Thermodynamic properties; Coal burnout; Coal fired power plants; Nitrogen oxide reduction; Steady state operations; Thermal efficiency; Fluidized bed combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029217037

Because of common volcanism throughout the region, ash is a major component of the sediment where it is not diluted by continental detritus. Dissolution of glass, olivine, pyroxene and amphiboles occurs rapidly (within 1 Ma), followed by formation of a variety of clay and zeolite minerals. Simultaneously, pore fluid compositions change greatly: Ca+2, CI- and Br- concentrations increase whereas the concentration of Mg and values for the ∂18O of the pore water decrease. The formation of authigenic clay and zeolite minerals reduces permeability in the sediments and retards diffusive exchange with seawater, allowing large concentration gradients to develop in the pore fluids. In the Japan Sea, high productivity in the Middle Miocene produced silica rich deposits (app. 80% SiO2), but nonetheless, the abundance of silica was insufficient to form thick sections of bedded chert. High productivity also provides a large source of barium to the sediments, which is remobilized and concentrated as barite deposits at the base of the sulfate reduction zone. Authigenic carbonate is common throughout the western Pacific. The shift from a predominance of rhodochrosite to dolomite reflects increasing bottom water oxygenation of the Japan Sea in the Middle Miocene. In the Sulu Sea, 13C-depleted dolomites form from terrestrial organic matter deposited in turbidites. © 1995 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0007726056

Two isomeric forms of the CO2-aluminosilicate complexes have been considered: (1) ""CO2-like"" complexes, in which the CO2 group is bound through carbon to a bridging oxygen and (2) ""CO3-like"" complexes, in which two oxygens of a central CO3 group form bridging bonds to the two TH3 groups. The CO2-like isomer of CO2-H3SiOSiH3 is quite weakly bonded and its 13C isotropic NMR shielding is almost identical to that in free CO2. As Si is progressively replaced by Al in the -H terminated aluminosilicate model, the CO2-like isomers show increasing distortion from the free CO2 geometry and their 13C NMR shieldings decrease uniformly. The calculated 13C shielding value for H3AlO(CO2)AlH3-2 is only about 6 ppm larger than that calculated for point charge stabilized CO3-2. However, for a geometry of H3SiO(CO2) AlH3-1, in which the bridging oxygen to C bond length has been artificially increased to that found in the -OH terminated cluster (OH)3SiO(CO2)Al(OH)3-1, the calculated 13C shielding is almost identical to that for free CO2. The CO3-like isomers of the CO2-aluminosili-cate complexes show carbonate like geometries and 13C NMR shieldings about 4-9 ppm larger than those of carbonate for all T,T′ pairs. For the Si,Si tetrahedral atom pair the CO2-like isomer is more stable energetically, while for the Si,Al and Al,Al cases the CO3-like isomer is more stable. Addition of Na+ ions to the CO3-2 or H3AlO(CO2)AlH3-2 complexes reduces the 13C NMR shieldings by about 10 ppm. Complexation with either Na+ or CO2 also reduces the 29Si NMR shieldings of the aluminosilicate models, while the changes in 27Al shielding with Na+ or CO2 complexation are much smaller. Complexation with CO2 greatly increases the electric field gradient at the bridging oxygen of H3AlOAlH3-2, raising it to a value similar to that found for SiOSi linkages. Comparison of these results with the experimental 13C NMR spectra support the formation of CO2-like complexes at SiOSi bridges in albite glasses and CO3-like complexes at SiOAl and AlOAl bridges in albite and nepheline glasses. Changes in the calculated shieldings as Na+ ions are added to the complexes suggest that some of the observed complexes may be similar in their CO2-aluminosilicate interactions, but different with respect to the positions of the charge-compensating Na+ ions. © 1995.",,"aluminosilicate; carbon dioxide; crystal chemistry; crystal structure; NMR; shielding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028864883

Compared to the previous model of Yung et al. (1984, Astrophys. J. Suppl. 55, 465-506), the most significant recent change in the reactions used is the updated methane photodissociation scheme (Mordaunt et al. 1993, J. Chem. Phys. 98(3), 2054-2065). Moreover, the transfer of the solar radiation in the atmosphere and the photolysis rates have been calculated by using a Monte Carlo code. Finally, the eddy diffusion coefficient profile is adjusted in order to fit the mean vertical distribution of HCN retrieved from millimeter groundbased observations of Tanguy et al. (1990, Icarus, 85, 43-57) using new values for the boundary flux of atomic nitrogen (Strobel et al. 1992, Icarus 100, 512-526). We have run the model in both steady-state and diurnal modes, with 62 species involved in 249 reactions. There is little difference between diurnal and steady-state results. Overall our results are in a closer agreement with the abundances inferred from the Voyager infrared measurements at the equator than the Yung et al. results. We find that the catalytic scheme for H recombination invoked by Yung et al. only slightly improves the model results and we conclude that this scheme is not essential to fit observations. © 1995 Academic Press.

Emission occurs in a nonuniform medium when the local dispersion relation of the collective wave is satisfied. This is a form of resonance crossing. Using the Weyl symbol calculus, a local expansion of the collective wave equation driven by the particle source is derived in the neighborhood of the crossing. The collective wave dispersion manifold and the gyroballistic wave dispersion manifold can be used as a pair of local coordinates in the neighborhood of the resonance crossing, which greatly simplifies the analysis. This change of representation is carried out using a metaplectic transform (a generalization of the fourier transform). The Wigner function of the emitted wave field is then computed in the new coordinates. The Wigner function is a phase space scalar, hence the numerical value is invariant under linear canonical transformations. This invariance is invoked to finally arrive at the Wigner function in the original (physical) coordinates. The wave-action and energy emission rates are then computed from the Wigner function. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038397902

Visual observations were made, and sediment samples collected and analysed to elucidate the nature of the sedimentary regime. In the upper part of the canyon (480-940 m water depth) sediments consisted of a mixture of terrigenous quartz rich silts and sands, skeletal carbonate of benthonic and planktonic origin and minor clay minerals and authigenic dolomite. There were localised Lophelia pertusa coral thickets on both the flanks and floor of the canyon. Sedimentary structures and physical measurements revealed there to be active transport of sediments in the canyon down to a depth of at least 940 m, effected by (?tidal) reversing currents and bioturbation. In these parts of the canyon, deposits around glacial dropstones and coral thickets indicate that there has been a maximum of 0-1 m of net sediment accumulation since the last glacial period. At 3000 m water depth, in the channel system, the sediments were fine calcareous ooze with a drape (up to 0-3 m thick) of flocculant phytoplankton detritus. At these depths, there was no evidence for present-day sediment resuspension by currents. © 1995, Royal Society of Edinburgh.

A check-list was filled out for each household that had at least one child aged 5 years or less; the list recorded conditions of crowding, roofing materials, house ventilation, cooking fuels and cooking place, family income and immunization status. Cross-tabulation tables were prepared and Chi-square values calculated for the various forms of ARI and environmental characteristics. Significance level was put at 5% (p = < 0.05). Using standard tables, significant associations were found between ARI diagnosed at the examination of a child and the following: number of persons per house (p = 0.01); bed sharing (p = 0.027); house ventilation (p = > 0.01) and; presence or absence of a smoke vent in a house (p = 0.002). Crowding and increased indoor air-pollution were rife in Ugandan Army camps and seem to have contributed to the local incidence of ARI in children. It is recommended that health education activities be started to promote improved environmental sanitation and to reduce crowding.

The Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission (OC Transpo) has an interest in reducing emissions from older transit buses in their fleet. Eight Donaldson particulate trap systems were installed on transit buses. The purpose of the work, involving four different bus/engine combinations, was to assess the practicality and benefits of particulate traps in transit applications.

Thus, a computer program has been developed that can automatically construct the potential-pH diagram and calculate the solubility of corrosion product at elevated temperatures for Metal-CO2/H2S-H2O system. The partial pressure of CO2 or H2S gas in this program was used as the input parameter because that can be measured in laboratory tests and actual fields. The thermodynamic data of H2CO3 and H2S (aq) were used in the program, since chemical species such as H2CO3HCO3 _ and C03 2- are produced when CO2 or H2S gas dissolved are thermodynamically in the equilibrium state. Then, the corrosion of pure iron in CO2 environments was discussed based on the potential-pH diagram for Fe-CO2-H2O system and the solubility of FeCO3. The solubility decreased as the temperature increased, and the pure iron showed the maximum corrosion rate because the FeCO3 film was partially produced on metal surface around 100° C, and then the corrosion rate decreased above 150° C because of the protective FeCO3 film layer. Finally, the solubility of FeS in Fe-H2S-H20 system is very low compared with that of Fe-CO3and the corrosion rate of the pure iron was also low at 60 and 100° C, but that increased above 150° C. In this case, the phase transition of FeS from α to β was an important factor. © 1995, Japan Society of Corrosion Engineering.

If the catalyst is effective in reducing the activation energy of adsorption of NO, the chemisorption process occurs at low temperatures and is not accompanied by the formation of surface oxides. Both N2 and N2O can be produced at low temperatures. Severe catalyst deactivation is observed, however, under these conditions, which are characterized by oxygen accumulation on the surface. The transfer of oxygen from the oxidized catalytic site to the carbon is crucial for maintaining high steady-state catalytic activity. Upon restoration of the reduced catalytic site, the remaining kinetically significant reactions are characterized by the oxygen–carbon reaction. The mechanism is analogous to one of the mechanisms postulated for the selective catalytic reduction by hydrocarbons and to that of alkali- and alkaline-earth-catalyzed gasification of carbon. © 1995, Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957097078

Some of these methane-rich fluids are near critical and may contain significant amounts of high molecular weight hydrocarbons. These features make it particularly difficult to study their thermodynamic behaviour, as well from an experimental as from a theoretical point of view. As such contrasted mixtures have not been extensively studied in the literature, we have also started data acquisition on synthetic mixtures. Compared with real fluids, synthetic mixtures allow indeed a more reliable test of thermodynamic models because their composition is much better controlled. Four synthetic gas condensates containing 6 or 7 components have been investigated in a visual cell to show the sensitivity of phase equilibria with respect to small quantities of heavy alkanes (nC36) and aromatics (phenanthrene). A very large sensitivity has been found, since addition of about 1% mol. of a heavy hydrocarbon may increase dew pressures by 200 bar in some cases. Crystallization of heavy hydrocarbons has been observed for temperatures 10-30 °C lower than pure component melting temperatures. These features have been modelled, using the Peng-Robinson equation of state for fluid phases. As a general feature, the Peng-Robinson EOS reproduces adequately the phase envelope of these fluids with regressed interaction parameters between methane and the heaviest hydrocarbon. However, prediction of liquid dropout is unsatisfactory. A simple model of crystallization has been used to predict appearance of solid from gas, which accounts for solid state transitions. This model accounts fairly well for phenanthrene or nC36 crystallization at high pressure. © 1995.","Data; Experiments; Hydrocarbons; Mixtures; Solid-gas; Solid-liquid; VLE high pressure","Equilibria; Multiphase Flow; Reservoir Fluids; Reservoirs; Crystallization; Equations of state; High pressure effects; High temperature effects; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Mixtures; Petroleum reservoirs; Phase equilibria; Phase transitions; Solid solutions; Thermodynamic properties; High pressure-high temperature reservoir fluids; Liquid dropout; Peng-Robinson equation; Solid state transitions; Solid-gas phase; Solid-liquid phase; Synthetic condensate gases; Gas condensates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029390674

The study of dispersed angiosperm cuticles originated prior to World War II and has focused on the origin and paleoecology of coal. Activity in dispersed cuticles reached a high point during the 1950s and 1960s with the study of Tertiary lignites in central Europe, then subsided in central Europe as workers from other regions expanded the technique to other time-periods and geographic regions. Data from dispersed cuticles augment data from palynomorphs because dispersed cuticles originate from a different generation of the vascular plant life cycle and have different taphonomic histories. Because the analysis of dispersed angiosperm cuticles is unfamiliar to many geologists, methods for the analysis and preparation of dispersed angiosperm cuticles are detailed in an appendix. Dispersed cuticle assemblages from coals in the upper Albian Longford Member of the Kiowa Formation and the Maastrichtian-Paleocene Raton Formation of the Southern Western Interior provide new constraints on the times that angiosperms entered coal swamps and rose to dominance. The Kiowa assemblages indicate that angiosperms first entered coal swamp environments by the late Albian, while the Raton assemblages indicate that angiosperms dominated primary productivity in some subtropical coal swamps by the late Maastrichtian. Angiosperms in Kiowa coals probably comprised pioneer species in conifer-dominated vegetation; the most common family of angiosperms was Chloranthaceae. Angiosperms in upper Maastrichtian Raton coals comprised the dominant seed plants to the exclusion of conifers; magnoliid dicots and monocots were the dominant taxa and comprised diverse genera and families. Evidence from palynology and types of preserved cuticle indicates that ferns were subordinate to seed plants in biomass in Raton coals, in contrast to some described assemblages from the Northern Western Interior. Paleocene coals from the Raton Basin show the loss of many Cretaceous angiosperm taxa as well as the appearance of new taxa, including conifers belonging to Taxodiaceae. However, these Taxodiaceae were evergreen and subordinate in abundance to angiosperms. Vegetational patterns shown by Cretaceous-Paleocene coals of the Southern Western Interior contrast with those of more northerly regions and indicate a poleward gradient in the timing of angiosperm dominance in coal swamps. © 1995.",,"coal; Cretaceous; cuticle; mine; Palaeocene; spatial variation; temporal evolution; vegetation; North America; Biomass; Ecology; Geology; History; Peat; Plants (botany); Rocks; Angiosperm cuticles; Cretaceous coals; North America; Paleocene coals; Paleoecology; Palynology; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029416063

In this context, changes in the monthly weather pattern serve only to outline the growth conditions due to the nonlinearity of response of shrubs to climatic factors. The plant-soil-atmosphere system is described by means of ordinary non-linear differential equations for the state variables: green biomass, woody biomass, the residues of green and woody biomasses, faecal detritus of mammals on the soil, and the total organic matter of the soil. The behaviour of the flow variables is described by means of equations obtained from non-linear multiple regressions from the state variables and the input variables. The model has been applied with success to the behaviour of Cistus albidus in two zones of the Province of Alicante (Spain). The data base for the parametrical locations (zone 1) and validation (zone 2) is based upon measurements taken weekly over a 2-year period. The model is used to simulate the response of this shrub to a decreasing tendency in precipitation combined with a simultaneous rise in temperature. A period of 10 years is simulated and it is observed that plants with woody biomass smaller than 85 g die between the first and the third month and other plants' biomass decreases during this period, and strongly thereafter. © 1995.","Climate; Shrubland ecosystems","Cistus albidus; climatic change; ecosystem response model; MARIOLA; shrubland; Mediterranean; Spain, Alicante",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028978971

This new policy is being called ""Intrinsic Safety"". The important elements of this course of action are: &#x02022; - A greater degree of control of structural developments. &#x02022; - Increased action to prevent accidents rather than that which reduces the severity of the consequences of accidents. &#x02022; - Greater attention for an integral approach of traffic safety, through influencing all kinds of decision makers outside the realm of traffic safety. &#x02022; - Not viewing and treating the human aspects, the roads and the vehicles in isolation, but primarily focusing attention on the interaction between these components. At the moment the Ministry has inaugurated some actions which will be a more specific elaboration of ""Intrinsic Safety"". In this paper we will try to analyze whether this new policy is a totally new concept rather than an intensification of the old course of action. Furthermore we will discuss a few problems which may occur when the ""Intrinsic Safety"" approach will be elaborated in the near future. For example: &#x02022; - How do we make sure that chosen measures (e.g. decisions concerning the infrastructure) will be the most effectual ones in relation with safety? &#x02022; - Is the organisation at this moment sufficiently fit to work on an ""intrinsically safe traffic system"" or is it inappropriate? (e.g., presently there is an increasing tendency of decisions being made by regional departments rather than by central government) &#x02022; - Are we in the possession of sufficient knowledge concerning the interactions between the several goals of traffic policy so that actions taken in relation with one goal (e.g. reducing air pollution) will not have a negative effect on traffic safety? © 1995.",,"conference paper; highway; netherlands; policy; prevention; priority journal; traffic accident; traffic safety",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029115218

The emission rates of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are sensitive to the variations in the inputs related to cold transient, hot transient, and hot stabilized operating mode fractions. Therefore it is important to provide realistic values for these parameters while modeling emissions using air quality models such as the MOBILE model. The objective of the research presented is to derive aggregate operating mode fractions as alternatives to the federal test procedure (FTP) mode mix on the basis of a detailed analysis of personal travel data. The data source used for the analysis of personal travel information is the 1990 Nationwide Personal Travel Survey. Issues related to data quality, screening, and aggregation are discussed. After determining of the percentages of start mode as cold starts and hot starts, the percentages of vehicle miles of travel (VMT) operating in different modes are derived by trip purpose and for different time periods. The VMT weighted operating mode fractions derived from these start mode fractions indicated a significant difference from the FTP operating mode mix. It is observed that the FTP operating mode mix generally underestimates the portion of travel in cold transient mode. Also, it is observed that the percentage of VMT in cold transient mode decreases with the increase in the size of the urban area.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Computer simulation; Environmental protection; Hydrocarbons; Motor transportation; Particulate emissions; Urban planning; Emission inventory; Federal test procedure mode mix; Mobile source emissions; Operating mode fractions; Personal travel information; Vehicle miles of travel; Air quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029191705

The projects under this research sub-theme share a common interest in the complexities of implementing various types of economic instruments. The first project deals with the design of a European system of tradable emission rights. The second project is on the feasibility of ecological tax reform, with special reference to The Netherlands. The Climate Fund project, the third project, aims at investigating whether an international fund for side payments is an effective and efficient tool to reduce CO 2 emissions. To that purpose, the world is divided into 9 regions. Finally, the fourth project uses an applied general equilibrium model to analyze the effectiveness and especially the income distributional effects of differently designed CO 2 charges.

The purification consisted of a three-step procedure: ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography on phosphocellulose and affinity chromatography on GTP-agarose. The enzyme presented a native molecular mass of 85 kDa, appearing as an active monomer. Under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE), the enzyme showed a relative molecular mass of 74 kDa. The specific activity of homogeneous PEPCK in the presence of 2.3 mM Mn2+ was 13.0 U/mg at 25°C.

Apparent Km for GDP was &lt; 0.01 mM. ADP was not a substrate of the enzyme. Inosine 5'-triphosphate (ITP) inhibited the PEPCK activity (IC50 = 1.7 mM), and this inhibition was not reverted by 5 mM alanine.

These systems have been thought to contribute to pH homeostasis of parasites and environmental adaptation by mediating extrusion of protons which are either generated metabolically or result from exogenous acid loads. In this work we show that HCO3- transport plays a physiological role in supporting pH regulation of parasites. Intracellular pH (pHi) and the membrane potential (Vm) were assessed fluorometrically with pH sensitive and potentiometric dyes. We show that intracellular acidification, caused either by blocking the pump or the putative anion channel or by depleting Cl- from cells, could be largely overcome by addition of HCO3-. Likewise, addition of HCO3- raises the steady state intracellular pH of untreated cells from 6.76 ± 0.01 to 6.98 ± 0.02 and induces membrane hyperpolarization in pump-inhibited cells. We provide evidence for the involvement of HCO3- transport systems that subserve pH homeostasis in Leishmania promastigotes. A major anionic pathway which is sensitive to anion transport blockers is apparently conductive in nature and accomodates ions such as HCO3- and Cl-. In physiological conditions, the primary role of H+ pumping is the generation of a relatively large membrane potential (Vm = -113 ± 4 mV) which subserves electrochemical-driven uptake of nutrients. The involvement of H+ pumping in physiological pH regulation of promastigotes is apparently of a secondary nature. © 1995.","Biocarbonate; Channel; Chloride; Fluorescence; Leishmania; pH; Promastigote","bicarbonate; article; cell ph; fluorometry; leishmania major; membrane potential; priority journal; promastigote; 4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid; Animal; Bicarbonates; Chloride Channels; Homeostasis; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ion Transport; Leishmania major; Membrane Potentials; Proton Pumps; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Leishmania major",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028968663

The induction of capsule synthesis in vitro requires growth in the presence of bicarbonate and CO2; however, little else is known about the regulation of capsule synthesis and the role it plays in the expression of virulence. Recently, transposon Tn917 mutagenesis of B. anthracis plasmid pXO2 identified genes involved in capsule production and genes associated with virulence in inbred mice. One mutant, UUP5, had an 8.2-kb deletion located outside of the capsule structural gene region (cap). UUP5 was reduced significantly in capsule production and in virulence as compared to the wild-type (wt) parental strain. Using a HindIII-generated pXO2 library, we examined fragments contained in the deleted region and showed that electroporation of the mutant with a cloned 2.3-kb HindIII fragment restored capsule production to wt levels. Sequence analysis of the 2.3-kb fragment revealed a 1449-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 483-amino-acid (57 kDa) protein, in good agreement with the 55-kDa protein detected by in vitro transcription/ translation. Construction of a frameshift mutant that replaced the 55-kDa protein with a truncated 34-kDa moiety abrogated the complementing activity of the fragment in UUP5. mRNAs specific for cap and for the 1449-bp ORF were detected in mutant UUP5 transformed with the unaltered fragment and grown in the presence of bicarbonate, but not in air. No cap-specific mRNA, and very low levels of ORF-specific mRNA, were detected in UUP5 containing the frameshift mutation. Thus, a gene designated as acpA encodes a positive trans-acting protein which is involved in the bicarbonate-mediated regulation of capsule synthesis; the transcription of acpA appears to be bicarbonate-mediated. © 1995.","Bicarbonate-mediated regulation; cap region; poly(d-glutamic acid) capsule; pXO2","gene product; protein; trans acting factor; article; bacillus anthracis; bacterial virulence; gene structure; genetic transcription; mutant; nonhuman; plasmid; priority journal; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus anthracis; Bacterial Capsules; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Bicarbonates; Cloning, Molecular; Comparative Study; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Genes, Regulator; Genetic Complementation Test; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Restriction Mapping; Sequence Deletion; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Trans-Activators; Virulence; Bacillus anthracis; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028859789

The main focus of the paper is the construction of regional climate change scenarios from climate change experiments carried out using General Circulation Models (GCMs). An introduction to some GCM climate change experiments highlights the difference between model types and experiments (e.g. equilibrium or transient). The latest generation of climate change experiments have been performed using fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs. These allow transient simulations of climate change to be performed with respect to a given greenhouse gas forcing scenario. There are, however, a number of problems with these simulations which pose difficulties for the construction of climate change scenarios for use in climate change impacts assessment. The characteristics of the transient climate change experiments which pose difficulties for the construction of climate change scenarios are discussed. Three examples of these problems are: different climate change experiments use different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios; the ""cold-start"" problem which makes it hard to link future projections of climate change a given calendar year; and the drift of the climate is noticeable in the control simulations. In order to construct climate change scenarios for impacts assessment a method has therefore to be employed which addresses these problems. At present the climate modelling and climate change impacts communities are somewhat polarised in their approach to spatial scales. Current GCMs model the climate at resolutions larger than 2.5° × 3.75°, while the majority of impacts assessment studies are undertaken at scales below 50 km (or 0.5°). This paper concludes by addressing the problems in bringing together these two different modelling perspectives by presenting a number of regional climate change scenarios. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000160091

Ions of C2+ with kinetic energies of several hundred eV are detected in the leading edge of the plasma plumes from both targets.

This has been accomplished through the use of quantum confinement and built-in strain. There has been less emphasis on altering the photonic properties to improve laser performance. In this paper we examine the potential of a surface-emitting microcavity structure with submicron lateral dimensions for improving laser performance. We find that as the lateral dimensions are decreased, the photon density of states starts to change. In particular, strongly resonant states associated with Bragg reflection begin to dominate the photon spectrum. By placing the resonance peak close to the gain peak in the active quantum well region, a number of laser properties can be altered. The dimensions at which the changes start to be significant is about λ/na, where na is the refractive index of the active region. A study of how the threshold current, dynamic characteristics and laser linewidth change as a function of the microcavity dimensions is presented. Our studies show that the spontaneous emission factor β approaches a value of ≈ 0.5 for small structures with high mirror reflectivities. This in turn results in essentially zero threshold lasing for a microcavity with lateral dimensions &lt; 0.3 μm (for emission at 1.3 eV). The laser linewidth increases as β decreases, but the increase is not proportional to β, and even for small structures, the linewidth is expected to be in the range of 100 MHz to 1 GHz, which may be adequate for many applications. The -3 dB response of the 0.3 μm laser exceeds 40 GHz.",,"Laser optics; Light emission; Optical properties; Optoelectronic devices; Refractive index; Bragg reflection; Photon density; Spontaneous emission factor; Surface emitting microcavity structures; Threshold current; Zero threshold lasing; Semiconductor device structures",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029223949

In the Holocene, the temperature of the region changed with 1000-1200 and 3000 yr periods on the background of nonstationary trends with a 14 000 yr period; wetter periods occurred with 1000, 1500-1600 and 3000-yr periods; and the vegetation itself changed with 1000-1100, 1500, 2500 and 14 000 yr periods. The warmest period was observed 6000 yr ago, but 1500 yr later the temperature had decreased to the modern level. Climate warming results usually in intensive and deep reorganization of vegetation (successional replacement). The most intensive reorganizations occur c500 yr after the beginning of simultaneous and opposite oscillations in temperature (warming) and moisture (drying). The low stability of spruce forests to warming and drying can also result in ""catastrophic' reorganization of communities. A slight warming from the end of the 19th century and a slight cooling after the 1940s as well as a general increase in precipitation has been found. The current climate tends to be less continental. The relative stability of the climate over this 100-yr period contrasts with the relative instability of the vegetation communities. Fluctuations of radial increment and observations of stand destruction are consistent with water stress as the major factor. Intensive measurements of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration during individual seasons indicate that aggregate CO2 assimilation is reduced by 15-25% during dry periods. -from Authors",,"climatic change; Holocene; Norway spruce; pollen; spore; spruce forest; taiga; Russian Federation; Tver; Abies; Bacteria (microorganisms); Picea; Picea abies; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029480525

Fragments from the author's life, together with three South African action research projects, are then outlined to illustrate these points. The case is then developed for the notion of critique in action research, arguing in effect for the central practical importance of rigorous theory-based projects if action researchers are going to be able to step outside their taken-for-granted reality and push at the edges of their own experiences. This case is supported with reflections on the author's own educational development, shaped over time and grounded in the dialectical play of sociological theories and her empirical texts.

The concern over diesel particulate has increased in recent years. Firstly, the evidence indicating adverse effects from all particulate in urban air has grown stronger. Secondly, regarding diesel's cancer risk, evidence has grown that there is no threshold, i.e., there is no level below which one could consider diesel particulate to be safe. As a result, countries around the world are increasingly tightening diesel regulations with the result that technology for reducing emissions continues to advance. Engine and combustion improvements have substantially reduced NOx and particulate from modern engines. Oxidation catalysts have also become widespread especially on passenger cars in Europe and trucks in the US. Particulate trap oxidizers continue to undergo development and refinement to reduce cost and complexity and are expected to become more widely utilized in the future, not only for new vehicles but also as retrofits for existing buses and trucks. Whatever future improvements emerge for reducing ""engine out"" emissions, aftertreatment technology which can reduce 50 to 90% of the remainder will be necessary since health concerns require diesel emissions to be reduced to the greatest degree feasible. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Engines; Nitrogen oxides; Population statistics; Trucks; After-treatment technology; Diesel emission; Diesel particulate; Diesel vehicles; Future improvements; Oxidation catalysts; Particulate traps; Reducing emissions; Automobiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072426866

This reconstruction method combines both the measured projection data and the a-priori knowledge of the property of the image to be reconstructed. A piecewise-constant prior is assumed such that the reconstructed transmission image consists of smooth homogeneous regions separated by sharp edges. By using this approach, the reconstructed image is less noisy and has sharper edges preserved in comparison with the filtered back projection(FBP) method. As a result, segmentation of the transmission image is more accurate. By using this calculated attenuation correction approach, the final reconstructed emission image has less statistical noise than the image corrected by the measured attenuation data.",,"Algorithms; Attenuation; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Nuclear medicine; Probability; Filtered backprojection; Maximum a posteriori reconstruction; Mean field annealing; Segmented attenuation correction; Positron emission tomography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029429372

The reduction of nitric oxide on the palladium catalysts is inhibited significantly by hydrocarbon. However, the reduction of nitric oxide was improved by the addition of cerium to the catalysts. The XPS and TPR studies showed that the presence of cerium provided palladium oxide in a hard-reduced state and suppressed the chemisorption of hydrocarbons on the palladium oxide.

Each vehicle was tested to 5 different driving cycles including the FTP cycles and steady speed driving. Research had shown that for hot-start operation the major driving pattern parameters which influence fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are average speed and PKE (the positive acceleration kinetic energy per unit distance). Plots from analysis of micro-trip fuel use and emissions rates from the test cycles may be presented as contours in PKE. It follows that the micro trip emissions from a range of driving cycles including, regulated e.g. FTP city and unregulated e.g. LA-92, recently developed EPA cycles or from other cities e.g. Bangkok can be superimposed. The implications of stop-go driving can be graphically depicted and compared with smooth driving such as the U.S. highway cycle. It is concluded that: the latest technology vehicles, whilst emitting at lower levels have emission rates more sensitive to high accelerations (PKE) than older technology vehicles; the conditions for minimum emissions change with vehicle technology; and regulating vehicle acceleration and speed can be a beneficial emission reduction strategy. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Diesel engines; Emission control; Fleet operations; Fuels; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Emission reduction strategy; Engine technology; Fleet of vehicles; High acceleration; Latest technology; Three way catalysts; Vehicle acceleration; Vehicle technology; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072446533

The Forth Field reservoir contains biodegraded oil and consists of Palaeocene and Eocene unconsolidated to semi-consolidated, well sorted, medium- to fine-grained sub-arkoses at a maximum present burial depth of 1.8 km. Pervasive ferroan and non-ferroan calcite cements dominate the Forth paragenetic sequence. Bitumen-filled inclusions within these cements indicate that oil emplacement and carbonate cementation occurred simultaneously, probably within the first 1000 m of burial. Carbonate δ 18O data suggest that meteoric water from the East Shetland Platform flushed the reservoir, biodegraded the migrated oil and displaced the original sea water. Biodegradation of oil took place at the palaeo-oil-water contact, producing a complex sequence of laterally extensive non-ferroan and ferroan calcite concretions. Frequent oil leakage during shallow burial may have produced a large number of concretionary cement layers. The cemented layers have the potential to act as major barriers to vertical fluid movement and to significantly reduce the net to gross ratio of the reservoir. Pore-filling ankerite post-dates non-ferroan and ferroan calcite. Ankerite precipitation marks the final stages of bacterial influence within the sediment column. The Balmoral Field is located c. 100 km to the south of Forth. The reservoir consists of a series of poorly sorted subfeldspathic arenites with infrequent spherical carbonate concretions. These non-ferroan and ferroan calcitic concretions preferentially precipitated around localized accumulations of organic matter at &lt; 500 m burial depth. Pore fluids were meteoric, and carbonate was provided by both bacterial oxidation and sulphate reduction of organic matter. Meteoric water is thought to have been derived from the East Shetland Platform to the north of Balmoral. Oil migrated into Balmoral during the Oligocene, post-dating meteoric flooding. Laterally extensive carbonate-cemented sand horizons, formed in association with oil biodegradation, have the potential to compartmentalize a reservoir. The distribution of these cements within Tertiary deep water sandstone reservoirs adjacent to the East Shetland Platform is likely to be controlled by the relative timing of meteoric flushing and oil migration. © 1995 The Geological Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052686043

For all ions except hydrogen, the efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of energy in the range up to a few hundred keV used for medium energy backscattering. Combining expressions for spectrometer efficiency and trace element sensitivity obtained previously, we show that for a given ion the product of scattering cross section and spectrometer efficiency determines an optimum energy for trace element analysis by backscattering. The optimum choice of ion is a function of the mass of the trace element under investigation. If the limit of sensitivity is determined by sputtering, then light elements such as He appear to be unconditionally superior to heavy projectiles such as C or N. However, the numerical value of the limiting sensitivity for a given trace element is strongly influenced by the details of the sputtering and the degree of beam induced mixing at the surface. For elements in the region of Fe to Cu reasonable assumptions about sputtering lead to the conclusion that sensitivities of about 3 × 1010 cm-2 are achievable using 100 keV He+ projectiles and a spectrometer which subtends a solid angle of 1 msr. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26744459984

X-ray emission during the laser target interaction and the subsequent collision is used to diagnose the initial plasma conditions and the colliding plasma properties. X-ray instrumentation consists of a 100 ps gated x-ray pinhole imager, a time-integrated bremsstrahlung x-ray spectrograph and a gated x-ray spectrograph used to record isoelectronic spectra from the Ti-Cr plasmas. The imager has obtained multiframe images of the collision and therefore, a measure of the stagnation length which is a function of the ion charge state and density and a strong function of the electron temperature. Other instrumentation includes a Thomson scattering spectrometer with probe beam, neutron detectors used to monitor the CE coated foil collisions, and an ion spectrometer.

In response to community concern about the possible respiratory effects of emissions from a fertiliser plant, a study was carried out to determine whether the prevalence of asthma symptoms in 5-8 yr old children in an industrial suburb of Christchurch (Hornby) was the same as in the rest of Christchurch. METHODS. A sample of 646 children aged 5-8 years in Hornby was compared with 1183 6-7 year old children randomly selected from schools throughout the Christchurch metropolitan area. The Christchurch sample was part of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) carried out during 1993. ISAAC questionnaires on respiratory symptoms with some additional questions about smoking and pets were answered by the caregivers of the children sampled. RESULTS. Response rates were 97% in Hornby and 94% in Christchurch. Of the sample, 29% (Hornby) and 27% (Christchurch) had 'wheeze in the last 12 months' while 45% of Hornby and 44% of Christchurch children had 'ever wheezed', 28% had 'ever had asthma'. Significantly more children in Hornby (44%) were exposed to passive smoking compared to Christchurch (29%). Indoor pets were present in 73% and 67% of homes, respectively. CONCLUSION. There was no evidence of an increase in asthma symptoms reported in children in the industrial area of Hornby.",,"fertilizer; abnormal respiratory sound; air pollution; animal; article; asthma; child; comparative study; cross-sectional study; domestic animal; human; indoor air pollution; industry; New Zealand; pathophysiology; population; preschool child; prevalence; Air Pollution; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fertilizers; Humans; Industry; New Zealand; Prevalence; Respiratory Sounds; Suburban Population; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029651399

They offer exceptionally high energy conversion efficiency and extremely low environmental emissions. When combined with gas turbines, fuel cell systems promise an electrical conversion efficiency of 70% (based on lower heating value of fuel). As modular units for distributed power generation, fuel cells are expected to be particularly beneficial where their by-product, heat, can be used effectively in co-generation applications.

A time-resolved Fourier transform infrared emission technique acquires the time and spectrally resolved data. Two excitation wavelengths are employed: 193 nm and 248 nm. The infrared emission features are strongly dependent on the initial excitation energy. Wavelength-resolved spectra recorded 6.8 μs after the laser pulse show a 45 cm-1 redshift from the gas-phase absorption spectra for 193 nm excitation and 25 cm-1 for 248 nm excitation. We hypothesize that a series of sequence bands originating from the highly vibrationally excited ensemble of molecules is responsible for the observed shift. As collisional and radiative deactivation removes energy from the highly vibrationally excited molecules, the maximum in the emission profile gradually approaches the customary absorption maximum. This indicates that the amount of redshift is strongly dependent on the amount of internal vibrational energy in the molecule at the time of the vibrational transition.","Infrared: ISM: lines and bands; Line: identification; Molecular processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11944256294

Both wild-type thioredoxin and mutant D26A thioredoxin were selectively 13C-enriched on cysteine β-carbons. In both proteins, the variation with pH of 1 HBl, 1HB2, and 13CB NMR chemical shifts has been measured. In wild-type reduced thioredoxin, for both cysteines, the pH versus chemical shift plots of HBl protons can be fit to one titration with pKa values of 7.0-7.1. In contrast, the HB2 protons and β-carbons give pH-chemical shift plots that clearly reflect more than one titration; fits to the data give apparent pKa values of 7.0-7.3 and 9.5 for HB2 protons and 7.5-7.9 and 9.2-10.2 for CB carbons. In reduced D26A, all three probe chemical shifts have a pH dependence that is fit by one titration with pKa of 7.4-7.9. The absence of a titration with pKa&gt;9 in D26A, taken together with cysteine thiol pKa values of 7.1 and 7.9 determined by Raman spectroscopy [Li et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5800-5808], indicates that the pKa&gt;9 in reduced thioredoxin is that of Asp26. This is highly significant in view of the previous observation that, in oxidized thioredoxin, Asp26 pKa is 7.5 [Langsetmo et al. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7603-7609], The very high pKa values of these carboxyls is consistent with their local environment in the three-dimensional structure; the Asp26 side chain in oxidized thioredoxin is almost but not completely buried, and in reduced thioredoxin it may be even more buried. The upward shift in pKa of Asp26 in reduced thioredoxin accounts for the lower stability of reduced compared to oxidized thioredoxin and suggests that the function of this very highly conserved active site group is to regulate the redox potential of the enzyme through thermodynamic linkage to global stability. The higher pKa of Asp26 in reduced thioredoxin also offers an explanation for the preference for reduced thioredoxin in phage maturation processes. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

A computationally efficient approach to depicting the response of an air basin to emission controls is developed. The problem of ozone isopleth generation is addressed using a large Eulerian grid-based photochemical airshed model that is distributed over a grid system of 64 different ROG and NOx control combination points that were run simultaneously on a parallel computer. This method is used for the Los Angeles area to examine the effect on predicted ozone concentrations of alternative assumptions about how boundary conditions at the edge of the air basin will change as a result of changed recirculation of pollutants from within the airshed plus emission decreases upwind. We show that an accurate forecast of the effect of future emission control programs on pollutant inflows across the boundaries of the Los Angeles modeling region is absolutely critical to selection of a successful ozone control strategy for the Los Angeles area. © 1995.","Airshed model; ozone; parallel computer","boundary conditions; ozone control strategy; photochemical airshed model; USA, California, Los Angeles; ozone; air pollution control; article; photochemistry; priority journal; united states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028972637

At first, the catalytic oxidations of thiols and sulfide in the presence of different Co(II)phthalocyanines are discussed. Thiolates are oxidized to disulfides via a two‐electron transfer whereas the reduction of O2 occurs via a two‐ or four‐electron transfer to H2O2 or H2O. Zn(II) and Al(III)phthalocyanines are efficient sensitizers for the conversion of triplet to singlet dioxygen under illumination with visible light. In the presence of thiolates or sulfides an efficient photo‐oxidation to sulfonic acids or sulfate is observed. The oxidation state of sulfur changes from −2 to +4 or +6, respectively. This process of singlet oxygen reactions finds application in the photodynamic therapy of cancer. The unsubstituted zinc(II)‐phthalocyanine as p‐type molecular semiconductor can efficienfly reduce O2 in photoelectrochemical experiments whereas zinc(II)phthalocyanines with electronwithdrawing groups as n‐type conductors are active in the photoelectrochemical oxidation of thiols. All processes include multi‐electron transfer. The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is investigated at electrodes modified with Co(II)phthalocyanine. In particular, the phthalocyanine in a polyvinylpyridine membrane is active, so the CO2 is reduced to CO by multi‐electron transfer. In addition, two photon excitations of a Mg(II)phthalocyanine are presented and some examples are reviewed.

Here we report for the first time, that light from Maillard reactions can be seen by the human eye and also can be photographed. In parallel with visual perception and photography CL was monitored by means of a CL-detection programme of a liquid scintillation counter (LSC, single photon rate counting). CL emission spectrum was recorded by a monochromator-microchannel plate photomultiplier arrangement. CL intensity from reaction of 6-aminocaproic acid with D-ribose (200 mg each) in 5 mL H2O at pH 11 at 95 degrees C was high enough for visual perception after adaptation to absolute darkness. Reaction in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) exhibited strongly enhanced CL (10 mg each in 5 mL were sufficient for visual detection) and could be photographed (15 minutes' exposure, ASA 6400); all characteristics of Maillard specific CL (O2-dependence, no CL from nonreducing sugars, inhibition by sulphur compounds) remained. Visual detection of CL and measurement by LSC were in full concordance. The CL emission spectrum showed two broad peaks at around 500 nm and 695 nm. Fluorescence emission of the brown reaction mixture matched the blue-green part of the CL emission spectrum.

Although cigarette consumption has gradually decreased in the United States from a high of about 3800 cigarettes per adult per year in 1965 to about 2800 cigarettes in 1993, death from lung cancer has reached a high among males at the rate of 74.9/100,000/year and among females at the rate of 28.5. However, in the younger cohorts, the lung cancer death rate is decreasing in both men and women. In this overview we discuss the steeper increase during recent decades of lung adenocarcinoma incidence compared with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. In 1950, the ratio of these two major types of lung cancer in males was about 1:18; today it is about 1:1.2-1.4. This overview discusses two concepts that are regarded as contributors to this change in the histological types of lung cancer. One factor is the decrease in average nicotine and tar delivery of cigarettes from about 2.7 and 38 mg in 1955 to 1.0 and 13.5 mg in 1993, respectively. Other major factors for the reduced emission of smoke relate to changes in the composition of the cigarette tobacco blend and general acceptance of cigarettes with filter tips; the latter constitute 97% of all cigarettes currently sold. However, smokers of low-yield cigarettes compensate for the low delivery of nicotine by inhaling the smoke more deeply and by smoking more intensely; such smokers may be taking up to 5 puffs/min with puff volumes up to 55 ml. Under these conditions, the peripheral lung is exposed to increased amounts of smoke carcinogens that are suspected to lead to lung adenocarcinoma. Among the important changes in the composition of the tobacco blend of the U.S. cigarette is a significant increase in nitrate content 10.5% to 1.2-1.5%), which raises the yields of nitrogen oxides and N-nitrosamines in the smoke. Furthermore, the more intense smoking by the consumers of low-yield cigarettes increases N-nitrosamines in the smoke 2- to 3-fold. Among the N-nitrosamines is 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyi)-1-butanone (NNK), a powerful lung carcinogen in animals that is exclusively formed from nicotine. This organ-specific tobaco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA) induces adenocarcinoma of the lung. All of these factors, the more intense smoking, the deeper inhalation of the smoke, and the increased yields of N-nitrosamines in the smoke of low-yield cigarettes, are considered major contributors to the drastic increase in lung adenocarcinoma among cigarette smokers in recent years. This overview also discusses the differences in the major lung cancer types in female compared with male smokers as well as the likely underlying factors for increased lung cancer risk among African Americans compared with that among white Americans. Although the only sure way to prevent smoking-related diseases is giving up the tobacco habit, there must be a measure of protection for those who cannot accomplish this. Therefore, setting upper permissible limits of tar levels for the smoke of U.S. cigarettes, similar to strategies already taken in Western Europe, should be considered.","Histology; Hormones; Lung cancer; Nitrosamines; Prevention; Race; Smoking","cigarette smoke; nicotine; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; nitrosamine; tar; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cigarette smoking; conference paper; human; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; priority journal; sex difference; squamous cell carcinoma",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029620449

Br6—CB11H6- is a particularly weakly coordinating anion and leads to long Si-Br bond distances (ca. 2.43-2.48 Å). The developing silylium ion character in these species is reflected in the approach of the R3Siδ+ moiety toward planarity. The sum of the C-Si-C angles for each of the four derivatives lies in the range ca. 345-351°. The closest approach to 360° is found in the triisopropyl derivative, not the tri-tert-butyl derivative as might be anticipated from steric considerations. One of the isopropyl groups in the i-Pr3 derivative has its carbon atoms very nearly planar with the silicon atom. This is indicative of C-H bond hyperconjugative stabilization of the developing positive charge on silicon. An “inorganic” description would be in terms of an α-agostic C-H interaction with the electron-deficient 3pz orbital on silicon. The results suggest that hyperconjugative stabilization of cationic character, although relatively unimportant compared to that for carbon in carbenium ions, is nevertheless not negligible for silicon. Solid state CPMAS 29Si NMR data are also reported. The chemical shifts lie in the 105–115 ppm downfield region as expected for silylium ion-like character in these R3Siδ+(Br6-CB11H6)δ- species. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Based on land availability for afforestation, 20 cases are identified in five suitable regions in China. The least expensive way of developing forests for the purpose of sequestering carbon emissions is the case of Pinus massoniana from the initial investment point of view, and then Spruce. The cases of open forest management are relatively less expensive options because of their low initial investment and long rotations, although their annual wood increments are low. Some less productive tree species have higher net costs for carbon sequestering. For most of the agroforestry systems the net costs are low, especially in the south, the southwest, and the north of China, though their initial investments are high. If the total land available is afforested, the net carbon sequestering will be about 9.7 billion tons under perpetual rotations, amounting to 16.3 times the total industrial carbon release in 1988 in China, and the total initial cost for such a programme is estimated at 19.3 billion US$.

The yields of the photocatalytic reaction strongly depended on the types of catalysts, the ratio of CO2/H2O and the reaction temperature. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O is linked to the much higher reactivity of the charge transfer excited state, i.e., (Ti3+-O-)* of the tetrahedral coordinated titanium oxide species formed on the surfaces. Based on the detection of the reaction intermediate species such as Ti3+, H atoms, and C radicals, a molecular scale reaction mechanism has been proposed. © 1995.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Methane; Photochemical reactions; Titanium oxides; Ultraviolet radiation; Water; Highly dispersed active titanium oxide catalysts; Photocatalytic synthesis; Synthesis (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029323503

The magnitude of such emission rates and factors controlling those rates are not well understood. We evaluated CH4 emission from the widely distributed aquatic emergent plant cattail (Typha latifolia L.) in several wetlands in the United States using a field gas‐exchange system that concurrently estimated stomatal aperture (i.e., conductance) on the surface of leaves and net photosynthesis. We compared gas exchange among plants of different age and from sites with different soil and atmospheric conditions. The mean rate of CH4 emission was 0.22 µ mol m−2[leaf] s−1, which is 940 mg CH4 m−2 d−1 on a ground‐area basis, with individual rates ranging from 0.01 to 1.49 µ mol m−2[leaf] s−1. For individual plants, we found emission rates were (i) highest for the part of the leaf about 1.0 m above the waterline and lower near the leaf tip and close to the leaf base, and (ii) highest near midday and lower soon after sunrise and towards sunset. We also found the ease that CH4 moves in a sediment‐plant‐atmosphere continuum seems to increase with plant age. We propose that a series of factors influences CH4 emission from Typha latifolia to the atmosphere; stomatal conductance and plant age are as important as the amount of microbially produced CH4 in the wetland sediment.

Anne de Bellevue, Quebec, H9X 3V9, Canada, Canada","The FTIR spectra of selected aldoses and ketoses were recorded in D2O as a function of temperature between 30 and 80°C. The analysis of the spectra has revealed the presence of two sets of temperature-sensitive bands, one centered in the carbonyl region (1700-1750 cm-1) and the other in the alkene absorption region (1630-1680 cm-1). The latter was assigned to the enediol species formed as a result of enolization of acyclic aldehydo and keto forms of the sugars. Both absorption frequencies were confirmed by studies with selected 13C-substituted sugars. The presence of α-hydroxyl groups in reducing sugars was found to shift the stretching frequencies of sugar carbonyl bands to higher values relative to simple alkyl-substituted carbonyl compounds. The relative concentration of enediol to that of carbonyl was also studied as a function of temperature and concentration. The ratio of intensities of enediol to carbonyl absorption bands was found to decrease with temperature and increase with concentration. Using d-[2-13C]ribose and d-[1-13C]ribose, further evidence for the occurrence of enolization was provided by observing the migration of carbonyl group from C-1 to C-2 in d-ribose and subsequent formation of d-erythro-pentulose (d-ribulose) as a result of reversal of enediol-carbonyl equilibrium through both hydroxyl groups. A mechanism is proposed for the enolization of sugars in neutral aqueous solutions involving hydrogen-bonded sugar dimers. These studies indicated that the relative concentrations of the enediols are as important as aldehydo or keto forms of reducing sugars in aqueous solutions. © 1995.","Enolization; FTIR spectroscopy; Sugars, carbonyl; Sugars, enediol forms; Sugars, reducing","carbohydrate derivative; article; carbohydrate analysis; fourier transformation; infrared spectrophotometry; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028824689

Now, new and proposed emissions regulations have recognized portable analyzers using electrochemical sensor technology as an accurate method for monitoring emissions on a semicontinuous or periodic basis. Most portable analyzers on the market provide multigas detection capabilities. They are designed to identify certain parameters of the combustion process, allowing users to properly adjust and control the air-fuel ratio of the engine, and better understand how efficiently the fuel is burning. Sensors for CO, NO and NO2 generally consist of a sensing electrode, a counter electrode and a reference electrode separated by a thin layer of electrolyte. Gas diffusing to the sensing electrode reacts at the surface of the electrode either by oxidation or reduction. Reactions are catalyzed by special electrode materials and are designed to be specific to the gas measured. The greatest contributor to the recent advancement of portable instruments is, partly, because of proper gas sample conditioning, advanced microprocessor technology, and a proper calibration protocol. The removal of interference gases is very important in receiving accurate readings. This is achieved by acid gas scrubbers, software matrix calculations, temperature compensated sensors, as well as the use of heated sample lines, heated probes, internal Peltier coolers, and continuous water extraction.

Enhanced catalysis for CO2 electroreduction at more positive potential and of greater efficiency was achieved with the present system than with the system using pure CoPc as catalyst, whereas both coatings were found to catalyze proton reduction as well. The electrochemical behavior of the PVP-bound CoPc was examined at different pH, taking the normally adsorbed CoPc as reference. The greatly enhanced and sustained catalytic activity of the CoPc/PVP membrane for CO2 electroreduction in water is discussed in terms of electron donation of the pyridine group to the central cobalt by an axial coordination and a proton-exchanging property of the PVP and the increased local concentration of CO2 in the PVP layer owing to their hydrophobic and/or acid-base interaction.

Isotope distributions of hydrogen and formic acid were measured. In comparison with simple hydrogen evolution under an N2 atmosphere, the formation of HD was suppressed. This suggests the existence of hydrogen-rich and deuterium-rich regions on the electrode surface and is attributable to poisoning by the adspecies. More than 95% of the formic acid was HCOO-, i.e. it was formed by the incorporation of hydrogen from H2O. Considering that no formic acid was formed in the absence of hydrogen supplied from the back face, the surface hydrogen converted to formic acid is probably unstable, and is generated only on the hydrogen ""flowing-out"" surface. The effect of thiourea was investigated for poisoning or promotion of hydrogen-related processes and CO2 reduction.

LML (Lean Misfire Limit) extension and NOx emission reduction was realized in combination with the following factors. (1) Installing several types of SCV (Swirl Control Valve) with different section shapes and dividing wall in the intake port intensified the flow field inside combustion chamber, so optimized mixture formation and combustion improvement were obtained. (2) By precisely controlling injection timing, changing injection rate, thus obtaining locally stratified charging, LML was extended. (3) By intensifying ignition system, better combustion characteristics were achieved. (4) NOx emission was reduced by extending LML and adopting lean NOx catalyst (Cu-ZSM-5). By combining above factors, we extended LML to A/F 23. Therefore NOx emission was reduced 60.6%, fuel economy was improved 10.6% in engine dyno test.

The metastable intermediate has no or low absorbance at 450 nm in the reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum and has no absorbance at 420 nm. The intermediate is easily converted to P420 by increasing concentrations of GuHCl. Before it becomes P420, the cytochrome can be completely reconverted to native P450 by dilution and incubation at 4-C. Cytochrome P420 resulting from exposure to higher concentrations of GuHCl (>3 M) failed to be reconverted to P450 by dilution. Denaturation of P450 2B1 by exposure to low concentrations of urea (<2 M) is also completely reversible but no obvious intermediate is detectable. An intermediate is observed, however, when the urea denaturation is conducted in the presence of 1 M NaCl. As is the case with higher concentrations of GuHCl, cytochrome P450 denatured by exposure to 5 M or higher concentrations of urea is not reversible. The failure of reconversion of P420 denatured by exposure of cytochrome P450 to high concentrations of GuHCl or urea is probably attributable to the extensive unfolding of the apoprotein, which favors aggregation, rather than to heme loss. Our results also suggest that the active site is more sensitive to denaturants than other regions of the protein. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Tubules were perfused at different lumen Ca2+ concentrations in the presence and absence of the calcium ionophore A23187. Bicarbonate reabsorption was not affected by Ca2+ in the range of 0 to 1 mM, but was significantly reduced when 0.5 mM EGTA was added to the 0 Ca2+ perfusates, indicating that only at very low luminal Ca2+ levels, bicarbonate reabosorption (= H+ secretion) was impaired. These observations indicate that Ca2+ in the tubule lumen is important for the maintenance of normal proximal bicarbonate transport, but the low Ca2+ level necessary to impair this transport mechanism is achieved only in the presence of EGTA, a condition that simulates the absence of parathyroid hormone.","Bicarbonate reabsorption; Calcium; Calcium ionophore; H+ secretion; Proximal tubule","bicarbonate; calcimycin; egtazic acid; parathyroid hormone; proton; acid secretion; animal tissue; article; blood ph; calcium blood level; controlled study; kidney proximal tubule; male; nonhuman; perfusion; priority journal; rat; regional perfusion; Absorption; Acids; Animals; Bicarbonates; Calcium; Half-Life; Kidney Tubules, Proximal; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029590295

The tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2 matrix materials have been synthesized from the Zr-n-propoxide-acetylacetone-water-isopropanol system. The study shows that the ZrO2 matrix is able to retain the relative Co3O4: CoO population at elevated temperatures. The thermodynamically stable oxide population (Co3O4: CoO) at room temperature for Zro2-supported Co3O4-CoO is about 50:50 (Co2+: Co3+ = 2:1), which is markedly different from the 100:0 case (Co2+: Co3+ = 1:2) for an unsupported Co3O4-CoO surface oxide system. The relative Co3O4: CoO ratio in the surface region of the ZrO2 is temperature dependent but matrix-polymorph independent. The composition of an oxide solid solution formed by the Co3O4-CoO and matrices of Zro2 is determined to have a cobalt molar percentage of 4.5%. Diffusion thermodynamic quantities are investigated, and the measured diffusion activation energy for a cobalt ion in the ZrO2 matrices is 0.21 eV.

Box 1700 MS 3339, Victoria, BC, V8W 2Y2, Canada","A simplified cumulus parameterization scheme, suitable for use in GCMs, is presented. This parameterization is based on a plume ensemble concept similar to that originally proposed by Arakawa and Schubert (1974). However, it employs three assumptions which significantly simplify the formulation and implementation of the scheme. It is assumed that an ensemble of convective-scale updrafts with associated saturated downdrafts may exist when the atmosphere is locally conditionally unstable in the lower troposphere. However, the updraft ensemble is comprised only of those plumes which are sufficiently buoyant to penetrate through this unstable layer. It is assumed that all such plumes have the same upward mass flux at the base of the convective layer. The third assumption is that moist convection, which occurs only when there is convective available potential energy (CAPE) for reversible ascent of an undiluted parcel from the sub-cloud layer, acts to remove CAPE at an exponential rate with a specified adjustment time scale. The performance of the scheme and its sensitivity to choices of disposable parameters is illustrated by presenting results from a series of idealized single-column model tests. These tests demonstrate that the scheme permits establishment of a quasi-equilibrium between large-scale forcing and convective response. However, it is also shown that the strength of convective downdrafts is an important factor in determining the nature of the equilibrium state. Relatively strong down-drafts give rise to an unsteady irregularly fluctuating state characterized by alternate periods of deep and shallow convection. The effect of using the scheme for GCM climate simulations is illustrated by presenting selected results of a multi-year simulation carried out with the Canadian Climate Centre GCM using the new parameterization (the CONV simulation). Comparison of these results with those for a climate simulation made with the standard model (the CONTROL simulation, as documented by McFarlane et al., 1992) reveals the importance of other parameterized processes in determining the ultimate effect of introducing the new convective scheme. The radiative response to changes in the cloudiness regime is particularly important in this regard. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39549095502

The fuel system, as one of the key elements, is the subject of renewed and expanded research in an effort to understand and optimize the important parameters. Only through such enhanced understanding of the basic processes of fuel injection, metering, atomization, targeting, pulse-to-pulse variability and induction of fuel under cold, normal and elevated temperature conditions can the very low emissions of today's vehicles be further reduced to ULEV values. In the quest for reduced emissions and enhanced transient response, the electronic fuel injection system with sequential fuel pulse width control has become the fuel system choice in automotive gasoline engines, and this paper provides a comprehensive review of the research and development work associated with these systems and the associated basic processes. Various classes of port fuel injectors and their resultant spray structures are discussed, and the liquid fuel breakup mechanisms are reviewed. The key parameters that are required to numerically characterize a fuel spray from an automotive port injector are discussed, and the recent research advances are noted.

After determining the genetic coefficients for the cultivars, the CERES-rice model was run a second time for the same locations for a time period of 20 to 30 yr. The model used local climate data (1958-1986) and various doubled-CO2 climate change scenarios, with and without supplemental irrigation (to model paddy and upland rice, respectively). The study estimated the potential impacts of climate change on rice production by comparing the base runs with the runs under the three doubled-CO2 GCM scenarios and it considered the physiological effects of CO2 on rice growth in each GCM scenarios. Finally, the study examined several strategies for adapting to climate change. -from Authors",,"CERES model; climate change; crop growth modelling; rice production; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029479196

Diastereoisomeric pairs of products result at room temperature merely from the ‘endo’‐ and ‘exo’‐transition states; more complex mixtures appear above 60° as a consequence of (Z)/(E)‐isomerization of 4. The relative stability of the anomers of 5 and 6 is explored by treatment with BF3·Et2O. Acid alcoholysis (MeOH or EtOH) of 5 leads to acetals 9a, b of 4‐bromo‐5‐oxopentanoate.

It is shown that restructuring of the energy system is a major emission reduction option in all countries but with a potential varying greatly from country to country depending mainly on the existing structure and the age of the plants and on the development of the energy demand. The emission reduction costs for SO2 in Central and Eastern European countries are 50% to 70% lower than in Western countries due to high potential of fuel/technology switching and energy saving measures.

The paper refers to air protection policy priorities adopted by the government of Poland in 1990, and reviews policy instruments envisaged for their implementation. Additionally, it discusses international priorities and how the government of Poland attempts to address these in its policy. After defining cost-effectiveness, this paper reviews how the choice of policy instruments influences the costs of pollution control policy. Then, the recent Polish experience with charges, environmental funds, and transferable permits is confronted with the cost-effectiveness principles. The paper concludes that Poland has developed an extensive system of pollution fees which serves a revenue-raising purpose and gives modest incentives to abate, although the cost-effectiveness of this mechanism needs improvement. A potential role for transferable permits is emphasized. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Air pollution; cost-effectiveness; economies in transition; Poland; pollution fees; transferable pollution permits",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344607585

This investigation is performed to study the low temperature phase structural features, determining the structure and degree of order of molecules in the high temperature modifications. The crystalline phase structure of trihalogen substituted methanes and their degree order are considerably different. The reasons for these differences are not established completely. It is possible that the essential reason is because of the halogen type. The approach of the stage-by-stage “melting” of the molecular degrees of freedom in a crystal is the convenient basis for the interpretation of phenomena associated with the processes of increasing the dynamical disorder in molecular crystals with increasing the temperature. However, there are several examples of forming the high temperature intermediate phases with the elements of the stationary disorder. The transition from the orientationally ordered state into the isotropic liquid occurs in such crystals through the intermediate state whose feature is not the activated, but the stationary orientational disorder. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957031215
