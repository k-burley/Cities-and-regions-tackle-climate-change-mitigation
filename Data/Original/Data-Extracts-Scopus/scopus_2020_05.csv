The effects of permafrost thaw on DIC may be particularly strong where terrain subsidence following thaw (thermokarst) releases large amounts of sediment into fluvial networks. The mineral composition and chemical weathering of these sediments has critical yet untested implications for the degree to which streams represent a source of CO2 to the atmosphere vs. a source of bicarbonate to downstream environments. Here, we experimentally determine the effects of mineral weathering on fluvial CO2 by incubating sediments collected from three retrogressive thaw slump features on the Peel Plateau (NWT, Canada). Prehistoric warming and contemporary thermokarst have exposed sediments on the Peel Plateau to varying degrees of thaw and chemical weathering, allowing us to test the role of permafrost and substrate mineral composition on CO2:HCO-3 balance. We found that recently-thawed sediments (within years to decades) and previously un-thawed tills from deeper permafrost generated substantial amounts of solutes and DIC. These solutes and the mineralogy of sediments suggested that carbonate weathering coupled with sulfide oxidation was a net source of abiotic CO2. Yet, on average, more than 30% of this CO2 was converted to bicarbonate via carbonate buffering reactions. In contrast, the mineralogy and geochemical trends associated with sediments from the modern and paleo-active layer, which were exposed to thaw over longer timescales than deeper permafrost sediments, more strongly reflected silicate weathering. In treatments with sediment from the modern and paleo-active layer, minor carbonate and sulfide weathering resulted in some DIC and net CO2 production. This CO2 was not measurably diminished by carbonate buffering. Together, these trends suggest that prior exposure to thaw and weathering on the Peel Plateau reduced carbonate and sulfide in upper soil layers. We conclude that thermokarst unearthing deeper tills on the Peel Plateau will amplify regional inorganic carbon cycling for decades to centuries. However, CO2 consumption via carbonate buffering may partly counterbalance CO2 production and release to the atmosphere. Regional variability in the mineral composition of permafrost, thaw history, and thermokarst intensity are among the primary controls on mineral weathering within permafrost carbon-climate feedbacks. © Copyright © 2020 Zolkos and Tank.","carbon dioxide; carbonate; retrogressive thaw slump; sulfide; thermokarst","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Erosion; Geochemistry; Minerals; Permafrost; Sediments; Silicates; Substrates; Sulfur compounds; Thawing; Carbonate weathering; Chemical weathering; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Experimental evidence; Mineral composition; Mineral weathering; Regional variability; Silicate weathering; Weathering; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbonate sediment; chemical weathering; experimental study; mineral; permafrost; sulfide; thawing; thermokarst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085871476

This limit is the latest policy in the efforts to reduce sulphur emissions from shipping, following the designation of emission control areas (ECAs) and other regional regulations. In this paper, a literature review is conducted of academic studies that have dealt with issues relating to the reduction of maritime sulphur emissions. Various recurring research themes are identified, spanning the areas of operations research, maritime economics and transport policy. The effects and implications of available compliance options are then analyzed from the perspectives of ship operators, shippers and consumers. Using lessons learned from the enforcement of ECA regulations, this is followed by an appraisal of various potential issues related to the enforcement of these new global regulations. It is found that a homogeneous enforcement regime is required to ensure a level playing field amongst ship operators and that the global sulphur cap may lead to serious market distortion, due to the potential short term rise of fuel prices. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future research on sulphur emissions from shipping in the aftermath of the global cap and, looking forward, to its relationship to the IMO strategy on the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) shipping emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Compliance; Enforcement; Maritime transport; Sulphur cap; Sulphur emissions; Transport policy","Emission control; Gas emissions; Operations research; Ships; Sulfur; Waterway transportation; Compliance; Enforcement; Maritime transport; Sulphur emissions; Transport policy; Greenhouse gases; law enforcement; maritime transportation; shipping; strategic approach; sulfur emission; traffic emission; transportation planning; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081347268

Under certain conditions, the quasi-isothermal mode is characterized by the non-monotonic dependencies of the foam volume on the external pressure that are associated with the expansion-to-shrinkage transition. The quasi-adiabatic and quasi-isothermal expansions are characterized by a significant increase in the degree of foam expansion under conditions where the CO2 initial pressure approaches the critical value. The observed features are interpreted in terms of the energy balance in the foam volume and the phenomenological model based on the equation of the foam state. The expansion-to-shrinkage condition is based on the relationship between the average bubble radius and the pressure derivative of the surface tension for the plasticized polylactide. The maximum expansion ratio of the rapidly foamed polylactide in the vicinity of the critical point is interpreted in terms of the maximum decrement of the specific internal energy of the foaming agent (carbon dioxide) in the course of depressurization. © 2020 by the authors.","D, L-polylactide; Foaming; Internal energy; Plasticization; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Surface tension","Carbon dioxide; Expansion; Isotherms; Polyesters; Shrinkage; Supercritical fluid extraction; Adiabatic expansion; Depressurizations; Experimental evidence; External pressures; Phenomenological modeling; Pressure derivatives; Quasi-isothermal; Specific internal energy; Foams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085258079

Methane observations indicate that after almost a decade of stagnation, from 2006, a sudden and continuing global mixing ratio increase took place. We applied a general circulation model to simulate the global atmospheric budget, variability, and trends of methane for the period 1997-2016. Using interannually constant CH4 a priori emissions from 11 biogenic and fossil source categories, the model results are compared with observations from 17 Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) surface stations and intercontinental Civil Aircraft for the Regular observation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrumented Container (CARIBIC) flights, with > 4800 CH4 samples, gathered on > 320 flights in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere.</p> Based on a simple optimization procedure, methane emission categories have been scaled to reduce discrepancies with the observational data for the period 1997-2006. With this approach, the all-station mean dry air mole fraction of 1780 nmol mol-1 could be improved from an a priori root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.31 % to just 0.61 %, associated with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.79. The simulated a priori interhemispheric difference of 143.12 nmol mol-1 was improved to 131.28 nmol mol-1, which matched the observations quite well (130.82 nmol mol-1).</p> Analogously, aircraft measurements were reproduced well, with a global RMSD of 1.1 % for the measurements before 2007, with even better results on a regional level (e.g., over India, with an RMSD of 0.98 % and R2Combining double low line0.65). With regard to emission optimization, this implied a 30.2 Tg CH4 yr-1 reduction in predominantly fossil-fuel-related emissions and a 28.7 Tg CH4 yr-1 increase of biogenic sources.</p> With the same methodology, the CH4 growth that started in 2007 and continued almost linearly through 2013 was investigated, exploring the contributions by four potential causes, namely biogenic emissions from tropical wetlands, from agriculture including ruminant animals, and from rice cultivation, and anthropogenic emissions (fossil fuel sources, e.g., shale gas fracking) in North America. The optimization procedure adopted in this work showed that an increase in emissions from shale gas (7.67 Tg yr-1), rice cultivation (7.15 Tg yr-1), and tropical wetlands (0.58 Tg yr-1) for the period 2006-2013 leads to an optimal agreement (i.e., lowest RMSD) between model results and observations. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Therefore, mesophilic digestion of swine manure was carried out in a reactor with an H2 addition rate of 7.2 mL/min (at a 4:1H2: CO2 ratio) and an organic loading rate of 2.0 g of volatile solids (VS)/(L∙d). After H2 was injected into the reactor, the maximum average methane yield increased from 189 to 245 L/kg VS under intermittent mixing conditions. The acetate concentration increased to a maximum of 1600 mg/L but the methane yield was reduced to 210 L/kg VS, which was attributed to a reduction in acetoclastic methanogen abundance in the system due to continuous mixing. The combination of homoacetogenic Clostridium and the Methanosaeta acetoclastic methanogens instead of hydrogenotrophic methanogens appears to have played a vital role in converting the added H2 into CH4 in the mesophilic reactor. However, hydrogenotrophic methanogens accounted for approximately 10% of the total metabolic activity while having a relative abundance of less than 0.5% among the methanogens, after the acetoclastic were inhibited. © 2020","Acetoclastic methanogens; Anaerobic digestion; Continuous mixing; Homoacetogens; In-situ biogas upgrading; Microbial community structure","Biogas; Fertilizers; Methane; Methanogens; Mixing; Acetoclastic methanogens; Biogas upgrading; Continuous mixing; Homoacetogens; Microbial community structures; Anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion; biogas; community structure; hydrogen; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; mixing; Clostridium; Methanosaeta; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081643183

However, the state-of-the-art compact carbon electrodes succumb to an electrode matrix with sluggish ion-transfer kinetics and unsatisfying volumetric performance. Herein, a molten-salt pyrolysis strategy is presented for preparing a fluorine and nitrogen dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet (F/N-CNS). During the molten-salt pyrolysis, nitrogen- and fluorine-rich precursors were converted into a unique two-dimensional carbon nanostructure with in-plane micropores and tailor-made fluorine/nitrogen dual doping. The as-fabricated thick and compact electrode of the F/N-CNS demonstrates a high packing density of ∼1 g cm-3, fast ion-transfer kinetics, and largely boosted pseudocapacitive characteristics. As a result, the F/N-CNS electrode in a two-electrode configuration exhibits a high volumetric capacitance of 255 F cm-3 (1 A g-1), a high volumetric energy density of 18.8 W h L-1 in an aqueous electrolyte, and an exceptional cycling stability for 20 000 cycles with almost no capacitance loss.

Among them, the problems of energy shortage and environmental pollution have become increasingly serious. The quick development of the big data has brought new challenges and opportunities for environmental management. In this paper, we propose a new data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to analyze the energy and environmental efficiency of industrial sectors from China's 30 provincial-level regions in order to determine the potential and route for energy saving (ES) and carbon emission reduction (CER). The new DEA model not only considers the dynamic data, but also involves the technology heterogeneity and closest targets, which could achieve the potential or provide the route for ES and CER step by step with least effort. The new approach is illustrated by using the regional industrial dataset of China and some implications for ES and CER are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Carbon emission reduction; Data envelopment analysis; Energy saving","Big data; Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Carbon emission reductions; Closest targets; Economic growths; Energy shortages; Environmental efficiency; Environmental pollutions; Industrial sector; New approaches; Data reduction; carbon; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; economic growth; emission control; energy efficiency; industrial emission; Article; carbon emission reduction; China; data analysis; data envelopment analysis; energy conservation; environmental impact; environmental management; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; priority journal; renewable energy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076532858

Moreover, the statistics data of coal and solid biomass consumption for rural households are significantly underestimated, which has a negative impact on the air pollution control. In this study, Henan province, an agricultural province in China, is taken as a case to analyze the county-level emission characteristics and emission reduction potential of rural household combustion. Firstly, activity data at county-level are obtained through regression based on partial activity data from field survey in 2016, and a high-resolution emission inventory of multi-type air pollutants from rural residential combustion is established. Then, twelve abatement technologies are selected to replace coal and solid biomass used in heating and cooking. A new optimization model is established based on the rural household burden ratio to discuss the optimal emission reduction schemes at county-level under five substitution scenarios. The results show that the total emissions of SO2, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, CO, NH3 and VOCs from rural residential combustion in Henan province are estimated at about 108.6, 30.9, 72.7, 113.5, 1141.9, 19.6 and 110.0 kt, respectively. The inventory results of different counties vary greatly, with PM2.5 emissions ranging from 7.9 t to 1550.3 t. Counties with large emissions have more agricultural activities. Among the abatement technologies, air source heat pump (ASHP) and palisade structure (PS) are more suitable for promotion in rural areas. The PM2.5 emissions in the five substitution scenarios are 99.0%, 98.8%, 99.1%, 98.6% and 98.8% lower than BAU-scenario, and S1-scenario is more conducive to rural emission reduction with considering the costs. It is suggested that the government should pay more attention to the air pollution caused by rural household combustion and improve the existing energy statistics system, especially for solid biomass. Abatement technologies suitable for heating and cooking in rural areas should be actively promoted, such as air source heat pump. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emission inventory; Field survey; Optimizing; Reduction potential; Rural residential combustion","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Air pollution; Ammonia; Biomass; Coal combustion; Emission control; Heating; Housing; Rural areas; Abatement technologies; Agricultural activities; Emission characteristics; Emission inventories; Emission reduction potentials; High-resolution emission; Optimization modeling; Technology optimization; Air source heat pumps; atmospheric pollution; coal combustion; emission inventory; field survey; heating; optimization; rural area; rural population; air pollutant; article; attention; biomass; China; combustion; cooking; government; heat; heating; household; rural area; China; Henan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082743708

The government has started to implement the clean heating with ambitious targets. However, the specific heating status is not clear, especially in rural areas, thus leading to significant obstacles to policy formulation and air pollution control. In order to understand the current heating conditions and heating behaviors of households in more detail, we conduct a field survey of household heating in towns and villages across northern China from December 2017 to March 2018. The survey results show that more than 75% of rural households still rely on traditional heating methods, such as coal, firewood, kang, and a simple stove. Household income, awareness of using heating fuels, and government subsidies may have a certain impact on heating fuel choice. In addition, approximately 34.6% of rural households do not use any housing insulation measures, which is also of concern when focusing on the heating quality. Lastly, considering the huge cost of rural household clean energy transition, we suggest that only a few regions are encouraged to turn to electricity or natural gas for heating, while most other regions transition to using clean coal and attach more importance to improving the quality of heating stoves. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Clean heating; Heating fuels; Heating tools; Households; Self-heating; Survey","atmospheric pollution; electricity; field survey; heating; household energy; insulation; natural gas; small town; village; China; China; city; cooking; heating; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; questionnaire; rural population; Air Pollution, Indoor; China; Cities; Cooking; Heating; Particulate Matter; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080911288

The combustion of diesel fuels used by internal and external port-related container trucks and in-port machineries can release various pollutants, causing air pollution. The terminals are close to the residential area, and the emissions are concentrated, which is worth paying attention to. This study aims to synthetically assess the port-related emissions and their environmental impacts. We firstly constructed an emission inventory of air pollutants in the port of Shanghai and then used the WRF-CMAQ model to estimate the influence of port-related source emissions on air quality. The results show that the annual emissions of SO2, NOX, CO, VOCS, PM, PM10, PM2.5, CO2, BC and OC caused by cargo-handling equipment were 21.88 t, 1811.22 t, 1741.72 t, 222.76 t, 61.52 t, 61.42 t, 58.41 t, 141,805.40 t, 26.80 t and 10.07 t in 2015. The emissions of NOX, CO, VOCS, PM10 and PM2.5 caused by external port-related container trucks were 18,002.92 t, 5308.0 t, 1134.57 t, 711.12 t and 640.58 t. The exhaust of external port-related container trucks was much larger than that of cargo-handling equipment, so the impact on air quality was also higher than that of the machinery. The peak annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and NOX contributed by the port-related sources were 1.75 μg/m3 and 49.21 μg/m3, respectively, which accounted for 3.08% and 36.7%, respectively, of the simulated ambient concentrations by all the anthropogenic emissions in Shanghai. Our results imply that the emission control policy to reduce the combined port-related emissions, especially for the cargo-delivery transportation phase from port to city, is key for large coastal port cities such as Shanghai. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; Cargo-handling equipment; Emission inventory; External container trucks; Port-related emission","air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; combustion; emission control; emission inventory; environmental impact; particulate matter; residential location; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085688368

Since the Eu2+ ions occupied two diverse sites in the host, the resultant compounds emitted two distinct emissions in blue and yellow regions. In particular, the blue emission is ascribed to the Sr2+ sites, while the yellow emission is attributed to Ca2+ sites. By adjusting the content ratio between Ca2+ and Sr2+ ions, the emitted color can be changed from yellowish-brown to blue upon 365 nm excitation. Furthermore, with the aid of the fluorescence intensity rate technology, the temperature-sensing ability of the synthesized phosphors is revealed by means of detecting the inequable responses of the blue and yellow emissions to the temperature. When x = 0.4, the maximum relative sensitivity of the developed samples is 1.181% K-1. Importantly, the sensor sensitivities of the resultant phosphors can be adjusted by engineering the composition. These features elaborate that the Eu2+-activated Li4(Sr1-xCa1+x)(SiO4)2 phosphors with high sensor sensitivities present as one of most promising candidates for noninvasive optical thermometers. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Fiber optic sensors; Light emission; Phosphors; Silicon; Thermometers; Building blockes; Fluorescence intensities; Multi-color emissions; Optical thermometer; Relative sensitivity; Sensor sensitivity; Temperature sensing; Yellow emissions; Temperature sensors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086505693

For this purpose, the quadratic model is applied to measuring emission trends and the Qualitative Flexible Multiple Criteria Method (QUALIFLEX) is used for measuring sustainable energy investment alternatives by the several emission levels. Forecasted values of 29 provinces in China are converted into the linguistic and fuzzy numbers based on IT2 FS respectively to measure the priorities of emission reduction for sustainable economies.

This particularly concerns cities in arid/semi-arid regions which cover two fifths of the global land area and are home to more than one third of the world's population. Focusing on the desert city of Be'er Sheva Israel, we investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of urban–rural and intra-urban temperature variability by means of satellite observation, vehicular traverse measurement, and computer simulation. Our study reveals a well-developed nocturnal canopy layer urban heat island in Be'er Sheva, particularly in the winter, but a weak diurnal cool island in the mid-morning. Near surface air temperature exhibits weak urban–rural and intra-urban differences during the daytime (<1°C), despite pronounced urban surface cool islands observed in satellite images. This phenomenon, also recorded in some other desert cities, is explained by the rapid increase in surface skin temperature of exposed desert soils (in the absence of vegetation or moisture) after sunrise, while urban surfaces are heated more slowly. The study highlights differences among the three methods used for describing urban temperature variability, each of which may have different applications in fields such as urban planning, climate change mitigation, and epidemiological research. © 2019 The Authors.

Nevertheless, CO2 reduction selectivity is still low due to the low concentration of CO2 near the catalyst surface and the high energy barrier for CO2 activation. This paper describes an AuCu nanochain aerogel (NC-AuCu) with abundant grain boundaries (GBs) that promote the accumulation and activation of CO2 for further electrochemical reduction, employing in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. GBs can induce a strong local electric field to concentrate the electrolyte cations and thus accumulate CO2 near the catalyst surface. NC-AuCu exhibits a superior Faradaic efficiency of close to 100% for CO2 electroreduction to CO at an extremely low overpotential of 110 mV with a high CO partial current density of 28.6 mA cm-2 in a flow cell. Coupling with a Si solar cell to convert solar energy to CO, a very high conversion efficiency of ∼13.0% is achieved.

Low-carbon strategies can be defined from carbon (C) footprint and ecological pressure caused by energy consumption. We hypothesized that this should be done at the regional and city levels because factors controlling C footprints vary with location and time, yet there is actually little knowledge at local levels. Here, we mapped the C emissions and footprint of 11 cities in the Zhejiang Province of China, a rapidly growing area of about 57 million inhabitants, which is representative of the strong economic growth in China. The C footprint is expressed as the land surface necessary to adsorb C emissions. We studied spatio-temporal evolution of C footprints from 2005 to 2015 using the center of gravity method. Results show that total annual C emissions due to energy consumption in Zhejiang increased by 40.83 million tons (55.8%) from 2005 to 2011. Then, from 2011 to 2015, C emissions decreased by 5.8%, which is explained by the 5-year national plan aiming at decreasing emissions. Similarly, the total C footprint increased by 55.8% from 29,201,904 hm2 in 2005 to 45,496,817 hm2 in 2011 and then declined by 5.8% from 2011 to 2015. At the city level, Ningbo has the largest C footprint contribution, whereas Lishui the lowest. Zhoushan shows an increase in C emissions and footprint, whereas Hangzhou and Shaoxing show a decline. The center of gravity of the C footprint is located in Shaoxing and is moving southeast from 2006 to 2011. Overall, our findings reveal the high spatial heterogeneity of C footprint at the regional and city levels, implying that national low-carbon strategies should be adapted at lower levels for higher efficiency. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon footprint; Energy consumption; Spatio-temporal heterogeneity; Zhejiang Province",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080925251

Based on the GHG inventory guidelines provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this study calculated GHGs from the municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal sector (including landfill, incineration, and compost) in China during the period 2002–2017. Overall GHG emission from the MSW disposal sector increased from 30,392.0 Gg CO2 in 2002 to 76,623.0 Gg in 2017. MSW landfill contributed most to GHG emissions as indicated by the emission share of landfill decreasing from a peak value of 93.5% in 2002 to 65.8% in 2017. GHG emissions from MSW incineration increased rapidly from less than 3.0% in 2002 to 32.8% in 2017. In 2017, East China contributed the most among the seven regions of China, while the Northwest contributed the least. Methane mitigation technologies such as landfill gas to energy projects and functional solid cover utilization are the primary measures for reducing GHG emissions from landfill; conversion of the treatment method from landfill to incineration is another effective measure; MSW sorting and source reduction of waste amounts prior to incineration were also found to be promising strategies. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","climate change; GHG emission inventory; incinerator; landfill; municipal solid waste","Budget control; Climate change; Composting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Refuse incinerators; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Anthropogenic sources; Disposal activities; GHG emission; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Inventory guidelines; Landfill-gas-to-energy projects; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Waste disposal sector; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074870204

Sugarcane, a sugar crop planted in warmer climate, suffers dramatically from drought stress. Bacterial communities colonizing the rhizosphere, where roots sense drought stress initially, have been well studied for their beneficial effects on plant growth and health. The Ea-DREB2B gene cloned from the sugarcane, Saccharum arundinaceum, belongs to the DREB2 subgroup of the DREB gene family, which is involved in drought response regulation. Here, we present a detailed characterization of the rhizoplane, rhizosphere, and bulk soil bacterial communities determined using a high-sequencing approach with the transgenic (TG) sugarcane variety GN18 harboring the drought-tolerant Ea-DREB2B gene and its isogenic wild-type (WT) variety FN95-1702 under the same environmental conditions. In addition, the total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) contents in each soil area were compared to explore the relationship between bacterial alteration in the TG and WT plants and environmental factors (TC, TN, TP, C:N, C:P, and N:P). Our results showed that the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of TG sugarcane were more similar and perfectly correlated with the environmental factors than those of the WT. This suggested that the bacterial communities of the TG plants were altered in response to the changes in root exudates. The results of our study suggest that the change in soil environment caused by transgenic sugarcane alters soil bacterial communities. © Copyright © 2020 Zhao, Jiang, Liu, Yang, Wang and Zhang.","bacterial community; drought-tolerant; Ea-DREB2B; environmental factor; sugarcane","carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; RNA 16S; abiotic stress; Actinobacteria; alpha diversity index; Article; Bacteroidetes; beta diversity index; Betaproteobacteria; biodiversity; Chloroflexi; connectivity; controlled study; crop production; Deltaproteobacteria; DNA modification; DNA replication; drought resistance; drought stress; ea dreb2b gene; ecological phenomena and functions; environmental factor; Gammaproteobacteria; gene; gene overexpression; Mantel Haenszel test; microbial community; molecular genetics; nonhuman; parameters; physical chemistry; plant development; plant growth; polymerase chain reaction; principal coordinate analysis; rhizosphere; Saccharum arundinaceum; Shannon diversity index; soil analysis; soil microflora; spectrophotometry; sugarcane; transgenic plant; Verrucomicrobia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085066275

In ICCI mode, by real-time control over the injection strategies of two independent direct injection systems (including fuel proportions, injection pressure, timing and duration), the concentration and reactivity stratifications of the air-fuel mixture can be flexibly adjusted. Therefore, in this paper, an experimental study was conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine to research the working mechanism of ICCI mode fueled with biodiesel and n-butanol. Experimental results showed that, the n-butanol/biodiesel ICCI combustion mode had great potential to improve engine efficiency and reduce its emissions. At medium load, the early biodiesel injection timing (SOI2) can shorten the combustion duration and improve the indicated thermal efficiency (ITE), and the maximum ITE can reach 50.7%. As the butanol energy ratio increased, the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions could be reduced due to the reduction of local high temperature, while NOx emissions were always at low level and it can meet Euro 6 emission standards. The butanol injection pressure had significant effect on the combustion and emission characteristics of the ICCI mode, properly increasing the butanol injection pressure can improve the ITE and reduce emissions, however, excessive butanol injection pressure deteriorates the combustion process, increased the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. In general, the butanol-biodiesel ICCI mode can achieve stable combustion under different loads while ensuring high efficiency and ultra-low emissions with a single injection of biodiesel at low/medium loads and two injections of biodiesel at high load. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Combustion and emission; Dual fuel direct injection; Intelligent charge compression ignition (ICCI); n-Butanol","Biodiesel; Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Real time control; Carbon monoxide emissions; Charge compression; Dual-fuels; Emission characteristics; Experimental investigations; Indicated thermal efficiency; N-butanol; Single-cylinder diesel engine; Direct injection; biofuel; carbon monoxide; chemical compound; combustion; diesel engine; emission; experimental study; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082647276

An efficient microecological system for Enteromorpha fermentation was constructed using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and granular sludge at mesophilic condition (35 °C). In order to investigate the influence of S. cerevisiae dosage on fermentation, biomethane production and variations in dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated. The results indicated that the microecosystem with added S. cerevisiae exhibited improved fermentation capacity. Specifically, biomethane production was improved by 18%, with a maximum methane yield of 331 mL/g VS, and the time required to reach 90% methane yield was reduced by 41%. There were positive linear relationships between S. cerevisiae dosage and the efficiency of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis (R2 &gt; 0.9). According to theoretical calculations, there was a positive effect of lower S. cerevisiae dosage (less than 0.93 g/g TS) on biomethane production, and excess dosage (more than 0.93 g/g TS) led to a negative effect due to volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation. The excitation–emission matrix (EEM) indicated that the humification index (HIX) and fulvic acid (FA) percentage of fluorescence regional integration in the system were decreased because the quinone and ketone groups of the FA accepted electrons from S. cerevisiae.

In rural Baoding and Langfang regions of Hebei Province, China, approximately 1.25 million households have shifted from coal to natural gas combustion. Field-based emission factors, modified combustion efficiency, and thermal efficiency of typical gas stoves were measured to evaluate the contribution of this shift to local air pollution control. Natural gas burning in stoves produced much lower air pollution than coal or other popular fuel/stove combinations due to its good fuel properties and high combustion efficiency. All tested gas stoves were rated at excellent tiers according to Chinese national standards. Through the adoption of coal-to-gas shift during a complete winter heating season, the total emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NO), methane (CH4), particles with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and ≤10 μm (PM10) were reduced by 98%, 56%, 33%, 80%, 82%, 99% and 99% in rural Baoding region, and by 99%, 37%, 25%, 83%, 71%, 99% and 99% in rural Langfang region, respectively. Correspondingly, GWC100 values decreased from 11 396 to 4 554 and from 13 408 to 7 881 ktCO2e·heat season−1·city−1 for the two cities, respectively. The estimated 7 083, 1 142, 8 834, 3 422, and 2 464 all-cause mortality cases resulting from the intakes of CO, NO, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10 were avoided in rural Baoding region, and 5 771, 467, 7 432, 2 762 and 1 987 cases were avoided in rural Langfang region, among which cardiopulmonary death was the primary reduced mortality.

The carbon dynamic is reflective of the forest characteristics and their interactions with climate, topographic, and soil conditions. In this study, we measured the carbon content and carbon density of canopy, shrub, understory vegetation, litter, and soil, and assessed carbon dynamics in three forest ecosystems (Cunninghamia lanceolate, Pinus massoniana, and Evergreen broad-leaved forests) with a combination of data from Fujian Provincial forest resource inventory. This study showed that the carbon content of the canopy layers increased over time, and the carbon content of the topsoil (0–30 cm) in the young forests was significantly higher than that in other age groups in Cunninghamia lanceolata forest and Pinus massoniana forest. Due to the carbon differences in the soil layer, the carbon stocks of the C. lanceolata forest and the P. massoniana forest declined from 1996 to 2007, but the carbon stocks of Evergreen broad-leaved forest increased. Besides, using the traditional carbon content coefficient (0.5) might underestimate the carbon sequestration potential of these forest ecosystems, especially for the mature forests. The coniferous forests displayed a short-term reduction in the carbon stocks of ecosystems between 10 and 20 years after afforestation, and the decline cannot be ignored in the carbon budget. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon content; Carbon sequestration; Forest ecosystem types; Subtropical forest","broad-leaved forest; carbon sequestration; coniferous forest; evergreen forest; forest ecosystem; forest resource; topsoil; understory; China; Cunninghamia; Cunninghamia lanceolata; Pinus massoniana; carbon; carbon sequestration; China; ecosystem; forest; soil; tree; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Ecosystem; Forests; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079767468

For dealing with multiple forms of uncertainties and dynamics concerning energy utilization, capacity expansions, and environmental protection, the inexact two-stage stochastic robust programming optimization model was developed. The novel programming method, which integrates interval parameter programming (IPP), stochastic robust optimization (SRO), and two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), was applied to electric power system planning and management in Harbin, China. Furthermore, the Gray-Markov approach was employed for effective electricity consumption prediction, and the forecasted results can be described as interval values with corresponding occurrence probability, aiming to produce viable input parameters of the optimization model. Ten scenarios were analyzed with different emissions reduction levels and electricity power structure adjustment modes, and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was selected to identify the most influential factors of planning decisions by selecting the optimal scheme. The results indicate that a diversified power structure that dominates by thermal power and is mainly supplemented by biomass power should be formed to ensure regional sustainable development and electricity power supply security in Harbin. In addition, power structure adjustment is more effective than the pollutants emission control for electricity power system management. The results are insightful for supporting supply-side energy reform, generating an electricity generation scheme, adjusting energy structures, and formulating energy consumption of local policies. © 2020 by the authors.","Emissions reduction; Optimization model; Post-optimization analysis; Power demand forecasting; Structure adjustment; Uncertainties","biomass power; demand analysis; electrical power; electricity generation; emission control; forecasting method; management practice; optimization; research work; stochasticity; sustainable development; thermal power; China; Harbin; Heilongjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085654395

In China, Theaceae has particularly high abundances and endemism, comprising ~75% of the total genera and ~46% of the total species worldwide. Therefore, predicting the response of Theaceae species to climate change is vital. In this study, we collected distribution data for 200 wild Theaceae species in China, and predicted their distribution patterns under current and future climactic conditions by species distribution modeling (SDM). We revealed that Theaceae species richness is highest in southeastern China and on Hainan Island, reaching its highest value (137 species) in Fujian Province. According to the IUCN Red List criteria for assessing species threat levels under two dispersal assumptions (no dispersal and full dispersal), we evaluated the conservation status of all Theaceae species by calculating loss of suitable habitat under future climate scenarios. We predicted that nine additional species will become threatened due to climate change in the future; one species will be classified as critically endangered (CR), two as endangered (EN), and six as vulnerable (VU). Given their extinction risks associated with climate change, we recommended that these species be added to the Red List. Our investigation of migration patterns revealed regional differences in the number of emigrant, immigrant, and persistent species, indicating the need for targeted conservation strategies. Regions containing numerous emigrants are concentrated in Northern Taiwan and coastal regions of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, while regions containing numerous immigrants include central Sichuan Province, the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region, southwest Yunnan Province, northwest Sichuan Province, and the junction of Guangxi and Hunan provinces. Lastly, regions containing persistent species are widely distributed in southern China. Importantly, regions with high species turnover are located on the northern border of the entire Theaceae species distribution ranges owing to upwards migration; these regions are considered most sensitive to climate change and conservation planning should therefore be prioritized here. This study will contribute valuable information for reducing the negative impacts of climate change on Theaceae species, which will ultimately improve biodiversity conservation efficiency. © 2020 The Authors.

This raises the question: of which lens is most appropriate to gain an understanding of the recent changes in China's domestic climate change policy? Although there is insufficient attention paid to political science accounts of central–local relations in climate governance, this article aims to contribute to the theoretical research on Chinese climate change policy by developing and applying a theoretical framework. Using this novel theoretical framework based on systems theory, this article analyses the complex allocation of power and incentives between the central and local governments. Methodologically, this research is based on expert interviews with relevant officials, negotiators, scholars, climate nongovernmental organizations, and emitter companies. Our analysis reveals that this evolution has been a nonlinear process that has been substantially influenced by central–local governmental interactions. Specifically, we find two trial-and-error processes in the evolution of China's climate change policy. We conclude with some reflections on the wider implications of this recentralization trend for the long-term sustainability of China's climate change policies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","central–local relationship; Chinese politics; climate change; emission trading system","climate change; environmental policy; governance approach; local government; policy analysis; power relations; research work; sustainability; theoretical study; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078880259

This decrease is attributed to the combined impacts of meteorology and emission sources changes, though the question of which is more important has raised great concerns. Four sensitivity experiments based on the Global-Regional Assimilation and Prediction System coupled with the Chinese Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment (GRAPES-CUACE) model, together with comparative analysis of the observed meteorological conditions and emission inventory between 2016 and 2017, are used to evaluate the relative contributions of meteorology and emission to the substantial reductions of PM2.5 concentration from December 2016 to December 2017. The results show that the meteorological conditions and emission in December 2017 were both beneficial to the PM2.5 decrease in Central and Eastern China. Regarding the entire region, 21.9% of the PM2.5 decrease was a result of the favorable meteorological conditions, and 78.1% of the decrease was a result of emission reductions, showing the distinct contributions of emission reductions on the air quality. The relative contributions of meteorology varied from 12.2% to 50.9% to the PM2.5 decrease from December 2016 to December 2017, while the emission contributed 49.1% to 87.8%, in different cities depending on geographical location and topography. Meteorology showed the largest contributions to the PM2.5 decrease from 2016 to 2017 in Beijing (BJ), which caused the greatest total decrease of PM2.5 compared to that of other cities.

Multiple advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are emerging to remediate petroleum hydrocarbons-contaminated soils, while very few studies have focused on the features of AOPs applied in soils. This review aims to provide an updated overview of the state of the science about the efficiency, influencing factors and environmental implications of AOPs. The key findings from this review include: 1) cyclodextrin and its derivatives can be used to synthesize targeting reagents; 2) soil organic matter (SOM), glucose and cement can activate persulfate; 3) SOM affects redox circumstance in soil and could be further developed for enhancing the catalysis effect of transition metals; 4) non-thermal plasma and wet oxidation are promising methods of AOPs to remove petroleum hydrocarbons from soil; 5) the occurrence, fate, and transformation of intermediates during the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil should be considered more. Overall, this review reveals an urgent need to develop the cost-effective remedial strategies for petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated soils, and to advance our knowledge on the generation, transport and propagation of radicals in soils. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced oxidation processes; Non-thermal plasma; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Radicals; Soil remediation","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Biogeochemistry; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Gasoline; Oxidation; Petroleum transportation; Reaction intermediates; Remediation; Soil cement; Soil conservation; Soils; Transition metals; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Nonthermal plasma; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Radicals; Soil remediation; Soil pollution; cement; cyclodextrin; glucose; hydrogen peroxide; ozone; petroleum derivative; soil organic matter; alkane; aromatic hydrocarbon; asphaltene; hydrocarbon; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; anthropogenic effect; efficiency measurement; environmental impact; factor analysis; oxidation; petroleum hydrocarbon; plasma; radical; remediation; soil pollution; soil remediation; acidity; alkalinity; atmospheric pressure; biodegradability; bioremediation; catalysis; energy consumption; energy transfer; environmental impact; hydrophilicity; oxidation; pH; plasma gas; Review; soil moisture; soil pollution; soil texture; soil treatment; bioremediation; ecosystem restoration; oil spill; oxidation reduction reaction; pollution; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; Alkanes; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Pollution; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Hydrocarbons; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Oxidation-Reduction; Petroleum; Petroleum Pollution; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078768653

Most studies have focused on the electric vehicle routing problem under a deterministic environment, neglecting the effects of uncertain factors in practical logistics distribution. Thus, a novel fuzzy electric vehicle routing problem with time windows and recharging stations (FEVRPTW) is investigated in this study, and a fuzzy optimization model is established based on credibility theory for this problem. In the presented model, fuzzy numbers are used to denote the uncertainties of service time, battery energy consumption, and travel time. Moreover, the partial recharge is allowed under the uncertain environment. To solve the model, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm enhanced with the fuzzy simulation method is proposed. In the proposed ALNS algorithm, four new removal algorithms are designed and integrated for addressing the FEVRPTW. To further improve the algorithmic performance, the variable neighborhood descent algorithm is embedded into the proposed ALNS algorithm and five local search operators are applied. The experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ALNS algorithm for solving the presented model. © 2019","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Credibility theory; Electric vehicle; Fuzzy simulation; Vehicle routing problem","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Fuzzy sets; Optimization; Travel time; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Credibility theory; Fuzzy optimization model; Fuzzy simulation; Uncertain environments; Variable neighborhood descents; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076679601

The results show that top-down performance targets can drive the adoption of atmospheric pollutant emission standards in Chinese provinces. Furthermore, the influence of vertical environmental performance targets on the adoption of local atmospheric pollutant emission standards is stronger in Chinese provinces that have adopted more similar standards in the previous period.

The Chinese economic system is such that local government competition has become a key factor affecting regional green development under the current leadership. Based on the inter-provincial panel data of 30 provinces in mainland China from 1997 to 2017, this paper uses the total-factor non-radial directional distance function and slack-based measure data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) to measure the green development efficiency of the provinces. Additionally, it also uses the Malmquist–Luenberger (ML) index to decompose green development efficiency and analyzes its internal driving factors. Finally, taking environmental regulation as a mediating variable, this paper empirically analyzes the influence mechanism of local government competition on green development efficiency from three perspectives including growth competition, fiscal competition and investment competition. The study found that: the green development efficiency of Chinese regions showed a downward trend, with significant regional differences; technological progress is the key factor to improve the efficiency of green development, and its role gradually decreases from eastern to western and central regions; pure technical efficiency has become a bottleneck restricting the improvement of green development efficiency, while scale efficiency shows significant regional differences; the growth competition, fiscal competition and investment competition of local government all have a significant inhibitory effect on the efficiency of green development. This paper puts forward policy suggestions supporting enterprise technology research and development, optimizing energy conservation and emission reduction as well as improving the local government performance evaluation system for green development. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, we constructed an optimal urban traffic structure model based on the concept of carbon emission satisfaction in order to estimate the absolute carbon emission reductions that can be achieved, and to objectively analyze the relative difficulty of achieving the emissions reduction goal. By considering Shanghai as an example, we found that rail transit is the dominant mode of transportation and that the proportion of travel in private cars can be greatly reduced, but buses should be maintained at the current level, whereas the proportion of taxis may be reduced slightly. In the existing traffic environment in Shanghai, after optimizing the urban traffic structure, we found that 47.62% of the carbon emissions reduction target can be achieved. However, given the excessive attention paid to the satisfaction of individuals and the government but the lack of consideration of the ecological environment, the carbon emission satisfaction with respect to urban traffic is low at present in Shanghai. Improving the carbon emission satisfaction by reducing the satisfaction of other targets is difficult, and the potential for reducing carbon emissions is limited for transportation. Therefore, Shanghai can only achieve its carbon emission reduction targets by implementing resource allocation, transportation technology, and urban planning measures in order to improve the existing traffic conditions, thereby achieving the goal of reducing carbon emissions but without affecting the satisfaction of other targets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission satisfaction; Multi-objective optimization; Traffic structure; Urban traffic","carbon emission; emission control; estimation method; source apportionment; traffic emission; transportation system; urban area; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084346884

This work reports results of one-year measurement of BC conducted in northern suburb of Nanjing, China from December 2017 to November 2018. Annual mean BC concentration was determined to be 2.78 μg/m³. BC concentration presented a “U” shape from December to November, lowest in summer and highest in winter. Nighttime BC concentration on average was higher than it in daytime, indicating heavier influence of meteorology than emissions. Diurnal pattern revealed that besides a clear emission-induced morning peak, meteorology played a more important role in governing BC changes in the rest of the day. Influences of meteorological factors on BC were in an order of boundary layer height, wind speed, temperature and relative humidity (RH), and further Granger causality analysis verified that the first three factors were indeed Granger causes of BC, while RH was not. Based on the diagnostic mass ratios of BC to CO, NO2 and SO2, as well as their correlation coefficients, we inferred that diesel vehicles rather than gasoline vehicles were the major BC emission source in suburban Nanjing; contributions from industry coal combustion were relatively less important. Back trajectory and potential source contribution analyses showed that regional rather than long-range transported air parcels led to the BC pollution in this site.

The results show that the degree of market integration and the total emissions, per capita emissions, and emission intensity of three types of pollutants (i.e., sulfur dioxide, industrial wastewater, and industrial smoke and dust) all show an inverted “U-shaped” curve relationship. When market integration exceeds a certain critical level, market integration will have an emission-reduction effect on these three types of pollutants. Most cities in the Yangtze River Delta region are in an emission-reduction state of market integration. Market integration facilitates strengthening the emission-reduction effects of technological innovation, environmental regulation, and energy efficiency. Moreover, both environmental pollution and market integration have a significant spatial spillover effect. The market integration in neighboring regions is conducive to reducing local pollution emissions. We suggest that China should accelerate market-oriented reform and promote regional market integration, so as to make full use of the emission-reduction effect of market integration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Environmental pollution emissions; Market integration; Relative price approach; Spatial spillover effect","sulfur dioxide; emission; emission control; environmental fate; environmental quality; market system; panel data; price dynamics; regulatory approach; spatial analysis; spillover effect; Article; carbon footprint; economic development; environmental factor; environmental policy; environmental protection; integration; market; pollution; river; smoke; waste water; China; city; environmental monitoring; industry; river; China; Yangtze River; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Rivers; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078793416

The demand for flexibility is increasing sharply with the rapid penetration of intermittent renewables in the power system. Meanwhile, in the coal dominated power system, the reduction on the share of coal-fired power will leave the power system with a more serious shortage of flexibility. The flexible nuclear operation has aroused wide attention as an important flexibility resource of the power system. To evaluate the role of the flexible nuclear operation on the coal-dominated power system, we first model the flexible operation of nuclear power plants (NPPs). Then we integrate the operation model of NPPs in a unit commitment and economic dispatch model. The model is further integrated into the power system operation simulation framework. Finally, we analyze the potential benefits of flexible nuclear operation using the power system operation simulation tool for a coal-dominated power system: Shandong province of China. The simulation results indicate that the flexible nuclear operation could effectively reduce start-up and shut-down times of coal-fired power units and help the power system to achieve a higher renewable energy penetration of 47.98%. The research suggested that it is feasible and beneficial to use NPPs to produce flexibility in the future power system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal-dominated power system; Flexibility; Nuclear power; Power system operation simulation; Renewable energy; Unit commitment","Coal; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Plant shutdowns; Plants (botany); Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Coal-fired power unit; Flexibility; Flexible operation; Intermittent renewables; Power system operations; Renewable energies; Renewable energy penetrations; Unit-commitment; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080039552

The five aspects of evaluation index system for green development competitiveness showed different development tendencies:the competitiveness of green high-quality growth and that of resource conservation and emission reduction sawa steady increase; the competitiveness of urban ecological environment quality and that of green lifestyle remained relatively stable, while the competitiveness of green investment declined slightly. Analysis of regional difference showed that the varying degree of western China was larger than that of eastern, central and northeastern China in order. Besides, the varying degree is becoming larger in eastern and northeastern regions while becoming lower in central and western regions. Convergence analysis showed that from 2003 to 2016, competitiveness level differed from region to region and there were no obvious signs of stochastic convergence at the national level. At the regional level, it can be found that the evaluation values of the eastern region saw stochastic dispersion from the national average.

Although the effectiveness of powerful control measures implemented by the Chinese State Council has been comprehensively evaluated in terms of reducing atmospheric primary pollutants, the effectiveness in mitigating photochemical pollution is less assessed and therefore the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The stringent emission controls implemented from 24 August to 6 September 2016 during the summit for the Group of Twenty (G20) provide us a unique opportunity to address this issue. Surface concentrations of atmospheric O3, PAN, and their precursors including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen dioxides (NOx ), in addition to the other trace gases and particulate matter, were measured at the National Reference Climatological Station (NRCS) (30.22° N, 120.17° E, 41.7ma.s.l) in urban Hangzhou. We found significant decreases in atmospheric PAN, NOx , total VOCs, PM2.5, and sulfur dioxide (SO2/under the unfavorable meteorological conditions during G20 (DG20) relative to the adjacent period before and after G20 (BG20 and AG20), indicating that the powerful control measures were effective in reducing the pollutant emissions in Hangzhou. Unlike with the other pollutants, daily maximum 8 h average (DMA8) O3 exhibited a slight increase and then decrease from BG20 to AG20, which was mainly attributed to the variation in the solar irradiation intensity and regional transport in addition to the contribution from the implementation of stringent control measures. Results from an observation-based chemical model (OBM) indicated that acetaldehyde and methylglyoxal (MGLY) were the most important second-generation precursors of PAN, accounting for 37.3 %-51.6% and 22.8 %-29.5% of the total production rates including the reactions of OVOCs, propagation of other radicals, and other minor sources. Moreover, we confirmed the production of PAN and O3 was sensitive to VOCs throughout the whole period, specifically dominated by aromatics in BG20 and DG20 but by alkenes in AG20. These findings suggested that reducing emissions of aromatics, alkenes, and alkanes would mitigate photochemical pollution including PAN and O3. Source appointment results attributed the reductions of VOC source and ozone formation potentials (OFPs) during G20 to the effective emission controls on traffic (vehicle exhaust) and industrial processes (solvent utilization and industrial manufacturing). However, fuel combustion and biogenic emissions both weakened such an effect with a sizable contribution to the VOC mixing ratios (18.8% and 20.9 %) and OFPs (25.6% and 17.8 %), especially during the latter part of G20 (G20 II) when anthropogenic VOCs were substantially reduced. This study highlights the effectiveness of stringent emission controls in relation to traffic and industrial sources, but a coordinated program related to controlling fuel combustion and biogenic emissions is also required to address secondary pollution. © 2020 Author(s).",,"atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; mitigation; nitrate; ozone; photochemistry; pollutant source; pollutant transport; pollution incidence; spatial variation; China; Hangzhou; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084635273

To find an effective solution to reduce carbon emissions, it is important to identify the dominant factors contributing to carbon emission intensity (CEI). Based on refined indicators and a dynamic spatial panel model, we build a comprehensive framework to quantify the impact of the industrial structure and technical progress on the CEI and conduct empirical research on 281 prefecture-level cities in China during 2006–2016. The results show that both spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity of CEI values are significant and positive among cities. Technical change and efficiency improvements are the dominant factors behind CEI change. Technical progress plays a significant role in reducing the CEI, whereas the carbon emissions rebound effect decreases these positive impacts. Further, the combined effect of industrial structure optimization and technical progress on reducing carbon intensity is not significant as we have expected. Based on our findings, we suggest specific, targeted policies to reduce CEI, including promoting regional green technology, focusing on combining green technologies with green cities, formulating different urban development strategies and strengthening cooperation among cities. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emission intensity (CEI); China; Dynamic spatial panel model; Industrial structure; Prefecture-level cities; Technical progress","Carbon; Climate change; Industrial research; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Structural optimization; Urban growth; Carbon emission intensities; China; Industrial structures; Panel model; Prefecture-level cities; Technical progress; Industrial emissions; carbon emission; development strategy; green economy; industrial structure; optimization; spatial data; technical change; technical efficiency; urban area; urban development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079343013

Here the temporal trends in potential evapotranspiration (PE) and precipitation were selected as climate change indicators, five possible scenarios were established and relationships between desertification and the climate change indicators were examined for different time periods across northern China. The results indicate that climate change was the primary or one of drivers of desertification reversion in the northeastern and northwestern regions of China between 1975 and. 1990, whereas the desertification reversion near Mu Us Desert was influenced primarily by human intervention. Climate change triggered desertification variation across the entire region, including the Hulenbur, Otigdag, Horqin, Horbq, and Mu Us deserts and the Sounite Grassland between 1990 and 2000. However, the desertification reversion near the Otindag, Mu Us and Horqin deserts was due primarily to human intervention. Desertification reversion occurred across 54,609 km2 between 2000 and 2005 in northern China and climate change was thought to be related to majority reversion, whereas the regions that experienced desertification development and aggravation, including the areas near the Hulunbuir and Nengjiang deserts, were influenced primarily by human intervention. Broad desertification reversion occurred across the North China region between 2005 and 2010, with 45,787 km2 experiencing desertification reversion compared with only 8026 km2 experiencing desertification development and aggravation, however, climate change had a limited effect on desertification in this period.

The coating on graphite was prepared by flame spraying, plasma spraying and dipping sintering, then it was observed and characterized. The results show that the apparent quality of the obtained coating is intactness. Here, the spraying coating is composition uniform and structure compact; the dipping coating exhibits an obvious color change and presents the typical porous structure. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","CaZrO3; coated graphite; dipping; thermal spraying","Binary alloys; Coatings; Flame spraying; Graphite; Melting; Plasma spraying; Sintering; Solid state reactions; Thermal spraying; Titanium alloys; CaZrO3; Color changes; dipping; High temperature process; Melting materials; Porous structures; TiNi alloy; Thallium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071955582

Species responses often lag behind climate warming, but the reasons for such lags remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed multidecadal understory microclimate dynamics in European forests and show that thermophilization and the climatic lag in forest plant communities are primarily controlled by microclimate. Increasing tree canopy cover reduces warming rates inside forests, but loss of canopy cover leads to increased local heat that exacerbates the disequilibrium between community responses and climate change. Reciprocal effects between plants and microclimates are key to understanding the response of forest biodiversity and functioning to climate and land-use changes.

However, the production of conventional concrete causes more than 5% of anthropogenic CO2emissions and therefore there is a need for emission-reduced construction materials. One method to produce a solid, concrete-like construction material is microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). To get a better understanding of MICP it is important to be able to follow local pH changes in dissolution and precipitation processes of CaCO3. In this work we present a new method to study processes of MICP at the micro-scalein situand in real time. We present two different methods to monitor the pH changes during the precipitation process of CaCO3. In the first method, the average pH of small sample volumes is measured in real time, and pH changes are subsequently correlated with processes in the sample by comparing to optical microscope results. The second method is introduced to follow local pH changes at a grain scalein situand in real time. Furthermore, local pH changes during the dissolution of CaCO3crystals are monitored. We demonstrate that these two methods are powerful tools to investigate the pH changes for both MICP precipitation and CaCO3dissolution for knowledge-based improvement of MICP-based material properties. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Concrete industry; Concrete products; Dissolution; Knowledge based systems; Carbonate precipitation; Conventional concrete; Knowledge-based improvements; Local pH; pH change; Precipitation process; Real time; Small samples; Precipitation (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086437141

With this aim, climate was analysed and cities were classified based on it. The analysis of those cities’ energy consumption and CO2 emissions allowed for drawing conclusions. Once aware of the climate zones in which energy consumption and emissions are higher, these mentioned conclusions could help to take further actions. An index has been defined to facilitate this analysis. This paper shows the case of Spain for illustrative purposes. This type of study has been carried out in some detail in many countries, but not in Spain yet. This paper tries as well to fill the existing gaps in studies that relate climate to thermal and electric energy consumption. For this purpose, it analyses the 145 cities in Spain that have more than 50,000 inhabitants. Knowing all this is essential in all regions and countries. It will allow for taking proper actions for promoting the energy saving and the use of alternative energy sources that reduce CO2 emissions. According to the study carried out in this paper, the extremer the climate of a city is, the higher the thermal energy consumption is. This consumption decreases in softer climates. However, electric energy consumption is similar in all cities independent of the climate they have. With regard to CO2 emissions, it was calculated that the higher the energy consumption of a city is, the higher these emissions are. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Buildings; Cities; Climate; Emissions; Energy consumption; Spain","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate effect; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy conservation; energy planning; energy use; residential energy; thermal power; Spain; carbon dioxide; city; climate; climate change; Spain; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Climate; Climate Change; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079827488

Climatic conditions interact with local microtopography, which might either buffer or exacerbate the degree of climatic stress. Here we sought to understand how extremely dry growing seasons affected the composition and productivity of desert ephemeral communities growing in sand dunes from the Gurbantunggut desert in Central Asia, and to which extent did microtopography modulate the response. We set up a rainfall manipulation study on four sand dune microtopographies and, during two consecutive years, we measured soil moisture, nutrients and texture, ephemeral layer composition, plant phenology, biomass accumulation and biomass allocation patterns for the dominant species. We observed significant biomass reductions during the extreme drought but plant community richness and composition were not affected, indicating that the composition of the ephemeral layer in this desert ecosystem may resist under extreme conditions. Additionally, extreme drought increased biomass allocation to reproductive organs of the dominant species. There were also significant microtopographic effects as the sensitivity of biomass to drought in western aspects was larger than in eastern aspects. Our results indicate that previously overlooked microtopographical differences may mediate the impact of climate change on plant communities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cold desert; Ephemeral plants; Extreme drought; Microtopography","Biomass; Drought; Ecosystems; Landforms; Productivity; Soil moisture; Textures; Biomass accumulation; Climatic conditions; Cold deserts; Ecosystem functions; Ephemeral plants; Gurbantunggut deserts; Micro topography; Rainfall manipulations; Climate change; rain; climate change; climate effect; drought; ecosystem function; extreme event; microtopography; net ecosystem production; plant community; resource allocation; soil moisture; Article; bioaccumulation; biomass allocation; Central Asian; climate change; controlled study; crop production; desert; drought; ecosystem monitoring; environmental stress; ephemeral species; Erodium; Erodium oxyrrhynchum; extreme environment; genital system; human; nonhuman; phenology; physical chemistry; plant community; plant growth; precipitation; priority journal; sand; seasonal variation; soil analysis; soil moisture; species richness; topography; water supply; Asia; biomass; desert climate; plant; Central Asia; China; Gurbantunggut Desert; Xinjiang Uygur; Asia; Biomass; Desert Climate; Droughts; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079376566

Most respondents reported to have used some adaptation strategies, such as using improved rice varieties, early planting, field bunding and rice transplanting. We also found that 68% of the respondents had medium adaptive capacity with seasonal and unsustainable alternative income sources. This finding at least partially explains why off-farm jobs in the area are not available and why 50% of the respondents had offered farm labor services as their alternative income source. We further demonstrate that smallholder rice farmers in the study area were vulnerable to several socio-economic challenges such as weak asset base and inadequate institutional and governmental support. These challenges threatened their ability to adapt to more intensive climate change impacts in the future.

Urban agglomerations and rural ecosystems in the Mediterranean region and globally are interlinked through the flows of resources/nutrients and wastes. Contributing to balancing these cycles, the present study advocates standardized biochar as a soil amendment, produced from Mediterranean suitable biowaste, for closing the nutrient loop in agriculture, with parallel greenhouse gas reduction, enhancing air quality in urban agglomerations, mitigating climate change. The study's scope is the contextualization of pyrolytic conditions and biowaste type effects on the yield and properties of biochar and to shed light on biochar's role in soil fertility and climate change mitigation. Mediterranean-type suitable feedstocks (biowaste) to produce biochar, in accordance with biomass feedstocks approved for use in producing biochar by the European Biochar Certificate, are screened. Data form large-scale and long-period field experiments are considered. The findings advocate the following: (a) pyrolytic biochar application in soils contributes to the retention of important nutrients for agricultural production, thereby reducing the use of fertilizers; (b) pyrolysis does not release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, contributing positively to the balance of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, with carbon uptake by plant photosynthesis; (c) biochar stores carbon in soils, counterbalancing the effect of climate change by sequestering carbon; (d) there is an imperative need to identify the suitable feedstock for the production of sustainable and safe biochar from a range of biowaste, according to the European Biochar Certificate, for safe crop production. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; Biochar; Climate change; Mediterranean; Pyrolysis; Soil amendment; Waste","Agglomeration; Agricultural robots; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Plant shutdowns; Soils; Agricultural productions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gas reductions; Mediterranean ecosystem; Mediterranean region; Sequestering carbon; Urban agglomerations; Urban growth; agglomeration; air quality; biochar; climate change; crop plant; experimental study; growth rate; nutrient availability; pyrolysis; rural area; soil fertility; urban economy; waste management; Mediterranean Region",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085953912

The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the changes in SOC and N contents in density fractions under Kobresia pasture due to degradation and (2) to explore the contributions of the changes of SOC and N in density fractions to the changes of SOC and N in whole soil. Materials and methods: The impact of Kobresia pasture degradation on SOC and N fractions was investigated in the permafrost region of the Tibetan Plateau. A continuously degraded pasture was identified and classified into three categories of vegetation cover according to their degrees of degradation (i.e., vegetation cover decline from 90% ± 6.6% to 70% ± 8.3% and 45% ± 8.7%). The SOC and N fractions were separated by using the density separation method. Results and discussion: The Kobresia pasture degradation significantly decreases SOC and N contents and stocks in soils. The SOC and N contents in the whole soil were positively correlated with the SOC and N contents in the light and heavy fractions (p < 0.001, respectively). The SOC and N contents were significantly correlated with soil pH and the contents of soil moisture, clay, silt, and sand. The ratio of SOC to total N in the whole soil was positively correlated with the ratio of SOC to N in heavy fractions (p < 0.001) rather than the ratio of SOC to N in light factions (p > 0.05). When pasture degraded from vegetation covers 90% to 45%, SOC stock at 0–40-cm soil layer decreased by 28.7% and N stock decreased by 39.2% in the whole soil; 56.6% and 47.6%, respectively, in the light fractions and 14.3% and 40.6%, respectively, in the heavy fractions. The depletion rates of N were higher than those of SOC in the heavy fractions and whole soil. At all sites, more than 80% of the SOC and N stocks were protected in heavy fractions. Conclusions: These results indicate that a decoupling depletion of SOC and soil N appeared with the Kobresia pasture degradation in the permafrost region of the Tibetan Plateau. The Kobresia pasture degradation affects the SOC and N fractions differently and thus regulates soil carbon and N cycling in the permafrost soils on the Tibetan Plateau. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Heavy fractions; Kobresia pasture; Light fractions; Soil organic matter; Tibetan Plateau","biodegradation; nitrogen; organic carbon; pasture; permafrost; soil carbon; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Kobresia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082676705

Mangrove reforestation has been practiced as a strategy to restore the ecological functions of coastal environments. However, it remains unclear how introduced mangrove species impact their sediment microbial communities and CH4 emissions. Here we compared the changes in CH4 emissions, sediment properties, methanogenic and methanotrophic communities between two distinct mangrove habitats: one dominated by Kandelia obovata (KO, native species) and the other dominated by Sonneratia apetala (SA, introduced species). Compared with the KO sediment, the SA sediment had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher levels of CH4 emissions (1643 vs. 593 μmol m−2 day−1), pH value (7.1 vs. 6.4), and ammonium (6.5 vs. 5.1 mg kg−1), but lower levels of salinity (3.8 vs. 11.9 ppt), total carbon (12.3 vs. 40.7 g kg−1), total nitrogen (2.3 vs. 4.5 g kg−1), and sulfate (1865 vs. 2959 mg L−1). Analysis of the methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) and particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) genes showed that SA introduction led to a significant (P &lt; 0.01) shift of sediment CH4-cycling microbial communities with increased alpha-diversity of methanogenic communities, and decreased abundances of methanotrophs compared with the KO sediment. Specifically, the relative abundance of Methanosarcina increased, while the relative abundance of type II methanotrophs decreased in the SA sediment, so the increased CH4 emissions in the SA sediment could be attributed to greater capacity of CH4 production and reduced CH4 consumption. Also, salinity, pH, total carbon, total nitrogen and sulfate were found to be important environmental factors shaping the CH4-cycling microbial community structure. This study provides insights into the impact of mangrove introduction on CH4-cycling microbial communities and CH4 emissions, which has very important implications about mangrove ecosystems in regulating global climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Kandelia obovata; Mangrove; Methane; Methanogen; Methanotroph; Sonneratia apetala reforestation","Climate change; Ecosystems; Methane; Methanogens; Microorganisms; Reforestation; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Kandelia obovata; Mangrove; Methanogenic community; Methanotrophs; Methyl-coenzyme M reductase; Microbial community structures; Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMOA); Sonneratia apetala; Plants (botany); environmental factor; global climate; mangrove; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; reforestation; relative abundance; Kandelia obovata; Methanosarcina; Methylocystaceae; Sonneratia apetala",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081121696

In the non-dock bicycle-sharing system planning, the definition of coverage area and the division of sub service areas are highly essential and fundamental, which get little attention in the existing studies. In this paper, we propose a market-oriented methodology for non-dock bicycle-sharing system planning. Firstly, the potential demand of bicycle-sharing use is identified using mobile phone data. Then, a link network is constructed to represent the spatial distribution of potential demand. The algorithm of community detection is applied to the link network to discover the densely connected nodes in the area and define the division of sub service areas. Finally, the potential patterns of bicycle-sharing use, the spatial distribution of the potential demand, and the potential emission reduction are analysed based on the resulting division of sub service areas. The proposed method is tested using a data set of approximately 34 million GPS trajectories obtained in Tokyo. The area of Tokyo is subdivided into 21 sub service areas. Suggestions for bicycle management, infrastructure development, and the bicycle-sharing system planning are given regarding sub service areas with different properties. The potential emission reduction for the introduction of bicycle-sharing system is calculated in the area of Tokyo. © 2020","Bicycle-sharing; Climate change mitigation; Community detection; Emission reduction potentials; Spatial analysis; Sub-area division","Cellular telephones; Climate change; Commerce; Docks; Emission control; Hydraulic structures; Population dynamics; Spatial distribution; Spatial variables measurement; Bicycle sharing; Climate change mitigation; Community detection; Emission reduction potentials; Spatial analysis; Sub-areas; Bicycles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078157787

Furthermore, this understanding is vital for evaluating the impact of soil management on both soil quality and climate change. This study was conducted in a Loess revegetated small watershed and the effects of the topography and vegetation factors on the content and distribution of SOC at different soil depths were evaluated. Soil profiles (0–200 cm; n = 122) were sampled that represent six vegetation types (i.e., natural mixed forests, artificial mixed forests, artificial forests with a single tree species, shrubbery, and grassland) and four topographic factors (i.e., elevation, slope gradient, slope position, and slope aspect). The following results were obtained: (1) The mean SOC of the 200 cm soil profile ranged from 2.34 g kg−1 to 5.70 g kg−1, decreasing with increasing soil depth. (2) The interactions between vegetation type and topography and soil depth significantly impacted SOC (P &lt; 0.05). Significant differences in the SOC content (P &lt; 0.05) were also found for slope gradient, slope position, slope aspect, and elevation for 0–200, 0–160, 0–100, and 0–200 cm, respectively. (3) The relative contribution of topographic factors to the SOC content exceeded that of vegetation type in entire soil profile. Topography was the dominant factor controlling the spatial distribution of SOC in the studied small watershed.

Planting of the exotic species Sonneratia apetala can rapidly increase the mangrove area and biomass. Here, we studied the change in vegetation and the soil carbon stocks along the chronosequence of S. apetala plantations in Qi'ao Island, China. Five sites, including rehabilitated S. apetala of different ages (1, 4, 9, and 15 years) and 40-year-old mature native Kandelia obovata forests were investigated. Vegetation biomass and the soil carbon content from 0 to 100 cm were analyzed. The ecosystem carbon density (vegetation and soil) was then calculated. A positive and linear relationship was observed between the vegetation carbon stocks and age of S. apetala. The 15-year-old S. apetala already had a similar biomass to 40-year-old K. obovata. However, its soil and ecosystem carbon densities remained lower than those of K. obovata. Different from K. obovata, the majority of the biomass of S. apetala was reserved within the stem. Mature K. obovata had a larger proportion of soil carbon stock to ecosystem carbon stock. S. apetala can accumulate biomass rapidly, but it had a lower ecosystem carbon stock than the native mature K. obovata. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass carbon density; Carbon accumulation; Forest age; Soil carbon density; Sonneratia apetala plantation","Ecosystems; Reforestation; Soils; Vegetation; Carbon accumulation; Carbon density; Forest age; Soil carbon; Sonneratia apetala; Biomass; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; accumulation; afforestation; angiosperm; biomass; carbon storage; environmental change; forest cover; mangrove; plantation; soil carbon; above ground biomass; age; Article; below ground biomass; biomass; bulk density; carbon storage; China; chronosequence; community structure; controlled study; exotic species; forest; Kandelia obovata; mangrove; nonhuman; plantation; priority journal; soil; soil acidity; soil property; soil salinity; Sonneratia apetala; total biomass; vegetation; ecosystem; island (geological); qi; China; Guangdong; Qiao Island; Kandelia obovata; Sonneratia apetala; Biomass; Carbon; China; Ecosystem; Islands; Qi; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079323851

This has led the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to integrate a comprehensive energy master plan for to develop the energy sector by 2029. Of the total residential energy consumption, 61 percent is consumed for heating spaces. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by domestic stock in Jordan are anticipated to increase by 59 percent in 2018. Most households heat their houses using traditional devices such as portable unflued kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves. Combustion of such heaters generates toxic by-products causing symptoms and illness among residents as a result of poor indoor air quality. This paper discusses these issues in view of urban low-middle income apartments in the capital Amman, with a focus on investigating the types of stoves used and health implications associated with using them. A representative sample of 106 low-middle income households in urban Amman were surveyed, through semi-structured interviews, to explore how they responded to the environmental conditions. Results showed that unflued kerosene and LPG stoves were used for heating spaces by around 39 percent and 89 percent of the total households surveyed, respectively. It was also found that almost 65 percent of them used more than one device for heating their apartments. Furthermore, around 50 percent of those households reported different health problems related to asthma which could partially be due to the use of these heating devices. The field study also showed that almost 75 percent of households lived in apartments constructed with external envelopes of hollow cement blocks leading to poorer fabric performance. The paper concludes with calling for thrift retrofit interventions for existing low-middle income apartments and raising inhabitants’ awareness towards the proper use of stoves. This would enhance their thermal comfort, reduce carbon emissions and help improve residents’ quality of life, which eventually would contribute to ameliorating related health issues. © 2020 WIT Press.","Energy; GHG emissions; Health issues; Low-middle income apartments; Retrofit; Sustainable development; Unflued stoves; Urban Amman",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086776856

Climate change and human activity acted as two major factors inducing the reduction. However, little knowledge is acquired on how and to what extent the decadal climate change and human activity induced runoff variations, which is essential for regional water resources planning and management. In this study, the observed data of 3 hydrological stations and 31 meteorological stations were used to analyze the runoff variability, and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model (Xu Liang, Seattle, WA, United States of America) coupled with scenario simulation was employed to attribute runoff variation of each period. The results showed that runoff decreased significantly at a rate of-1.01 x 108 m3year-1 with obvious stage characteristic during 1961-2016. The water yield was highest in the 1960s and varying degrees of decline were detected in the following periods, resulting in a decrease of available fresh water by 20.54%-58.24%. Human activity had a dominant contribution to induce an increasing runoff decline from 2.068 to 5.776 km3, while the effect of climate was relatively small and lead to runoff reduction, except in the 1970s.

Here, we firstly investigated the spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5 and analyzed its association with weather conditions and emission changes. Then, WRF-Chem simulations were conducted for an entire year to obtain various emission sectors' contributions to the PM2.5 mass by a hybrid method, which considers both the proportions of various components as well as each sector contributing to these components. The results showed that residential emissions had the largest contribution to PM2.5 because of its dominating contribution for primary components of PM2.5 (BC and POA), which can explain &gt;70% of PM2.5. Seasonally, the residential contributions to PM2.5 were higher in the non-monsoon period than in the monsoon period because of the higher contribution ratios to primary components. Regionally, as an essential source of the gaseous precursors, the industrial and transportation sectors were the second-largest contributors to PM2.5 in the highly populated urban (HP) and remote background (RM) regions, respectively. Further assessment of emission reduction measures indicated that eliminating 50% of residential emissions induced a 29.4% and 33.1% decrease in the annual PM2.5 mass of the HP and RM regions, respectively, with higher decrease proportions in non-monsoon. By comparison, eliminating 50% of industrial emissions caused a significantly lower decrease in PM2.5 for both HP (10%) and RM (4.6%). Eliminating 50% of transportation emissions led to PM2.5 concentrations to decline by 9.3% in RM, which was greater than the 4.6% reduction caused by eliminating 50% of industrial emissions. Therefore, in addition to focusing on the residential sector, especially in non-monsoon in western China, the transportation sector should be a focus to alleviate PM2.5 pollution on the Tibetan Plateau.

Therefore, considering the regional and industrial heterogeneities, this paper introduces a global multi-hierarchy meta-frontier Data Envelopment Analysis approach to analyze the dynamic performance of CO2 emissions and to estimate the current CO2 emissions inefficiency and reduction potential in the manufacturing industry of China's 30 provinces, which are separated into three components, namely, structural characteristics, technology gaps, and resource allocation levels. The results show that: (1) From 2003 to 2015, the CO2 emissions efficiency of China's manufacturing industry increased by a factor of 4.7, of which technological progress and optimization of industrial structure were the main driving forces. (2) At present, the CO2 emissions inefficiency of the manufacturing industry in mainland China is 0.7804, reflecting that 78.04% of its total CO2 emissions is excessive emissions, which is mainly caused by the low allocation efficiency. (3) The heavy sub-industry and the east region have the greatest potential for CO2 emissions reduction in the manufacturing and in the three regions of the country, respectively. In addition, by promoting the industrial restructuring, regional coordinated development, and strengthening the environmental regulations and promoting market-oriented reforms, China's manufacturing industry could reduce 29.65%, 11.55% and 36.84%, respectively, of its current CO2 emissions.

However, evidence from developing countries is limited although the concentrations of air pollution are disproportionably higher in these countries. We collected daily data on diabetes mortality, air pollution, and weather conditions from 16 Chinese provincial cities during 2007–2013. A quasi-Poisson regression combined with a distributed lag model was used to quantify the city-specific mortality risk of PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt; 10 μm). Then, a random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to pool effect estimates from 16 cities. We also calculated the attributable fraction and attributable number of diabetes mortality due to PM10. Effects of PM10 were found to be acute and limited to 3 days. Harvesting effect of PM10 was found during lag 4–10 days on diabetes mortality. An increase of 0.17% (95%CI: 0.01–0.34), 0.48% (95%CI: 0.22–0.73), and 0.53% (95%CI: 0.27–0.80) in diabetes mortality was associated with per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 at lag 0, 0–4 and 0–10 days, respectively. Totally, 5.76% (95%CI: 2.59–8.00%) and 5878 (95%CI: 2639–8163) deaths due to diabetes could be attributable to PM10. If the concentration of PM10 attained the Chinese government and WHO targets, the reduction in number of PM2.5-attributed diabetes deaths was 2016 and 5528, respectively. Higher effect estimates of PM10 were observed among females and those aged 0–64 years old at lag 0 day, while greater cumulative effects of PM10 were among males, the elderly aged 75 or over, and the illiterate at lag 0–10 days. However, the between-group differences were not statistically significant. It is one of the few studies on examining the attributable burden of diabetes mortality caused by particulate matter. Our findings indicated that effective efforts on controlling air pollution could reduce a prominent number of air pollution-related diabetes deaths. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Attributable fraction; China; Diabetes mortality; Particulate matter","age structure; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); developing world; diabetes; environmental effect; mortality risk; particulate matter; public health; China; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; child; China; city; diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; female; human; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; particulate matter; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Cities; Diabetes Mellitus; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083399894

Subsequently, the detailed Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) results for the pollutants were determined. The WRF-Chem model provided a clear perspective on the spatiotemporal distribution of air pollutants. High pollutant concentrations were mainly observed over highly populated mega-city regions, such as Sichuan and Guanzhong basins, whereas low concentration levels were observed over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The TP also showed an increased concentration of O3. Seasonally, all six pollutants except O3 exhibited high concentration values during winter and low values during summer. O3 concentrations exhibited an opposite seasonal variation in low-altitude regions. Unlike other pollutants that exhibited gradually decreasing concentrations with an increase in altitude, O3 concentrations revealed an increasing trend. Furthermore, NO2 concentrations gradually increased in the upper atmosphere possibly due to lighting and stratospheric transmission. Atmospheric pollution is closely related to emissions and meteorological variations in western China. Meteorological conditions in the summer are conducive to pollutant dispersion and wet scavenging; however, unfavourable weather conditions (high pressure as well as a low planetary boundary layer height and precipitation level) in the winter can further worsen air pollution. Atmospheric pollutants from various emission sectors generally exhibited varying monthly profiles. In six typical cities, pollutants were positively correlated with multiple emission sources except for industrial emissions. Further sensitivity simulations indicated that eliminating residential emissions resulted in the largest decrease (up to 70%) in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. The most significant reductions in the concentrations of SO2 and NO2 were achieved by eliminating industrial and transportation emissions, respectively. The outcomes of this study could be helpful for future studies on pollution formation mechanisms as well as environmental and health risk assessments in western China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission control strategies; Impact factors; Pollutant distribution; Western China; WRF-Chem","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Climate models; Emission control; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Risk assessment; Upper atmosphere; Weather forecasting; Control strategies; Impact factor; Pollutant distribution; Western China; WRF-Chem; Air pollution; carbon dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; boundary layer; emission control; pollutant; pollutant source; pollutant transport; regional climate; seasonal variation; upper atmosphere; weather; weather forecasting; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; altitude; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric pressure; boundary layer; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dispersion; environmental impact; meteorology; particulate matter; precipitation; seasonal variation; simulation; stratosphere; summer; winter; air pollutant; city; climate; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; procedures; season; weather; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; China; Cities; Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077356063

Due to prevailing weather conditions and high emission density, this region is prone to the accumulation of air pollutants that often leads to severe haze events. In this study, we combined satellite and ground observations, and a regional air quality modeling system to quantify the contribution of open biomass burning to surface PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm) concentrations during a severe haze episode. During this period (November 1st - 4th, 2015), the average PM2.5 concentrations in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces reached 116.98 μg/m3, 98.60 μg/m3, and 70.17 μg/m3 respectively. Model simulations showed that open biomass burning contributed to 52.7% of PM2.5 concentrations over Northeast China. Using the differences in active fire spots as detected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suites (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi-NPP, we estimated that the burning ban enforced in 2018 have caused the PM2.5 concentrations to decrease from the 2015 level by 67.10%, 53.23%, and 10.06% in the Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces respectively. Over the region, the burning ban proved to be effective in reducing fire emissions and lowering region-wide PM2.5 concentration by 48.1% during the post-harvest season. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; CMAQ; Crop residue burning; Emissions inventory; PM2.5; Policy","Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Biomass; Harvesting; Public policy; Thermography (imaging); Airborne particulate matters; CMAQ; Crop residue burning; Emissions inventory; Ground observations; PM2.5; Regional air quality modeling; Visible infrared imaging radiometer suites; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; biomass burning; computer simulation; concentration (composition); emission inventory; haze; numerical model; particulate matter; pollution policy; satellite data; VIIRS; air quality; Article; bioaccumulation; biomass; burning ban policy; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cropland; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; haze; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; open filed biomass burning; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; simulation; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; China; Heilongjiang; Jilin; Liaoning; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biomass; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079097491

Interestingly, the introduction of PDDA on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets can not only effectively adjust their surface charge property to strengthen the electrostatic interaction between metal and support but also induce the stereoassembly of worm-shaped Pt nanocrystals with abundant catalytically active grain boundaries, which enable the resulting hybrid to express high electrocatalytic activity, remarkable durability, and strong antipoisoning ability for methanol electrooxidation, which are better than those of the traditional Pt nanoparticle electrocatalysts loaded on carbon black, carbon nanotubes, reduced graphene oxide, and MXene matrixes.

However, the band-nested suppression of the recombination efficiency at higher excitation energies limits the ability to locally control and manipulate the photoluminescence of WS2 for multifunctional applications. In this work, we exploit an energy transfer method to modulate the fluorescence properties of TMDs under a larger excitation range spanning from UV to visible light. Self-assembled lanthanide (Ln)/TMD hybrids have been designed based on a low-cost and highly efficient solution-processed approach. The emission energy from Ln3+ sources can be effectively transferred to the TMD monolayers under low power exposure (0.13 mW) at room temperature, activating the characteristic monolayer fluorescence in place of Ln3+ emission signatures. The Ln/TMDs photonics can potentially tune the excitation of TMDs to provide variable yet controllable emissions.

However, little is known about the soil bacteria and their functions respond to the diverse vegetational types in the process of vegetation restoration. Effects of dominated vegetation, i.e., Artemisia halodendron Turcz Ex Bess, Caragana microphylla Lam., Hedysarum fruticosum Pall. and Pinus sylvestris L. on bacterial community structures and their potential functions in the Hulun Buir Sandy Land, China were determined using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) in 2015. Although the dominant phyla of soil bacterial community among different types of vegetation, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, were similar, the relative abundance of these dominant groups significantly differed, indicating that different types of vegetation might result in variations in the composition of soil bacterial community. In addition, functional genes of bacterial populations were similar among different types of vegetation, whereas its relative abundance was significantly differed. Most carbon fixation genes showed a high relative abundance in P. sylvestris, vs. recalcitrant carbon decomposition genes in A. halodendron, suggesting the variations in carbon cycling potential of different types of vegetation. Abundance of assimilatory nitrate reduction genes was the highest in P. sylvestris, vs. dissimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrate reductase genes in A. halodendron, indicating higher nitrogen gasification loss and lower nitrogen utilization gene functions in A. halodendron. The structures and functional genes of soil bacterial community showed marked sensitivities to different plant species, presenting the potentials for regulating soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. © 2020, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","16S rRNA; bacterial taxonomic composition; functional gene; soil carbon and nitrogen; vegetational type","bacterium; ecosystem function; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; relative abundance; restoration ecology; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil remediation; vegetation cover; China; Hulun Buir Desert; Nei Monggol; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Artemisia halodendron; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Caragana microphylla; Firmicutes; Hedysarum fruticosum; Pinus sylvestris; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085220155

This system applies robotic process automation to remote operation to automatically perform energy-saving operations on behalf of the operations manager. Furthermore, as another feature, the system requires only a local area network to connect to the central monitoring equipment enabling automatic operation to be performed regardless of the specifications of the central monitoring equipment. The items targeted for energy-saving operation by this system are the optimal operation of a heat source system, setting of the supply water temperature of heat source equipment, setting of room temperature, and setting of outside-air intake volume. At present, the operations manager has the role of performing these energy-saving operations, but finding the optimal value for each of these operations is a difficult task. An operations manager, moreover, is responsible for tasks other than facility operations such as maintenance management, so changing optimal settings accurately at regular intervals on an ongoing basis can be quite a burden. This system uses robotic process automation technology, so it is capable of performing all energy-saving operations that can be executed by the central monitoring equipment. We installed this system in a large-scale shopping mall and performed energy-saving operations on outside-air processing units. In this trial, we achieved a 44% reduction in the amount of energy required for outside-air processing and a 47% reduction in CO2 emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

Nations must support the provision of affordable and reliable power and concurrently address nationally agreed carbon reduction targets. Decentralised solar photovoltaic (PV) is a viable option to achieve universal energy access in rural areas, while it concurrently decarbonises energy generation, but often remains in tension with traditional centralised generation and distribution systems. Lack of awareness of PV technologies is seen as one of the major barriers limiting the deployment of decentralised systems in rural areas. This study explores awareness of PV systems drawing from over 700 household semi-structured surveys within Uttar Pradesh, India. We found existing awareness-raising campaigns, and subsidies for promoting PV technologies in rural areas are not effective with households preferring word of mouth, experiential learning and village-level awareness programmes than conventional electronic and print media advertising, as preferred by the government and private sectors. This lack of awareness also extends to subsidies for solar PV otherwise used to support this technology deployment and transition. We suggest locally organised and locally delivered targeted campaigns covering product knowledge, functionality and information on financing provisions for procuring solar PV system including how this relates to subsidies could be more effective to promote solar PV in the rural market. As public awareness precedes solar PV adoption, these findings can be insightful for policymakers, investors and the private enterprises to improve existing informational programmes and devise effective campaigns supporting the demand and therefore development of rural solar PV market.

Based on the micro family activity survey data of 3 towns and 9 townships in the Gujiao mining area in Shanxi Province, this study took the Consumer Lifestyle Approach (CLA) as the research paradigm, used descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis to process the data, and found that household carbon emissions characteristics were closely associated with specific resource endowment, household income level, education level and social development. Specifically, the residential behaviors and travel behaviors are the direct impact on household carbon emission characteristics. The residential behaviors have a significant positive correlation with household carbon emissions, in which residential electricity consumption accounted for nearly 41%. In the travel behaviors, private cars are the largest contributors to the carbon emissions from transportation, approaching 79%, followed by bus travel (13%) and motorcycle travel (8%). Then, aiming at the indirect effects of household carbon emissions, this study also set up three scenarios, and found that education level and policy regulation can effectively reduce carbon emissions, and family scale increases carbon emissions. According to the empirical results of this study, local governments should focus closely on two aspects: strengthening household energy conservation and emission reduction awareness and improving public infrastructure construction in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Household carbon emission characteristics; Household carbon emissions; Household carbon emissions behaviors; Mining areas","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Housing; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions; Descriptive statistics; Mining areas; Multiple regression analysis; Positive correlations; Public infrastructures; Residential electricity consumption; Resource endowments; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080077839

However, the uncontrollable photocorrosion and high use cost of single silver-based semiconductor photocatalysts limit its practical application. The construction of Z-scheme photocatalytic systems that mimic natural photosynthesis can not only enhance the photocatalytic activity of silver-based semiconductor photocatalysts, but also improve their stability and reduce the use costs. This critical review concisely highlights the basic principles of Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, and discusses the construction of silver-based semiconductor Z-scheme photocatalytic systems and the roles of metallic Ag in there and summarizes the synthesis methods of silver-based semiconductor Z-scheme photocatalytic systems. Then, a series of the solar-driven applications are elaborated, including organic pollutants degradation, hydrogen production, and carbon dioxide reduction. Meanwhile, the mechanism and difficult level of these photocatalytic reactions are also described. Besides, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as a novel type of photocatalysts have attracted growing attention. The novel combination of silver-based semiconductors with typical photoactive MOFs is highlighted based on the Z-scheme photocatalytic systems.

Optimal industrial production levels are economical, and they also avoid water deterioration. With the promise of being lower than the total allowed emission cap, water use participants have to balance trade-offs between optimal production levels and emission amounts. Effluent trading seems to be a cost-effective method to reduce effluent emission as it allows effluent reallocation among different sectors. Because of changing hydrological information and continuous development of treatment technology, the effluent production ratio is regarded as uncertain and is characterized as polygonal budget sets. This study tries to control the total emission quantity by optimizing cropland use and non-agricultural production levels using effluent trading under uncertain future environments. To illustrate the feasibility of the proposed model, an application is conducted in Indonisian Citarum River. The application finds that the proposed model is able to (1) identify an optimal effluent trading scheme that balances various production plans from multiple water users; (2) balance the trade-off between total emission reduction and total benefit maximization by changing budget levels; and (3) ease the decision makers burden, avoid information losses or distortions, and guide them in adjusting farmland planning, production levels, and effluent trading results under uncertainty. Based on the results, managerial implications are analyzed in terms of (1) the optimal crop area planning in the agricultural sector and the optimal production level in non-agricultural sectors; and (2) the optimal effluent trading pattern that expands economic development without deteriorating water environments. Finally, the comparison analysis with a traditional deterministic model, verify that with the incorporation of robust parameters, flexible solutions are offered to decision makers that have different attitudes toward constraints-violation risks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural sector; Developing countries; Effluent trading; Non-agricultural sectors; Strategy; Sustainable","Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Decision making; Deterioration; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Effluent treatment; Emission control; Optimization; Production control; Regional planning; Risk assessment; River pollution; Agricultural productions; Agricultural sector; Effluent trading; Managerial implications; Non-point source pollution; Strategy; Sustainable; Treatment technologies; Effluents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077924577

During 2013–2018, the city-wide annual PM2.5 concentrations decreased significantly by 40% (84 μg/m3 in 2013 vs. 50 μg/m3 in 2018). The decreasing PM2.5 trend is more pronounced in winter and during the heating season (November–March), in urban areas, and at the median and upper percentiles of PM2.5 concentrations. The 95th percentile PM2.5 concentrations had decreased by 20 μg/m3/yr in the heating season and 16 μg/m3/yr in the non-heating season. During the six-year study period, there was a significant increase in excellent air quality days (PM2.5 concentration &lt; 35 μg/m3) and a significant decrease in heavy pollution days (PM2.5 concentration &gt; 150 μg/m3). PM2.5 concentrations were strongly correlated across the 12 stations. Urban areas in south Beijing experienced higher PM2.5 levels than suburban sites at every hour-of-day, day-of-week, and month-of-year. PM2.5 levels were higher during winter and the heating season, when PM2.5 emission was high due to space heating and mixing layer heights were low. PM2.5 was higher at weekends than during weekdays, when 20% of private passenger vehicles are prohibited, and higher at night than during the day, when heavy duty delivery vehicles are not permitted. These temporal and spatial trends suggest that Beijing's PM2.5 is strongly impacted by local emissions. Our results indicate, control strategies implemented were successful in Beijing's air quality improvement, but further reduction of PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing could be challenging due to significant contribution from its neighboring cities, calling for comprehensive and collaborative efforts in regional/national scale. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Beijing; PM2.5; Spatial variability; Temporal variability; Trend","air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); heating; particulate matter; pollution control; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; urban area; air quality; article; China; city; control strategy; controlled study; heating; night; urban area; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Beijing [China]; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079843028

The results demonstrated that carbon VLR had a negligible effect on the COD removal with effluent below 50 mg L−1, and high and stable removal capacity for phosphorus were also obtained, regardless of carbon VLR change. Whereas TN removal efficiency was positively correlated with carbon VLR reduction, and lower carbon VLR produced a negative effect on TN removal. In addition, since nitrate served as an electron acceptor for denitrifying phosphorus removal (DPR), a significant effect on nitrogen and phosphorus removal was observed with different nitrogen VLR. The TN and TP removal efficiency was 68.30 ± 1.36%, 70.70 ± 1.23%, 45.19 ± 1.72% and 41.63 ± 3.09%, 98.14 ± 0.53%, 53.34 ± 2.68% with influent nitrogen VLR of 0.024 ± 0.001, 0.034 ± 0.001 and 0.045 ± 0.001 kg-N/(m3 d), respectively. Moreover, bacterial community structure of sludge samples in Run I and V from anaerobic–anoxic–aerobic-SBR (named A2OSBR_1 and A2OSBR_2) and membrane bioreactor (named N-MBR_1 and N-MBR_2) revealed that Candidatus_Accumulibacter was the most dominant genus in A2OSBR_1 (21.50%) and A2OSBR_2 (18.98%). The relative lower carbon VLR favoured the enrichment of Saprospiraceae, which was related with DPR, with the proportion of 9.31% and 14.61% in A2OSBR_1 and A2OSBR_2. Besides, Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas with proportions of 11.14%, 5.38% in N-MBR_1 and 10.72%, 6.77% in N-MBR_2 were observed, which were likely responsible for the nearly complete nitrification. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon volumetric loading rate; community structure; Denitrifying phosphorus removal; membrane bioreactor; nitrogen volumetric loading rate","Anoxic water; Batch reactors; Bioreactors; Carbon; Efficiency; Effluents; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Aerobic membrane bioreactors; Bacterial community structure; Denitrifying phosphorus removal; Influent concentrations; Nitrogen and phosphorus removal; Sequencing batch reactors; Synthetic waste water; Volumetric loading rates; Nitrogen removal; carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; bioreactor; nitrification; sewage; waste water; Bioreactors; Carbon; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055698565

After 140 days’ enrichment, the nitrate removal rate increased significantly from 3 to 4 mg-N L−1 d−1 to 22.09 ± 1.21 mg-N L−1 d−1 and the indicator, mol CH4 consumed/mol reduced NO3−-N (C/N ratio), decreased to 1.79 which was very close to the theoretical minimum value (1.27–1.39). The increased nitrate removal efficiency was largely related to the enhanced relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and methanol-utilizing denitrifiers. Type I methanotrophs and some denitrifiers, especially those potential methanol-utilizing denitrifiers from Methylobacillus, Methylotenera, Methylophilus and Methyloversatilis, were abundant in the MBfR sludge. Aerobic methanotrophs and potential methanol-utilizing denitrifiers were closely associated in many globular aggregates (5–10 μm diameter) in the MBfR sludge, which may have promoted the denitrifiers to capture methanol released by methanotrophs efficiently. If we assume methanol is the only cross-feeding intermediate in the MBfR, about 38–60% of the CH4 supplied would be converted to methanol and secreted rather than continuing to be oxidized. At least 63% of this secreted methanol should be utilized for denitrification instead of being oxidized by oxygen in the MBfR. These findings suggest that the nitrate removal efficiency of the AME-D process could be significantly improved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification; Membrane biofilm reactor; Methanol-linked synergy; Nitrate removal efficiency; O2:CH4 ratio","Biofilms; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Efficiency; Methane; Nitrates; Oxidation; Cross-feeding; Globular aggregates; Membrane biofilm reactor; Methane oxidation; Methanotrophs; Nitrate removal; O2:CH4 ratio; Theoretical minimum; Methanol; methane; methanol; nitrate; oxygen; methane; nitric acid derivative; anaerobic digestion; biofilm; bioreactor; denitrification; methane; methanol; methanotrophy; nitrate; oxidation; pollutant removal; activated sludge; aerobic bacterium; Article; bacterial gene; community structure; controlled study; denitrification; denitrifyer; fluorescence in situ hybridization; Hyphomicrobium; metagenomics; methanotroph; Methylobacillus; Methylobacterium; Methylocaldum; Methylococcaceae; Methylococcus; Methylocystaceae; Methylocystis; Methylomonas; Methylophilaceae; Methylophilus; Methylosinus; Methylotenera; Methyloversatilis; microbial community; narG gene; nirK gene; nirS gene; nonhuman; nosZ gene; oxidation; pmoA gene; priority journal; reactor monitoring; reactor operation; real time polymerase chain reaction; Rhodocyclaceae; waste component removal; waste water management; Xanthomonadaceae; biofilm; bioreactor; oxidation reduction reaction; Methylobacillus; Methylococcaceae; Methylophilus; Methylotenera; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Methane; Methanol; Nitrates; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079668947

This study investigated the air quality of three cities in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Jingmen, and Enshi, central China, from January to March 2017–2020 to analyze the impact of the epidemic prevention and control actions on air quality. The results indicated that in the three cities, during February 2020, when the epidemic prevention and control actions were taken, the average concentrations of atmospheric PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, and NO2 in the three cities were 46.1 µg m-3, 50.8 µg m-3, 2.56 ppb, 0.60 ppm, and 6.70 ppb, and were 30.1%, 40.5%, 33.4%, 27.9%, and 61.4% lower than the levels in February 2017–2019, respectively. However, the average O3 concentration (23.1, 32.4, and 40.2 ppb) in 2020 did not show a significant decrease, and even increased by 12.7%, 14.3%, and 11.6% in January, February, and March, respectively. This is because a lower concentration of NO2 resulted in constraints on the NO + O3 reaction, and the O3 could not be effectively further depleted. In addition, the average air quality index (AQI) for the three cities in January, February, and March 2020 were 32.2%, 27.7%, and 14.9% lower than the levels in 2017–2019, respectively. Based on the AQIs for the three cities, the combined proportions of Class I and Class Ⅱ in January, February, and March 2020 increased by 27.9%, 24.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, while the combined proportion of AQI Classes III, IV, V, and VI was reduced from 34.8% to 15.8%. In addition, in the first three months of 2020, the indicatory air pollutants in the three cities for the AQIs were predominant in the following order: PM2.5 (72.0%), O3 (16.4%), PM10 (8.3%), NO2 (2.9%), and CO (0.4%).

Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around ~11 °C to 15 °C mean annual temperature (MAT). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 BP. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT >29 °C currently found in only 0.8% of the Earth's land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara. As the potentially most affected regions are among the poorest in the world, where adaptive capacity is low, enhancing human development in those areas should be a priority alongside climate mitigation. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

In the present study, the 3-PGmix model was applied to simulate the thinning effects on productivity of Larix olgensis plantations under climate change using 164 sample plots collected from the 6th, 7th and 8th National Forest Inventories in Jilin Province, northeast China. Climate scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 were adopted from 2011 to 2100 with corresponding reference years (1981–2010). We simulated four cutting intensities: no-thinning, NT; low intensity thinning with 10% stem removal, LT; moderate thinning with 20% stem removal, MT and heavy thinning with 30% stem removal, HT for three times with 5- and 10-year thinning intervals. The results indicated that the mean net primary productivity (NPP) during the simulated 90 years was increased under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The LT and MT had positive but HT had negative effects on the mean NPP for the same climate scenario. Increased thinning intensity facilitated the positive effects of climate change on NPP but without a significant interaction effect. During the simulation, LT had the highest NPP value and HT had the biggest NPP increase under future climate change. We also discussed the management of larch plantations under climate change and advocated low intensity thinning with 10-year thinning interval to gain maximum NPP for mitigating climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3-PGmix model; Climate change; Larix olgensis plantation; NPP; Thinning","adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; deciduous tree; forest management; forestry production; net primary production; plantation forestry; sampling; thinning; article; China; climate change; forest; Larix; nonhuman; plantation; productivity; simulation; China; climate change; ecosystem; China; Jilin; Larix; Larix gmelinii var. olgensis; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Larix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079233753

Ultramicropores are considered essential for attaining high-rate capacity as well as initial Coulombic efficiency by allowing the rapid diffusion of Na+ and inhibiting the contact of the electrolyte with the inner carbon surfaces. Herein, hard carbon nanosheets with centralized ultramicropores (≈0.5 nm) and easily accessible carbonyl groups (C=O)/hydroxy groups (O-H) are synthesized via interfacial assembly and carbonization strategies, delivering a large capacity (318 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1), superior rate capability (145 mA h g−1 at 5.00 A g−1), and approximately 95% of reversible capacity below 1.00 V. Notably, a new charge model favoring fast capacitive sodium storage with dual potential plateaus is proposed. That is, the deintercalation of Na+ from graphitic layers is manifested as the low-potential plateau region (0.01−0.10 V), contributing to stable insertion capacity; meanwhile, the surface desodiation process of the C=O and O-H groups corresponds to the high-potential plateau region (0.40−0.70 V), contributing to a fast capacitive storage. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Because of the preparation and application of nanoscale WC powders, ultrafine-grain cemented carbides with excellent hardness and wear resistance have been successfully produced. In this paper, the preparation methods of ultra-fine WC powder are divided into solid-phase, liquid-phase, and vapor-phase methods according to the state of the raw materials (i.e., the W or C source). The liquid-phase methods could realize the preparation of WC at the temperature between 500 and 800°C. The purity of WC prepared by vapor-phase method is the highest.

The Olympic Games 2020, postponed to 2021, will take place in Tokyo at a time which is considered to be the hottest and most humid time of the year. However, a part of the athletic competitions is relocated to the northern city Sapporo. Therefore, it is important to quantify thermal comfort for different occasions and destinations and make the results accessible to visitors and sport attendees. The following analysis will quantify and compare thermal comfort and heat stress between Sapporo and Tokyo using thermal indices like the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature and themodified Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET andmPET). The results reveal different precipitation patterns for the cities. While a higher precipitation rate appears in Sapporo during winter, the precipitation rate is higher in Tokyo during summer. PET and mPET exhibit a greater probability of heat stress conditions in Tokyo during the Olympic Games, whereas Sapporo has more moderate values for the same period. The Climate-Tourism/Transfer-Information-Scheme (CTIS) integrates and simplifies climate information and makes them comprehensible for non-specialists. The CTIS of Tokyo illustrates lower suitable conditions for ""Heat stress"", ""Sunny days"" and ""Sultriness"". Transferring parts of the athletics competition to a northern city is thus more convenient for athletes, staff members and spectators. Hence, heat stress can be avoided and an acceptable outdoor stay is ensured. Overall, this quantification and comparison of the thermal conditions in Sapporo and Tokyo reveal limitations but also possibilities for the organizers of the Olympic Games. Furthermore it can be used to raise awareness for promoting or arranging countermeasures and heat mitigation at specific events and destinations, if necessary. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate-Tourism/Transfer-Information-Scheme; Countermeasures; Heat stress; Mitigation; Modified Physiologically Equivalent Temperature; Olympics; Sport events; Thermal comfort","Physiology; Thermal comfort; Thermal stress; Climate condition; Climate information; Heat stress condition; Physiologically equivalent temperatures; Precipitation patterns; Precipitation rates; Suitable conditions; Thermal condition; Sports; air temperature; climate conditions; comparative study; heat wave; Olympic Games; precipitation assessment; tourist destination; Hokkaido; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Sapporo; Tokyo [Kanto]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084924356

Although plentiful studies have been made into the driving factors of CO2 emissions, the existing literatures that take the spatial differences and temporal changes into consideration are few. Therefore, this study first analyzes the variations of total CO2 emissions’ spatial distribution from 2008 to 2017 and present the changes of driving factors, finding significant spatial autocorrelation in CO2 emissions at the province level, and that urbanization rate, per capita GDP and per capita CO2 emissions increased significantly, but energy consumption structure and trade openness decreased. We then compared the effects of different factors affecting CO2 emissions, using classic linear regression model, panel data model, and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, and the three models roughly agree on the effects of factors. The GWR model considering spatial heterogeneity provides more detailed results. Population, urbanization rate, per capita carbon emissions, energy consumption structure, and trade openness all have positive effects, while per capita GDP has a two-way impact on CO2 emissions. The influence of urbanization rate and energy consumption structure in the central and western regions increased even faster than in eastern regions, and the impacts of trade openness in lower and higher opening areas are more significant. The population and per capita CO2 emission have declining influences, among which the influence of population in coastal areas declined more slowly, while the rate of decline of per capita CO2 emission was positively correlated with the local total CO2 emissions. The Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient reveal the inequality distribution of CO2 emissions in various regions, with the highest CO2 emissions growth in the medium-economic-level areas, where the key area of carbon mitigation is. Finally, per capita GDP reveals that China as a whole has the trend of inverted N-shape Kuznets curve, and the underdeveloped regions are in the rising stage between the two inflection points, while developed regions are at the end of the rising stage and about to reach the second inflection point. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emissions; Geographically weighted regression model; Lorenz curve; Province-level; Spatial and temporal","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; Gross Domestic Product; Kuznets curve; numerical model; panel data; regression analysis; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; trade openness; urbanization; China; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; socioeconomics; urbanization; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Socioeconomic Factors; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081583857

Based on the concept of green development, we mainly consider the allocation of resources and the distribution of emission rights from the perspective of resource allocation and improve the efficiency of green development. We analyze how to allocate the additional fixed assets investment and emission rights to each province. We determine that the government should prioritize the faster economic growth areas when there is enough additional investment. Some coastal areas are not priority allocation regions, indicating that their development has basically reached saturation. We also investigated the emission rights of “three wastes” of 30 provinces in China. The result shows that only Shanghai, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Gansu are affected by three wastes emissions after the allocation of additional resources, and their emissions of those three wastes are all reduced. Finally, we dynamically analyze the amount of resource reallocation between different regions under different growth (reduction) rates of fixed resources and emission rights while ensuring maximum overall efficiency.

In this approach, PDI is firstly dispersed in concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and then deposited on CC substrate after the dilution of H2S04, which provides an organic solvent-free strategy to construct integrated LIB cathodes. The acdic solution based fabrication process also allows the facile adjusting of loading amounts of PDI in the cathodes, which can effectively influence the battery performances of the PDI/CC cathodes. As the result, the acidic solution processed PDI/CC cathode can deliver a high specific capacity of ~ 36mAh.g-1 at the current density of 50 m A.g-1 in both half cell with lithium foil as anode and full cell with pre-lithiated CC as anode. In both types of the batteries, the PDI/CC cathodes show good cycling stabilities by retaining ~ 84% of the initial capacities after 300 charge-discharge cycles at 500 mA.g-1. Additionally, the excellent mechanical stability of the PDI/CC cathode enables the LIBs in pouch cell to maintain the electrochemical performances under various bending states, demonstrating their potentials for flexible LIBs. © 2020, Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Acidic solution processing; Carbon clothes; Flexible lithium ion batteries; Organic cathodes; Perylene diimide","Anodes; Cathodes; Clothes; Mechanical stability; Organic solvents; Sulfuric acid; Charge-discharge cycle; Concentrated sulfuric acids; Electroactive components; Electrochemical performance; Fabrication process; High specific capacity; Lithium-ion battery cathodes; Organic solvent-free; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083049876

Here we explore an alternative model where Mn-carbonates form in redox-stratified water columns linked to calcium carbonate dissolution. In ferruginous Brownie Lake in Minnesota, USA, we document Mn-carbonates as an HCl-extractable phase present in sediment traps and in reducing portions of the water column. Mn-carbonate becomes supersaturated in the Brownie Lake chemocline where dissolved oxygen concentrations fall below 5 μM, and Mn-oxide reduction increases the dissolved Mn concentration. Supersaturation is enhanced when calcite originating from surface waters dissolves in more acidic waters at the chemocline. In the same zone, sulfate reduction and microaerobic methane oxidation add dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with negative δ13C. These observations demonstrate that sedimentary Mn enrichments may 1) develop from primary carbonate phases, and 2) can occur in environments with dissolved oxygen concentrations &lt;5 μM. Primary Mn-carbonates are likely to originate in environments with high concentrations of dissolved Mn (&gt;200 μM), and where Mn and Fe are partitioned by S cycling, photoferrotrophy, or microaerophilic Fe-oxidation. A shallow lysocline enhances Mn-carbonate production by providing additional DIC and nucleation sites for crystal growth. This carbonate model for Mn-enrichments is expected to be viable in both euxinic and ferruginous environments, and provides a more nuanced view of the relationships between Mn and carbon cycling, with applications throughout the rock record. © 2020","carbon isotopes; carbonates; ferruginous lake; manganese; redox-stratified","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbonates; Carbonation; Crystallization; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Lakes; Manganese; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentology; Sulfur compounds; Carbon isotopes; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Dissolved oxygen concentrations; Mn concentrations; Oxidizing conditions; redox-stratified; Reducing environment; Sulfate reduction; Manganese removal (water treatment); calcite; carbon isotope; carbonate rock; concentration (composition); dissolved oxygen; manganese; sediment chemistry; sediment trap; sedimentary rock; water column; Minnesota; United States; Scomberomorus semifasciatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081133861

Mauritius, as a Small Island State, is disproportionately affected by climate change, primarily due to its exposure to impacts, as well as various constraints in size and resources. Identifying and integrating local capacity needs into recommendations for policy measures is therefore urgently required to support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its National Adaptation Plan process. This study carries out a local governance assessment based on evaluative criteria to identify local capacity needs for implementing climate change adaptation in Mauritius. Results from the assessment indicate that local governance suffers from issues inherent to Small Island States, such as lack of technical know-how, financial and human resources, stringent legislation and effective monitoring mechanisms, preventing effective climate change adaptation. Through participatory, bottom-up stakeholder engagement with local and national government representatives, eight recommendations for policy formulation were then co-developed to address the identified capacity needs, and to improve cooperation between local and national institutions for more effective implementation of climate change adaptation. Key policy insights Local climate change adaptation needs have to be integrated into policy formulation for an effective response to climate change impacts. Roles and responsibilities of government levels for climate change adaptation in Mauritius are currently in need of clarification. Capacity building measures at the local level for implementing climate change actions from national government are urgently required. Stringent legislation and effective monitoring mechanisms need to be implemented to ensure planning regulations are adhered to. Increased collaboration between local and national levels of government in Mauritius is necessary for synthesizing a common approach to climate change adaptation. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

During the warm season, there were 2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0%, 5%) more BPD dispatches, 9% (95% CI = 7%, 12%) more BEMS dispatches, and 10% (95% CI = 5%, 15%) more BFD dispatches on days when the maximum temperature was 90°F or higher, which remained consistent when we considered multiple days of heat. A 10°F increase in daily maximum temperature, from 80° to 90°F, resulted in 1.016, 1.017, and 1.002 times the expected number of daily BPD, BEMS, and BFD dispatch calls, on average, after adjustment for other predictors. Conclusions. The burden of extreme heat on local emergency medical and police services may be agency-wide, and impacts on fire departments have not been previously documented. Public Health Implications. It is important to account for the societal burden of extreme heat impacts to most effectively inform climate change adaptation strategies and planning. © 2020 American Public Health Association Inc..

One of the promising technologies for reducing global CO2 emissions is oxy-fuel combustion (OFC) technology, which belongs to the carbon capture methods. OFC involves the use of oxygen and recirculated flue gas as an oxidizer in the combustion process. Application of oxy-fuel combustion in waste incineration can result in negative CO2 emission since some part of the carbon in municipal solid waste is biogenic. Such technology is often described as BECCS or Bio-CCS and it has attracted the attention of scientists recently. In addition to easier CO2 capture, oxy-fuel combustion of municipal solid waste offers other advantages, such as reduced flue gas volume, increased combustion temperature and the possibility of retrofit existing incineration plants. In the present paper, studies of oxy-fuel combustion of waste materials, in particular, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge are presented and summarized. The study shows the opportunities and challenges that have to be addressed to fully exploit the potential of the oxy-fired incineration plant. © 2020 The Authors","BECCS; Incineration; MSW; Oxy-fuel combustion; Waste","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Flue gases; Fuels; Gas plants; Global warming; Incineration; Municipal solid waste; Sewage sludge; Wastes; BECCS; Carbon dioxide emissions; Combustion pro-cess; Combustion temperatures; Environmental issues; Incineration plant; Oxyfuel combustion; Waste to energy technologies; Waste incineration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combustion; environmental issue; incineration; municipal solid waste; oxygen; sewage; sludge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081642979

However, natural tropical freshwater wetlands are increasingly being converted into other land uses, mainly rice cultivation. In this study, we investigated the impact of conversion of a natural tropical freshwater wetland into a rice paddy wetland on SOC, by determining SOC content, density and storage potential in the natural section (under different vegetation communities dominated by Cyperus papyrus [Papyrus], Typha latifolia [Typha] and Phragmites mauritianus [Phragmites]) and in the converted section (under rice cultivation). The SOC contents (g kg−1) and densities (kg m−2) of the 3 vegetation communities (Papyrus; 123.7 ± 2.6 [SE] and 7.22 ± 0.11, Typha; 85.3 ± 1.1 and 6.71 ± 0.12, and Phragmites; 78.2 ± 3.4 and 6.20 ± 0.06, respectively) of the natural section of the wetland were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those (39.7 ± 0.7 and 3.90 ± 0.06, respectively) of the converted section. Similarly, for the entire sampled soil depth (0–50 cm), SOC storage potentials (Mg ha−1) of Papyrus (361.18 ± 5.53), Typha (335.31 ± 6.18) and Phragmites (310.17 ± 3.16) significantly exceeded (p &lt; 0.05) that obtained in the converted section by nearly 46%, 42% and 38%, respectively. Soil physico-chemical characteristics: bulk density, salinity, pH and temperature, showed comparably significant correlations (p &lt; 0.05) with SOC in both the natural and converted sections of the wetland.

Thus, reducing the emission and ambient concentration of BC could help address climate change and improve air quality simultaneously. In this study, the mass concentration of atmospheric BC was continuously measured by an aethalometer in Shanghai in 2017. The annual BC concentration was 2.19 ± 1.28 μg/m3, with the highest loading in winter and the lowest loading in autumn. The BC concentrations varied with year and location when compared with previous studies in different locations in Shanghai. The hourly BC concentration had a bimodal distribution, with two peaks during the morning and evening traffic rush hours. Liquid fuels, biomass, and coal combustion contributed 65.7%, 21.5%, and 12.8%, respectively, of the total BC based on the advanced aethalometer model. The three sources varied in different seasons with a high contribution of liquid source in summer and more coal and biomass emissions in winter. High BC concentrations accumulated in the stable weather conditions in the four seasons and appeared when there were high wind speeds from the northwestern direction in winter. The Yangtze River Delta region was the most likely potential source region of high BC loading in the four seasons, and long-range transport from North China in winter was another likely source region based on the results of cluster analysis and potential source contribution function analysis of backward trajectories. ©2020.

They are frequently monitored at background observatories, but less so in urban areas, especially in China. In this study, the temporal variations of urban atmospheric CO2 and CH4, including seasonal, weekly, and diurnal characteristics, were obtained based on one year of continuous measurement in the megacity Shanghai. Probable anthropogenic sources were further investigated through relationships among GHGs and atmospheric pollutants. Potential sources regions and transport pathways of GHGs were studied in association with meteorological conditions. The annual average concentrations of CO2 and CH4 were 428.36 ± 13.96 ppm and 2154 ± 190 ppb, respectively, which were higher than those at global and regional background observatories. The highest CO2 concentration appeared in winter and the lowest in autumn, whereas CH4 values were highest in summer and lowest in spring. Both CO2 and CH4 showed strong diurnal variations, but only CO2 exhibited seasonal and weekly differences due to the variation of emission sources and plant photosynthesis in Shanghai and the surrounding Yangtze River Delta (YRD). CO2 and combustion-derived air pollutants were co-emitted from similar sources and co-transported to the research site, as demonstrated by correlation analysis. Furthermore, the correlation analysis also suggested some neglected anthropogenic combustion sources of CH4 in Shanghai, besides the traditional biogenic emissions from landfills, wetlands, paddy fields, and dairy farms. The anthropogenic CO2 concentration in urban Shanghai estimated from a CO2-CO regression model was 14.98 ± 5.09 ppm, together with a background concentration of 413.31 ± 7.07 ppm, which was higher than at global background sites but lower than at the nearby regional background Lin'an station. GHGs were accumulated from local sources under stable weather conditions and transported from remote sources at high wind speeds. Air masses from “super-emitters” north and south of the observation site contributed most of the elevation in GHGs concentration above their annual averages. Considering the co-emissions of GHGs and air pollutants from carbon-containing material combustion and use, and the potential of methane to generate O3 in the urban environment, reduction of CO2 and CH4 together with air pollutants could benefit both climate and air quality in Shanghai and the surrounding YRD. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic sources; GHGs; Meteorological conditions; Sea breeze; Temporal variations","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Correlation methods; Observatories; Regression analysis; Urban growth; Anthropogenic sources; GHGs; Meteorological condition; Sea breeze; Temporal variation; Greenhouse gases; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); greenhouse gas; megacity; methane; sea breeze; temporal variation; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075219391

This study was conducted to evaluate climate change impacts on water productivity of maize in farming practices in the Lower Chenab Canal (LCC) system. Two fields of maize were selected and monitored to calibrate and validate the model. A water productivity analysis was performed using the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model. Baseline climate data (1980-2010) for the study site were acquired from the weather observatory of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Future climate change data were acquired from the Hadley Climate model version 3 (HadCM3). Statistical downscaling was performed using the Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) for the A2 and B2 scenarios of HadCM3. The water productivity assessment was performed for the midcentury (2040-2069) scenario. The maximum increase in the average maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) was found in the month of July under the A2 and B2 scenarios. The scenarios show a projected increase of 2.8 °C for Tmax and 3.2 °C for Tmin under A2 as well as 2.7 °C for Tmax and 3.2 °C for Tmin under B2 for the midcentury. Similarly, climate change scenarios showed that temperature is projected to decrease, with the average minimum and maximum temperatures of 7.4 and 6.4 °C under the A2 scenario and 7.7 and 6.8 °C under the B2 scenario in the middle of the century, respectively. However, the highest precipitation will decrease by 56 mm under the A2 and B2 scenarios in the middle of the century for the month of September. The input and output data of the SWAP model were processed in R programming for the easy working of the model. The negative impact of climate change was found under the A2 and B2 scenarios during the midcentury. The maximum decreases in Potential Water Productivity (WPET) and ActualWater Productivity (WPAI) from the baseline period to the midcentury scenario of 1.1 to 0.85 kgm-3 and 0.7 to 0.56 kgm-3 were found under the B2 scenario.

To address the negative impacts of disturbance, progressive rehabilitation is commonly advocated. However, there is little research focusing on how these impacts affect ecosystem services within mine sites and changes over time. The aim of this study was to assess the cumulative impacts of mining disturbance and rehabilitation on ecosystem services through mapping and quantifying changes at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Four ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, air quality regulation, soil conservation and water yield were assessed in 1989, 1997, 2005 and 2013. Disturbance and rehabilitation was mapped using LandTrendr algorithm with Landsat. We mapped spatial patterns and pixel values for each ecosystem service with corresponding model and the landscape changes were analyzed with landscape metrics. In addition, we assessed synergies and trade-offs using Spearman's correlation coefficient for different landscape classes and scales. The results showed that carbon sequestration, air quality regulation and water yield services were both positively and negatively affected by vegetation cover changes due to mined land disturbance and rehabilitation, while soil conservation service were mainly influenced by topographic changes. There were strong interactions between carbon sequestration, air quality regulation and water yield, which were steady among different spatial scales and landscape types.

Specifically, when CAVs travel along an arterial corridor with signalized intersections, they can not only be driven automatically using pre-designed control models but can also communicate with other CAVs and the roadside infrastructure. In this paper, we describe a cooperative eco-driving (CED) system targeted for signalized corridors, focusing on how the penetration rate of CAVs affects the energy efficiency of the traffic network. In particular, we propose a role transition protocol for CAVs to switch between a leader and following vehicles in a string. Longitudinal control models are developed for conventional vehicles in the network and for different CAVs based on their roles and distances to intersections. A microscopic traffic simulation evaluation has been conducted using PTV VISSIM with realistic traffic data collected for the City of Riverside, CA, USA. The effects on traffic mobility are evaluated, and the environmental benefits are analyzed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) model. The simulation results indicate that the energy consumption and pollutant emissions of the proposed system decrease, as the penetration rate of CAVs increases. Specifically, more than 7% reduction on energy consumption and up to 59% reduction on pollutant emission can be achieved when all vehicles in the proposed system are CAVs. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs); cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC); eco-approach and departure (EAD); eco-driving; mixed traffic; signalized intersections","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental Protection Agency; Longitudinal control; Pollution; Street traffic control; Traffic signals; Automated vehicles; Environmental benefits; Microscopic traffic simulation; Motor vehicle emissions; Pollutant emission; Signalized intersection; Transportation system; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084478555

North China offers a natural experiment for studying how plant growth responds to air pollution under different meteorological conditions, where rapid economic growth has led to severe air pollution and climate changes increase drought stress. Using a single aspen clone (Populus euramericana Neva.) as a ‘phytometer’, we conducted three experiments to monitor aspen leaf photosynthesis and stem growth during in situ exposure to atmospheric pollutants along the urban-rural gradient around Beijing. We used stepwise model selection to select the best multiple linear model, and we used binned regression to estimate the effects of air pollutants, atmospheric moisture stress and their interactions on aspen leaf photosynthesis and growth. Our results indicated that ozone (O3) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) inhibited leaf photosynthesis and stem growth. The interactive effect of O3 and VPD resulted in a synergistic response: as the concentration of O3 increased, the negative impact of VPD on leaf photosynthesis and stem growth became more severe. We also found that nitrogen (N) deposition had a positive effect on stem growth, which may have been caused by an increase in canopy N uptake, although this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by further studies. The positive impact of aerosol loading may be due to diffuse radiation fertilization effects. Given the decline in aerosols and N deposition amidst increases in O3 concentration and drought risk, the negative effects of atmospheric pollution on tree growth may be aggravated in North China. In addition, the interaction between O3 and VPD may lead to a further reduction in ecosystem productivity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol; Nitrogen deposition; Ozone; Stem growth; VPD","Aerosols; Climate change; Drought; Economics; Forestry; Moisture; Ozone; Photosynthesis; Radiation effects; Rural areas; Urban growth; Atmospheric pollutants; Ecosystem productivity; Meteorological condition; Multiple linear models; Nitrogen deposition; Stem growth; Urban-rural gradients; Vapor pressure deficit; Air pollution; nitrogen; ozone; ozone; aerosol; atmospheric moisture; atmospheric pollution; deciduous tree; growth; nitrogen cycle; ozone; photosynthesis; pollution exposure; rural-urban comparison; stem; vapor pressure; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; atmospheric moisture; canopy; controlled study; drought; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental stress; fertilization; growth rate; nitrogen uptake; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant stem; Populus; Populus euramericana; precipitation; rural area; seasonal variation; urban area; vapor pressure; China; ecosystem; plant leaf; Beijing [China]; China; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Ecosystem; Ozone; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078737972

Public bicycles are one of the important forms of bicycle sharing. The use of public bicycles instead of motor vehicles has brought about changes in environmental benefits for the society, and at the same time, it has also changed the travel time of residents. Because these changes are potential and cannot be measured directly, we put forward the calculation methods of environmental benefits and time costs of public bicycles according to the concept of opportunity cost. Taking Hohhot, the capital city of Inner Mongolia, as an example, according to the streaming data of 9.76×106 valid orders of public bicycle trips in 2016, we found that the use of public bicycles could reduce consumption of standard coal by as much as 5,796.11 tons (accounting 0.16‱ of the total coal consumption in Inner Mongolia) and carbon emissions were reduced by 4,381.28 tons (accounting 0.30‱ of the total carbon emissions in Inner Mongolia). However, the promotion of public bicycles is not without disadvantages. The use of public bicycles has increased the average travel time of residents by 0.06 hours, which is neglected in previous studies. The contribution of public bicycles to saving 1kg standard coal corresponds to 0.10 hours of travel time waste. Thus, reducing 1kg of carbon emissions is corresponding to a waste of 0.14 hours of travel time. The use of public bicycles varies among different income groups, which is caused by the value of travel time. Low-income groups use more frequently than high-income groups. Generally speaking, low-income groups bring more environmental benefits to society through the use of public bicycles, but bear more time costs. Therefore, we propose a carbon tax on high-carbon transportation modes to encourage green travel and balance the environmental benefits and time costs of public bicycles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental benefit; Environmental management; Public bicycle; Streaming data; Time cost","Bicycles; Carbon; Coal; Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Sporting goods; Travel time; Average travel time; Empirical analysis; Environmental benefits; Opportunity costs; Public bicycles; Streaming data; Time cost; Transportation mode; Cost benefit analysis; carbon; coal; cost analysis; cycle transport; data set; empirical analysis; environmental management; public transport; trade-off; travel time; adult; analytic method; Article; calculation; controlled study; data analysis; empirical analysis; environment; exhaust gas; highest income group; human; income; lowest income group; Mongolia; priority journal; tax; time factor; traffic and transport; travel; travel time; China; Hohhot; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078703449

Potential inhomogeneities in surface solar radiation observations, however, add uncertainties to the published patterns and trends of Rd and Rf over China. To exclude inhomogeneous time series and outliers, a data quality control process has been applied to the surface observations of Rd and Rf. The homogeneous data show that, in response to the global dimming and brightening phenomena in R, decadal changes can also be observed in the Rd and Rf trends over China with the actual transition occurring in the mid-2000s. Since the 1960s, Rd dimming has mainly distributed over eastern China with intensive anthropogenic activities, with recoveries especially from 2008 onward over regions with high Rd energy potential. Rf, on the other hand, had further enhanced since the 1960s especially over the high Rf proportion areas but has decreased in the recent decade over the northern region. The summer season shows the most significant decadal trends in Rd and Rf. Under clear-sky conditions, that is, ruling out cloud effects, the transitions in Rd and Rf trends become more remarkable, pointing to atmospheric aerosols as the main driving force. In addition, dramatic Rd and Rf variations are observed in the subsequent years after large volcanic eruptions. The varying Rd and Rf proportions are in line with recent governmental control on SO2 emissions over China. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Yet, whether flowering phenology of woody species varies with functional traits, growth form, and phylogeny in arid regions is unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the relationships of three characteristics of flowering phenology (i.e., first flowering date, end of flowering date, and flowering duration) against functional traits, growth form, and phylogeny across 59 woody plant species across 3 years in Ürümqi city of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, in Northwest China. The results showed that, plant functional traits and growth form had significant influences on the variability of flowering phenology among species. The contributions of fruit type (34.7–43.5%) and flower color (30.1–30.7%) to the variability of flowering phenology were larger than those of pollination mode (4.6–14.4%), life form (8.4–14%) and maximum plant height (9.7–13.1%). Trees had the significant correlations in terms of flowering duration against first flowering date and end of flowering date, while shrubs showed the opposite pattern. The values of phylogenetic signal (Blomberg’s K) of the three characteristics of flowering phenology ranged from 0.36 to 0.43, which were significantly lower than the expectation of the Brownian motion model. Our results suggested that functional traits, growth form and phylogeny all affected variability of flowering phenology among species.

The expression of 11β-HSD1 in the fetal membranes is under the feedforward induction by cortisol, which is potentiated by proinflammatory cytokines. As a result, the abundance of 11β-HSD1 increases with gestational age and furthermore at parturition with an escalation of cortisol concentration in the fetal membranes. Accumulated cortisol takes parts in a number of crucial events pertinent to the onset of labor in the fetal membranes, including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and stimulation of prostaglandin output. Cortisol remodels the ECM through multiple approaches including induction of collagen I, III, and IV degradation, as well as inhibition of their cross-linking. These effects of cortisol are executed through activation of the autophagy, proteasome, and matrix metalloprotease 7 pathways, as well as inhibition of the expression of cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase in mesenchymal cells of the membranes. With regard to prostaglandin output, cortisol not only increases prostaglandin E2 and F2α syntheses through induction of their synthesizing enzymes such as cytosolic phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase 2, and carbonyl reductase 1 in the amnion, but also decreases their degradation through inhibition of their metabolizing enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in the chorion. Taking all together, data accumulated so far denote that the feedforward cortisol regeneration by 11β-HSD1 in the fetal membranes is a requisite event in the onset of parturition, and the effects of cortisol on prostaglandin synthesis and ECM remodeling may be enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines in chorioamnionitis. © Copyright © 2020 Wang, Guo and Sun.","11β-HSD1; collagen; fetal membranes; glucocorticoids; prostaglandins","11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; 15 hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase; carbonyl reductase; carbonyl reductase 1; collagen type 1; collagen type 3; collagen type 4; collagenase 3; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; cyclooxygenase 2; cytosolic phospholipase A2; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; hydrocortisone; interstitial collagenase; matrilysin; messenger RNA; neutrophil collagenase; phospholipase A2; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin F2 alpha; proteasome; protein lysine 6 oxidase; serum amyloid A; serum amyloid A1; STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; amnion; autophagy (cellular); bioaccumulation; birth; chorioamnionitis; chorion; collagen degradation; enzyme inhibition; extracellular matrix; fetus membrane; human; immunohistochemistry; labor; membrane rupture; negative feedback; nonhuman; pregnancy; prostaglandin synthesis; protein cross linking; protein expression; protein localization; protein RNA binding; Review; tensile strength; trophoblast",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086155174

Few studies estimate these damages for on-road freight, especially at scales relevant for subnational policies requiring cross-border cooperation. Here, we assess the damages to US receptors from emissions of air pollutants (PM2.5, NOx, SO2, NH3), and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) from medium and heavy duty freight trucking, and the benefits of ZEV adoption by census division in the Province of Ontario. We develop an integrated modelling framework connecting a travel demand model, a mobile emissions simulator, and a regression based marginal damages model of air pollutants and climate change. We estimate $1.9 billion (2010 USD) in annual cross-border damages, or $0.16/VKT, resulting from scaled up atmospheric emissions from a ‘typical day’ of medium and heavy duty truck traffic volume for Ontario in 2012. This implies approximately $8000 per truck per year in damages, which could inform an economic incentive for emission reduction. The provincial goal of 5% ZEV adoption would reduce GHG emissions in 2012 by 800 ktCO2e, yielding $89 Million (2010 USD) in cross-border benefits annually, with air quality co-benefits of $83/tCO2e. This result varies between −19% and 22% based on sensitivity analysis for travel and emissions models, though economic damages are likely the largest uncertainty source. Such advances in subnational scale integrated modeling of the environmental impacts of freight can offer insights into the sustainable design of clean freight policy and programs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Air quality; Ammonia; Climate models; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Roads and streets; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Trucks; Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric emission; Economic incentive; Emission reduction; Integrated modeling; Integrated modelling; Travel demand modeling; Uncertainty sources; Zero emission vehicles; Climate change; atmospheric pollution; chemical pollutant; climate change; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; incentive; Canada; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082857768

Improving carbon emission performance is one way to reduce carbon emissions. Although carbon emission performance has been discussed at the national and industrial levels, city-level studies are lacking due to the limited availability of statistics on energy consumption. In this study, based on city-level remote sensing data on carbon emissions in China from 1992–2013, we used the slacks-based measure of super-efficiency to evaluate urban carbon emission performance. The traditional Markov probability transfer matrix and spatial Markov probability transfer matrix were constructed to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of urban carbon emission performance in China for the first time and predict long-term trends in carbon emission performance. The results show that urban carbon emission performance in China steadily increased during the study period with some fluctuations. However, the overall level of carbon emission performance remains low, indicating great potential for improvements in energy conservation and emission reduction. The spatial pattern of urban carbon emission performance in China can be described as “high in the south and low in the north,” and significant differences in carbon emission performance were found between cities. The spatial Markov probabilistic transfer matrix results indicate that the transfer of carbon emission performance in Chinese cities is stable, resulting in a “club convergence” phenomenon. Furthermore, neighborhood backgrounds play an important role in the transfer between carbon emission performance types. Based on the prediction of long-term trends in carbon emission performance, carbon emission performance is expected to improve gradually over time. Therefore, China should continue to strengthen research and development aimed at improving urban carbon emission performance and achieving the national energy conservation and emission reduction goals. Meanwhile, neighboring cities with different neighborhood backgrounds should pursue cooperative economic strategies that balance economic growth, energy conservation, and emission reductions to realize low-carbon construction and sustainable development. © 2020, Science in China Press.","China; spatial Markov chain; spatiotemporal patterns; super-efficiency SBM model; trend prediction; urban carbon emission performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084036160

In the study, we aimed to examine the association between air pollution and prevalence of hypertension and tested whether this air pollution and hypertension association was mediated by changes in body weight. We used a linkage dataset from China with nationwide city-level air quality data linked with individual-level health data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study among adults aged 45 or older. Air quality was assessed based on the daily air quality index (AQI), a standard sum index of multiple air pollutants. To be specific, air pollution was measured by number of polluted days according to AQI and monthly average AQI. We examined the association between air quality and hypertension and tested mediation effect of body weight using a four-step mediating regression model. Air pollution was a risk factor for obesity. Each exposure to one more polluted day for females predicted on 2.1% (OR 1.021; 95% CI 1.007–1.035) higher prevalence of hypertension without BMI adjusted. A significant mediation effect of body mass index on the association between AQI and hypertension was observed. However, the effect of air pollution on hypertension among males was not significant. These results provide further evidence of the potential risks of air pollution and suggest that reducing pollution could help control both obesity and blood pressure. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Blood pressure; Body weight; Suspended particulates; The air quality index","air quality; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; disease prevalence; health risk; mental disorder; obesity; regression analysis; risk factor; weight; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083394508

While in many polar coastal areas retreating glaciers open up new ground for marine animals to colonise, little is known about the combination of both factors on the local GHG budget. We studied the magnitude of GHG fluxes (CO2, CH4 and N2O) on the combined effect of glacial retreat and penguin-induced fertilisation along a transect protruding into the world's largest King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) colony at Saint Andrews Bay on sub-Antarctic South Georgia. GHG production and consumption rates were assessed based on laboratory incubations of intact soil cores and nutrients and water additional experimental incubations. The oldest soils along the transect show significant higher contents of soil carbon, nutrients and moisture and were strongly influenced by penguin activity. We found a net CH4 consumption along the entire transect with a marked decrease within the penguin colony. CO2 production strongly increased along the transect, while N2O production rates were low near the glacier front and increased markedly within the penguin colony. Controlled applications of guano resulted in a significant increase in CO2 and N2O production, and decrease in CH4 consumption, except for sites already strongly influenced by penguin activity. The results show that soil microbial activity promptly catalyses a turnover of soil C and atmospheric methane oxidation in de-glaciated forelands. The methane oxidizers, however, may increase relatively slowly in their capacity to oxidise atmospheric CH4. Results show also that the increase of nutrients by penguins reduces CH4 oxidation whereas N2O production is greatly increased. A future expansion of penguins into newly available ice-free polar coastal areas may therefore markedly increase the local GHG budget. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Chronosequence; Glacier foreland; King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus); Methane oxidation; Nitrous oxide; Soil properties; sub-Antarctic","Atmospheric chemistry; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Coastal zones; Glacial geology; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Oxidation; Soils; Chronosequences; King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus); Methane oxidation; Nitrous oxide; Soil property; sub-Antarctic; Birds; ammonia; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; catalysis; coastal zone; glacier retreat; greenhouse gas; methane; seabird; soil biota; soil emission; animal behavior; Aptenodytes patagonicus; Article; catalysis; controlled study; deglaciation; fertilization; glacier; greenhouse gas; nonhuman; oxidation; penguin; priority journal; soil chemistry; soil microflora; soil moisture; South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; animal; Antarctica; ecosystem; greenhouse gas; island (geological); penguin; soil; Antarctica; South Georgia; Animalia; Aptenodytes patagonicus; Spheniscidae; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Gases; Islands; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Spheniscidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076605895

However, existing studies focus mainly on CO2 emissions from vessels calling at the ports and cargo handling within the ports, paying little attention to the inland distribution networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an easily implemented method for calculating CO2 emissions from port container distribution (PCD) and investigates their spatial characteristics and driving factors. By analyzing 30 container ports in China, the main findings are as follows. First, road transportation is the major contributor of CO2 emissions from PCD due to the lack of rail and inland water transportation. Second, PCD carbon emissions exhibit significant local spatial clustering. That is, ports with similar geographical locations tend to present a similar pattern of PCD carbon emissions. Third, as suggested by the spatial Durbin model, PCD carbon emissions are negatively determined by local gross domestic product, number of port berths, but are positively determined by local tertiary industry value and highway freight volume, and waterway freight volume in both local and neighboring ports. These results provide empirical insights into cross-port collaboration in reducing PCD carbon emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Container distribution facilities; Green port; local Moran's I; Port carbon emissions; Spatial Durbin model","Carbon dioxide; Containers; Global warming; Carbon emissions; Distribution facilities; Green ports; Local moran's i; Spatial Durbin models; Spatial distribution; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cargo handling; port operation; spatiotemporal analysis; vessel; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081667108

An approximately 100-fs pump pulse at 205.1 nm excites H atoms through a two-photon process (n = 3 n = 1), which is followed by detection of the forward emission signals induced by a broadband fs probe pulse near 656 nm. Above a certain threshold, we observe a quadratic dependence of the emission signal on the pump laser energy. Moreover, the linewidth of the forward emission signal varies with the probe delay and the probe laser energy. This behavior can be explained in terms of superradiance. We perform a theoretical analysis and compare the experimental results with the theory, and conclude that, within the conditions of our experiment, the behavior of the atomic system involves atomic coherence, which is produced non-adiabatically and corresponds to a superradiant process. Variations in the duration of the gain time window and lifetime of the excited-state H atoms in flames are explored at different flame conditions (i.e., equivalence ratio and heights above the burner). The fs pump-probe technique demonstrated here can also be extended to characterize the time-resolved population dynamics and the corresponding collisional energy transfer rates for energy levels involved in laser-induced fluorescence detection of H atoms in flames relevant to practical combustion applications. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Atom lasers; Combustion; Energy transfer; Excited states; Fluorescence; Hydrogen; Optical pumping; Probes; Two photon processes; Collisional energy transfer; Directional emission; Excited-state dynamics; Femtosecond pump probes; Laser induced fluorescence detection; Practical combustion; Pump-probe technique; Quadratic dependence; Atoms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092592274

In this study, we focused on the Ningxia Plain in China, an important wine grape (Vitis vinifera L.) growing region. Based on the daily average air temperature data from 1981 to 2017, we investigated changes in the planting boundaries of different climate zones for wine grape before and after 1997 (when an abrupt change in regional air temperature occurred). The goal of this study is to provide scientific evidence for local agricultural authorities to make long-term climate change adaptation plans. We used the effective accumulated temperature as an indicator to evaluate the inter-decadal changes in the climate zones for wine grape. We concluded as follows: (1) since the abrupt change in regional air temperature in 1997, the subtotal area of climate zone I for wine grape was reduced by 31%, while the subtotal area of climate zone II (moved southward) and III (part of climate zone II in the northern part of the region turned into climate zone III) for wine grape was expanded by 7% and 24%, respectively; (2) during the 1990s, climate zone III for wine grape emerged in the study region; during the 2000s, the planting boundaries of climate zone II and III moved southward; during the period of 2011–2017, climate zone I (suitable) for wine grape mostly vanished in the Ningxia Plain; and (3) since the abrupt change in regional air temperature in 1997, most of the area in the Eastern Foothills of the Helan Mountains turned from climate zone II to climate zone III for wine grape, with the exceptions of Hongsipu district and the relatively high altitude area. During the 37 study years, most of the area in the study region remained as climate zone II for wine grape with a probability of 80%. Overall, the climate zones for wine grape in Ningxia, China have changed against the background of global warming. In particular, the wine grape varieties and wine types are expected to be changed in the Helan Mountains area in order to adapt to the ongoing climate change. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; global warming; temperature effect; vineyard; wine; China; Ningxia Huizu; Vitis vinifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082801332

Observations in TP have revealed warming and moistening trends before 2004 and weakening of those trends after 2004. These changes in the course of climate warming altered hydrological components in TP from the early years of 1992–2003 to the recent decade of 2004–2015, resulting in strong changes of the terrestrial water storage (TWS) in TP. In this study, hydrological and climatic data that determine the budget of TWS in TP were compiled from multiple data sources for 1992–2015. An empirical formula was developed by correlation analysis of TWS from these data with TWS derived from GRACE data for 2003–2015 in TP. The estimated TWS by the formula highly agrees with GRACE data in describing TWS variations across TP, even though it underestimates the absolute value of annual TWS in north TP. The formula was used to estimate TWS variations in 1992–2003, which were compared to those in 2004–2015. Major results show that (1) in the warm and wet region of south TP, the recently reduced rate of climate warming and moistening reversed the trend of annual TWS from increase in 1992–2003 to significant decrease in 2004–2015. This change is largely caused by decreases of soil water and groundwater storage and increased runoff. (2) In the cold and dry region of north TP, the increase of TWS in 1992–2003 accelerated in 2004–2015 because of increases of soil moisture and lake storage. (3) The difference of TWS change in the north and south TP altered the multi-year balance of water storage over the entire TP. Decreasing TWS from 2004 to 2015 lowered multi-year mean TWS in south TP, while increasing TWS in north TP raised its multi-year mean TWS. The reduction of TWS in south TP, with decrease of streamflow and groundwater storage, could threaten the sustainability of surface and subsurface water resources for this critical source region of Asia's large rivers. The accumulation of TWS following the rise of surface water in north TP could increase spilling of lakes and thus risks of floods and debris flows. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","GRACE; Terrestrial water storage; Tibetan Plateau; Weakening of climate warming","Budget control; Digital storage; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Lakes; Soil moisture; Water conservation; Climate warming; Correlation analysis; Empirical formulas; GRACE; Groundwater storage; Multiple data sources; Terrestrial water storage; Tibetan Plateau; Climate change; climate variation; flood; GRACE; satellite data; soil moisture; soil water; streamflow; surface water; water resource; water storage; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079101586

Here, we fabricated a novel photocatalyst, namely, MPA&amp;MUA QDs prepared from CdS quantum dots (QDs) anchored by mixed MPA (3-mercaptopronic acid) and MUA (11-mercaptoalkanoic acid) ligands in one pot. Assisted by the sacrificial agent, the MPA&amp;MUA QDs exhibited excellent performance and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to carbonaceous products HCOOH, CO and CH4 with the corresponding rates of 2.8, 5.4 × 10-2 and 6.3 × 10-3 μmol mg(cat)-1 h-1, respectively, under irradiation for 32 h. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for the production of HCOOH achieved a high value up to 23.2%, while for CO and CH4, it was 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. The attractive duration for photocatalysis under irradiation implied that the MPA&amp;MUA QDs possessed enhanced photostability. Compared with the QDs solely decorated by MPA or MUA, the MPA&amp;MUA QDs could enhance the energy gap Eg and tune the conduction band to smoothly generate CH4, CO and HCOOH. From the combination of steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved lifetime, we inferred that the MPA&amp;MUA coatings had a decreased number of available hole trapping sites and improved passivation on the surface, which allowed for efficient hole and electron migration. With this work, we introduce a facial and feasible strategy to create an inexpensive and efficient visible-light photocatalyst for the multi-electron reduction of CO2.

The reduction process of iron-bearing burden is greatly significant for the smelting and smooth operation of blast furnace. In this study, the effects of ICHB on the reduction process of pellet were experimentally investigated under simulated conditions within a blast furnace, and the interaction mechanism between the gasification of ICHB and the reduction of pellet was revealed. The results showed that the reduction degree of pellet with mixing charging 10% ICHB is increased by 6.48% in comparison to that without adding ICHB and conventional coke. Furthermore, with increasing the temperature from 900 °C to 1100 °C, the reduction degree of pellet without adding ICHB is increased from 20.20% to 32.45%, while it is remarkably improved from 20.93% to 40.14% under the condition of mixed charging 10% ICHB. Moreover, with increasing the mixed ratio of ICHB from zero to 30%, the reduction degree of pellet evidently is accelerated from 23.69% to 33.72%, but the improvement in the reduction degree of pellet is levelled off as the charging ratio of ICHB is more than 20%, suggesting that the promotion has a limitation. The interaction mechanism is indicated that the gasification of ICHB and the reduction of pellet are mutually promoted through increasing the reducing potential in local region during the reaction process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blast furnace ironmaking; Fuel; Iron coke hot briquette; Low carbon emission; Reduction process of pellet","Alternative fuels; Briquets; Fueling; Gasification; Iron ores; Pelletizing; Petroleum coke; Smelting; Blast furnace iron-making; Interaction mechanisms; Iron ore concentrates; Isothermal reduction; Low-carbon emissions; Reaction process; Reduction process; Thermal reserve zones; Blast furnaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079851366

The results showed that 13 antibiotics were detected in all 12 sites and their detection frequencies were much higher in September, but concentrations were lower than that in March. Of them, erythromycin (ETM) and ofloxacin (OFL) were the predominant antibiotics in both seasons. The remarkably higher concentration of antibiotics in sediments of these rivers than those in other rivers were found. Environmental risk assessment found that four antibiotics posed high risk toward some sensitive algae. For ARGs, their relative abundances were higher in waters than those in sediments, higher in March than in September. Correlation analysis showed that antibiotics were not the exclusive selective pressure of ARGs; many environmental factors like dry matter contents on a mass basis, organic matter, total organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, temperature, oxidation reduction potential and nitrite could affect the occurrence of ARGs. MST indicators analysis demonstrated that this river basin was largely polluted by human and pig feces, and human feces might be one main source of the four ARGs and five antibiotics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antibiotic; Antibiotic resistance gene; Microbial source tracking; Risk assessment; Spatiotemporal distribution","Antibiotics; Biomarkers; Genes; Mammals; Organic carbon; Redox reactions; Risk assessment; Rivers; Antibiotic resistance genes; Dissolved organic carbon; Environmental factors; Environmental risk assessment; Microbial source tracking; Oxidation reduction potential; Spatiotemporal distributions; Total Organic Carbon; River pollution; antibiotic agent; ciprofloxacin; dissolved organic matter; enrofloxacin; erythromycin; nitrite; norfloxacin; ofloxacin; organic matter; oxytetracycline; roxithromycin; sulfadiazine; sulfadimethoxine; sulfadimidine; sulfamerazine; sulfamethoxazole; sulfathiazole; surface water; tetracycline; antiinfective agent; bacterial DNA; algorithm; antibiotic resistance; antibiotics; concentration (composition); dry matter; environmental risk; feces; oxidation; risk assessment; river basin; river system; sediment-water interface; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; alga; antibiotic resistance gene; Article; China; concentration (parameter); environmental factor; feces; gene; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; pig; pollution; risk assessment; river; seasonal variation; sediment; temperature; total organic carbon; water sampling; Anabaena flos-aquae; animal; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; chemistry; China; drug effect; environmental monitoring; genetics; human; river; season; time factor; water pollutant; China; algae; Suidae; Anabaena flos-aquae; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; China; DNA, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Genes, Bacterial; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Seasons; Swine; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078010244

In this work, a method to estimate NOx emissions by means of mutual information (MI) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) was introduced. All measured signals were ranked by MI value and the most significant parameters were classified according to their physical meanings. The model inputs were selected by analysis of the classified groups. The forecasting model was developed by the BPNN algorithm to predict raw NOx emissions and NO mass flow rate (MFR) before Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with selected input variables. Ranking, classification, selection, and training were carried out under steady-state conditions and the world harmonized stationary cycle. The verified BPNN network could well predict raw NOx emissions and NO MFR before SCR. Compared to static map prediction, the mean absolute deviation and root mean square error of BPNN are reduced by about 15%, which also indicated that the MI-based feature selection method was effective. The proposed approach is a generic approach for NOx emission prediction, which could also reduce the requirement for expert knowledge on feature selection, has a lower computational cost, and could be used in engine and aftertreatment control system of real driving vehicle. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Back propagation neural network; Correlation analysis; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Mutual information; Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission estimation","Engines; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; Selective catalytic reduction; Torsional stress; Back propagation neural networks; Correlation analysis; Emission estimation; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Mutual informations; Backpropagation; artificial neural network; back propagation; correlation; engine; nitric oxide; prediction; quantitative analysis; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080984858

Understanding the various planting behaviors of farmers, instead of taking them as one, can be very helpful for improving crop management efficiency. This information can be used to relieve the pressures of direct and indirect energy use and GHG emissions. In this study, we took Jiangsu Province as an example to estimate the energy and GHG performance of the rice-wheat rotation system from a life-cycle perspective based on a large-scale behavior investigation of 409 samples in 2016. We further studied the influences of regional farmers’ planting characteristics on energy and GHG performance by regression models. The results indicated that farmers’ agricultural inputs varied widely among individuals and regions. Indirect energy consumption and GHG emissions, which are mainly caused by the use of fertilizers and pesticides and vary among farmers, contribute most to the life-cycle energy use and GHG emissions of the crop system in Jiangsu. The life-cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions of rice systems in Jiangsu can be effectively reduced by increasing the planting scales. Statistically, by controlling household characteristics such as the number of farmers involved in agricultural activities, age and education level of the household head, a 1-ha increase in the planting scale would lead to approximately 14.07 J/kcal and 1.676 kg CO2-e/kcal decreases in life-cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions, respectively, in Jiangsu. Policy implications are proposed to reduce and rationally use fertilizer as well as to enlarge the planting scale for sustainable agricultural development in Jiangsu. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption; Farm size; Fertilizer use; GHG emissions","Artificial life; Crops; Energy utilization; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Public policy; Regression analysis; Agricultural activities; Agricultural productions; Farm size; Fertilizer use; GHG emission; Life cycle perspectives; Rice-wheat rotations; Sustainable agricultural development; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079171682

The molecular-frame fivefold-differential cross sections were measured for electron emission in the plane perpendicular to the incoming projectile beam. An (e, 2e + ion) triple coincidence method was used covering projectile scattering angles of 6.5°, 10.0° and 20.0° and ejected energies of 20 eV and 30 eV. The experimental cross sections are compared with results from the multi-center distorted-wave (MCDW) as well as the molecular three-body distorted wave (M3DW) approaches. M3DW is in overall better agreement with the measured data in the binary lobes than MCDW, while the intensity of recoil lobes are underestimated by both theories. Furthermore, we examine the presence of two-center interference patterns by comparing the experimental cross section ratios between mutually perpendicular alignment angles of the molecular axis with that predicated by the interference model. Agreement with the interference model is found only for Bethe ridge kinematics, i.e. in the binary peak region and with the ejected electron momentum being roughly equal to the momentum transfer.

We use China's panel data of provincial-level carbon emissions over 1995–2016 to quantitatively measure the levels of inter-provincial imbalance and polarization in carbon emissions and carbon intensity. Further, we decompose the Kaya-Zenga index into different contributing factors both regionally and structurally and perform a scenario analysis to identify the corresponding regionally differentiated countermeasures regarding carbon emission reduction. The results show that the imbalance in carbon emissions is mainly caused by imbalances in population scale and income level, while the imbalance in carbon intensity predominantly results from imbalances in energy efficiency and energy mix. In addition, for heavy manufacturing provinces, the respective emission-reduction strategy should aim at lowering energy intensity through local technology improvement and inter-regional technology transfer. For light manufacturing and high technology provinces, carbon emission reduction is harder to be achieved; however, a mix of policies of improving energy efficiency, optimizing energy mix, and industrial upgrading should be implemented. The results of the scenario analysis indicate that reducing imbalance in carbon intensity under different scenarios can lead to a substantial reduction in carbon emissions (up to 10%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Carbon imbalance; Carbon intensity; China; Kaya-Zenga index; Scenario analysis","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; energy intensity; Gross Domestic Product; index method; panel data; scenario analysis; Article; carbon balance; carbon footprint; chemical structure; China; economic development; energy balance; energy consumption; environmental policy; human; income; polarization; population; reduction (chemistry); technology; gross national product; industry; China; Torreya nucifera; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Gross Domestic Product; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081039195

These uncertainties are ever more pertinent today as urban transportation systems undergo drastic changes. This study presents a greenhouse gas emission and energy consumption accounting approach for on-road transportation, developed to estimate well-to-wheel emission distributions for household gasoline and electric vehicles, while capturing specific sources of uncertainty in the modelling process. Using data for Greater Toronto and Hamilton, the combined effects of vehicle electrification and well-to-wheel emission uncertainty were investigated. Under the base case, and for the study years 2011 and 2017, mean values for daily regional greenhouse gas emissions from household transportation, were estimated at 31,000 and 29,000 metric tons of CO2eq. The results of the policy scenarios present insight into the effectiveness of electric vehicles at reducing emissions and point out possible risks of using deterministic and single point estimates in policy appraisal. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that well-to-tank emissions have the largest uncertainty, while tank-to-wheel emissions contribute the most to total uncertainty as they make up 75% of total emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decision-making; Electric vehicle; Emission distribution; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gases; Monte-Carlo simulation; Road transport; Robustness; Stochasticity; Uncertainty; Well-to-wheel emissions","Decision making; Electric automobiles; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Monte Carlo methods; Motor transportation; Risk perception; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Robustness (control systems); Sensitivity analysis; Tanks (containers); Urban transportation; Vehicle wheels; Emission distribution; Road transports; Stochasticity; Uncertainty; Well-to-wheel; Uncertainty analysis; decision making; electrification; emission; greenhouse gas; Monte Carlo analysis; road transport; sensitivity analysis; simulation; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; Canada; Hamilton [Ontario]; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081670561

Air pollution may affect driving behavior through psychological and physiological pathways and cause the haze to reduce visibility of road. Our objective here is to explore whether daily traffic accident is related to the environmental air pollutant while other factors, including weather and time variables, are controlled. We used particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5, which are the two main air pollutants in China) to quantify air pollution. We collected daily traffic accident data of a small island of Taihu Lake, in Suzhou City, China. Four types of count models, namely, Poisson, negative binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression were applied to fit data. PM10 and PM2.5 were respectively included in the four count models. The four models revealed a similar result that daily traffic accident was positively related to PM10 and PM2.5. If PM10 and PM2.5 increased from the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards-Grade I to Grade Ⅱ, then traffic accidents increased by nearly 35% and 11.1%.Our results confirmed that daily risk of traffic accident was related to PM (PM10 and PM2.5) and increase the social burden.

The development of such strategies is the subject of target E of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030). Furthermore, an increasing understanding of the need to address the root causes of risk has led to calls for greater coherence between strategies that focus on DRRR, and those dedicated to climate change adaptation and sustainable development goals. The purpose of this paper is to increase knowledge on associated decision-making in general, and in Sweden in particular. We analyze the relevance and scope of a Swedish DRRR strategy, and identify drivers and barriers to integrated development and implementation. Based on document reviews, and interviews and group discussions with representatives in Sweden and six European countries, the results highlight a growing awareness that much remains to be learnt and shared between domains in order to progress towards integrated DRRR and more climate-proof sustainable development. In practice, most strategies are developed independently and related actors work in silos, leading to power struggles with negative impacts on national and local capacity. At the same time, windows of opportunity are appearing for the development of national DRRR strategies and increased policy coherence. We discuss these, and present some policy recommendations. © 2019 The Authors","Agenda 2030; Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Climate policy integration; Disaster management; Disaster risk reduction; Local strategies; Mainstreaming; National strategies; Paris agreement; Resilience building; Risk reduction; Sendai Framework; Sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078214737

As an endophyte and prolific grass root colonizer it has the potential to promote plant growth, enhancing crop yield in many cereal crops. While the mechanisms for plant growth promotion are controversial, the one irrefutable fact is these microorganisms rely heavily on plant-borne carbon as their main energy source in support of their biological functions. Unfortunately, the tools and technology enabling researchers to trace carbon exchange between plants and the microorganisms associating with them has been limiting. Here, we demonstrate that radioactive11CO2 administered to intact maize leaves with translocation of11C-photosynthates to roots can provide a ‘traceable’ source of carbon whose assimilation by microbial organisms can be quantified with enormous sensitivity. Fluorescence root imaging of RAM10, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporting strain of H. seropedicae, was used to identify regions of high microbial colonization. Microbes were mechanically removed from these regions via sonication in saline solution and extracts were subjected to fluorescence measurement and gamma counting to correlate carbon-11 atoms with numbers of colony forming units. The method has potential to translate to other microorganisms provided they possess an optical reporting trait. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite this importance, global forest loss has steadily increased in recent decades. Protected Areas (PAs) currently account for almost 15% of Earth's terrestrial surface and protect 5% of global tree cover and were developed as a principal approach to limit the impact of anthropogenic activities on natural, intact ecosystems and habitats. We assess global trends in forest loss inside and outside of PAs, and land cover following this forest loss, using a global map of tree cover loss and global maps of land cover. While forests in PAs experience loss at lower rates than non-protected forests, we find that the temporal trend of forest loss in PAs is markedly similar to that of all forest loss globally. We find that forest loss in PAs is most commonly-and increasingly-followed by shrubland, a broad category that could represent re-growing forest, agricultural fallows, or pasture lands in some regional contexts. Anthropogenic forest loss for agriculture is common in some regions, particularly in the global tropics, while wildfires, pests, and storm blowdown are a significant and consistent cause of forest loss in more northern latitudes, such as the United States, Canada, and Russia. Our study describes a process for screening tree cover loss and agriculture expansion taking place within PAs, and identification of priority targets for further site-specific assessments of threats to PAs. We illustrate an approach for more detailed assessment of forest loss in four case study PAs in Brazil, Indonesia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the United States. © 2020 by the authors.","Deforestation; Global forest; Protected areas; Tree cover loss","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Agriculture expansion; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenic forest; Democratic Republic of Congo; Ecosystem services; Northern latitudes; Temporal trends; Terrestrial surface; Ecosystems; biodiversity; deforestation; ecosystem service; forest cover; greenhouse gas; land cover; protected area; Biodiversity; Conservation; Coverings; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Trees; Brazil; Canada; Democratic Republic Congo; Indonesia; Russian Federation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085657469

Individual-tree biomass estimates made using allometric equations are the foundation for these maps, yet the potentially-high uncertainty and bias associated with individual-tree estimates is commonly ignored in biomass map error. We developed allometric equations for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in northern Colorado. Plot-level biomass estimates were combined with Landsat imagery and geomorphometric and climate layers to map aboveground tree biomass. We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Component Ratio Method (FIA-CRM). Total biomass map uncertainty was calculated by propagating errors from allometric equations and remote sensing model predictions. Two evaluation methods for the allometric equations were compared in the error propagation-errors calculated from the equation fit (equation-derived) and errors from an independent dataset of destructively-sampled trees (n = 285). Results: Tree-scale error and bias of allometric equations varied dramatically between species, but local equations were generally most accurate. Depending on allometric equation and evaluation method, allometric uncertainty contributed 30-75% of total uncertainty, while remote sensing model prediction uncertainty contributed 25-70%. When using equation-derived allometric error, local equations had the lowest total uncertainty (root mean square error percent of the mean [% RMSE] = 50%). This is likely due to low-sample size (10-20 trees sampled per species) allometric equations and evaluation not representing true variability in tree growth forms. When independently evaluated, allometric uncertainty outsized remote sensing model prediction uncertainty. Biomass across the 1.56 million ha study area and uncertainties were similar for local (2.1 billion Mg; % RMSE = 97%) and nationwide (2.2 billion Mg; % RMSE = 94%) equations, while FIA-CRM estimates were lower and more uncertain (1.5 billion Mg; % RMSE = 165%). Conclusions: Allometric equations should be selected carefully since they drive substantial differences in bias and uncertainty. Biomass quantification efforts should consider contributions of allometric uncertainty to total uncertainty, at a minimum, and independently evaluate allometric equations when suitable data are available. © 2020 The Author(s).","Allometric equations; Carbon; Landsat; Pinus contorta; Pinus ponderosa; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Uncertainty","allometry; biomass; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; equation; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; Landsat; landscape structure; remote sensing; satellite imagery; uncertainty analysis; Pinus contorta; Pinus ponderosa; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085130893

Notably, calcium carbonate loadings of up to 60 wt% were investigated. The formulations were designed to be I- and D-optimal, based on a quadratic Scheffé polynomial model. Novel and established measures for the thermal stability of the materials were compared, based on data generated using techniques for the determination of oxidative induction time and for studies by time-sweep oscillatory rheometry. For ease of comparison, all tests were performed in air. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was performed on the materials subjected to time-sweep oscillatory rheometry, to ascertain the locality and modes of degradation. Variable effects were found, depending on the technique used. Broadly, strong primary effects were found: positive in the cases of the carbon black and stabiliser pack, negative in the case of calcium carbonate. The latter, however, was offset by the highly synergistic interaction of calcium carbonate with the stabiliser pack.

The estimated health burden of exposure to shipping emissions in coastal areas may inform policy makers as they seek to reduce exposure and associated potential health impacts. This work estimates the PM2.5-attributable impacts in the form of premature mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions, from long-term exposure to shipping emissions. Health impact assessment (HIA) was performed in 8 Mediterranean coastal cities, using a baseline conditions from the literature and a policy case accounting for the MARPOL Annex VI rules requiring cleaner fuels in 2020. Input data were (a) shipping contributions to ambient PM2.5 concentrations based on receptor modelling studies found in the literature, (b) population and health incidence data from national statistical registries, and (c) geographically-relevant concentration-response functions from the literature. Long-term exposure to ship-sourced PM2.5 accounted for 430 (95% CI: 220–650) premature deaths per year, in the 8 cities, distributed between groups of cities: Barcelona and Athens, with &gt;100 premature deaths/year, and Nicosia, Brindisi, Genoa, Venice, Msida and Melilla, with tens of premature deaths/year. The more stringent standards in 2020 would reduce the number of PM2.5-attributable premature deaths by 15% on average.

This study has made an effort to find out the association of carbonaceous aerosol (CA) emissions with the socio-economic factors in the households of a rural village, Baggi in Himachal Pradesh, India. Also, the emissions of Organic Carbon (OC) and Elemental Carbon (EC) were evaluated for different types and combination of fuel combustion for cooking and heating purposes. Enhanced average concentrations of OC (240 μg/m3) and EC (118.4 μg/m3) were found with sole biomass burning (wood) on the Chullah (traditional low-budget cookstoves) due to inefficient and incomplete combustion. Although, there was a significant reduction of 53% and 41% in OC and EC respectively when a combination of biomass and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) was used for cooking. With LPG, the concentrations of OC and EC significantly declined to as low as 38.1 μg/m3 and 31.6 μg/m3 respectively. Also, an excellent inter-relationship was identified between the socio-economic parameters such as the kitchen's ventilation, education, financial status, etc. and CA emissions. In the house with very good ventilation (2 wide windows), the total CA emissions were as low as 86.7μg/m3. Also, the family members were educated and financially affluent. On the other hand, the total CA emissions were escalated by a significant 75.9% where the ventilation facility was extremely poor (small window and slit in the roof), the family was limitedly educated, and financial status lied below poverty line. On an average, the women in this village were found to spend 5 hours per day in the kitchen area. The socio-economic parameters are necessarily important towards the mitigation indoor air pollution and hence carbonaceous aerosols. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Elemental Carbon; Organic Carbon; Solid Biomass Fuel","Aerosols; Air quality; Biomass; Budget control; Combustion; Economic analysis; Fuels; Heating; Indoor air pollution; Liquefied petroleum gas; Organic carbon; Ventilation; Average concentration; Carbonaceous aerosol; Himachal Pradesh , India; Incomplete combustion; Inter-relationships; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Socio-economic factor; Ventilation facilities; Rural areas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086226084

Candelilla has an economic importance due to natural wax it produces. The economic importance and the intense harvest of the wax from candelilla seems to gradually reduce the natural populations of this species. The essence of this research was to project the potential distribution of candelilla populations under different climate change scenarios in its natural distribution area in North America. We created a spatial database with points of candelilla presence, according to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). A spatial analysis to predict the potential distribution of the species using Maxent software was performed. Thirteen of 19 variables from the WorldClim database were used for two scenarios of representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (4.5 as a conservative and 8.5 as extreme). We used climate projections from three global climate models (GCMs) (Max Planck institute, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and the Met Office Hadley), each simulating the two scenarios. The final predicted distribution areas were classified in five on-site possible candelilla habitat suitability categories: none (< 19%), low (20-38%), medium (39-57%), high (58-76%) and very high (> 77%). According to the area under the curve (0.970), the models and scenarios used showed an adequate fit to project the current and future distribution of candelilla. The variable that contributed the most in the three GCMs and the two RCPs was the mean temperature of the coldest quarter with an influence of 45.7% (Jackknife test). The candelilla's distribution area for North America was predicted as approximately 19.1 million hectares under the current conditions for the high habitat suitability; however, the projection for the next fifty years is not promising because the GCMs projected a reduction of more than 6.9 million hectares using either the conservative or extreme scenarios. The results are useful for conservation of the species in the area with vulnerable wild populations, as well as for the selection of new sites suitable for the species growth and cultivation while facing climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Candelilla spatial analysis; Environmental change scenarios; Species distribution","Biodiversity; Climate models; Conservation; Ecosystems; Population distribution; Population statistics; Area under the curves; Climate change scenarios; Geophysical fluid dynamics laboratories; Global climate model; Information facilities; Natural distribution; Potential distributions; United States of America; Climate change; climate change; database; shrub; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; species concept; wild population; America; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Mexico; USA; Chihuahuan Desert; Euphorbia antisyphilitica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085655925

Post-processing techniques have accentuated the reduction of the overall size to the nanoscale and the modification of the material properties of these structures. However, there are no processing techniques that can locally modify the morphology and the properties of microscale polymeric structures. In this study, our objective is to demonstrate localized nanoscale morphing and material modification of polymer 3D lattice structures through continuous wave laser induced selective pyrolysis, leading to local carbonization. Our approach of focused laser heating on single beam members precipitates thickness reduction from 500 nm to 250 nm. Local size reduction can further embrace collective mechanical deformation and form new complex geometries. Through spatially-variant laser heating on the periodic structures, curved and gradient three-dimensional shapes can be fabricated. Finite element analysis explained the resulted changes and predicted the enhanced mechanical performance. Ultimately, in situ scanning electron microscopy of the microindentation process proves that the modified structure demonstrates a substantially improved mechanical performance through the combination of high strength and ductility of the ceramic and polymer counterparts.

Continued reforestation that aims to achieve further economic and environmental benefits remains a national priority and strategy. We explore the current status of plantation forests and highlight possible means to facilitate their expansion in the uplands of Vietnam. We employ mixed method triangulation to empirically explore plantation forests and their economic role in household livelihood, to quantify trade-offs between plantation forests and shifting cultivation, and to assess the constraints on plantation forest expansion in Nghe An province, north-central Vietnam. Results show that forest in the study area expanded by 406,000 ha (71.1%) between 1990 and 2016. Plantation forests increased by nearly 500% (from 32,000 ha to 190,000 ha), while natural forests expanded by 48.1% (from 538,000 ha to 797,000 ha). Plantation forests contributed an average of 35.1 percent of total household income in wealthier households and 27.9 percent of income in poor households. Switching from shifting cultivation to plantation forests would increase total household income and average carbon stock but decrease food provision. Total Economic Value would be higher for plantation forest scenarios if increased carbon stocks in plantations can be monetized. This carbon income might drive conversion of shifting cultivation to plantation forests. Constraints on further expansion of plantation forest are low external cooperation, education, market stability, and agroforestry extension services. Our empirical results inform national plantation forest development, sustainable upland livelihood development, and climate change mitigation programs to ultimately facilitate forest transition and improve the resilience and sustainability of socio-ecological systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Forest transition; Plantation forest solutions; Principal component analysis; Rural livelihood; Trade-offs; Vietnam","Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Deforestation; Economic analysis; Landforms; Reforestation; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Economic and environmental benefits; Forest cover change; Forest transition; Plantation forests; Shifting cultivations; Socio-ecological systems; Total economic values; Economic and social effects; environmental change; forest cover; household income; livelihood; plantation; rural area; trade-off; upland region; Carbon; Commerce; Deforestation; Economic Analysis; Reforestation; Vietnam; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085643415

Microgrid energy management (MGEM) is a challenging task for microgrid operator (MGO) for optimal energy utilization with penetration of renewable energy sources, energy storage devices, and demand response. In this paper, optimal energy dispatch strategy is established for grid-connected and stand-alone microgrids integrated with photovoltaic, wind turbine, fuel cell, microturbine, diesel generator, and battery storage system. Techno-economic benefits are demonstrated for the hybrid power system considering uncertainty of load and generation. So far, MGEM problem has been addressed with the aim of minimizing operating cost only. However, the issues of power losses and emission-related objectives need to be addressed for effective MGEM. In this paper, MGEM is formulated as mixed-integer linear programming, and a new multi-objective solution is proposed for MGEM. Demand response is also included in the optimization problem to demonstrate its impact on optimal energy dispatch and techno-commercial benefits. Simulation results are obtained for the optimal capacity of each component, charging/discharging scheduling, state of charge, power import from main grid, net present cost, cost of energy, initial cost, operational cost, fuel cost, and cost of emissions taking care of seasonal load variation throughout the year. The results show that CO2 emission in stand-alone microgrid is reduced by 41.74% compared with traditional system with diesel generator. Simulation results obtained with the proposed method has been compared with various evolutionary algorithms to verify its effectiveness. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","demand response; microgrid energy management; renewable energy sources; seasonal load; storage system","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Diesel engines; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Microgrids; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Battery storage system; Charging/discharging; Hybrid power systems; Integration of renewable energies; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimization problems; Renewable energy source; Traditional systems; Electric load dispatching",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079701400

In addition, biomodified rapeseed meal characteristics (acidity and microbiological) were analyzed. The 36-day experiment was conducted using 25-day-old Large White/Norwegian Landrace (LW/NL) piglets, which were randomly distributed into two groups: a control group fed with basal diet and a treated group fed with fermented feed (500 g/kg of total feed). The study showed that the selected LAB starter combination can be recommended for rapeseed meal fermentation (viable LAB count in fermented feed 8.5 ± 0.1 log10 CFU/g and pH 3.94 ± 0.04). At the beginning of the in vivo experiment, the microbial profiles in both piglet groups were very similar: The highest prevalence was Prevotella (34.6–38.2%) and Lactobacillus (24.3–29.7%). However, changing from an extruded soya to fermented rapeseed meal in the feed recipe led to desirable changes in piglets’ fecal microbiota. There was a more than four-fold higher Lactobacillus count compared to the control group. Furthermore, there was significantly lower ammonia emission (20.6% reduction) in the treated group section. Finally, by changing from an extruded soya to cheaper rapeseed meal and applying the fermentation model with the selected LAB combination, it is possible to feed piglets without any undesirable changes in health and growth performance, as well as in a more sustainable manner. © 2020 by the authors.

A majority of the country's development has occurred within and around Bangkok (BKK), the capital city of Thailand, and the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR). Since 1995, the BMR has experienced air quality degradation, in particular, enhanced ozone (O3) due to a combination of the local increase in emissions from accelerated growth in automotive and industrial activities, local meteorology including strong solar radiation, high temperature and high humidity, and potential long-range effects of regional transport from China. To investigate the O3 formation in the BMR due to the effects of long-range transport and local meteorology feedbacks, we perform a multi-scale simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) during the O3 season (January to March), 2010; since O3 mixing ratio exceedances in the BMR occur primarily during this period The results in this study indicate the significance of China's emission reductions on the regional-scale and the local-scale pollution, as far as the BMR region and southern Thailand. Applying China's oxide of nitrogen (NOx)-only emission controls, generally, enhance the domain-wide monthly-average peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and O3 in the regional scale, in the order of ~1–7% and ~1–5%, respectively, while those in the local scale are ~ 0.2–6% and ~0.1–5% compared with the baseline simulation. However, the increases in PAN and O3 are mitigated by 40% China's Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) reduction along with 40% NOx reduction. The results, supported by an indicator analysis, suggest that northern and eastern China, northern and central Thailand and the BMR, are likely VOC-limited during the O3 season. Since the BMR is VOC-limited regime, controlling anthropogenic VOC emissions will show more benefit to control O3 than controlling NOx-only emissions. Other factors that influence on O3 levels in the BMR are biogenic VOC emissions from the Tenasserim range and land- and sea-breeze circulations that recirculate and disperse pollutants along the coastal areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Long-range transport; NOx-limited; Surface ozone; VOC-Limited; WRF-Chem","Air quality; Emission control; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Radiation effects; Volatile organic compounds; Industrial activities; Land and sea breezes; Long range transport; Metropolitan regions; Multi-scale simulation; Peroxyacetyl nitrates; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Weather research and forecasting models; Weather forecasting; nitric acid; nitrogen; oxygen; ozone; peroxyacetylnitrate; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic source; capital city; coastal zone; emission control; high temperature; metropolitan area; ozone; spatiotemporal analysis; urban pollution; urbanization; air pollution control; air quality; Article; boundary layer; circadian rhythm; control strategy; controlled study; dry season; environmental monitoring; high temperature; humidity; ozonation; particle size; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); sensitivity analysis; simulation; solar radiation; surface property; Thailand; Bangkok; Bilauktaung Range; Central Region [Thailand]; China; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Myanmar; Tanintharyi; Thailand; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083337226

Amongst the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found indoors, formaldehyde and toluene are two toxic compounds. Indoor plants have an innate capability to remediate indoor airborne pollutants. Zamioculcas zamiifolia is an ornamental plant local to Thailand reported to be very efficient for VOC removal. Indole acetic acid (IAA) was applied to shoots and roots of Z. zamiifolia to enhance the capability for removing a toluene and formaldehyde mixture. We found that 5 μM of exogenous IAA can enhance Z. zamiifolia efficiency about 20% and 40% for toluene and formaldehyde, respectively, after plant was exposed to initial toluene-formaldehyde mixture concentration 20 ppm (1:1) for 3 cycles (156 h). We found that 5 μM of exogenous IAA had a positive effect on the stomatal aperture opening and stomatal conductance. However, 10 μM of exogenous IAA had a negative effect on the opening of stomatal aperture, and thus initially decreased that remediating ability of Z. zamiifolia for formaldehyde and toluene. We investigated the formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity in shoots of Z. zamiifolia and found significantly enhanced FDH activity in plants supplied with exogenous IAA. We concluded that exogenous IAA in optimum amounts could enhance the mitigating ability of indoor plants for airborne air pollutants. However, our research indicated that the application of IAA to roots could have a negative effect on the remediating ability of Z. zamiifolia. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air phytoremediation; Formaldehyde; Indole-3-acetic acid; Toluene; Zamioculcas zamiifolia","concentration (composition); formaldehyde; ornamental species; phytohormone; shoot growth; toluene; volatile organic compound; Thailand; Zamioculcas zamiifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083279275

Acknowledging that successful radon risk management requires engagement of stakeholders, this paper investigated prescriptions and practices for stakeholder participation. First, it points out the need to integrate radon risk management in a holistic approach to indoor air pollution, together with urban planning and energy saving policies. It then argues for establishing more systematic approaches to the involvement of stakeholders in the design, implementation and evaluation of radon actions. Finally, it suggests the development of context specific approaches for the engagement of stakeholders at local and regional level. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences 2020.","ENGAGE; Indoor radon; Radiation protection culture; Radon action plan; Stakeholder engagement","Energy conservation; Health risks; Indoor air pollution; Risk management; Energy saving policies; Holistic approach; In-buildings; Indoor radon; Lung Cancer; Regional levels; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder participation; Radon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087871661

Cumulative impact maps highlight regions affected by multiple human activities, but efficient conservation investment requires linking dominant pressures to management actions that best address the particular drivers of impacts. We rebuild cumulative impact maps by stressor type (climate change, marine and land) at a global scale to evaluate the expected effectiveness of various management strategies for all coastal territories. Average cumulative impact from non-marine stressors (climate and land) was double those of marine impacts at a national level. The greatest climate impacts by country were in the waters of Pacific Island and Antarctic territories; in the Caspian Sea region and East-Asia for land impacts; and in the waters of European, East-Asian and Caribbean countries for marine impacts. We developed a conservation-effectiveness indicator for the 10 worst-impacted countries in each of the three stressor categories. The indicator considered common management tools for each stressor category: ecosystem-based adaptation and disaster risk reduction (climate), marine protected areas (marine) and integrated coastal management (land). Key disparities were found between broad-scale management of marine ecosystems and the dominant stressors, with existing management in tropical island nations likely insufficient to address intense impacts from climate change. These countries also typically had low performance on governance indicators, suggesting challenges in implementing new mitigation. We highlight trade-offs in making decisions for stressor mitigation and offer strategic guidance on identifying locations to target management of marine, land, or climate impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic pressures; Cumulative effects; Ecosystem-based management; Indicators; Marine spatial planning; Threat maps","coastal zone management; conservation management; ecosystem management; human activity; marine environment; protected area; risk assessment; spatial planning; trade-off; Caspian Sea; Pacific islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082683463

Nevertheless, the commonly used platinum as the counter electrode (CE) encounters great difficulties in its scarcity and noble nature. Herein, we demonstrate a promising and facile route to attain an earth-abundant, high-conductivity Pt-free flexible CE with the controllable catalytic activity via the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO as the nanoscale sacrificial template. Our result reveals the electrocatalytic activity of carbon cloth as a function of surface morphology can be successfully tailored by the ALD cycle. It can be ascribed to the interplay of ZnO and carbon during carbothermic reduction, offering the synergetic effects of the defects and oxygen doping on the carbon cloth surface as the enhanced catalytic sites for the regeneration of triiodide into iodide. As a proof of concept, the DSSC using the activated carbon cloth via ALD is enabled to deliver a boosted conversion efficiency by 79%, as compared with that using pristine carbon cloth. Such a promising route can open up a perspective for reaching an earth-abundant, high-conductivity carbon-based flexible CE with the superior catalytic activity for the photoelectrochemical cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atomic layer deposition; Carbon cloth; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Pt-free counter electrode; ZnO","Activated carbon; Atomic layer deposition; Atoms; Catalyst activity; Electrodes; II-VI semiconductors; Morphology; Platinum compounds; Surface morphology; Zinc oxide; Activated carbon cloth; Carbon cloths; Counter electrodes; Electrocatalytic activity; Energy pay back time; High conductivity; Renewable energy community; Sacrificial templates; Dye-sensitized solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082044194

These services are underpinned by different energetic pathways including those dominated by Antarctic krill, fishes and squids, or gelatinous zooplankton (salps). Climate change is likely to impact Southern Ocean food webs by affecting their foundations — both primary producer communities and ice habitats. However, the implications of these changes for ecosystem services – including wildlife populations, fisheries and carbon sequestration – are unclear, as are the implications for policy and management. Here, we use a generalised representation of Southern Ocean food webs and qualitative network modelling to investigate the consequences of five simple but plausible scenarios of future change for ecosystem services and the conservation of important taxa: (i) a shift in primary producer communities with decreasing large diatoms and increasing small flagellates; (ii) increasing salps; (iii) increase (recovery) of the Great whales; and unregulated and unsustainable fisheries for (iv) krill or (v) toothfish. Strikingly, our results suggest that increases in salps might not have negative consequences for ecosystem services and could enhance carbon export potential. Simulated increases in unregulated krill and toothfish fisheries affect predatory wildlife and could also reduce carbon export potential. Our results emphasise the important policy implications of understanding the structure and change of whole food webs, and highlight that improved quantitative understanding and modelling of the relative importance of different energy pathways will be important for developing robust management responses to climate change impacts. © 2020","Ecosystem impacts of climate change; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem status and trends; Marine ecosystem assessment for the Southern Ocean; Science-policy; Southern Ocean ecosystems","carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation; ecological impact; ecosystem management; fishery management; food web; marine ecosystem; marine policy; trend analysis; Southern Ocean; Bacillariophyta; Cephalopoda; Cetacea; Euphausiacea; Mastigophora (flagellates); Pisces; Salpida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078840628

The effect of different biomass on the morphologies has been examined. Furthermore, the synthetic mechanism was deduced by investigating the impact of hydrothermal time on the synthesis. In addition, the vanadium oxidation state has been finally confirmed by XPS and UV–Vis. The as-synthesized carbon-coated Na3(VOPO4)2F shows a superior long-term cycling performance, such as the capacity retentions are higher than 70% after 1400 cycles at a current rate of 5 C.

A set of global scenarios regarding future socio-economic and climate developments, combining shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) with climate forcing outcomes as described by the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), was created by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Chinese researchers have also developed various emission scenarios by considering detailed local environmental and climate policies. However, a comprehensive scenario set connecting SSP-RCP scenarios with local policies and representing dynamic emission changes under local policies is still missing. In this work, to fill this gap, we developed a dynamic projection model, the Dynamic Projection model for Emissions in China (DPEC), to explore China's future anthropogenic emission pathways. The DPEC is designed to integrate the energy system model, emission inventory model, dynamic projection model, and parameterized scheme of Chinese policies. The model contains two main modules, an energy-model-driven activity rate projection module and a sector-based emission projection module. The activity rate projection module provides the standardized and unified future energy scenarios after reorganizing and refining the outputs from the energy system model. Here we use a new China-focused version of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM-China) to project future energy demand and supply in China under different SSP-RCP scenarios at the provincial level. The emission projection module links a bottom-up emission inventory model, the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), to GCAM-China and accurately tracks the evolution of future combustion and production technologies and control measures under different environmental policies. We developed technology-based turnover models for several key emitting sectors (e.g. coalfired power plants, key industries, and on-road transportation sectors), which can simulate the dynamic changes in the unit/vehicle fleet turnover process by tracking the lifespan of each unit/vehicle on an annual basis. With the integrated modelling framework, we connected five SSP scenarios (SSP1-5), five RCP scenarios (RCP8.5, 7.0, 6.0, 4.5, and 2.6), and three pollution control scenarios (business as usual, BAU; enhanced control policy, ECP; and best health effect, BHE) to produce six combined emission scenarios. With those scenarios, we presented a wide range of China's future emissions to 2050 under different development and policy pathways. We found that, with a combination of strong low-carbon policy and air pollution con trol policy (i.e. SSP1-26-BHE scenario), emissions of major air pollutants (i.e. SO2, NOx, PM2:5, and non-methane volatile organic compounds-NMVOCs) in China will be reduced by 34 %-66 % in 2030 and 58 %-87 % in 2050 compared to 2015. End-of-pipe control measures are more effective for reducing air pollutant emissions before 2030, while low-carbon policy will play a more important role in continuous emission reduction until 2050. In contrast, China's emissions will remain at a high level until 2050 under a reference scenario without active actions (i.e. SSP3-70-BAU). Compared to similar scenarios set from the CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6), our estimates of emission ranges are much lower than the estimates from the harmonized CMIP6 emissions dataset in 2020-2030, but their emission ranges become similar in the year 2050. © 2020 Author(s).",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; combustion; emission inventory; environmental policy; forecasting method; pollution control; socioeconomic status; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085128382

Nevertheless, it has also been pointed out that the use of a natural pozzolan as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) can pose problems of low workability and slow strength development. Also, in addition, its composition and physical properties have large variety and variability. We have been conducting studies on the total utilization of volcanic deposits for applications suitable for respective properties by classifying them by floating speed difference and particle diameter. It is reported that sorting out particles less than 2.4 g/cm3 by dry gravity classification and removal of smaller clay fraction by dust collector is technically effective to recover high purity volcanic glass from pyroclastic flow deposits called “Ito-Shirasu”, which is a local name for pyroclastic flow deposits in Japan. In this study, concrete containing high-purity volcanic glass powders with different finenesses are investigated regarding fresh properties, strength development, chloride ion penetration and CO2 reduction. As a result, it was found that volcanic glass powders made an excellent contribution to the improvement of flowability comparable to fly ash, the enhancement of strength comparable to silica fume, and the restraint of chloride ion penetration. Volcanic glass powders can also contrbute to the reduction of CO2 emission because the content of Portland cement can be significantly reduced to obtain the same strength compared to concrete with 100% Portland cement. This study provides a possibility to produce high performance SCMs in volcanic regions worldwide from volcanic ejecta by sorting out a high purity volcanic glass by the same method. © 2020, The Author(s).","Dry gravity classification; Natural pozzolan; Supplementary cementitious material; Volcanic glass","Carbon dioxide; Chlorine compounds; Clay deposits; Deposits; Fly ash; Glass; Portland cement; Powders; Screening; Silica fume; Strength of materials; Volcanoes; Chloride ion penetration; Durability of concretes; Particle diameters; Pyroclastic deposits; Pyroclastic flow deposits; Strength development; Supplementary cementitious material; Volcanic deposits; Concretes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100774756

A cradle-to-gate life cycle carbon analysis for 252 mills in the US was performed by integrating large datasets at the production line level. The results indicated that one metric ton of paper product created a production weighted average of 942 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2eq) of GHG emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions varied by pulp and paper grade, from 608 kg CO2eq per metric ton of product to 1978 kg CO2eq per metric ton of product.

In the second version of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2), the oceanic carbon cycle component has gone through numerous updates that include, amongst others, improved process representations, increased interactions with the atmosphere, and additional new tracers. Oceanic dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is now prognostically simulated and its fluxes are directly coupled with the atmospheric component, leading to a direct feedback to the climate. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition and additional riverine inputs of other biogeochemical tracers have recently been included in the model. The implementation of new tracers such as ""preformed"" and ""natural"" tracers enables a separation of physical from biogeochemical drivers as well as of internal from external forcings and hence a better diagnostic of the simulated biogeochemical variability. Carbon isotope tracers have been implemented and will be relevant for studying long-term past climate changes. Here, we describe these new model implementations and present an evaluation of the model's performance in simulating the observed climatological states of water-column biogeochemistry and in simulating transient evolution over the historical period. Compared to its predecessor NorESM1, the new model's performance has improved considerably in many aspects. In the interior, the observed spatial patterns of nutrients, oxygen, and carbon chemistry are better reproduced, reducing the overall model biases. A new set of ecosystem parameters and improved mixed layer dynamics improve the representation of upper-ocean processes (biological production and air-sea <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> fluxes) at seasonal timescale. Transient warming and air-sea <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> fluxes over the historical period are also in good agreement with observation-based estimates.

Direct irradiation of the RAFT agent as a means to generate radicals, also known as the photoiniferter mechanism, is one commonly proposed mechanism. The current study shows that dithioesters and trithiocarbonates have the lowest singlet and triplet excited-state energy levels that are close to, or lower than, the C-S bond dissociation energies. Excitation of these agents into their S1 band results in negligible radical production, while excitation into the S2 band or higher results in the decomposition of dithioesters and trithiocarbonates, resulting in radical formation but with low quantum yields. Likewise, there is significant literature precedence for an electron transfer initiation mechanism, PET-RAFT. It is shown that the dithioesters and trithiocarbonates all show peak reduction potentials at ca. -1.0 V (vs SCE). However, transient absorption spectroscopy studies of the electron transfer from a mediator show that these reactions occur rapidly only when the mediator potential is more negative than -1.2 V (vs SCE). © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Chemical bonds; Electron transitions; Free radical reactions; Polymerization; Bond dissociation energies; Excited-state energy; Initiation mechanism; Photophysical behavior; Photophysical properties; Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization; Transient absorption spectroscopies; Trithio carbonates; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085586346

Field studies were undertaken between 2011 and 2013 at 3 arable and 3 grassland sites in the UK. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured following the autumn and spring application of different manures (pig slurry, cattle slurry, cattle farmyard manure (FYM), pig FYM, poultry layer manure, and broiler litter) at typical rates, using representative manure application and soil incorporation methods. In addition, ammonia emissions and nitrate leaching losses (1 site on a light sandy soil) were measured to calculate indirect N2O losses. IPCC comparable, direct N2O EFs ranged from −0.05 to 2.30% of total nitrogen applied, with the variability driven by a range of factors including differences in manure composition, application method, incorporation and climatic conditions. When data from the autumn applications were pooled, the mean N2O EF from poultry manure (1.52%) was found to be greater (P &lt; 0.001) than from FYM (0.37%) and slurry (0.72%), with no difference found (P = 0.784) in the EF for bandspread compared with surface broadcast slurry application, and no effect (P = 0.328) of the nitrification inhibitor, Dicyandiamide (DCD). For the spring applications, the mean N2O EF for bandspread slurry (0.56%) was greater (P = 0.028) than from surface broadcast slurry (0.31%), but there were no differences (P = 0.212) in the mean N2O EFs from poultry manure (0.52%), slurry (0.44%), and FYM (0.22%). The study did confirm, however, that DCD reduced N2O emissions from slurries applied in the spring by 45%.

Many system-level assessments, however, evaluate different mixes on the basis of minimizing electricity costs without accounting for regional environmental externalities. California represents a highly populated region with both aggressive electricity decarbonization policies and water scarcity issues that are projected to worsen under climate change, representing an interesting case study for assessing the tradeoffs between the costs of electricity decarbonization and water resource consumption. This study therefore combines electric grid dispatch modeling and regional life cycle freshwater consumption data to compare in-state freshwater consumption and levelized cost of electricity for four electricity mix scenarios designed to achieve zero-carbon electricity in California by 2045, compliant with current law (California Senate Bill 100). In modeled scenarios, we find that the lowest costs occurred for mixes with lower energy storage capacity needs enabled by high capacity factor and dispatchable renewables. However these mixes also resulted in high freshwater consumption due largely to heavy reliance on geothermal resources. By contrast, the mix with the lowest freshwater consumption relied exclusively on wind, solar, and hydropower and reduced water consumption by an order of magnitude compared to that of the lowest cost mix. Due to lower capacity factors and greater difficulty in matching supply to demand (increasing energy storage needs), this mix increased the levelized cost of electricity by 30%. Overall, our results show that prioritizing low electricity costs as well as other climate-relevant criteria, such as freshwater consumption, in meeting zero-carbon electricity goals will result in a very different electricity mix than simply considering costs alone. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","California; Electric grid; Freshwater consumption; Senate Bill 100; Water for energy; Zero-carbon","Carbon; Climate change; Costs; Decarbonization; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Geothermal fields; Life cycle; Water; Water distribution systems; Water resources; California; Electric grids; Fresh water consumption; Senate Bills; Zero carbons; Electric load dispatching; carbon emission; compliance; cost analysis; electricity; energy efficiency; energy storage; smart grid; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081653956

To improve the supercapacitor stability, there is a need to understand the degradation mechanism. In this work, the degradation sites in a carbon electrode at negative potential range are investigated in two common organic electrolytes: 1 M Et4NBF4 dissolved in propylene carbonate and in acetonitrile. To elucidate the common factor over a wide range of carbon materials, we examined eight kinds of carbon materials including activated carbons, carbon blacks, zeolite-template carbon (high surface area and a large amount of carbon edge sites) and graphene mesosponge (high surface area and a little amount of carbon edge sites). Their surface structures are distinguished into two regions: carbon basal planes and edge sites by nitrogen physisorption and high-sensitivity temperature-programmed desorption up to 1800 °C. Unlike the degradation at positive potential range, initial degradation reactions at negative potential range occur mainly on the carbon basal planes rather than the edge sites. This finding is corroborated by the theoretical calculation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Basal plane; Edge site; Electrochemical degradation; Negative potential range; Supercapacitors","Activated carbon; Degradation; Electrodes; Temperature programmed desorption; Zeolites; Basal planes; Degradation mechanism; Edge sites; Electrochemical degradation; Negative potential; Nitrogen physisorption; Theoretical calculations; Zeolite template carbons; Supercapacitor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081682171

The present study is the first to develop a simulation model for estimating the fractions emitted to the air (fair), surface water (fsw), and the fractions that leach vertically (fvl) of pesticides applied in paddy fields for life cycle assessments (LCA). The emission quantification methods are based on the properties of the active ingredients of the pesticides and management aspects such as formulations (granular or liquid) and the water-holding period following application. The emission fractions of 37 pesticides used commonly in Japan were estimated using the presented model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by adjusting parameters applied in the model to reveal their influence on the emission fractions. The parameters influencing fair included the formulation applied, while the water-holding period and waterproofing of the levee influenced fsw regardless of the formulation adopted, suggesting that local management could effectively reduce emissions to surface water. In addition, soil organic carbon content influenced fvl greatly, suggesting considerable regional variation in the emission factor. The developed model is expected to greatly improve the realism of impact assessment of pesticide in LCAs for paddy rice cultivation, considering it fills a gap in the fate model used in LCAs to estimate pesticide emissions to air, surface water, and soil in paddy fields. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fate and distribution; Life cycle assessment; Management practices; Paddy fields; Pesticide","Organic carbon; Pesticides; Sensitivity analysis; Soil pollution; Surface waters; Adjusting parameters; Environmental compartment; Fate and distribution; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management practices; Paddy fields; Quantification methods; Soil organic carbon content; Life cycle; organic carbon; pesticide; surface water; emission; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; pesticide application; rice; sensitivity analysis; soil carbon; air; Article; concentration (parameter); environmental factor; leaching; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; priority journal; rice; sensitivity analysis; simulation; species cultivation; water management; water retention; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078890447

The different hydrodynamic characteristics of these two types have been intensively discussed in a literature. However, their impact and the resulting damage have not yet been examined in a comprehensive manner due to the lack of extreme rainfall data and/or computational costs of flood simulations. Recently, an increasing number of ensemble climate simulation data has become available, providing long-term rainfall data based on numerical climate simulations. This is a case study of a flooding in an urban area set in Nagoya City, Japan. We applied a large ensemble climate simulation database, d4PDF, to a pluvial and fluvial flood model and derived the flood risk curves for each type of flooding. The results indicated that pluvial flooding presents comparable economic risk to fluvial flooding (only 16% and 17% lesser damage at 50- and 100-year return periods, respectively) despite its significantly shallower flood depths (area with flood depth over 45 cm was only 10.5% and 5.4%, respectively). The significant impact of pluvial flooding is attributable to its wider flood area (despite shallower depths), impacting major economic assets sprawled over the city, including areas further away from the river. Furthermore, fluvial flood risk was managed by settling the Nagoya Castle (now the central economic district) on higher altitudes. The results suggest that pluvial flooding could have comparable economic risks to fluvial flooding in urban areas where major economic assets are not concentrated around streams as well as historical countermeasures are installed against fluvial flooding. © 2020","Ensemble climate simulation; Flood risk assessment; Fluvial flood; Pluvial flood","Climate models; Flood control; Large dataset; Rain; Risk assessment; Climate simulation; Computational costs; Economic assets; Extreme rainfall; Flood risk assessments; Flood simulation; Hydrodynamic characteristics; Pluvial flooding; Floods; climate change; comparative study; data set; ensemble forecasting; flood; flooding; fluvial process; rainfall; risk assessment; simulation; urban area; Aichi; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Nagoya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079883266

The electrosynthesis of multi-carbon (C2+) products, such as ethylene, ethanol, and 1-propanol, from CO2 is desired because of the high energy density and large global markets of these products. In order to achieve selective conversion of CO2 into C2+ products, past studies have been focused on the design of catalysts and the tuning of local environment (e.g., pH, cations, and molecular additives). Here, we report that local CO2 concentration has been an overlooked factor that affects the selectivity toward C2+ products. Utilizing our control catalysts and a gas-diffusion electrode flow cell operated at industrially relevant activity in near-neutral electrolyte, we show that a high local CO2 concentration leads to a suboptimal selectivity. Instead, providing a moderate local CO2 concentration is effective in promoting C–C coupling toward C2+ products. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Flow electrolyzers based on gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) have been increasingly employed to advance toward industry-relevant electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance, though fundamental understanding of the GDE system is still lacking. Here, we propose that regulating local CO2 concentration on copper (Cu) surfaces is an effective and general strategy to promote C−C coupling in CO2RR. Local CO2 concentration could influence the surface coverage of ∗CO2, ∗H, and ∗CO, which affects the reaction pathways toward multi-carbon (C2+) products. Guided by mass-transport modeling, we have identified three approaches to modulate the local CO2 concentration in GDE-based electrolyzers: (1) catalyst layer structure, (2) feed CO2 concentration, and (3) feed flow rate. Utilizing Cu2O nanoparticles as the model catalysts, modulation of local CO2 concentration enabled an optimized faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products of up to 75.5% at 300 mA cm−2 and C2+ partial current density of up to 342 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KHCO3. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Local environment plays an important role in steering the reaction pathways in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Here, we present three approaches to modulate local CO2 concentration in gas-diffusion electrode flow electrolyzers.

Ultimately, this study serves as a rational guide to tune CO2 mass transport in gas-diffusion electrode electrolyzers for the optimal production of valuable multi-carbon molecules. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","carbon utilization; catalysis; CO2 electroreduction; CO2 mass transport; energy conversion; ethanol; ethylene; gas-diffusion electrodes; local environment; solar fuels","Additives; Carbon; Catalyst selectivity; Copper oxides; Diffusion in gases; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Gas industry; International trade; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Potassium compounds; Product design; Faradaic efficiencies; Gas diffusion electrodes; High energy densities; Local environments; Mass transport model; Molecular additives; Neutral electrolytes; Optimal production; Carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; catalyst; concentration (composition); electrochemical method; electrode; nanoparticle; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084632637

Excessive N deposition on Earth’s surface leads to adverse feed-backs on ecosystems and humans. Similar to that of air pollution, emission control is recognized as an efficient means to control acid deposition. Control of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions has led to reduction in deposition of oxidized nitrogen (NOy, the sum of all oxidized nitrogen species, except nitrous oxide [N2O]). Reduced forms of nitrogen (NHx = ammonia [NH3] + ammonium [NH4 +]) deposition have, otherwise, increased, offsetting the benefit of reduction in NOy deposition. Stringent control of NH3 emissions is being considered. In this study, we assess the response of N deposition to N emission control on continental regions. We show that significant reduction of NHx deposition is unlikely to be achieved at the early stages of implementing NH3 emission abatement. Per-unit NH3 emission abatement is shown to result in only 60–80% reduction in NHx deposition, which is significantly lower than the demonstrated 80–120% benefit of controlling NOx emissions on NOy deposition. This 60–80% effectiveness of NHx deposition reduction per unit NH3 emission abatement reflects, in part, the effects of simultaneous reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

CN-based materials possess a lot of advantages over conventional metal-based inorganic photocatalysts including ease of synthesis and processing, versatile functionalization or doping, flexibility for surface engineering, low cost, sustainability, and recyclability without any leaching of toxic metals from photocorrosion. Carbon nitrides and their hybrid materials have emerged as attractive candidates for CO2 capture and its reduction into clean and green low-carbon fuels and valuable chemical feedstock by using sustainable and intermittent renewable energy sources of sunlight and electricity through the heterogeneous photo(electro)catalysis.

It has previously been reported that a simple surface modification gives rise to a nanoscale layer, termed the ""NanoSuit"", which can keep small animals alive under the high vacuum required for field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). We have previously applied this technique to plants, and successfully observed healthy petals in a fully hydrated state using SEM. The flower petals protected with the NanoSuit appeared intact, although we still lack a fundamental understanding of the images of other plants observed using FE-SEM. This report presents and evaluates a rich set of images, acquired using the NanoSuit, for a taxonomically diverse set of plant species.

They are very dependent on forest resources and practices of local wisdom to survive from various climate conditions. This paper aims to analyze the adaptation strategy of Kasepuhan Karang AC, Lebak District, Banten Province, towards climate change. Data are analyzed using descriptive analysis. The results show that the AC has no knowledge of climate change. However, the local wisdom reflected in their customary rules has until recently been able to make the AC to maintain their customary forest cover and manage its sustainably. They have never experienced a shortage of food and water, and are free from the huge flood disasters that hit several areas around it. This customary rule has proven that they are able to remain survived. But the increase of population and the development process has formed its own challenges. Their adaptation efforts are intended to improve the biophysical environment, expand business opportunities, and seeking breakthroughs in the use of their inherited land.

An assessment framework using three core indicators: ‘economic health’, ‘dependency on coal’ and ‘carbon contribution to climate change’ is used to identify key constraints and contradictions. The indicators include 8 secondary measures. From a complete global list of 264 countries provided by World Bank, a final sample of 118 countries was selected, based on availability of data for the indicators. The sample was further refined using a two-step process. First, 118 countries were characterized according to their capacity to transition from coal (combining ‘economic health’ and ‘dependency on coal’) then divided into 4 groups of countries (A-D). Second, the groups were categorized by their level of carbon dioxide (CO2) contribution. This step resulted in a further refinement of the categories showing the different constraints to nations achieving set transition goals. In designing and analyzing our framework, we considered the importance of interrelationships between the measures. ‘Carbon contribution to climate change’ and ‘economic health’, in particular, show strong links across the evaluated indicators. Our research demonstrates a direct correlation between CO2 emissions and the size of national economies, as well as the important role of coal imports in transitioning market systems. Green growth is widely promoted as a lever for continued economic expansion. The new energy-efficient technologies and capital investment required for this environmentally sustainable economic growth, however, present significant challenges, particularly for nations that have historically contributed little to global CO2 levels. This article provides a comprehensive multi-step analysis of country-level dependencies that will shape the decision-making pathways available to individual nation states. Recalcitrant nations frame this pathway as a trade-off between short-term economic viability and long-term, even deferrable, climate security issues. While policy platforms that defer climate action are becoming deeply unpopular in most democratic societies, there remains the fundamental question of how coal-dependent nations will stabilize their economies in the absence of coal. In a choice between imperfect alternatives, conservative politics appears to gravitate towards maintaining a cautious balance of market protectionism with the façade of supporting incremental investments in cleaner energy alternatives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coal phase-out; Economic growth; Just transition; Renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Health; International trade; Investments; Capital investment; Economic expansion; Economic growths; Economic viability; Incremental investments; Just transition; Renewable energies; Sustainable economic growth; Climate change; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; climate change; complexity; economic conditions; economic growth; energy market; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082115402

The contribution of natural and anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gas emissions is becoming increasingly significant. For example, the amount of carbon dioxide produced by the decomposition of organic substances in the zones of degradation of permafrost increases every year. The contribution of the total emission of numerous dispersed sources of atmospheric pollution is also very significant. Traditional methods of control and limitation of greenhouse gas emissions in this case are irrevocable. The solution of the problem is possible only on the basis of the creation of controlled natural and technical systems. The task for the systems is to organize the flow of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and carbon fixing in the stable components of the environment. The main area of this activity is the stimulation of bioproduction processes. This task is difficult to accomplish in the field of agricultural production. The main objective of the development of this industry is to meet the growing shortage of food products. Against the background of the threat of mass starvation in a number of regions of the world, the problem of the greenhouse effect loses its relevance. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

The reproducibility of the NPO in climate models is thus a topic of interest for the more accurate prediction of climate extremes. By investigating the spatial characteristics of the NPO in models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), this study reveals the intimate relationship between the NPO structure and the atmospheric mean states over the North Pacific. The majority of the models reasonably capture the meridional contrast of pressure anomalies, but the detailed horizontal characteristics of the NPO are found to differ among the models. Diagnostic analysis of 30 climate models and long-term observations suggest that systematic bias in the mean atmospheric baroclinicity over the North Pacific crucially affects the horizontal shape and zonal position of the NPO. In the models in which the climatological continental trough over the western North Pacific extends farther to the east, the NPO tends to be simulated farther to the east, strengthening its impact on the downstream climate. In contrast, when the climatological continental trough is reduced in size toward the west, the growth of the NPO is limited to the west, and its influence is weakened downstream. This relationship can be understood via the altered available potential and kinetic energy conversions that feed the total energy of the NPO, primarily stemming from the difference in the mean horizontal temperature gradient and stretching deformation of the mean horizontal wind. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.

Also, by using a quantitative approach, it was concluded that in general, open-dumping waste does not follow the rules of sanitary landfills. There is no gas collection and processing system so that it pollutes the atmosphere, and the absence of leachate collection and processing systems results in soil pollution and surface water.

Based on the analysis of environmental and meteorological data observed over 2013-2019 in Nanjing, an urban area in East China, this study investigated the influences of PM2.5 and RH on atmospheric visibility changes over recent years. The visibility had significantly negative correlations with the PM2.5 concentrations and RH changes. The nonlinear relationships existed between PM2.5 concentrations and visibility, as well as between RH and visibility, with the inflection points in the atmospheric visibility changes. The PM2.5 inflection concentrations were 81.0 μg m-3, 76.0 μg m-3, 49.0 μg m-3, and 33.0 μg m-3, respectively, for the RH ranges of RH &lt; 60%, 60% ≤ RH &lt; 80%, 80% ≤ RH &lt; 90%, and RH ≥ 90%, indicating that the improvement of visibility with reducing PM2.5 concentrations could be more difficult under the humid meteorological condition. The visibility changes were most sensitive to PM2.5 concentrations in the RH range of 60-80% in this urban area of East China. The relative contributions of natural factor RH and anthropogenic factor PM2.5 to variations of wintertime atmospheric visibility were quantified with 54.3% and 45.7%, respectively, revealing an important role of natural factor RH in the change of atmospheric visibility in the urban area of East Asian monsoon region. © 2020 by the authors.","Atmospheric visibility; Nanjing; PM2.5; Relative humidity","Meteorology; Visibility; Anthropogenic factors; Atmospheric visibility; Fine particulate matter; Horizontal visibility; Meteorological condition; Negative correlation; Non-linear relationships; Relative contribution; Atmospheric humidity; annual variation; anthropogenic effect; concentration (composition); particulate matter; relative humidity; urban area; visibility; winter; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085364176

In this study, we systematically investigated the microbial communities in the seawater–sediment interface of Formosa cold seep using high-throughput sequencing techniques including amplicon sequencing based on next-generation sequencing and Pacbio amplicon sequencing platforms, and metagenomics. We found that Sulfurovum dominated the microbial communities in the sediment–seawater interface, including the seawater close to the seepage, the surface sediments, and the gills of the dominant animal inhabitant (Shinkaia crosnieri). A nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was obtained from the Pacbio sequencing platforms and classified as OTU-L1, which belonged to Sulfurovum. This OTU was potentially novel as it shared relatively low similarity percentages (<97%) of the gene sequence with its close phylogenetic species. Further, a draft genome of Sulfurovum was assembled using the binning technique based on metagenomic data. Genome analysis suggested that Sulfurovum sp. in this region may fix carbon by the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) pathway, obtain energy by oxidizing reduced sulfur through sulfur oxidizing (Sox) pathway, and utilize nitrate as electron acceptors. These results demonstrated that Sulfurovum probably plays an important role in the carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles of the Formosa cold seep of the SCS. This study improves our understanding of the diversity, distribution, and function of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in deep-sea cold seep. © 2020 by the authors.

The realization of the targets depends on the fair and effective mitigation plans of all provinces. However, with varying ecological and environmental conditions and social-economic development, it is a critical issue to quantify the provinces' efforts equally. This paper proposed a comprehensive fE index in coordinating ecology, equity and economy, by accounting for carbon emissions and sinks to characterize provincial carbon emission status in China, from 2000 to 2017, which shows a spatial pattern of “boundary high, central low”. The provinces with higher fE value (&gt;1.5) in boundary areas can be seen as “relative equality” provinces with good ecology circulation, equity and economic efficiency. The provinces with lower fE value (&lt;0.7) in central areas around Bohai Bay are regarded as “severe inequality” provinces, and are identified as the hot-spot provinces, which have emitted more CO2 than their equity share by occupying the carbon emission space of other provinces in recent decades. These results could provide a reference for a provincial guide for carbon reduction and sustainable development of the low-carbon economy. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

After robust testing, we confirmed that polycentric structures decrease the mean CO2 concentrations of city regions, significantly reducing CO2 concentrations in primary city centers and mildly increasing those in city subcenters.

A set of methods and tools designed at international level is expected to be transferred to the domestic level in many developing countries, in order to generate information on how these countries contribute to global emissions reduction through local forest landscapes. Using the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) device as an example, this paper sets out to analyze this knowledge transfer by identifying bottlenecks. It proposes an original analysis that will help to better understand how such knowledge transfers could be improved at the domestic level. Based on empirical case studies related to REDD+ projects in Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, it assesses knowledge transfer and the role of stakeholders involved at multiple levels (global, regional, national and local). For this purpose, we used the Research Integration and Utilization (RIU) model, which is an analytical framework allowing analyses showing how scientific results can be owned, integrated and disseminated to meet specific needs. Results show that there is a weakness in MRV knowledge transfer from global to local levels and back. The MRV knowledge has a strong research background, a weak MRV knowledge integration and a mitigated direct utilization. The RIU model allows us to identify significant weaknesses in the transfer of MRV knowledge, including institutional dysfunction, weak institutional coordination, a lack of integration and reduced utilization of the scientific knowledge produced, despite the creation of coordinating institutions. These weaknesses are due partly to the absence of a common platform between exogenous and endogenous knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, synergies between scientists and indigenous actors should be explored and developed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Forest policy; Knowledge transfer; Monitoring verification and reporting (MRV); REDD+; RIU model","Deforestation; Developing countries; Emission control; Integration; Democratic Republic of Congo; Empirical case studies; Forest landscape; Global emissions; Knowledge integration; Knowledge transfer; Scientific knowledge; Scientific results; Knowledge management; Congo; Deforestation; Developing Countries; Integration; Monitoring; Reduction; Transfer; Utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079552235

Sediment methanogenesis and estuarine discharge appear to be the major sources of CH4 in the nearshore regions during non-upwelling period. But under oxygen deficient conditions that prevail during the upwelling period, extremely low concentrations of CH4 in the nearshore anoxic region of Mangalore (14 ± 2 nM) compared to similar region of hypoxic Kochi shelf (35.5 ± 15.4 nM) have been observed. We propose that this is mainly due to its greater loss through anaerobic oxidation and in part by the reduced sedimentary inputs by weak bioturbation over Mangalore relative to Kochi. On an annual basis, SEAS is found to be a net source of CH4 to the atmosphere with its efflux ranging from 0.03 to 170 μmol m–2 d–1 (21.9 ± 36.7 μmol m–2 d–1). Following a zonal extrapolation approach, the estimated CH4 efflux from the SEAS (7–14°N; 3.2 Gg y–1) accounts for up to ∼16% of the total CH4 emission from the Arabian Sea. © Copyright © 2020 Sudheesh, Gupta and Naqvi.","anaerobic oxidation; bioturbation; coastal anoxia/hypoxia; methane; methane flux; upwelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085740648

Hydrocarbons on combustion produce gases such as CO2, CO, HC and NOx which affect human health as well as environment. Introduction of Hydrogen in Internal Combustion (IC) engine reduces emission and increases the performance. HHO gas which is produced through electrolysis of water can be used instead of hydrocarbon based fuels as the gas contains both Hydrogen as well as oxygen. Due to the challenges in storing Hydrogen, HHO gas is produced onsite through electrolysis process. This article presents the investigation on producing HHO gas through electrolysis onsite. A numerical calculation was done using empirical formula to predict the production of HHO gas. The electrolyser's performance analysis showed that maximum of 0.75 LPM of HHO gas was produced at 80 °C and by supplying 40 A-h. The numerical calculation showed that at the similar working condition the HHO gas produced was 1.3 LPM. The trend of both experiments and model was same for varying the current and rate of generation of HHO gas.

The underlying toxicity mechanism, however, is not well explored. Here, we investigated the long-term effects of chlorothalonil on soil microbial denitrification and N2O emission pattern in a tea field after 40 days of exposure. Results showed that chlorothalonil inhibited denitrification process but remarkably promoted N2O emission by 380–830%. Chlorothalonil significantly inhibited N2O reductase activity but did not affected nosZ abundance. Our results further revealed that chlorothalonil influenced soil denitrification by directly suppressing microbial electron transport system activity, and decreasing electron donor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and energy source adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. Additionally, chlorothalonil also downregulated denitrifying functional genes (narG, nirS, and norB) and declined the relative abundances of potential denitrifiers (i.e., Pseudomonas and Streptomyces). Stepwise regression and path modeling suggested that nitrate reductase was the most significant factor in explaining denitrification rate under chlorothalonil applications. This study provides important information for revealing the chronic impacts of pesticide on tea soil denitrification and N2O emission on the basis of electron transport mechanism. Most significantly, N2O emission is underestimated in chlorothalonil-treated soils, which suggests that future estimations of N2O emission from agricultural lands should take account of pesticide dependency conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Denitrification; Enzyme activity; Microbial community; N2O emission; Pesticide","chlorothalonil; denitrification; enzyme; enzyme activity; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil microorganism; toxicity; Pseudomonas; Streptomyces; chlorothalonil; nitrile; nitrous oxide; denitrification; microbiology; soil; tea; Denitrification; Nitriles; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Tea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081410719

Many processing industries have energy that we do not even think about on a daily basis. Residues of materials that are produced in many factories from technological processes are difficult for utilization. This is the case, for example, in the manufacture of corrugated cardboard, paper dust that accumulates in air filters. This type of waste, which is mechanically separated in technological processes in Latvia, accumulates about 250 tons per year. The company presses it into briquettes and burns. Incineration generates additional emissions. It would be more environmentally friendly to recycle such waste through anaerobic fermentation. The aim of the study was to determine the potential of biogas from paper dust briquettes in anaerobic fermentation. The study was conducted in four four-section bioreactors with a capacity of 40 litres. Anaerobic fermentation took place in mesophilic mode at 38 OC. The study lasted for 100 days, during which the following results were obtained. The biogas yield was on average 25.24 L·d-1 and the methane yield 12.3 L·d-1. The yield of biogas per gram of dry organic matter was on average 0.335 L·gDOM -1, and the yield of methane was 0.163 L·gDOM -1 at 48.7 % methane content. The novelty of the research was the use of paper dust briquettes and four-section bioreactors in anaerobic fermentation. The results are original. The results by sections are as follows: section 1 averaged 5.59 L·d-1, section 2 - 4.83 L·d-1, section 3 - 5.54 L·d-1, section 4 - 9.29 L·d-1.

Little explored, however, is the interdependency of pathways and rates of CO2fixation on the concurrent usage of organic substrate(s). Potentially, this could reveal which substrates out of a pool of dissolved organic carbon are utilised by environmental microorganisms. To explore this possibility, Bacillus subtilis W23 was grown in a minimal medium with normalised amounts of either glucose, lactate or malate as only organic substrates, each together with 1 g/L NaH13CO3. Incorporation of H13CO3- was traced by elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry of biomass and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of protein-derived amino acids. Until the late logarithmic phase, 13C incorporation into the tricarboxylic acid cycle increased with time and occurred via [4-13C]oxaloacetate formed by carboxylation of pyruvate. The levels of 13C incorporation were highest for growth on glucose and lowest on malate. Incorporation of 13C into gluconeogenesis products was mainly detected in the lactate and malate experiment, whereas glucose down-regulated this path. A proof-of-principle study with a natural groundwater community confirmed the ability to determine incorporation from H13CO3- by natural communities leading to specific labelling patterns. This underlines the potential of the labelling approach to characterise carbon sources of heterotrophic microorganisms in their natural environments. © 2020 FEMS 2020.","bacterial substrate usage; dissolved organic matter; heterotrophic CO2 fixation; isotope analysis; isotope labelling; organic substrate use","bacterium; carbon fixation; detection method; dissolved organic carbon; groundwater; microorganism; organic carbon; stable isotope; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); carbon; carbon dioxide; bacterium; gluconeogenesis; isotope labeling; Bacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Gluconeogenesis; Isotope Labeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085586187

For these estimates to be successful, there is a need both for accurate quantification of urban tree populations and structure, and consideration of the net carbon sequestered when the fate of wood waste is factored in. This study provides a novel approach to providing a full city tree inventory for the city of Meran in northern Italy, using a combination of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and field techniques. Allometric equations, and the i-Tree application quantified the carbon storage in Meran as 8923 and 9213 Mg respectively, with an average carbon storage of 13.5 t/ha (5.47 kg C/m2). The percentage of traffic emissions sequestered annually is 0.61% falling to 0.17% when all emissions are considered. Differences between end-of-life wood management techniques were revealed, with burning with energy recovery for electricity being the most efficient with a carbon emissions/input ratio of 0.5. Landfill was the least efficient with a ratio of 121.9. The fate of this end-of-life wood has significant implications for carbon budget calculations in cities worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; I-tree; IPCC waste model; LiDAR; Missing value imputation; Urban tree growth; Urban tree inventory","Budget control; Lithium compounds; Optical radar; Urban growth; Waste management; Wood; Accurate quantifications; Allometric equations; Carbon neutralities; Carbon sequestration; Field measurement; Light detection and ranging; Missing value imputation; Urban trees; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079123875

Biofuel feedstocks sourced from within a regional market have the potential to also address sustainability goals. The U.S. Mid-Atlantic region could meet the advanced fuel designation specified in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2), which requires a 50% reduction in GHG emissions relative to a gasoline baseline fuel, through ethanol produced from winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We estimate technology configurations and winter barley grown on available winter fallow agricultural land in six Mid-Atlantic states. Using spatially weighted stochastic GHG emission estimates for winter barley supply from 374 counties and biorefinery data from a commercial dry-grind facility design with multiple co-products, we conclude that winter barley would meet RFS2 goals even with the U.S. EPA's indirect land use change estimates. Using a conservative threshold for soil GHG emissions sourced from barley produced on winter fallow lands in the U.S. MidAtlantic, a biorefinery located near densely populated metropolitan areas in the Eastern U.S. seaboard could economically meet the requirements of an advanced biofuel with the co-production of CO2 for the soft drink industry. © 2020 by the authors.","Biofuel policy; Energy security; GHG mitigation; Indirect land use change; Life cycle assessment","Agricultural robots; Beverages; Bioconversion; Commerce; Energy policy; Environmental Protection Agency; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Product design; Refining; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Barley (hordeum vulgare l.); Biofuel feedstocks; Biorefinery co products; Environmental footprints; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Indirect land-use changes; Metropolitan area; Soft drink industry; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084375590

This framework, known as Davenport chain and based on a wind model coherent with synoptic-scale extra-tropical cyclones, is so limpid as to become a sort of axiom. In 1977, Gomes and Vickery separated thunderstorm from non-thunderstorm winds, evaluated their extreme wind speed marginal distributions, and from them obtained a mixed statistical model later generalized to other wind types. This viewpoint, dealt with as a milestone in the emerging issue of mixed climatology, pointed out the difficulty of labeling a heterogeneous set of phenomena endowed with different velocity fields, frequencies, durations, and sizes by the generic term “wind.” Many wind types, in particular tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and downslope winds are typical of limited and well-known areas. Extra-tropical depressions and thunderstorms are natural hazards that affect the whole planet. This paper provides a state-of-the-art discussion of thunderstorm downburst, one of the most spectacular and damaging events caused by nature, and its wind loading of structures. Also, in light of the planet's climatology evolution, this topic is a key issue of structural safety and sustainability. © Copyright © 2020 Solari.","downburst; extra-tropical cyclone; mixed climatology; synoptic wind; thunderstorm; wind loading of structures",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085965226

Worldwide studies suggest that climate change can reduce the effectiveness of CD solutions, but no study of CD effects has been carried out in Polish conditions yet. In this study, the DRAINMOD (Wayne Skaggs, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA) computer simulation model was used to predict the effects of CD on the time horizons of 2021–2050 (near future) and 2071–2100 (far future) assuming the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 emission scenario. The effectiveness of CD solutions is presented for a drainage network with spacing of 7 or 14 m. Additionally, different dates of blocking the outflow from the drainage network (1st and 15th of March and 1st and 15th of April) and different initial groundwater table conditions (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 m) were assumed. All simulations for different variants were carried out for the same period, i.e. from 1st of March to 30th of September. The results of climate models indicated that in the area of central-western Poland in the near and far future there will be an increase in air temperatures by 1.02 and 1.97°C, respectively, and in precipitation by 5.98% and 10.15%, respectively. In addition, there will be a change in the structure of precipitation, especially with respect to the extension of rain-free periods and an increase in the amount of extreme daily precipitation. The effect of climate change will be a decrease in the mean groundwater table in the fields equipped with drainage systems from 2 to 5 cm. In addition, the number of days on which groundwater table will be above the level of the drainage network will decrease. For the drainage network with spacing of 7 m, the time of the groundwater table above the level of the drainage network will decrease by 5 and 7 days in the near and far future, respectively, while for the drainage network with spacing of 14 m, it will decrease by 4 and 7 days. Climate change will also reduce sub-surface outflow. Subsurface outflows will be smaller than those currently recorded on average by 11% and 17% and 12% and 18% for 7 m and 14 m spacing drainage networks, in the near and far future, respectively. The increase in rainfall intensity in the near and far future will result in a fivefold increase in surface outflow in comparison to the present situation. The simulations show that the greatest effectiveness of CD solutions will be achieved by starting the blocking of outflow from the drainage network on the 1st of March. The implementation of CD solutions since April in the near and far future will allow maintaining the groundwater table at the level presently observed for the conventional network (free drainage-FD). © 2020 by the authors.","Agriculture; Climate change; Control drainage; Drainage water management; DRAINMOD",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084307419

To optimize transportation costs, a practical design of the route network is necessary for log trucks that ship wood material from timberlands to wood mills. Road conditions resulting from various road maintenance policies dramatically affect speed limits, log-truck route networks, and transportation costs. The effects of road maintenance policies on truck route selection and user/agency cost trade-offs have not been deeply researched. By considering forest-road maintenance policies, this study intends to provide accurate information on timber-processing service coverage and log-truck route selections for forest companies or subcontracted fleets of log trucks. This research also conducts an environmental analysis to assess the effects of various road maintenance policies on consumed energy and greenhouse gas emissions of log trucks. With current maintenance policies, the results indicate that only between 33% and 51% of timber areas in Oregon can be accessed or harvested by existing nearby wood mills. However, application of the proposed road maintenance policy in this paper would increase accessibility to timberlands by up to 104%. The cost of log transportation also decreases by 16%-34%. The methodology developed in this study can lead to improvements in forest road preservation management systems to achieve the full benefits of reducing log-truck emissions and total transportation costs. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Carbon emission; Economic application of Geographic Information System (GIS); Forestry; Forestry route selection; Log transportation; Maintenance policy","Automobiles; Carbon; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Highway planning; Investments; Maintenance; Materials handling; Planning; Roads and streets; Timber; Transportation routes; Truck transportation; Trucks; Carbon emissions; Environmental analysis; Forest road maintenance; Maintenance policy; Preservation management; Route Selection; Transportation cost; Wood transportation; Costs; carbon emission; cost analysis; forestry; GIS; maintenance; road; trade-off; transportation economics; transportation planning; trucking; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080122111

Four months after the first report, the oil has already been found along >3000 km of the Brazilian coastline on >980 beaches and was recently observed along the Amazon coast, making this oil spill the most extensive and severe environmental disaster ever recorded in Brazilian history, in the South Atlantic basin, and in tropical coastal regions worldwide. Four features of this oil-spill disaster make it unique: 1) the characteristics of the oil spill; 2) the characteristics of the affected region in tropical Brazil; 3) the significant number of protected areas (>55) and tropical ecosystems affected by the oil; and 4) the absence of measures and/or flaws in the measures taken by the federal government to address this environmental and social emergency. The affected species and poor human communities in Brazil should receive focused attention in the coming decades owing to the long-term impacts of the oil contamination. Environmental monitoring and response measures must be implemented to minimize the ecological, economic, and social effects of the spill. Biodiversity and climate regulation losses considering blue carbon environments should drive discussions regarding mining accidents and global consequences related to pre-salt oil exploitation, new spill events, and their global impacts. These measures are particularly relevant in areas with high tropical biodiversity and high social inequality, as in the present case, which represents one of the worst-case scenarios of an environmental and governmental disaster. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Governance; Marine biodiversity; Oil exploration; Oil spill; Pollution","biodiversity; disaster; governance approach; hydrocarbon exploration; oil spill; pollution monitoring; protected area; tropical region; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080048072

Each PLD is greater than 2 ​km thick and contains thousands of layers, each containing information on the climatic and atmospheric state during its deposition, creating a climate archive. With detailed measurements of layer composition, it may be possible to extract age, accumulation rates, atmospheric conditions, and surface activity at the time of deposition, among other important parameters; gaining the information would allow us to “read” the climate record. Because Mars has fewer complicating factors than Earth (e.g. oceans, biology, and human-modified climate), the planet offers a unique opportunity to study the history of a terrestrial planet's climate, which in turn can teach us about our own planet and the thousands of terrestrial exoplanets waiting to be discovered. During a two-part workshop, the Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) hosted 38 Mars scientists and engineers who focused on determining the measurements needed to extract the climate record contained in the PLD. The group converged on four fundamental questions that must be answered with the goal of interpreting the climate record and finding its history based on the climate drivers. The group then proposed numerous measurements in order to answer these questions and detailed a sequence of missions and architecture to complete the measurements. In all, several missions are required, including an orbiter that can characterize the present climate and volatile reservoirs; a static reconnaissance lander capable of characterizing near surface atmospheric processes, annual accumulation, surface properties, and layer formation mechanism in the upper 50 ​cm of the PLD; a network of SmallSat landers focused on meteorology for ground truth of the low-altitude orbiter data; and finally, a second landed platform to access ~500 ​m of layers to measure layer variability through time. This mission architecture, with two landers, would meet the science goals and is designed to save costs compared to a single very capable landed mission. The rationale for this plan is presented below. In this paper we discuss numerous aspects, including our motivation, background of polar science, the climate science that drives polar layer formation, modeling of the atmosphere and climate to create hypotheses for what the layers mean, and terrestrial analogs to climatological studies. Finally, we present a list of measurements and missions required to answer the four major questions and read the climate record. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Deposits; Digital storage; Network architecture; Orbits; Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric process; Mission architectures; Scientists and engineers; Surface activities; Terrestrial analogs; Terrestrial exo-planets; Terrestrial planets; Earth (planet)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078988779

Our objective was to determine the impact of N and P fertilization on biomass yield, N use efficiency (NUE), apparent N recovery (ANR), and nutrient removal (NR) on three perennial grasses: elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.), giant reed (Arundo donax L.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Four fertility treatments were evaluated in a 8-year field study in northwestern Uruguay: 1. control (No fertilizer), 2.100 kg N ha−1 year−1, 3.100 kg P2O5 ha−1 year−1, and 4.100 kg N + 100 kg P2O5 ha−1 year−1. Across years, elephantgrass had the highest biomass yield followed by giant reed and switchgrass (18.9, 16.3, and 14.1 Mg ha−1, respectively). Biomass yield increased 46% when N fertilizer was added, compared to the control. A low response was detected for P fertilization on all grasses, probably for initial P soil content (≥9 g kg−1). Elephantgrass had the highest NUE (70 kg kg−1 N), however, it had the highest total NR on these eight years (899, 226, and 2800 kg ha−1 for N–P–K, respectively) among the grasses, indicating a potential for increased fertilization input over time. Switchgrass had the lowest average ANR (19%) and NR (334, 45, and 166 kg ha−1, respectively). Therefore, even though switchgrass presented the lowest biomass yield, it is an excellent option as low-input bioenergies grass for temperate regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass yield; Elephantgrass; Fertilization; Giant reed; Nitrogen use efficiency; Switchgrass","Efficiency; Fertilizers; Nitrogen removal; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Biomass yield; Elephantgrass; Fertilization; Giant reed; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Switchgrass; Biomass; bioenergy; biomass; concentration (composition); grass; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; phosphorus; pollutant removal; Uruguay; Arundo donax; Panicum virgatum; Pennisetum purpureum; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081624105

We analyze the climatology (1995–2014) of convective weather using TRMM lightning data. The results show both temporal and spatial variability within South Asia. The WRF-Chem model simulation for BC transport was conducted for an ENSO (El-Nino Southern Oscillation) moderate year - 2013. The model simulates the observed concentrations trend for most of the region except the central Himalayan cities. Our analysis indicates the dominant role of synoptic atmospheric dynamics and upper boundary conditions for the inverted seasonal trend of BC during the pre-monsoon season over these cities. The study presents time series and seasonal scale analysis of BC concentration over South Asia at various altitude levels. Our model simulations suggest that free troposphere (FT) BC concentration is higher in the monsoon season compared to the winter season at the same elevation. In addition, our results show the presence of a persistent BC plume from 500 hPa and above over central India with implications for the summer monsoon. The presence of an anti-cyclonic region during the monsoon season at the higher troposphere (500–300 hPa) contributes to this stable BC layer. Although individual high convection days (high helicity/CAPE) can easily transport a significant amount of BC from the surface to the FT, simulations do not show significant BC transported to the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere during these days. While satellite derived products provide some insights into model predictions, there is a need for in-situ measurements of BC concentration aloft over South Asia to further constrain model performance and improve understanding of BC transport to FT. © 2019","Black carbon; Convection; Monsoon; South Asia; Vertical","Atmospheric pressure; Boundary layers; Carbon; Climatology; Heat convection; Time series analysis; Troposphere; Weather forecasting; Black carbon; El Nino southern oscillation; Monsoon; Planetary boundary layers; South Asia; Temporal and spatial variability; Vertical; Weather research and forecasting models; Atmospheric thermodynamics; atmospheric convection; atmospheric transport; black carbon; boundary layer; climatology; monsoon; summer; troposphere; weather forecasting; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075290745

The influences of operating conditions including CH4/O2 ratio (5:1–1:2), pressure (1–50 bar) and temperature (200–1000 °C) on MPO performance in terms of reactant equilibrium conversion, product and side product yields and H2/CO ratio were scrutinized. The results reveal that indirect combustion-reforming pathway was possibly the main contributory factor to the syngas yield during MPO. The lower CH4/O2 ratios possessed a positive effect on syngas yield. Carbon formation was favored at low temperatures but it could be suppressed as CH4/O2 ratios reduced at elevated temperatures. Although a rising pressure was disadvantageous for MPO performance but the quantity of carbon deposit was hindered since these processes involved gas volume expansion. A temperature at least of 800 °C and CH4/O2 ratio of 2:1 or 3:2 are the preferable operating conditions for MPO reaction to achieve the carbon-free region meanwhile maximizing the syngas yield with H2/CO ratio of 2 that appropriate for FTS process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon elimination; Fischer-tropsch synthesis; Partial oxidation of methane; Synthetic gas; Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis","Carbon; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Methane; Oxidation; Synthesis gas; Temperature; Carbon eliminations; Equilibrium conversion; Gibbs free energy minimization; Methane partial oxidation; Partial oxidation of methane; Synthetic gas; Thermodynamic equilibria; Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Gibbs free energy; methane; oxidation; oxygen; performance assessment; temperature; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081651562

To meet these challenges, herein CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals in cube and faceted noncube shapes were explored for photocatalytic reductions of CO2. Importantly, halide-deficient dim multifaceted noncube emitters having less than 1% photoluminescence quantum yields showed superior catalytic activity compared to that of bright halide-rich cube nanocrystals. Beyond these, hexapod-shaped nanocrystals were also explored, and these remained in an intermediate state. With the support of density functional theory, the adsorption and desorption probabilities of reactants/products on different facets were also calculated and correlated with experimental findings.

A general framework for multi-objective optimization using this simulation technique is proposed for solar-wind hybrid system, considering the feed-in tariff regulations, environmental regulations and installation area constraints of Taiwan. The hourly load profile is selected using a climate classification system. A decomposition-based differential evolutionary algorithm is used for finding the optimal Pareto set of two economic objectives and one environmental objective with maximum installation area and maximum PV capacity constraints. Two types of buildings are chosen for analysis at four climate locations. Analysis of Pareto sets revealed that the photovoltaic modules are economic options for a gridconnected mode at all four locations, whereas solar-wind hybrid systems are more environmentally friendly. A method of finding the fitness index for the Pareto front sets and a balanced strategy for choosing the optimal configuration is proposed. The proposed balanced strategy provides savings to users-up to 49% for urban residential buildings and up to 32% for rural residential buildings with respect to buildings without a hybrid energy system (HES)-while keeping carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions lower than 50% for the total project lifecycle time of 20 years. The case study reveals that for all four locations and two building types an HES system comprising a 15 kW photovoltaic system and a small capacity battery bank provides the optimal balance between economic and environmental objectives. © 2020 by the authors.

Here we simulate the river-floodplain-reservoir inundation dynamics over the MRB for 1979–2016 period using a newly integrated, high-resolution (~5 km) river hydrodynamics-reservoir operation model. The framework is based on the river-floodplain hydrodynamic model CaMa-Flood in which a new reservoir operation scheme is incorporated by including 86 existing MRB dams. The simulated flood extent is downscaled to a higher resolution (~90 m) to investigate fine-scale inundation dynamics, and results are validated with ground- and satellite-based observations. It is found that the historical variations in surface water storage have been governed primarily by climate variability; the impacts of dams on river-floodplain hydrodynamics were marginal until 2009. However, results indicate that the dam impacts increased noticeably in 2010 when the basin-wide storage capacity doubled due to the construction of new mega dams. Further, results suggest that the future flood dynamics in the MRB would be considerably different than in the past even without climate change and additional dams. However, it is also found that the impacts of dams can largely vary depending on reservoir operation strategies. This study is expected to provide the basis for high-resolution river-floodplain-reservoir modeling for a holistic assessment of the impacts of dams and climate change on the floodpulse-dependent hydro-ecological systems in the MRB and other global regions. ©2020.

Limited empirical studies have been conducted to determine the influence of land use and population growth on air quality in South Africa. Thus, the purpose of this research is to examine the relationship between land use, population growth and air pollution focusing on black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) pollution in South Africa. Three urban areas; Tshwane, Rustenburg and Emalahleni in South Africa were chosen for this study. We found that the increase in population growth in these areas led directly to the expansion of built-up areas. As a consequence, these led to the increase in BC, CO and SO2 concentrations thus degrading air quality in these areas. Rural-urban migration could be the main reason for the rapid increase in population growth, land expansion and the deterioration in air quality in these areas.

Many of these services are driven by the biogeochemical cycles of C and N, and soil is the major reservoir for these chemical elements. These cycles may be influenced by the changing climate. The high plant biomass in mangrove forests makes these forests an important sink for blue C storage. However, anaerobic soil conditions may also turn mangrove forests into an environmentally detrimental producer of greenhouse gases (such as CH4 and N2O), especially as air temperatures increase. In addition, the changing environmental factors associated with climate change may also influence the N cycles and change the patterns of N2 fixation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and denitrification processes.

In view of legislation to reduce carbon emissions, the aim of the paper is to gain insights into how payment options affect inventory decisions for perishable products under the widely-used carbon tax regulation. Precisely, this paper establishes an inventory replenishment model from the buyer's perspective in which: (a) the buyer is charged for each unit carbon emissions with a constant tax rate (i.e., carbon-tax regulation) (b) the seller offers one of three commonly-used payment schemes (i.e., advance payment, cash payment, and credit payment), and (c) the product gradually degrades with time and cannot be sold after its expiration date (or sell-by date). Then, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution under each payment term is proven, which simplifies the search for the global solution to a local minimum. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted and the results among those three payment schemes are compared in order to answer the following two major questions: How does the payment scheme affect carbon emissions? Which payment scheme is the least expensive for the buyer, when carbon taxes are charged? Computational results provide evidences that the advance payment in companion with price discount is the least costly for the buyer but leads to highest carbon emissions per unit time among all three payment schemes. On the other hand, the credit payment is the best of all three payment schemes to curb carbon emissions and thus protect the climate and environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental regulations; Expiration dates; Inventory; Payment types; Perishable goods","Emission control; Environmental regulations; Laws and legislation; Sales; Sustainable development; Taxation; Computational results; Existence and uniqueness; Expiration dates; Inventory; Inventory replenishment; Numerical experiments; Payment types; Perishable goods; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073264130

Instead, cities have doubled down on waterfront development. We ask why and with what implications, using the U.S. state of Massachusetts as a case study. By overlaying data on sea level rise, land use, and property taxes, we find a few coastal cities may lose significant levels of municipal revenues to long-term sea level rise, while others face negligible impacts. Coastal municipalities are cognizant of their risks yet continue to site redevelopment projects in flood-vulnerable areas to meet present-day budgetary needs. Moreover, they resist efforts to align property values and insurance premiums with climate risks, as reforms only hasten lost taxes. Left unchanged, existing land use and fiscal policies incentivize municipalities to make short-term decisions with accelerating climate risks over time. This creates new dynamics of fiscal stress that can increase regional inequality and vulnerability to climate change. The study highlights the need for dialogue among researchers and policymakers in the U.S. and internationally on the nexus between land use planning, government administration, and climate change as these tensions likely exist wherever local governments rely on land-based finance. © 2020 The Authors","Adaptation; Climate change; Fiscal stress; Land finance; Property taxes; Sea level rise","climate change; coastal development; fiscal policy; land market; policy reform; redevelopment; sea level change; tax system; urban area; vulnerability; Massachusetts; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079902327

Here, we attempted to analyze the relationships between urban forms and CO2 emissions in 264 Chinese cities, with explicit consideration of the government policies, urban area size, population size, and economic structure. First, urban forms were calculated using the urban land derived from multiple-source remote sensing data. Second, we collected and processed CO2 emissions and three control variables. Finally, a correlation analysis was implemented to explore whether and to what extent the spatial patterns of urban forms were associated with CO2 emissions. The results show that urban form irregularity had a more significant impact on CO2 emissions in low-carbon pilot cities than in non-pilot cities. The impact of the complexity of urban forms on CO2 emissions was relatively significant in the small- and large-sized cities than in the medium-sized cities. Moreover, urban form complexity had a significant correlation with CO2 emissions in all of the cities, the level of which basically increased with the population size.

However, studies examining the effect of urban expansion on PM2.5 concentrations at multiple administrative scales from different perspectives are still lacking. In this study, multisource remote sensing data were used to define urban spatial expansion and urban socioeconomic expansion, respectively. The effect of urban expansion on PM2.5 concentrations was then evaluated and compared at the regional, urban agglomeration, and metropolitan scales. The results showed that China's economic urban expansion lagged far behind urban spatial expansion from 2000 to 2015. There is a bidirectional long-term Granger causal relationship between urban expansion and PM2.5 concentrations across different scales. A short-term Granger causality test proved that urban expansion is still at the stage of aggravating PM2.5 concentrations. Variance decomposition analysis results indicated that the contribution of urban socioeconomic expansion in explaining PM2.5 concentrations was higher than urban spatial expansion with the increase in scales. The aggregation effect has become an important means for urban socioeconomic expansion to affect PM2.5 concentrations.

In this study, we adopted an integrated approach by combining a population migration model and environmentally extended input-output analysis to quantify impacts of rural-to-urban (RU) and urban-to-urban (UU) migrations on emissions of NOx, SO2, and primary PM2.5 in China. Results indicate that population migration increases NOx (1.42 Mt), SO2 (1.30 Mt), and primary PM2.5 (0.05 Mt) emissions, accounting respectively for 5.4, 4.8, and 0.4% of China's total in 2012. RU migration, involving 54% of the migrating population, significantly increases NOx and SO2 emissions because of high urban indirect per-capita emissions from consumption and investment. RU migration influences negligibly primary PM2.5 emissions reflecting the small rural-urban difference in per-capita emissions. Interestingly, UU migration, mostly from inland to coastal provinces, leads to a slight emission decrease for the three pollutants, attributable to the greener development in coastal cities. A significant emission growth can be traced back to heavy and utility industries, suggesting that future emission control of these sectors should reduce the exposure to air pollution of the growing urban population. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Emission control; Energy utilization; Investments; Nitrogen oxides; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Urban growth; Air pollutant emission; Emission decrease; Emission growth; Input output analysis; Integrated approach; Rapid urbanizations; Urban population; Utility industry; Air pollution; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission control; energy use; input-output analysis; integrated approach; particulate matter; population migration; urbanization; air pollutant; air pollution control; article; China; human; investment; population migration; quantitative analysis; urban population; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; pollutant; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084938765

The persistence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the deep ocean has been attributed to inherently refractory molecules and to low concentrations of molecules, but the relative roles of molecular properties and molecular concentrations remain uncertain. We investigate both of these possibilities using bioassay experiments with unfiltered seawater collected from five depths (50–1500 m) at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study site. The microbial utilization of compositionally distinct forms of seawater DOC at in situ and elevated concentrations was determined. Microbial utilization of in situ organic carbon ranged from 6% to 7% in surface waters to 0% in deep water after 180 d. Additions of surface plankton-derived DOC (~18 μmol L−1), which was enriched in amino acids and carbohydrates, revealed substantial (50–75%) removal of the added DOC at all depths within 7 d. In sharp contrast, additions of C-18 isolated deep-sea DOC (~20 μmol L−1) showed insignificant or minimal utilization at all depths after 7 or 180 d, even when primed with labile substrates. These experiments demonstrate microbial communities from varying depths and environments in the ocean could rapidly utilize elevated concentrations of plankton-derived DOC, whereas these same microbes failed to utilize elevated concentrations of C-18 DOC. These results indicate molecular properties are the primary control on the microbial utilization of DOC in the ocean. Our findings imply a dynamic DOC reservoir with a flexible capacity for carbon sequestration in the global ocean. © 2019 The Authors.

Results indicated that the phosphogypsum promoted the carbonization ratio of steel slag. When the content of phosphogypsum was 2.5%, strength and carbonization ratio of carbonated steel slag from pressing formation reached 82.6 MPa and 52.1% respectively. The main product of the carbonated steel slag was calcite and C–S–H. The strength and porosity of carbonated steel slag pervious concrete reached 9.4 MPa and higher than 20% respectively. And it also had a good plantability when it is used in sponge city construction. Compared with ordinary pervious concrete, carbonated steel slag pervious concrete saved 75.8% cost of materials, was 100% made of solid waste and absorbed around 100 kg/m3 of CO2, which turns out to be a green and high-efficiency approach to utilize the solid waste steel slag, saving the natural resource and reducing the carbon footprint of the construction of sponge city. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2; Performances; Pervious concrete; Phosphogypsum; Steel slag","Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Carbonation; Carbonization; Concrete aggregates; Gypsum; Slags; Solid wastes; City construction; High-efficiency; New approaches; Performances; Pervious concrete; Phosphogypsum; Steel slag; Steel slag powder; Concretes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078933372

In this paper, we explore the impact and cost-effectiveness of the Chinese PEV subsidy program. In particular, a vehicle choice model is estimated using a large random sample of individual level, model year 2017 Chinese new vehicle purchases. The choice model is then used to predict PEV market share under alternative policies. Simulation results suggest that the 2.5% PEV market share of Chinese new vehicle sales in 2017 resulted in China's new vehicle fleet fuel economy improving by roughly 2%, reducing total gasoline consumption by 6.66 billion liters. However, the current PEV subsidy in China is expensive, costing $1.90 per additional liter of gasoline saved. This is due to a large number of non-additional PEV buyers, particularly high income consumers, who would have purchased the PEV regardless of the subsidy. Eliminating the subsidy for high income consumers and increasing it for low income consumers could result in a substantially lower cost per additional PEV ($13,758 versus $24,506). This would allow for greater PEV adoption (3.11% versus 2.47% market share) for the same budget. In terms of the impact of the recently announced subsidy reduction, results suggest that the PEV market share in China would have declined by 21% had the subsidy been halved without any countervailing measures. Using the same reduced budget, had zero PEV subsidies been given to high-income consumers and higher subsidies been given to low-income consumers, the PEV market share would have declined by only 8%. © 2020 The Authors","Fleet fuel economy; Plug-in electric vehicle; Subsidy","Budget control; Commerce; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Fleet operations; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Light electric vehicles; Sales; Individual levels; Light duty vehicles; Local air pollutions; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Random sample; Reduced budget; Vehicle choice; Vehicle fleets; Plug-in electric vehicles; electric vehicle; environmental economics; fuel consumption; numerical model; policy approach; subsidy system; technology adoption; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084836359

However, curricula on climate-health are still lacking and gaps in knowledge persist. Objective: To understand the state of climate-health curricula among health professions institutions internationally. Design, Setting, and Participants: A survey of 160 institutional members of the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education, which includes international health professions schools and programs, was conducted from August 3, 2017, to March 1, 2018. The survey, hosted by Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, used an online survey tool for data collection. Main Outcomes and Measures: The survey assessed climate-health curricular offerings across health professions institutions internationally, including existing climate-health educational offerings, method of teaching climate-health education, whether institutions are considering adding climate-health education, whether institutions received a positive response to adding climate-health curricula and/or encountered challenges in adding curricula, and opportunities to advance climate-health education. Results: Overall response rate to the survey was 53%, with 84 of 160 institutional responses collected; 59 of the responses (70%) were from schools/programs of public health, health sciences, or health professions; 15 (18%) were from medicine; 9 (11%) were from nursing; and 1 (1%) was from another type of health profession institution. Among respondents, 53 (63%) institutions offer climate-health education, most commonly as part of a required core course (41 [76%]). Sixty-one of 82 respondents (74%) reported that climate-health offerings are under discussion to add, 42 of 59 respondents (71%) encountered some challenges trying to institute the curriculum, and most respondents have received a positive response to adding content, mainly from students (39 of 58 [67%]), faculty (35 of 58 [60%]), and administration (23 of 58 [40%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Current climate-health educational offerings appear to vary considerably among health professions institutions. Students, faculty, and administration are important groups to engage when instituting curricula, and awareness, support, and resources may be able to assist in this effort.. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional case study on 50 residences in an inner-city neighbourhood scheduled for urban development, bisected by a busy road. We measured indoor and outdoor NO2, indoor temperature, and undertook a survey on demographic factors and household NO2 sources. We performed a linear regression to examine the association between indoor and outdoor NO2 (measured at the building facade) adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Mean indoor and outdoor levels of NO2 were 8.4 and 12.5 μg/m3 respectively. The unadjusted model showed no significant association between indoor and outdoor NO2. In the fully-adjusted model, a 1 % increase in outdoor NO2 was associated with a 5 % increase in indoor NO2 (95 %CI: 1.2–8.8%). Conclusion: A weak association between indoor and outdoor NO2 was found. More intensive housing development in a transport corridor may be possible; however given the health risks of induced by air pollutants starts even at levels below WHO recommended levels, urban policy measures to reduce indoor and ambient air pollution are required. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Housing intensification; Indoor NO2; NO2 level; Outdoor NO2; Transport; Urban development","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Health risks; Housing; Indoor air pollution; Risk assessment; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Indoor NO2; NO2 level; Outdoor NO2; Transport; Urban development; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079331239

The results showed that deployment of ICS would help in reduction in personal BC concentration in all the households ranged from 36 to 84% and 33–89% in BC10 and BC2.5, respectively. The study measured the personal dose of BC concentration for women of all the selected households. The reduction in the exposure dose for personal BC10 and BC2.5 was 69% and 59%, respectively. The results showed that BC concentration during cooking greatly varies with time-activity pattern of users and which in turn affects the exposure levels of the participants. Thus, it is imperative to measure the exact time users spend near to the emission source to get actual exposure inhalation concentration. The results of the study also shared with the local communities to build their capacity for better understanding about the benefits of advanced cooking technologies, household design to improve the ventilation conditions in the kitchen areas and health benefits in terms of reduction in exposure levels especially for vulnerable group like women and children. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Black carbon; Improved cookstoves; Kitchen characteristics; Personal exposure assessment; Time activity","Carbon; Black carbon; Cooking technology; Emission sources; Improved cookstoves; Intervention analysis; Personal exposure assessments; Time activity patterns; Vulnerable groups; Kitchens; black carbon; black carbon; concentration (composition); cooking appliance; health risk; household survey; rural area; ventilation; air conditioning; Article; cooking; household; human; kitchen; rural population; adult; child; exposure; family size; female; India; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; procedures; rural population; soot; India; Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Cooking; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; India; Inhalation Exposure; Particulate Matter; Rural Population; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077759610

The model is based on regional climate change scenarios, potential urban surface cover alternatives and resulted urban microclimate variations in Adelaide. Projected energy demand variations and corresponding carbon emission are calculated in each scenario. Results indicate that an ideal urban landscape transformation scenario with 30% tree canopy can effectively decrease the surface temperature by 1 °C in winter and 3 °C in summer by 2090. It is estimated that having greener and more heat resilient public spaces could save a total carbon emission of 140,000 tone CO2e in Adelaide annually compared to a business-as-usual scenario.

This study provides a systematic review of the published literature in Scopus and Web of Science regarding PV-green roof technologies, to identify the benefits and challenges associated with PV-green roofs in practice, and its future directions. A total of 145 published documents were reviewed, revealing that the PV-green roof is an effective strategy for producing clean energy on the building scale. However, there are still various challenges that hinder the large-scale implementation of PV-green roofs, including high initial costs, limited experimental data, and lack of awareness about the long-term benefits. These challenges can be overcome through the new cost-effective design of PV-green roofs and the adoption of the most appropriate materials, which can perform more effectively over a longer period. In addition, more real large-scale experimental studies are needed to evaluate the long-term performance of PV-green roofs in urban areas. Suggestions for further improvements include: providing the optimal design of PV-green roofs for each climatic region; improving laws and regulations; evaluating life-cycle assessment including social, environmental, and economic benefits over a longer period; and establishing interagency collaboration and cooperation tools for the wider adoption of PV-green roof projects. This review draws an overall picture of the benefits and limitations of the PV-green roof around the world.

International organizations such as the United Nations and the European Commission are highlighting the potential role of nature in mitigating air pollution and are now funding the implementation of Nature-Based Solutions, especially at the city level. Over the past few decades, the attention of the scientific community has grown around the role of urban forest in air pollution mitigation. Nevertheless, the understanding on Particulate Matter (PM) retention mechanisms by tree leaves is still limited. In this study, twelve tree species were sampled within an urban park of an industrial city. Two techniques were used for leaf analysis: Vacuum/Filtration and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, in order to obtain a quali-quantitative analysis of the different PM size fractions. Results showed that deposited PM loads vary significantly among species. Different leaf traits, including micro and macromorphological characteristics, were observed, measured and ranked, with the final aim to relate them with PM load. Even if no significant correlation between each single leaf characteristic and PM deposition was observed (p > 0.05), multivariate analysis revealed relationships between clusters of leaf traits and deposited PM. Thus, by assigning a score to each trait, an Accumulation index (Ai) was calculated, which was significantly related to the leaf deposited PM load (p ≤ 0.05). © 2018","Air quality; Leaf morphology; Nature-based solutions; Particulate matter; Scanning electron microscopy","Air quality; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Forestry; Health risks; Multivariant analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Air particulate matters; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Industrial environments; International organizations; Leaf morphology; Multi variate analysis; Particulate Matter; Scientific community; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental management; leaf morphology; particulate matter; scanning electron microscopy; tree; urban area; accumulation ratio; air quality; article; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; filtration; human; leaf morphology; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; recreational park; scanning electron microscopy; vacuum; air pollutant; chemistry; city; environmental monitoring; Italy; particulate matter; plant leaf; tree; Italy; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079693274

There is insufficient understanding of the precise time windows during which inter-annual variation in weather drives phenological shifts and the consequences for mismatches between interacting species and resultant population dynamics—particularly for insects. We use a 20 year study on a tri-trophic system: sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, two associated aphid species Drepanosiphum platanoidis and Periphyllus testudinaceus and their hymenopteran parasitoids. Using a sliding window approach, we assess climatic drivers of phenology in all three trophic levels. We quantify the magnitude of resultant trophic mismatches between aphids and their plant hosts and parasitoids, and then model the impacts of these mismatches, direct weather effects and density dependence on local-scale aphid population dynamics. Warmer temperatures in mid-March to late-April were associated with advanced sycamore budburst, parasitoid attack and (marginally) D. platanoidis emergence. The precise time window during which spring weather advances phenology varies considerably across each species. Crucially, warmer temperatures in late winter delayed the emergence of both aphid species. Seasonal variation in warming rates thus generates marked shifts in the relative timing of spring events across trophic levels and mismatches in the phenology of interacting species. Despite this, we found no evidence that aphid population growth rates were adversely impacted by the magnitude of mismatch with their host plants or parasitoids, or direct impacts of temperature and precipitation. Strong density dependence effects occurred in both aphid species and probably buffered populations, through density-dependent compensation, from adverse impacts of the marked inter-annual climatic variation that occurred during the study period. These findings explain the resilience of aphid populations to climate change and uncover a key mechanism, warmer winter temperatures delaying insect phenology, by which climate change drives asynchronous shifts between interacting species. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","emergence; hymenopteran parasitoids; pests; phytophagous insects; population size; woodland","aphid; climate change; climate effect; global change; parasitoid; phenology; population dynamics; population growth; Acer pseudoplatanus; Aphididae; Drepanosiphum platanoidis; Hexapoda; Periphyllus testudinaceus; animal; aphid; climate change; population dynamics; season; temperature; Animals; Aphids; Climate Change; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081736694

The current work reports an experimental analysis of the structural evolution of GO to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) during thermal treatment. GO has been thermally annealed at an optimized temperature of 350 °C in ambient. Thermal reduction is observed after 7 min of annealing and confirmed by shifting of the first major peak from 12° to 23° in X-ray diffraction pattern. Significant carbon content enrichment and exfoliation are two aspects of the thermal reduction of GO. Carbon content suddenly enriches from 38 wt% in GO to 77 wt%.

Small-scale farmers are particularly at risk. The responses of farmers to climate change and variability are often dependent on their perceptions of climate change. Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of adaptation strategies that are feasible and practised at farm level. Despite this need, in some developing countries such as Botswana, there is a dearth of studies that use mixed research methods to critically analyse farmers’ perceptions of climate change and their adaptation strategies. This study uses empirical data collected from farming households in the Ngamiland East region of Botswana to (i) analyse the perceptions of small-scale farmers regarding climate change, (ii) analyse small-scale farmers’ adaptation strategies to climate change, and (iii) determine constraints faced by farmers in adapting to climate change and variability. The results show that there is a direct relationship between the farmers’ adaptation strategies and education. Unlike findings from other studies, the results of the study show that there is no significant relationship between gender and farmers’ adaptation strategies. The results verify that there is high heterogeneity characterising the case studies, making adaptation studies case-specific. Farmers in the Ngamiland region are faced with several challenges in their attempt to adapt to climate change. Chief among the constraints is the lack of financial resources and lack of appropriate skills. The government should empower the farmers through provision of subsidies and skills training. © 2020 Royal Society of South Africa.","adaptation strategies; climate change and variability; perceptions; small-scale farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084996235

The research area, located around the city of Trinec, is significantly affected by a complex spectrum of air pollution sources, including local residential heating (coal and wood burning), heavy industry (mainly iron and steel production), road traffic, and regional and long-range air pollution transport from the nearby cities, Poland, and other countries. The main pollution sources contributing to the total concentration of fine suspended particles (PM2.5) were evaluated on the basis of the measurements at three sites and on subsequent positive matrix factorization modeling. The six major air pollution factors were identified, and their relative and absolute contributions were quantified. The result of the study is that the most important current task of air protection is to reduce the residential emissions from solid fuels, which are responsible for approximately 50-60% of PM2.5 concentration, followed by the regional primary and secondary aerosol sources (up to 40% of the total PM2.5 aerosol mass). Lower contributions have been identified in the case of resuspended mineral and biogenic particles (15-20%), long-range (trans-European) air pollution transport (up to 10%), and heavy industry (up to 10% in the most affected location). A detailed discussion has been provided considering specific regional EC (elemental carbon)-OC (organic carbon) relations in the region with traditional coal-burning for household heating which complicate the interpretation of the PMF (Positive Matrix Factorization) results, especially due to the interference between the traffic, residential heating, and biogenic aerosol factors. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; PM2.5; PMF (Positive matrix factorization); Source apportionment","Aerosols; Air pollution; Coal industry; Factorization; Fuels; Heating; Housing; Iron and steel industry; Iron research; Matrix algebra; Organic carbon; Steelmaking; Air pollution sources; Air pollution transport; Iron and steel productions; Positive Matrix Factorization; Positive matrix factorization models; Residential emissions; Source apportionment; Suspended particles; Atmospheric movements; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; concentration (composition); long range transport; particulate matter; pollutant source; source apportionment; traffic emission; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085730328

This paper discusses an ex-post-impact assessment methodology based on cumulative ecosystem services losses in a specific study area: the Melfi municipality in the Basilicata region (Italy). The proposed methodology, starting from a temporal evolution of RES plants, considers the ecosystem services estimation based on InVEST tools in order to deliver spatial multicriteria maps of the resulting territorial impacts. These results allowed to clarified the limits of a local sectorial planning approach and highlighted the opportunities offered by performance-based planning in assessing alternative transformation scenarios. The conclusions regard policy implications towards a multidimensional performance-based planning system where alternative low carbon transition scenarios could be compared in order to take into account territorial specializations and identity assets as a tool to drive decision-making in a sustainable planning perspective. © 2020","Cumulative effect; Ecosystem services; InVEST; Performance based planning; RES","Carbon; Decision making; Natural resources; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Rhenium; Cumulative effects; Ecosystem services; InVEST; Low-carbon transitions; Performance based; Post impact assessments; Renewable energy source; Sustainable planning; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079209115

The database collects measurements and estimates of these fractions, which contain pollutants such as sulphates, nitrates, and black carbon, from established public air quality monitoring systems. These pollutants can penetrate deep into the lungs and the cardiovascular system, posing the greatest risk to human health. Unsurprisingly, the WHO database reports relatively low levels of urban PM pollution in high-income (HI) countries in Western Europe, the Americas, the Western Pacific, and Oceania but high levels in low-and middle-income (LMI) countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America—where lack of funding and inadequate staffing are key barriers to effectively reducing the air pollution—and even in high-income countries in the third region. Unfortunately, politicians, organizations, and the media have used the database to draw inaccurate and misleading conclusions based on comparisons between cities, such as occurred with the 2016 version. In this paper, we investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the 2018 database with respect to several criteria (e.g., the selection of pollutants, completeness, spatial and temporal representativeness, and quality assurance and quality control) and offer recommendations for improvement. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Air pollutants; Comparability; Completeness; Data coverage; Representativeness","Aerodynamics; Air quality; Cardiovascular system; Health risks; Monitoring; Quality assurance; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Aerodynamic diameters; Air quality monitoring; Ambient air quality; Particulate Matter; Risk to human health; Western Europe; Western Pacific; World Health Organization; Database systems; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; health risk; particulate matter; public health; World Health Organization; Africa; Latin America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West); Southeast Asia; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084046431

Several groups have succeeded in conducting kilometer-scale multiweek GCM simulations and decadelong continental-scale RCM simulations. There is the well-founded hope that this increase in resolution represents a quantum jump in climate modeling, as it enables replacing the parameterization of moist convection by an explicit treatment. It is expected that this will improve the simulation of the water cycle and extreme events and reduce uncertainties in climate change projections. While kilometer-scale resolution is commonly employed in limited-area numerical weather prediction, enabling it on global scales for extended climate simulations requires a concerted effort. In this paper, we exploit an RCM that runs entirely on graphics processing units (GPUs) and show examples that highlight the prospects of this approach. A particular challenge addressed in this paper relates to the growth in output volumes. It is argued that the data avalanche of high-resolution simulations will make it impractical or impossible to store the data. Rather, repeating the simulation and conducting online analysis will become more efficient. A prototype of this methodology is presented. It makes use of a bit-reproducible model version that ensures reproducible simulations across hardware architectures, in conjunction with a data virtualization layer as a common interface for output analyses. An assessment of the potential of these novel approaches will be provided. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Computer graphics; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Weather forecasting; Climate change projections; Data virtualization; Explicit treatments; Hardware architecture; High resolution simulations; Horizontal resolution; Numerical weather prediction; Regional climate models; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086822309

The mechanism of contributions established at national level under the Paris Agreement of 2015 lays the foundations to help international donors better understand each country's climate needs. With this in mind, this paper aims to provide some policy suggestions emerging from the analysis of the impact some variables have on reducing vulnerability. To this end, we consider the vulnerability index of 33 SIDS countries in terms of adaptation and mitigation policies. Based on the data availability, we use the panel-corrected standard errors estimator in time span from 2010 to 2014, taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of vulnerability. Our findings display that foreign aid and social development variables are crucial to promoting adequate and balanced responses to climate change. Therefore, we can confirm the effectiveness of external funds in reducing vulnerability. Domestic resources alone do not appear able to help SIDS due to endogenous limits of countries beneficiaries. The approach proposed in this paper can be extended to other small countries which are not islands, as well as to islands that are not nations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate finance; Climate policy; Panel corrected standard errors; Small island developing states; Vulnerability","Voltage measurement; Climate policy; Empirical investigation; International donors; Panel corrected standard errors estimators; Small island developing state; Spatial heterogeneity; Standard errors; Vulnerability; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079098365

We also include dynamic pre-positioning of idle vehicles in anticipation of new customer arrivals, and relocation of vehicles to rebalance the use of vehicles in the system, which can have a sizable effect on energy and environmental conservation.

The impact of mangrove deforestation on carbon emissions has been reported on a global scale; however, uncertainty remains at subnational scales due to geographical variability and field data limitations. We present an assessment of blue carbon storage at five mangrove sites across West Papua Province, Indonesia, a region that supports 10% of the world's mangrove area. The sites are representative of contrasting hydrogeomorphic settings and also capture change over a 25-years LULCC chronosequence. Field-based assessments were conducted across 255 plots covering undisturbed and LULCC-affected mangroves (0-, 5-, 10-, 15- and 25-year-old post-harvest or regenerating forests as well as 15-year-old aquaculture ponds). Undisturbed mangroves stored total ecosystem carbon stocks of 182–2,730 (mean ± SD: 1,087 ± 584) Mg C/ha, with the large variation driven by hydrogeomorphic settings. The highest carbon stocks were found in estuarine interior (EI) mangroves, followed by open coast interior, open coast fringe and EI forests. Forest harvesting did not significantly affect soil carbon stocks, despite an elevated dead wood density relative to undisturbed forests, but it did remove nearly all live biomass. Aquaculture conversion removed 60% of soil carbon stock and 85% of live biomass carbon stock, relative to reference sites. By contrast, mangroves left to regenerate for more than 25 years reached the same level of biomass carbon compared to undisturbed forests, with annual biomass accumulation rates of 3.6 ± 1.1 Mg C ha−1 year−1. This study shows that hydrogeomorphic setting controls natural dynamics of mangrove blue carbon stocks, while long-term land-use changes affect carbon loss and gain to a substantial degree. Therefore, current land-based climate policies must incorporate landscape and land-use characteristics, and their related carbon management consequences, for more effective emissions reduction targets and restoration outcomes. © 2020 The Authors.

An appropriate policy and strategy cannot be effective without a proper understanding of peoples’ climate change perception. This study intends to explore the local adaptation strategies of the riverine island (char) dwellers in the face of climate change hazards through a survey of 374 char dwellers living in the flood and riverbank erosion prone geographically isolated areas in Bangladesh. The study reveals almost no difference between the perception of char dwellers and the observed data on climate change. It further reports that the climate impacts make the char households a vulnerable community and minimize their livelihood resilience. A number of local adaptation strategies are adapted by char dwellers in the face of climate change effects which enhance their livelihood resilience. The study further reveals that homestead gardening, changing cropping pattern, tree plantation and migration are the most common strategies adapted by char dwellers. The study suggests that continuous development program and riverine island-based disaster management projects should be executed through an effective monitoring for enhancing char dweller's livelihood resilience. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Disaster management; Resilience; Sandbar; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; livelihood; vulnerability; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081025317

The magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that both Co(II) ions are in low-spin (S = 1/2) states and two Co(II) spin centers are antiferromagnetically coupled with the exchange coupling constant of J = −45 cm−1. Co2L2 showed catecholase-like activity when 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (3,5-H2dtbc) was treated with Co2L2 in the presence of O2 and NaOH with the turnover number of kcat = 803 h−1. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) on the reaction mixture observed a key reaction intermediates, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzosemiquinonate anion radical (3,5-dtsq[rad]−) bound to Co(III)-center.

However, there are still limited studies in evaluating the emissions from the clean water production and supply sector. This study aimed to calculate CO2 emissions from the sector which includes raw water abstraction, clean water treatment plant, and clean water distribution by using mathematical models. The calculation was carried out to two water treatment plants in Depok City, Legong and Citayam. CO2 emissions from both WTP are estimated at 0.49 kg CO2/m3 for WTP Legong and 0.35 kg CO2/m3 for WTP Citayam. Based on the calculation, electricity consumption is the most contributing component to CO2 emissions because the operation of both WTP requires an extensive amount of electricity. This study also revealed that changing the source of electrical power gave the largest reduction in CO2 emissions. © 2020 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096443147

Chile is highly vulnerable to climate change, and fires are a recurrent phenomenon affecting many people each year. To reduce fire risk, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests reducing both exposure and vulnerability through multiple initiatives, which demand increased community engagement. In such a context, this study explores local perceptions of fire in a sample of inhabitants in a wildland-urban interface (WUI) in Valparaiso, a city that is affected by numerous fires each year. The ultimate goal was to identify psychological and community factors that should be taken into consideration to develop prevention plans and safer environments for people living in a context of poverty and social inequity. Using a qualitative approach, 28 interviews were conducted and analyzed following grounded theory principles. Results identified multiple causes, impacts, and characteristics of the problem perceived by people who permanently cohabit with fire risk, showing that for many of them, fire risk is not about the probability of occurrence of a disaster, but a question about when and how the next fire will happen. However, in such a complex scenario, psychological, community, and structural barriers deter people from implementing more effective actions. Conversely, in emergency situations, such barriers are irrelevant and cooperative actions prevail, suggesting the existence of resources and capacities within the community that could lessen exposure and vulnerability if activated on a day-to-day basis. Overall, reducing fire risk cannot be achieved by local communities alone nor without their support. To build, maintain, and consolidate fire prevention actions, it is critical to activate community strengths and cooperation and engage the resources and management capacity of local governments. © 2020 by the authors.","Chile; Climate change; Disasters risk reduction; Fire risk perceptions; Fires prevention","fire management; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; local government; local planning; natural disaster; policy implementation; probability; qualitative analysis; risk assessment; vulnerability; Valparaiso",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085701134

Climate plays a vital role in the terroir of a given wine region, as it strongly controls canopy microclimate, vine growth, vine physiology, yield, and berry composition, which together determine wine attributes and typicity. New challenges are, however, predicted to arise from climate change, as grapevine cultivation is deeply dependent on weather and climate conditions. Changes in viticultural suitability over the last decades, for viticulture in general or the use of specific varieties, have already been reported for many wine regions. Despite spatially heterogeneous impacts, climate change is anticipated to exacerbate these recent trends on suitability for wine production. These shifts may reshape the geographical distribution of wine regions, while wine typicity may also be threatened in most cases. Changing climates will thereby urge for the implementation of timely, suitable, and cost-effective adaptation strategies, which should also be thoroughly planned and tuned to local conditions for an effective risk reduction. Although the potential of the different adaptation options is not yet fully investigated, deserving further research activities, their adoption will be of utmost relevance to maintain the socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of the highly valued viticulture and winemaking sector in Europe. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Risk reduction; Viticulture; Wine production",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085114680

The concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr, Mn, Hg, Ni, and Zn, together with several other elements, were measured. The average metal concentrations followed the order: Zn > Cr > Cu > Mn > Pb > V > Ni > As ~ Sb > Cd > Tl > Pd > Hg > Pt. From the analysis of the temporal variation in the elemental concentration of PM2.5, results show seasonal variations that reach, in general, a maximum in the coldest seasons and a minimum in the warmer seasons. These differences could be explained by the different weather conditions during each season, the influence of the El Niño/La Niña regimen, and the presence of fires on certain sampling dates. The source apportionment analysis performed for the period 2017–2018 showed the contribution to PM2.5 of combustion of heavy fuel oil and diesel-powered vehicles, pet coke, metallurgical and nonferrous industries, paint plant factory, traffic, and natural sources like the soil and road dust. This last analysis completed the assignment of sources for the 10-year period of study. Thus, the results of this work contribute to the implementation of emission reduction strategies in order to decrease the impact of PM2.5 on the environment and the human health. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","El Niño-La Niña regimen; Elemental composition; PM2.5; PMF; Toxic metals","Emission control; Metallurgical coke; Road vehicles; Diesel-powered vehicles; Elemental concentrations; Emission reduction strategy; Metal concentrations; Meteorological condition; Seasonal variation; Source apportionment; Temporal variation; Metal analysis; antimony; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; diesel fuel; fuel oil; lead; manganese; mercury; nickel; paint; platinum; thallium; vanadium; zinc; heavy metal; combustion; concentration (composition); emission control; heavy metal; meteorology; monitoring; particulate matter; sampling; seasonal variation; strategic approach; Argentina; Article; cold exposure; diesel engine; dust; El Nino; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; fire; metallurgy; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; season; seasonal variation; soil chemistry; toxic concentration; urban area; warmer season; air pollutant; city; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; Argentina; Argentina; Cordoba [Andalucia]; Cordoba [Argentina]; Cordoba [Cordoba (PRV)]; Air Pollutants; Argentina; Cities; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083815051

We use day-to-day, within-county variation in the number of vehicles certified after failing an initial emissions inspection as a proxy for emissions-related repairs. Additional passed reinspections of older vehicles with inferior emissions technology (pre-1985 model year) reduce local carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter levels, but passed reinspections of newer vehicles with more modern engine technology have no economically significant effect on air pollution.

This paper investigates potential challenges in implementation of the programs by exploring local community's understanding on the role of mangroves in climate change and their acceptance to the mangrove programs. The results are discussed in the context of theories related to community-based natural resources management and property rights. Survey using questionnaires is followed by in-depth interview and it shows that most respondents understand the importance of mangroves in climate change mitigation but are not well informed about the programs. They are also objected to the land reform and social forestry programs because the programs do not provide comparable compensation. This finding is congruent with the theories of property rights and co-management of natural resources. To increase community's acceptance, legalization of occupied mangrove land, therefore, needs to be followed by other interventions such as awareness raising programs, financial support and market control as extra benefits for the local communities. The central and local governments also need to intensively communicate with the local communities to arrange technical, administrative and political mechanisms in collaborative mangrove management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deforestation; Natural resources management; Surveys; Timber; Awareness raising; Climate change mitigation; Community based natural resources management; Financial support; Forest degradation; In-depth interviews; Reducing emissions; Social forestries; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086573944

This paper focuses on the determination of the main negative impacts caused by Zahrat Al-Finjan landfill operation in the northern part of the West Bank. The data were collected from seven nearby communities. Overall results showed that odor emissions, impacts on plants and animals, impacts on inhabitants’ hygiene, impacts on traffic and aesthetic views and pollution due to leachate spills, presence of insects and rodents, reduction in the value of the nearby land are the most significant negative impacts. In particular home-landfill distance plays an important role to the negative impact perception in cases such as particularly odors, and quality of life. On the other hand, dust, noise, and impact on groundwater are not considered issues of major issues of concerns from the residents’ point of view. This fact is highly influenced by the application of compensatory benefits to locals.

Thus, extensive studies have been conducted in carbonate and sandstone reservoirs to investigate how the physical properties of rocks and the chemical composition of fluids influence low salinity effect, while, the carbonate reservoir rocks requires more investigation of the effect of molecular and/or ionic interactions. In this experimental work, the effectiveness of various water flooding schemes in carbonate reservoir rock samples is investigated. In this regard, the oil recovery potential of seawater (SW), reservoir formation water (RFW) and managed water salinity (MWS), with different ion compositions adjusted based on the formation water composition are used. The experiments have been performed on the dolomite core samples and crude oil from an Iranian oil reservoir. Various measurements including zeta potential, XRD, contact angle and interfacial tension have been planned. The main contribution is to investigate the effect of both brine’s ionic composition and rock’s initial water saturation on wettability change and oil recovery. The results show that, the concentration of (Formula presented.) ion in the injected water must be managed over an optimum range for each case. This results in changing the wettability of carbonate rock to a less oil-wetting state by altering the brine composition and reducing the salinity. Moreover, initial water saturation plays a role in the process, so that, by increasing (Formula presented.) content in optimum range, the oil recovery increased. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","EOR; initial water saturation; ion exchanges; Low salinity water injection; managed water salinity; wettability alteration","Carbonation; Contact angle; Crude oil; Floods; Ion exchange; Ions; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Produced Water; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Rocks; Seawater; Wetting; Chemical compositions; Dolomite reservoirs; Initial water saturation; Iranian oil reservoirs; Low-salinity water; Sandstone reservoirs; Water salinity; Wettability alteration; Oil well flooding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066080939

For large networks, macroscopic emission models are preferred because of their simplicity. However, these models do not consider traffic flow dynamics that significantly affect emissions production. This study proposes a network-level emission modeling framework based on the network-wide fundamental diagram (NFD), via integrating the NFD properties with an existing microscopic emission model. The NFD and microscopic emission models are estimated using microscopic and mesoscopic traffic simulation tools at different scales for various traffic compositions. The major contribution is to consider heterogeneous vehicle types with different emission generation rates in a network-level model. This framework is applied to the large-scale network of Chicago as well as its central business district. Non-linear and support vector regression models are developed using simulated trajectory data of 13 simulated scenarios. The results show a satisfactory calibration and successful validation with acceptable deviations from the underlying microscopic emissions model regardless of the simulation tool that is used to calibrate the network-level emissions model. The microscopic traffic simulation is appropriate for smaller networks, while mesoscopic traffic simulation is a proper means to calibrate models for larger networks. The proposed model is also used to demonstrate the relationship between macroscopic emissions and flow characteristics in the form of a network emissions diagram. The results of this study provide a tool for planners to analyze vehicular emissions in real time and find optimal policies to control the level of emissions in large cities. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Superconducting materials; Traffic control; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Central business districts; Heterogeneous vehicles; Mesoscopic traffic simulation; Microscopic traffic simulation; Non-linear regression; Simulated trajectories; Support vector regression models; Transportation planning; Support vector regression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087757017

However, most studies have focused on the behaviour of construction and demolition (C&D) aggregates mixed with a single waste material. To the best of authors' knowledge, there is no previously published work on using C&D aggregates containing both crushed waste glass and crumb rubber for road base/subbase applications. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted to assess the dynamic behaviour of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and waste crushed rock (CR) blended with crumb rubber (R) and crushed glass (CG). Testing included permanent deformation, resilient modulus, Clegg impact hammer, dynamic lightweight cone penetration, aggregate crushing value, and Los Angeles Abrasion. The cyclic triaxial test is the most reliable test for the evaluation of the behaviour of unbound granular pavement materials under dynamic wheel loads. However, the test procedures are very time-consuming, complicated, and expensive. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have a simple and straightforward method to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of unbound waste aggregates. For the first time, a simple and quick method was proposed in this study for estimating the permanent deformation and resilient modulus properties of three combined waste aggregates by using two simple dynamic tests (i.e., Clegg impact hammer test and dynamic lightweight cone penetration test). The analytical results indicate that a strong correlation exists between the results of the cyclic triaxial test and simple-procedure dynamic properties. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Analytical studies; Construction and demolition aggregates; Crumb rubber; Crushed glass; Dynamic properties","Aggregates; Building materials; Deformation; Demolition; Gas emissions; Glass; Greenhouse gases; Hammers; Pavements; Recycling; Rubber; Rubber applications; Analytical studies; Construction and demolition; Crumb rubber; Crushed glass; Dynamic property; Concrete aggregates; crumb rubber; crushed glass; glass; rubber; unclassified drug; aggregate; analytical method; composite; construction material; cyclic loading; demolition; dynamic property; pavement; triaxial test; aggregate crushing value test; analytic method; Article; clegg Impact hammer test; construction and demolition waste; controlled study; dynamic lightweight penetrometer test; Los Angeles abrasion test; permanent deformation test; recycled concrete aggregate; recycling; reliability; repeated load triaxial test; resilient modulus; simulation; Young modulus; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078408197

The rising awareness of environmental impacts has led the public to demand the development of eco-friendly and dependable long-term solutions. Wind energy is acknowledged as among the best renewable energy sources with proven capabilities. The key contributing factor in defining the harnessing effectiveness is the wind availability and efficiency of the wind turbines at the specific wind conditions. But due to the non-uniform wind distribution and the limitations of the existing wind turbines at low wind speeds, countries with lower wind speed are still far away from exploiting wind energy. According to the World Energy Commission, the use of one million kWh of wind power can save 600 tons of CO2 emission. An examination into current energy data for Malaysia indicates that only 0.23% of the wind and solar power combined is employed for electricity production as of 2017. This is due to very low wind speed in this region throughout the year. It is also a leading factor to air-pollutants being suspended in the atmosphere for a longer period. It will impact an imbalance in the environmental conditions, such as acid rain, global warming, rise in sea-level and fluctuating sea levels. This paper reports an investigation into the potential impact of utilizing the advantages of wind energy technology in low speed wind regions as an air-pollutant free energy source, to contribute to the overall reduction of the Air Pollutant Index (API) in localized, impacted areas of Malaysia.

Malaria transmission is largely constrained by the suitability of the climate for Anopheles mosquitoes and Plasmodium parasite development. Thus, as climate changes, shifts in geographic locations suitable for transmission, and differing lengths of seasons of suitability will occur, which will require changes in the types and amounts of resources. Methods: The shifting geographic risk of malaria transmission was mapped, in context of changing seasonality (i.e. endemic to epidemic, and vice versa), and the number of people affected. A published temperature-dependent model of malaria transmission suitability was applied to continental gridded climate data for multiple future AR5 climate model projections. The resulting outcomes were aligned with programmatic needs to provide summaries at national and regional scales for the African continent. Model outcomes were combined with population projections to estimate the population at risk at three points in the future, 2030, 2050, and 2080, under two scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Results: Estimated geographic shifts in endemic and seasonal suitability for malaria transmission were observed across all future scenarios of climate change. The worst-case regional scenario (RCP8.5) of climate change predicted an additional 75.9 million people at risk from endemic (10-12 months) exposure to malaria transmission in Eastern and Southern Africa by the year 2080, with the greatest population at risk in Eastern Africa. Despite a predominance of reduction in season length, a net gain of 51.3 million additional people is predicted be put at some level of risk in Western Africa by midcentury. Conclusions: This study provides an updated view of potential malaria geographic shifts in Africa under climate change for the more recent climate model projections (AR5), and a tool for aligning findings with programmatic needs at key scales for decision-makers. In describing shifting seasonality, it was possible to capture transitions between endemic and epidemic risk areas, to facilitate the planning for interventions aimed at year-round risk versus anticipatory surveillance and rapid response to potential outbreak locations. © 2020 The Author(s).","Africa; Anopheles; Climate change; Malaria; Temperature","Africa; Article; carbon footprint; Central Africa; climate change; controlled study; endemic disease; epidemic; geography; infection risk; malaria; mathematical model; parasite transmission; population risk; prediction; seasonal variation; South Africa; temperature dependence; animal; Anopheles; forecasting; malaria falciparum; mosquito vector; physiology; Plasmodium falciparum; risk; theoretical model; Africa, Central; Africa, Eastern; Africa, Southern; Africa, Western; Animals; Anopheles; Climate Change; Forecasting; Malaria, Falciparum; Models, Theoretical; Mosquito Vectors; Plasmodium falciparum; Risk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084519625

Responses to climate-driven shifts in a fishery may be constrained by existing management or institutional arrangements and technological settings. In order to understand how fisheries are responding to ocean warming, we investigate purse seine fleets targeting tropical tunas in the east Atlantic Ocean using effort and sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) data from 1991 to 2017. An analysis of the spatial change in effort using a centre of gravity approach and empirical orthogonal functions is used to assess the spatiotemporal changes in effort anomalies and investigate links to SSTA. Both analyses indicate that effort shifts southward from the equator, while no clear pattern is seen northward from the equator. Random forest models show that while technology and institutional settings better explain total effort, SSTA is playing a role when explaining the spatiotemporal changes of effort, together with management and international agreements. These results show the potential of management to minimize the impacts of climate change on fisheries activity. Our results provide guidance for improved understanding about how climate, management and governance interact in tropical tuna fisheries, with methods that are replicable and transferable. Future actions should take into account all these elements in order to plan successful adaptation. © 2020 The Authors.

There is acknowledgement in the global literature of the need to highlight child and adolescent mental health more prominently in climate change health strategies and policies. It is vital that adaptation strategies are informed by research on risk prevention and promotion of resilience to ensure the mental health of children and adolescents is protected. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation; Adolescents; Children; Climate change; Extreme weather events; Global warming; Mental health; Pediatrics; Resilience; Sub-Saharan Africa","Extreme weather; Health; Health risks; Weather information services; Adaptation strategies; Children and adolescents; Climate change impact; Direct and indirect impacts; Extreme weather events; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Sub-saharan africa; Vulnerable regions; Climate change; adolescence; child health; climate change; climate effect; extreme event; health risk; literature review; mental health; meta-analysis; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085727361

Intensive study on land use carbon emissions is of great significance to alleviate environmental pressure, formulate carbon emission reduction policy, and protect ecological development. The lower Yellow River area is an important area of economic development, grain cultivation, and agricultural production in China. Land use change has significant economic, environmental, and ecological impacts in this region. Deep study of land used carbon emissions and its influencing factors in the lower Yellow River area is not only of great significance to the environmental improvement in the Yellow River basin, but also can provide references for the research of other basins. Based on this, this paper studies the land use carbon emissions of 20 cities in the lower Yellow River area from 1995 to 2018. The results showed that from 1995 to 2018, the land use change was characterized by the decrease of the ecological land and the increase of the built-up land significantly. The overall carbon emission of the lower Yellow River area is increasing, and the built-up land is the main factor that leads to the increase of carbon emission, which can be also proven by the analysis of the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model. The economic contributive coefficient (ECC) and ecological support coefficient (ESC) of carbon emission in the lower Yellow River area show a trend of high in Zhengzhou, Jinan, and Zibo and low in Zhoukou, Shangqiu, and Heze, and there was no significant changes during the study period, which indicates that each city did not achieve the coordinated development of the ecological economy. Finally, analysis results of the STIRPAT model indicated that the area of built-up land had the greatest impact on land use carbon emissions, followed by tertiary industry, whereas per capita gross domestic product (GDP) had the smallest impact. For every 1% increase in the area of built-up land, carbon emissions increased by 1.024%. By contrast, for every 1% increase in the contribution of tertiary industry to the GDP and per capita GDP, carbon emissions decreased by 0.051% and 0.034%, respectively. According to the study, there are still many problems in the coordinated development of economy and ecology in the lower Yellow River area. The lower Yellow River area should control the expansion of built-up land, afforestation, development of technology, reduction of carbon emissions, and promotion of the high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emission; Ecological support coefficient (ESC); Economic contributive coefficient (ECC); Land use; Lower Yellow River area; STIRPAT model","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Quality control; Reforestation; Rivers; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Watersheds; Agricultural productions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission reductions; Ecological development; Ecological environments; Environmental improvements; Environmental pressures; Gross domestic products; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085860276

The analysis is based on synthetic spectra (centered around 0.765 and 1.575 μm) produced by SCIATRAN. The input parameters considered include the profiles of temperature and pressure, as well as the surface albedo and aerosols. The main findings are temperature errors of 1 K and pressure errors of 2 hPa lead to XCO2 retrieval errors of less than 0.25%. The uncertainties in albedo (ranging from 0.03 to 1.0) or surface types lead to less than 2.0% retrieval error. Considering three aerosol types (urban, rural and maritime), we investigated the retrieval errors in XCO2 that were induced by incorrect assumptions on the aerosol optical thickness (AOT). For AOT values ranging from 0.02 to 1.0, the retrieval errors are less than 6.0% if aerosols are completely neglected in the retrieval. The presented results provide a basis for rational utilization of the a priori database and are conducive to increasing the inversion accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Satellite observation; Sensitivity analysis; XCO2 retrieval","Aerosols; Errors; Greenhouse gases; Infrared radiation; Solar radiation; Aerosol optical thickness; Inversion accuracy; Monitoring instruments; Retrieval algorithms; Satellite observations; Short wave infrared; Temperature and pressures; XCO2 retrieval; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082710246

On a global scale, the impact of glacial and periglacial processes on the geometry of mountain ranges and the relative efficiency of glacial and fluvial erosion are still discussed. To address these issues, we analyse a novel, worldwide dataset of more than 16,000 mountain peaks. We relate peak height and steepness to mean elevation and crustal thickness. We show that the geometry of mountain ranges systematically varies with latitude and thus with climate. For peaks of similar height, the steepness increases towards high latitudes, while mean elevation and thickness of the supporting crust decrease. Modelling flexural isostasy based on the topographic load of mountain ranges demonstrates that the crustal thickness required to support peaks of similar height dramatically declines with intensity of glacial erosion. In concert with latitudinal trends in peak steepness, mean elevation and crustal thickness, this shows that Quaternary climate cooling reduces the topographic load by transforming the geometry of mountain landscapes from fluvial to glacial conditions. We conclude that the prevalence of glacial erosion in cold climate reduces the topographic load of mountain ranges and enables the growth of high mountain peaks even on moderately over-thickened crust. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","crustal thickness; flexural isostasy; glacial erosion; mountain peaks; quaternary climate cooling; topographic load","Earth (planet); Erosion; Geodesy; Geometry; Glacial geology; Structural geology; Crustal thickness; flexural isostasy; Glacial erosion; Mountain peaks; Quaternary climate; Landforms; cooling; crustal thickening; crustal thickness; flexure; glacial erosion; glacial landform; isostasy; mountain region; paleoclimate; Quaternary; tectonic evolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081991288

This paper assembles and evaluates technical and policy interventions, both on the supply side and on the demand side. It identifies measures that, employed together, can achieve net zero industrial emissions in the required timeframe. Key supply-side technologies include energy efficiency (especially at the system level), carbon capture, electrification, and zero-carbon hydrogen as a heat source and chemical feedstock. There are also promising technologies specific to each of the three top-emitting industries: cement, iron & steel, and chemicals & plastics. These include cement admixtures and alternative chemistries, several technological routes for zero-carbon steelmaking, and novel chemical catalysts and separation technologies. Crucial demand-side approaches include material-efficient design, reductions in material waste, substituting low-carbon for high-carbon materials, and circular economy interventions (such as improving product longevity, reusability, ease of refurbishment, and recyclability). Strategic, well-designed policy can accelerate innovation and provide incentives for technology deployment. High-value policies include carbon pricing with border adjustments or other price signals; robust government support for research, development, and deployment; and energy efficiency or emissions standards. These core policies should be supported by labeling and government procurement of low-carbon products, data collection and disclosure requirements, and recycling incentives. In implementing these policies, care must be taken to ensure a just transition for displaced workers and affected communities. Similarly, decarbonization must complement the human and economic development of low- and middle-income countries. © 2020 The Authors","Emissions; Energy; Industry; Materials; Policy; Technology","Cement industry; Cements; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industry; Materials; Particulate emissions; Product design; Public policy; Reusability; Climate stabilization; Energy; Government procurement; Low and middle income countries; Separation technologies; Supply-side technologies; Technological route; Technology deployment; Plastics industry; catalyst; economic development; energy efficiency; global warming; greenhouse gas; heat source; industrial emission; policy making; recycling",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082446816

We evaluated the consequences of asynchronous range shifts in an alpine plant–pollinator community by transplanting replicated alpine meadow turfs downslope along an elevational gradient thereby introducing them to warmer climates and novel plant and pollinator communities. We asked how these novel plant–pollinator interactions affect plant reproduction. We found that pollinator communities differed substantially across the elevation/temperature gradient, suggesting that these plants will likely interact with different pollinator communities with warming climate. Contrary to the expectation that floral visitation would increase monotonically with warmer temperatures at lower elevations, visitation rate to the transplanted communities peaked under intermediate warming at midelevation sites. In contrast, visitation rate generally increased with temperature for the local, lower elevation plant communities surrounding the experimental alpine turfs. For two of three focal plant species in the transplanted high-elevation community, reproduction declined at warmer sites. For these species, reproduction appears to be dependent on pollinator identity such that reduced reproduction may be attributable to decreased visitation from key pollinator species, such as bumble bees, at warmer sites. Reproduction in the third focal species appears to be primarily driven by overall pollinator visitation rate, regardless of pollinator identity. Taken together, the results suggest climate warming can indirectly affect plant reproduction via changes in plant–pollinator interactions. More broadly, the experiment provides a case study for predicting the outcome of novel species interactions formed under changing climates. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alpine ecosystems; climate change; community ecology; migration; mutualism; pollination; range shifts","alpine environment; climate change; climate effect; meadow; plant-pollinator interaction; warming; Bombus (genus); animal; bee; climate change; flower; plant; pollination; reproduction; Animals; Bees; Climate Change; Flowers; Plants; Pollination; Reproduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082181167

Even though several studies have been conducted regarding a wide variety of CO2 capture techniques, gas separation membrane process has shown potential as an energy-efficient, low-cost CO2 capture option. However, most of the previous researches focused only on CO2-selective membrane, and there's limited literature about the application of N2-selective membrane. In this study, both CO2-selective and N2-selective membranes are considered and relevant issues regarding the CO2-selective membrane, such as pressure ratio, attainability, and multistage configuration, are studied and extended to the N2-selective membrane. Polaris® membrane is served as a typical CO2-selective membrane; on the other hand, membrane properties of N2-selective membrane with selectivity up to 200 are considered. Hybrid membrane process applying both CO2- and N2-selective membranes for capturing at least 90% CO2 from a typical 550 MW subcritical coal-fired power plant is designed, simulated and analyzed using Aspen Plus® simulation software. The optimization and economic analysis are also applied with the cost factor defined in this work, which is a comprehensive index to evaluate the applicability of the membrane, including permeance, membrane lifetime and membrane price. The results reveal the relationship between the optimal design variables and membrane properties. Moreover, the selectivity-limited region is identified, which leads to two different dominant strategies for the cost reduction in a different region, either by the increase in selectivity or the reduction of the cost factor. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 capture; CO2-selective membrane; Coal-fired power plant; Hybrid membrane process; N2-selective membrane","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal fueled furnaces; Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants; Mining; CO2 capture; Coal-fired power plant; Comprehensive indices; Gas separation membrane; Hybrid membrane process; Membrane properties; Multistage configuration; Selective membranes; Gas permeable membranes; carbon dioxide; Article; coal power; combustion; cost control; economic evaluation; electric power plant; membrane; pressure; priority journal; process optimization; simulation; Carbon Dioxide; Coal; Cost Control; Economic Analysis; Mining; Power Plants; Processes; Selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081654604

It is concluded that the total efficiency of the solar photovoltaic industry in China's six regions shows a growing trend, but the regional differences are obvious. The overall efficiency of the northwest region is superior. Among the index efficiency, CO2 emission reduction efficiency is better than cumulative installed capacity efficiency, solar energy utilization hour efficiency is the lowest, and CO2 emission reduction and cumulative installed capacity efficiency all show a consistent trend.

It is therefore necessary to find short-term measures to limit the exposure of this population and noise barriers have shown great potential for achieving this. Nevertheless, further work is needed to better understand how they can act on pollution reduction. To do this, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes model that takes into account thermal effects is used to study the effects of wind speed and atmospheric stability on the concentration reduction rates (CRR) induced by noise barriers. This study shows that the CRR behind the barriers may depend on both wind and thermal conditions. Although only the wind direction, and not the wind speed, has an impact on CRR in a neutral atmosphere, this parameter can be changed by both wind speed and thermal variations in non-neutral atmospheres. Stable cases lead to a higher CRR compared to unstable cases, while the neutral case gives intermediate results. Finally, it is shown that the variation of CRR is negligible for Richardson numbers ranging from −0.50 to 0.17. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Computational fluid dynamics; Noise barrier; Thermal stratification; Wind speed","Acoustic noise measurement; Air; Air pollution; Computational fluid dynamics; Navier Stokes equations; Speed; Thermal pollution; Thermal stratification; Atmospheric stability; Concentration reduction; Intermediate results; Noise barriers; Pollution reduction; Reynolds averaged navier-stokes models; Traffic-related emissions; Wind speed; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082168176

A metabolomic approach was developed to evaluate the sap extracted from sapwood of Norway spruce (Picea abies), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), radiata pine (Pinus radiata), macrocarpa (Cupressus macrocarpa), and two Eucalyptus species-shining gum and mountain ash (Eucalyptus nitens and Eucalyptus regnans. The sap extraction patterns in the different species were visualised using 1H magnetic resonance imaging. In softwoods with distinct annual rings, water was first removed from the latewood bands, and then gradually from the earlywood bands. In the case of the hardwood species an almost random water redistribution, rather than water expulsion, was observed. Analysis of the principal component analysis loading plots showed that the significant differences in the sap between each species were due to the carbohydrate region. Key discriminators were identified as pinitol, sucrose, glucose, and fructose. © 2020, North Carolina State University.","Magnetic resonance imaging; NMR fingerprinting; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Wood anatomy; Wood metabolites","Carbon dioxide; Hardwoods; Magnetic resonance imaging; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Plants (botany); Supercritical fluid extraction; 1H NMR spectroscopy; Carbohydrate regions; Eucalyptus regnans; Extraction patterns; NMR fingerprinting; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Tree species identifications; Water redistribution; Forestry; Bands; Carbon Dioxide; Eucalyptus Regnans; Forestry; Hardwoods; Norway; Sap; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088434646

Municipal waste as a substrate is used in many countries in biomethane production, but the amount of waste can cover only a small portion of the fuel used. In Europe, the new renewable energy directive (RED II) was established December 2018 to ensure the sustainability of renewable fuels. The directive includes typical and default greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for several potential substrates, such as biogas from manure or maize silage, which the biogas plants can use to verify their emissions directly or to calculate their emissions using the methods provided. However, such default value for grass silage as biogas substrate is lacking. We defined the conditions needed to fulfil the sustainability criteria of the directive when producing biomethane for vehicle fuel using grass silage as the feedstock in Finland. The emission reduction targets are not easy to achieve in Finland when using grass cultivated exclusively for energy production. The reduction targets can be achieved, however, if the grass is cultivated due to an improved crop rotation, where the grass is co-digested with manure and/or energy sources with zero emissions for the process can be applied. © 2020 by the authors.","Biogas; Biomethane; Grass silage; Manure; RED II directive; Sustainability; Vehicle fuel","alternative energy; biofuel; biogas; energy resource; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; methane; silage; sustainability; Finland; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085644967

N-doped graphene improves their reductivity and their low-temperature catalytic performance of CO oxidation. After the treatment with dry reaction gases, the treated composites show the changed chemical structure of nitrogen species from N[sbnd](C)3 structure to C[dbnd]N[sbnd]C structure. After the treatment with wet reaction gases, nitrogen species on N-doped graphene are decomposed and the anchored sites of Co3O4 nanoparticles are converted into oxygenated groups. The nitrogen sites of N[sbnd](C)3 structure are beneficial to promote the reversible conversion between the reduced Co2+ ions and active Co3+ ions on Co3O4 nanoparticles at low temperature, but Co3+ ions can irreversibly be converted into the reduced Co2+ ions on Co3O4 nanoparticles anchored at the nitrogen sites of C[dbnd]N[sbnd]C structure and it is more difficult to reduce Co3O4 nanoparticles anchored at oxygenated groups from the converted nitrogen species. Since CO oxidation is promoted by the reversible conversion between Co2+ ions and Co3+ ions on Co3O4 nanoparticles, Co3O4/N-doped graphene has low-temperature catalytic activity, but the composites treated with dry reaction gases require higher temperature to show catalytic activity and the composites treated with wet reaction gases show lower catalytic performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO oxidation; Co3O4; Graphene; N-doping; Nitrogen states","Catalytic oxidation; Decomposition; Doping (additives); Graphene; Ions; Nanoparticles; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Temperature; Catalytic performance; Co oxidation; Co3O4; Large scale synthesis; Low temperatures; N-Doping; Nitrogen species; Reaction gas; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079525381

This model consists in coupling a 2D model along the channel with another model perpendicular to the flow at the rib/channel scale. Simulations offer a deeper understanding of the corrosion through the analysis of the local conditions. Rib/channel heterogeneities show the higher degradation in the zones facing the anodic rib. These results are validated qualitatively on literature data by analysis of SEM images and carbon dioxide concentration at the cathode outlet. Three mitigation strategies are studied using the model. The first one consists in speeding up the hydrogen filling of the cell. The second strategy involves an external electrical resistance to create a current leak during the startup. Third, a design study of the rib/channel is performed to minimize the cathode degradation. Whatever the mitigation strategy, it consists in reducing either the duration or the magnitude of the high cathode electrode potential. © 2020 by the authors.

Given its importance, the precise size and location of the HZ remains a hot topic, as many studies, using a hierarchy of models, have assessed various factors including: atmospheric composition, time, and planetary mass. However, little work has assessed how the HZ changes with variations in background nitrogen pressure, which is directly connected to the habitability and life-bearing potential of planets. Here, I use an advanced energy balance model with clouds to show that our Solar system's HZ is ∼0.9-1.7 au, assuming a 5-bar nitrogen background pressure and a maximum 100 per cent cloud cover at the inner edge. This width is ∼20 per cent wider than the conservative HZ estimate. Similar extensions are calculated for A-M stars. I also show that cooling clouds/hazes and high background pressures can decrease the runaway greenhouse threshold temperature to ∼300 K (or less) for planets orbiting any star type. This is because the associated increase in planetary albedo enables stable climates closer to the star, where rapid destabilization can be triggered from a lower mean surface temperature. Enhanced longwave emission for planets with very high stratospheric temperatures also permits stable climates at smaller orbital distances. The model predicts a runaway greenhouse above ∼330 K for planets orbiting the Sun, which is consistent with previous work. However, moist greenhouses only occur for planets orbiting A-stars. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society","Astrobiology; Planets; Planets and satellites: atmospheres; Planets and satellites: oceans; Satellites: terrestrial planets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085392069

Here we report on bright emission, 5 orders of magnitude greater than harmonic generation, that can be seen from metal tunnel junctions that we believe is due to light-induced inelastic tunneling emission. Like inelastic tunneling light emission, which was recently reported to have 2% conversion efficiency per tunneling event, the emission wavelength recorded varies with the local electric field applied; however, here the field is from a 1560 nm femtosecond pulsed laser source.

Seedlings inoculated with Claroideoglomus etunicatum is recommended to produce superior planting stock of mahogany seedlings with better drought resistance in the nursery. Background and Objectives: With numerous intense droughts across tropical regions due to climate change, it is crucial to understand effects of drought stress on tree seedlings to improve crop management practices and avoid failures on large scale planting. Swietenia macrophylla, a commercial timber species in India, is poorly studied in relation to its management including physiological responses to various environmental stresses. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is known to improve performance of tree seedlings under drought conditions and produce quality planting stock in nursery. This study aims to understand the responses of mahogany seedlings under different levels of drought stress when inoculated with three types of AMF, namely Funneliformis mosseae, Claroideoglomus etunicatum, and Rhizophagus intraradices. Materials and Methods: The experiment is conducted in pot culture using a factorial completely randomized design. Different irrigation regimes were applied at 100, 80, 60, and 40 percentage of weekly cumulative evapotranspiration. The seedlings were tested for biometric, physiological, and mycorrhizal parameters periodically. Results: Physiological attributes such as rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, chlorophyll content, and water potential were found to be higher in the daily irrigated (control) seedlings. Performance of the seedlings were poorest in the least irrigated treatment. It was apparent that inoculated seedlings performed better than the non-inoculated ones. Conclusions: Among the three different AMF species used, C. etunicatum was found to be the most beneficial and suitable for the young mahogany seedlings. These seedlings also recorded higher root colonization percentage and total spore count in the rhizosphere soils. Seedlings inoculated with C. etunicatum showed positive influence on rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, chlorophyll content, relative growth rate (RGR) and water potential of seedlings. © 2020 by the authors.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Chlorophyll content; Drought stress; Leaf temperature; Plant water status; Rate of photosynthesis; Stomatal conductance; Swietenia macrophylla; Transpiration rate","Chlorophyll; Climate change; Crops; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Fungi; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Physiology; Soils; Transpiration; Adaptation strategies; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Chlorophyll contents; Completely randomized designs; Crop management practices; Environmental stress; Physiological response; Relative growth rate; Seed; adaptation; angiosperm; arbuscular mycorrhiza; climate change; inoculation; seedling emergence; strategic approach; Drought; Farm Crops; Forestry; Fungi; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Fungi; Rhizophagus; Swietenia; Swietenia macrophylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085926727

Subsidized electricity supply has led to unregulated groundwater pumping, causing a decrease in groundwater level and increase in carbon emissions. This complex nexus necessitates estimation of carbon emissions from groundwater irrigation. The study uses actual pumping data on 20.5 million groundwater structures from the Fifth Minor Irrigation Census (reference year 2013–14) to estimate carbon emissions. The estimates show that groundwater irrigation emits 45.3–62.3 MMT of carbon annually, contributing 8–11% of India’s total carbon emission. This analysis shows deep tubewells have a huge carbon footprint, and their growing number is a serious environmental concern. Spatial analysis reveals India’s western and peninsular region, which houses 85% of the country’s over-exploited groundwater blocks, contributes most to carbon emission. Moreover, this region hosts 27 districts which are groundwater–energy–climate nexus hotspots, together accounting for 34% of carbon emissions from groundwater irrigation. Comparison with the previous estimate reveals that carbon emission from groundwater irrigation nearly doubled between 2000 and 2013. Findings of this study are vital to the discourse on the increasing environmental costs of groundwater pumping in the country and will contribute to carbon emission mitigation strategies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon emission; GHG accounting; Water–energy–climate nexus","Emission control; Groundwater; Irrigation; Pumps; Carbon emissions; Electricity supply; Environmental concerns; Environmental costs; Groundwater irrigation; Groundwater pumping; Spatial analysis; Total carbon; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083647529

The training participants are community who live in and around the Peatland Hydrological Unit of Kampar-Indragiri Rivers, Riau. An impact assessment of the completed trainings has been conducted which employe four-level evaluation model as proposed by Kirkpatrick (1994). The results indicatesthat all of the trainings improve participants' knowledge and skill.

Emerging technologies may improve fleet operations by cost-effectively reducing emissions. This study analyzes both battery-electric buses and self-driving (autonomous) buses from both cost and qualitative perspectives, using the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority's bus fleet in Austin, Texas. The study predicts battery-electric buses, including the required charging infrastructure, will become lifecycle cost-competitive in or before the year 2030 at existing U.S. fuel prices ($2.00/gallon), with the specific year depending on the actual rate of cost decline and the diesel bus purchase prices. Rising diesel prices would result in immediate cost savings before reaching $3.30 per gallon. Self-driving buses will reduce or eliminate the need for human drivers, one of the highest current operating costs of transit agencies. Finally, this study develops adoption schedules for these technologies. Recognizing bus lifespans and driver contracts, and assuming battery-electric bus adoption beginning in year-2020, cumulative break-even (neglecting extrinsic benefits, such as respiratory health) occurs somewhere between 2030 and 2037 depending on the rate of battery cost decline and diesel-bus purchase prices. This range changes to 2028 if self-driving technology is available for simultaneous adoption on new electric bus purchases beginning in 2020. The results inform fleet operators and manufacturers of the budgetary implications of converting a bus fleet to electric power, and what cost parameters allow electric buses to provide budgetary benefits over their diesel counterparts. © 2020 by the authors.","Benefits of automation; Benefits of electrification; Electric bus; Self-driving bus; Transit costs","cost-benefit analysis; diesel; electric vehicle; electrical power; electrification; emission control; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; public transport; Austin [Texas]; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085648878

On the basis of an intensive literature review and field research conducted in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, the paper proposes a substantial linkage between T-learning and sustainability. It first outlines the environmental changes in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, which appear to serve as ""disorienting dilemmas"" that force local people to learn and gradually shift their farming practices to align with a climate-resilient development. The paper relies on the outcomes of household surveys, field observations and focus group discussions to explore the impacts of T-learning on building adaptive capacity and sustainability transition in two community-based projects in Can Tho City and Ca Mau province in the Mekong Delta. Our findings reveal that T-learning enables experts and practitioners to introduce new ideas and accordingly mobilize local people to make changes without inciting doubt, dismay or concern. In an ideal T-learning approach, small-scale farmers learn from being under the supervision of experts in ""field-based schools"" that offer real-life experience and encourage learners to shift their livelihoods to eco-friendly agricultural practices. The paper sheds new light on how a critical approach to education for sustainable development through T-learning can be, under specific conditions, one strategy. It concludes that T-learning should be acknowledged as a potentially important part of the broader approach to climate-resilient development in vulnerable grassroots communities. © 2020 Pensoft Publishers.

Palynological evidence suggests that between ca. 11,700 and 8500 cal yr BP, a mixed tropical deciduous forest occurred in the region under a warm and humid climate with good monsoon precipitation. The forest expanded into a dense mixed tropical deciduous forest since ca. 8500 cal yr BP to the present, under warm and relatively more humid climatic conditions with further increase in monsoon precipitation. This warm climatic phase represents the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO) or Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). Prior to the initiation of the long warm period, an open vegetation occurred in the region between ca.14,100 and 11,700 cal yr BP, under a cool and dry climate, probably indicating reduced monsoon precipitation, and partially matching with the Older Dryas stadial. The present study provides insights into the vegetation dynamics and associated climatic changes in response to the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) variability over the last ~ 14.1 ka from a poorly understood area of the tropics in South Asia, where rainfall is essentially controlled by the ISM.

Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a key index to estimate the terrestrial ecosystem carbon flux, which describes the total amount of organic carbon fixed by green plants through photosynthesis. In recent years, the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which is a probe for vegetation photosynthesis and can quickly reflect the state of vegetation growth, emerges as a novel and promising proxy to estimate GPP. The launch of Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) further makes it possible to estimate GPP at a finer spatial resolution compared with Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY). However, whether the relationship between GPP and SIF is linear or non-linear has always been controversial. In this research, we proposed a new model to estimate GPP using SIF and the atmospheric CO2 concentration from OCO-2 as critical driven factors simultaneously (SIF-CO2-GPP model). Evidences from all sites show that the introduction of the atmospheric CO2 concentration improves accuracies of estimated GPP. Compared with the SIF-CO2-GPP linear model, we found the SIF-GPP model overestimated GPP in summer and autumn but underestimated it in spring and winter. A series of simulation experiments based on SCOPE (Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy) was carried out to figure out the possible mechanism of improved estimates of GPP due to the introduction of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These experiments also demonstrate that there could be a non-linear relationship between SIF and GPP at half an hour timescale. Moreover, such relationships vary with CO2 concentration. As OCO-2 is capable of providing SIF and XCO2 products with identical spatial and temporal scales, the SIF-CO2-GPP linear model would be implemented conveniently to monitor GPP using remotely sensed data. With the help of OCO-3 and its successors, the proposed SIF-CO2-GPP linear model would play a significant role in monitoring GPP accurately in large geographical extents. © 2020 by the authors.","CO2; Gross primary productivity (GPP); OCO-2; Photosynthesis; SCOPE (soil-canopy observation of photosynthesis and energy); Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)","Chlorophyll; Ecosystems; Fluorescence; Greenhouse gases; Orbits; Organic carbon; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Spectrometers; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Global ozone monitoring experiments; Greenhouse gases observing satellites; Gross primary productivity; Non-linear relationships; Scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography; Spatial and temporal scale; Terrestrial ecosystems; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085251411

In order to investigate the responses of CO2 fluxes in subsurface soils to crop residue incorporation in the topsoil, a field experiment comprising two treatments (i.e., conventional tillage with and without crop residue incorporation) was carried out under a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system from 2014 to 2016 in the Yucheng Agricultural Station, Shandong Province, China. The results showed that soil CO2 fluxes had large spatiotemporal variabilities and were significantly affected by crop residue applications (P &lt; 0.05). Soil CO2 fluxes increased with soil depth. The CO2 fluxes from 100 to 400 mm soil depths were 1.1–5.1 times higher than those from 0 to 100 mm soil depths. Incorporation of crop residues into the soil significantly increased soil CO2 fluxes in all sampled layers (P &lt; 0.05), and the magnitude increased with increasing soil depth. Soil moisture and the ratio of soil dissolved organic carbon to nitrogen (DOC/DON) were the dominant factors regulating soil CO2 fluxes in the wheat growing season, whereas soil DON concentrations dominated in the maize growing season. Our study indicated that deep soil C was more vulnerable to the incorporation of crop residues than the C present in surface soil. Incorporation of crop residues into surface soil might not increase SOC sequestration in the subsurface soil. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","CO2 fluxes; Conventional tillage; Crop residues; Labile organic substrates; Soil depth","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; crop residue; cropping practice; dissolved organic carbon; maize; soil carbon; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; wheat; winter; China; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081023702

Results show that the lake surface temperature (LST) biases produced by BCC_AVIM2.0 with the default lake scheme can be largely reduced by adopting the CoLM-Lake scheme in winter due to much more realistically simulated vertical water temperature profiles over the Great Lakes region. The spatial distributions and seasonal variations of the LST simulations can also be significantly improved by the CoLM-Lake scheme within BCC_AVIM2.0. The performances of BCC_AVIM2.0 in simulating the lake ice in winter can be largely improved by replacing the default lake scheme with the CoLM-Lake scheme. The improvements in the LST simulated by BCC_AVIM2.0 with the CoLM-Lake scheme further lead to reduced biases in the simulated ground surface temperature. The simulations of air temperature and precipitation in the coupled model are also improved by adopting the CoLM-Lake scheme over the Great Lakes region, which indicates the improvements in simulating the energy and water exchange between the atmosphere and lakes.

Based on field monitoring experiments at high temporal resolution, we employed regression tree and importance analysis to identify quantitatively factors that influence the diffusive flux of GHGs to provide a scientific basis for reducing GHG emissions and controlling regional carbon and nitrogen losses. The results indicate that significant spatiotemporal variation of methane (CH4) nitrous oxide (N2O) diffusion occurs in all the four reaches (W1, W2, W3 and W4) of Tuojia river networks. Among them, W1 contributed lowest CH4 (22.55 μg C m−2 h−1) and N2O (5.00 μg N m−2 h−1) diffusive flux than the other three (P &lt; 0.05), while W4 offered highest CH4 (166.15 μg C m−2 h−1) and N2O (30.47 μg N m−2 h−1) diffusive flux but with no statistically significant difference between W2 and W3 due to homogeneous extraneous nutrition loading into the two reaches. W4 also contributed largest cumulative flux of CH4 (14.55 kg C ha−1 yr−1) and N2O (2.69 kg N ha−1 yr−1) in Tuojia River networks (P &lt; 0.05).

This paper focuses on the relationship and its internal mechanism of population urbanization, trade openness and carbon emissions using the threshold model and the moderated mediating model, which is based on the panel data of China during 2003–2016. The results show that the higher the level of population urbanization is; the more carbon emissions are. There is a significant threshold effect on trade openness. That is, when the threshold value of urban population density is 24,211 people per square kilometer, the relationship between trade openness and carbon emissions is “inverted U”. The population urbanization can also affect carbon emissions through trade openness indirectly, and its moderated mediating effect is significant. The moderated variables can be divided into four categories: scale effect, structure effect, technological progress effect, and social effect. Different moderated variables have different effects on carbon emission path, but they show an effective tendency of controlling emissions on the whole. By quantifying the conditional indirect effect, this paper analyzes the internal channel of population urbanization, trade openness, and carbon emissions. Then, according to the characteristics of different moderated effects, the effective emission control policy in China will be formulated in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon emissions; Moderated mediating effect; Population urbanization; Threshold model; Trade openness","carbon emission; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental economics; population density; quantitative analysis; trade openness; urban population; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082816380

Increasingly, scholars have been investing effort to establish a global–national–local system of linkages or a local–nonlocal division of linkages. However, analysis at the megaregion level has somehow been overlooked, although megaregions play a substantial role in the context of accelerating regional integration and increasing regional pollution. This study incorporated megaregions into the existing multiscale input-output model and constructed a four-level analytical framework to analyze the emissions embodied in exports (EEE) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Since this region pioneered the economic transition in China, this study further applies structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to investigate the structural changes in EEE. The empirical results show that EEE in the YRD region was mainly affected by local and cross-border linkages, which account for 85.1% and 9.8% of the total EEE in the region. The increase in local EEE linkages needs to be reduced by local technological innovation in sectors such as light industry and energy. To prevent the YRD from becoming a pollution haven for developed countries, the cross-border EEE linkage must be reduced by adjusting the production and consumption structure of light industry. Cross-regional EEE linkage can be reduced through technology upgrades in the construction sector. The trend of a decrease in intraregional linkage and an increase in cross-regional linkage indicates that YRD exports tend to be outward rather than inward oriented. The four-level framework for examining EEE offers new detailed insights into the mitigation of regional air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Input-output model; Multilevel perspective; Pollution embodied in exports; Structural decomposition; Yangtze river delta","Air pollution; Construction industry; International trade; Rivers; Input output model; Multilevel perspective; Production and consumption; Regional air pollution; Structural decomposition; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Technological innovation; Yangtze river delta; River pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078223313

This study models existing solvent-based carbon capture technologies on natural gas-fired power plants, using site-specific emissions and regionally defined cost parameters to calculate the cost of CO2 avoided for two scenarios: Delivery to and injection within reliable sequestration sites, and delivery and injection for the purpose of CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Despite the application of credits from the existing federal tax code 45Q, a minimum incentive gap of roughly $38/tCO2 remains for the geologic sequestration of CO2 and $56/tCO2 for CO2-EOR (before consideration of revenue generated from delivered CO2 contracts). At full escalation of 45Q, delivered CO2 costs from this sector for geologic sequestration could reach as low as $22/tCO2. However, given the capital investment required in the near-term, it would be beneficial if the credit provided the greatest economic benefit early on and decreasing over time as deployment continues to ramp up. Additionally, due to the high qualifying limit of 45Q for the power sector, e.g., 500 ktCO2/yr, the tax credit incentivizes the capture of roughly 397 MtCO2/yr at a 90% capture efficiency or 75% of the emissions in this sector, with missed opportunities equating to roughly 118 MtCO2. Advancing the scale of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) will require both technological advances in the capture technology, cost reductions through the leveraging of existing infrastructure, and increased policy incentives in terms of cost along with the reduction of qualifying limits. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Economics; Enhanced recovery; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Investments; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Reduction; Taxation; Capital investment; Capture efficiency; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Economic benefits; Enhanced oil recovery; Geologic sequestrations; Natural gas fired power plants; Technological advances; Carbon capture; carbon; carbon dioxide; natural gas; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; coal-fired power plant; cost analysis; decarboxylation; energy efficiency; incentive; natural gas; numerical model; power generation; Article; capital; carbon capture; carbon sequestration; cost; electric power plant; investment; tax; United States; waste management; electric power plant; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Natural Gas; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084939172

This article goes some way toward addressing this gap both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, it unpacks how traditional and Anthropocene geopolitics diverge in their approach toward the security repercussions of climate change and teases out the emanating foreign policy implications. These revolve around different levels of climate ambition, divergent approaches to fossil energy geopolitics, and differing weighting of planetary security versus mainstream geopolitical threats. Against this theoretical background, this article empirically zooms in on the EU case to explore which geopolitical mindset guides EU’s pursuit of climate change concerns and their incorporation in the EU foreign policy design. The analysis finds that, despite its comprehensive foreign climate policy initiatives, the EU remains fixed to a traditional geopolitical mindset and a foreign policy that underappreciates planetary security threats.

To this end, we resampled a jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and red pine (P. resinosa) chronosequence 16 years after the initial measurement to quantify carbon pools following ca. 40 years of regreening on an acid and metal impacted landscape. Measured carbon pools were then compared to those reported in an unpublished study to determine how carbon sequestration rates have changed over time and if repeated sampling at the stand level validates temporal trends estimated by the chronosequence. Total ecosystem carbon (TEC) within the stands ranged from 55 to 136 Mg ha−1 with a regional mean of 90.2 ± 9.6 Mg ha−1. On average, tree and soil organic pools (SOC) were the two largest carbon pools, representing 47% and 42% of TEC, respectively. Compared with unplanted sites, tree restoration resulted in a significant increase in the mean TEC among all sites of 54.4 ± 10.2 Mg ha−1 with a corresponding sequestration rate of 1.7 ± 0.3 Mg ha−1 yr−1. The chronosequence approach was only able to consistently detect a change in the tree carbon pool. In contrast, repeated sampling at the stand level identified changes in carbon sequestration rates within SOC, LFH and shrub carbon pools and showed that the chronosequence tree carbon sequestration rate was underestimated by a factor of 2.3. Chronosequence studies assume study sites have similar landscape history and environmental conditions, which may not be reasonable in highly degraded landscapes where past events (e.g., pollution, erosion, restoration) influence multiple landscape characteristics (e.g., local hydrology and topography). We conclude that tree restoration on impacted landscapes can sequester carbon at a rate comparable to silvicultural plantations in a similar climatic region and that reforestation of industrially damaged landscapes could be part of an effective carbon capture strategy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acidification; Carbon sequestration and storage; Chronosequence; Impacted landscape; Jack pine; Red pine; Repeated sampling; Soil organic carbon; Tree restoration","Acidification; Carbon capture; Conservation; Ecosystems; Lakes; Magnesium; Reforestation; Restoration; Topography; Carbon sequestration; Chronosequences; Impacted landscape; Jack pine; Red pines; Soil organic carbon; Organic carbon; acid; acidification; carbon storage; chronosequence; climatic region; coniferous tree; environmental conditions; environmental restoration; land degradation; metal; regeneration; sampling; shrub; silviculture; soil organic matter; Acidification; Conservation; Ecosystems; Lakes; Magnesium; Reforestation; Pinus banksiana; Pinus resinosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080885855

In the long term, this unyielding dependency is threatened by the depletion of the crude oil reserve. However, in the short term, its price highly fluctuates due to various factors, such as regional and global security instability causing additional complexity on refinery production planning. The petroleum refining industries are also drawing criticism and pressure due to their direct and indirect impacts on the environment. The exhaust gas emission of automobiles apart from the industrial and power plant emission has been viewed as the cause of global warming. In this sense, there is a need for a feasible, sustainable, and environmentally friendly generation process of fuels and chemicals. The attention turns to the utilization of biomass as a potential feedstock to produce substitutes for petroleum-derived fuels and building blocks for biochemicals. Biomass is abundant and currently is still low in utilization. The biorefinery, a facility to convert biomass into biofuels and biochemicals, is still lacking in competitiveness to a petroleum refinery. An attractive solution that addresses both is by the integration of bio- and petroleum refineries. In this context, the right decision making in the process selection and technologies can lower the investment and operational costs and assure optimum yield. Process optimization based on mathematical programming has been extensively used to conduct techno-economic and sustainability analysis for bio-, petroleum, and the integration of both refineries. This paper provides insights into the context of crude oil and biomass as potential refinery feedstocks. The current optimization status of either bio- or petroleum refineries and their integration is reviewed with the focus on the methods to solve the multi-objective optimization problems. Internal and external uncertain parameters are important aspects in process optimization. The nature of these uncertain parameters and their representation methods in process optimization are also discussed. © 2020 by the authors.","Biomass; Biorefinery; Mathematical programming deterministic; Multi-objective optimization; Process optimization; Single-objective optimization; Stochastics","Biomass; Chemicals; Crude oil; Decision making; Feedstocks; Gasoline; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Mathematical programming; Multiobjective optimization; Petroleum analysis; Petroleum industry; Process control; Production control; Proven reserves; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Biofuels and biochemicals; Direct and indirect impacts; Multi-objective optimization problem; Petroleum-derived fuels; Power-plant emissions; Representation method; Sustainability analysis; Sustainable integrations; Petroleum refineries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086009908

In this work, a hybrid fuel was prepared for the first time by blending Pongamia oil, hydrated ethanol (95% purity) and butanol (as a surfactant). To eliminate engine modification and reduce injector clogging in the diesel engine, degummed Pongamia oil was utilized for preparing hybrid fuels. The results show that the density and viscosity of Pongamia oil reduced considerably after blending with ethanol and was brought closer to that of diesel. The gross calorific values were comparable with that of diesel. The brake thermal efficiencies of using hybrid fuels on a compression ignition engine were very similar to that of diesel. The emissions characteristics of hybrid fuels show reduced emissions of CO2, NOx and SO2. The hybrid fuel blends E22B27DPO51 and E17B16DPO67 prepared with degummed Pongamia oil show the lowest emissions. Thus, these hybrid fuels have the potential to substitute diesel to run diesel powered inter-island shipping vessels, fishing boats and smaller power plants for household electricity in remote and outer islands of developing countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Efficiency; Emissions; Ethanol; Fuel characteristics; Hybrid fuels; Pongamia oil","Blending; Developing countries; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fishing vessels; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Microemulsions; Particulate emissions; Proven reserves; Brake thermal efficiency; Compression ignition engine; Emissions characteristics; Fuel characteristics; Gross calorific values; Hybrid fuels; Pongamia; Small island developing state; Alternative fuels; alternative fuel; compression; developing world; diesel; diesel engine; efficiency measurement; electricity; emission; essential oil; ethanol; fossil fuel; power plant; Pongamia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077662816

Whereas conventional scholarship of India's foreign policy underlines continuity, this article explores how India's self-conception has changed across two policy fields (climate change and maritime security). Adopting a role-theoretical approach, we analyze official statements as a mirror of both India's self-understanding and its view on the roles of significant other actors. Although both issue-areas exhibit change, India's self-ascribed role has been transformed more profoundly in the maritime domain. Our comparison suggests three factors to particularly induce transformation of rising powers' roles toward 'more responsibility': First, power-sharing is more conducive than burden-sharing; second, issue-areas with strong regional anchors are more likely to induce the adoption of a more responsible role than those areas situated primarily at the global level of politics; and third, positive external role ascriptions are more effective than negative ones. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

In this study, we developed an emission inventory to Belo Horizonte, a densely populated urban city in Brazil, with approximately 2.0 million vehicles. The vehicular emission inventory was developed applying the National Vehicle Emission Inventory model (VEIN) using emission factor from São Paulo State Environmental Protection Agency, different traffic behavior profile (constant and different diurnal cycle per vehicle type) established from local radar data and kriging interpolation method considering four different scenarios with reductions in fleet composition. The scenarios were described as according the combination between traffic behavior profiles, vehicle flow, vehicle type and a fuel consumption. The comparison between scenarios showed reductions of emissions around 8.5 % (CO), 8.8 % (CO2), when it was considered 10 % of reduction in fleet composition of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Considering 20 % reduction in diesel fleet composition (trucks and buses), a decrease of 8.4 % (NOx) and 8.6 % (PM) was observed. Furthermore, this work presented that the kriging method to define a spatial/temporal distributing using radar traffic data is an alternative low- cost method to investigate the effect of real traffic data on the vehicular emissions modeling. This study is pioneer in Brazil and reinforced the importance of detailing traffic activities using real data to estimate vehicular emissions in an urban area. Transportation management strategies to reduce air pollution and to assist users to reduce air pollution exposure are mandatory to create a collaborative network and build sustainable cities in the future.

Crop diversification, as an agricultural practice, could lead to climate adaptation and mitigation. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of climatic variability on categories of crop diversification so as to understand its role as an adaptive measure in response to climate change. An ordered probit model which allows for the separation of different categories of crop diversification was used for the 2006 period. The results showed that increases in temperature and precipitation did not affect each category in the same way. However, diversification intensity increases with climate variability: the greater the climate variability, the greater the likelihood of a municipality being in the very diversified category. Therefore, crop diversification appears as an adaptation strategy because it is influenced by climatic shocks. These results could be used to recommend Rural Extension programs to promote diversified systems as a resilient and cleaner type of agricultural production to improve climate risk management in Brazilian agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate variability; Crop diversification; Ordered probit","Crops; Greenhouse gases; Risk management; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural practices; Agricultural productions; Climate variability; Climatic variability; Crop diversification; Ordered probit; Ordered probit model; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078998933

It is necessary to have low-cost sensors for data collection, ready data source allowing normal citizen to access to and gain information, and have prospect solutions (e.g. autonomous vehicle) for air pollution reduction in the city. The aim of the study is to illustrate the drivers behind the use of low-cost sensors and to review the performance of sensors. In addition, autonomous vehicle is expected to reduce pollution; therefore, the paper analyzes the benefits and adoption of autonomous vehicles in the future. The challenges and outlook for both low-cost sensor deployment and the adoption of self-driving vehicle will also be discussed. A literature review is used to obtain these aims. The study indicates that the main driver of low-cost sensor is to provide high-density spatiotemporal pollution data, assisting in creating emission inventories of pollutants and detecting pollution hotspots without capital investments. A number of performance aspects considered include the coefficients of determination (R2), variance (CV), repeatability, reproducibly and stability of the sensor. Self-driving vehicle is promising in the change of travel patterns and having impacts on the health of society. Technology and economic challenges, the willingness to use the sensor and the autonomous policy approach are the major challenges. In terms of the outlook, standard guidelines and the calibration methods for low-cost sensors, energy consumption savings and policy supporting for autonomous vehicle should be further investigated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086674258

The particle-bound carbonaceous aerosols (CA) as elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) were quantified with the thermal/optical reflectance method following the IMPROVE_TOR protocol. The concentrations of different temperature carbon fractions (OC1-OC4, EC1-EC3 and PyO) in the size-fractionated PM were evaluated to discern OC and EC correlations as well as those between char-EC and soot-EC. The results showed that biomass burning, motor vehicle, and secondary organic aerosols (SOC) all contributed to the size-fractionated PM. The OC/EC ratios ranged from 2.90 to 4.30 over the year, with the ratios of PM2.5-10 being the highest, except during the open biomass burning period. The concentration of CA was found to increase during the pre-monsoon season and had its peak value in the PM0.5-1.0 fraction. The long-range transport of PMs from Indonesia, southwest of Thailand toward southern Thailand became more obvious during the pre-monsoon season. Transported plumes from biomass burning in Indonesia may increase the concentration of OC and EC both in the fine (PM0.5-1.0 and PM1.0-2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10 and PM&gt;10) fractions. The OC fraction in PM0.1 was also shown to be significantly affected by the transported plumes during the pre-monsoon season. Good OC and EC correlations (R2 = 0.824–0.915) in the fine particle fractions indicated that they had common sources such as fossil fuel combustion.

Diffusion laws for nitrogen and carbon in the Petrified Forest chert were determined using both in-diffusion of C (believed to diffuse as CO2) and N (believed to diffuse as N2) from a C-O-H-N vapor and ion implantation followed by heating. Arrhenius relationships in the form of D = D0exp(−Ea/RT) were established: the log (D0, m2/s) values are −14.1 and −17.2 and the Ea (kJ/mol) values are 68.9 and 37.9 for nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Although this chert sample has not experienced temperatures above 100 °C, the diffusion results indicate that it is ~70% retentive to carbon and ~92% retentive to nitrogen at 100 °C for over 1 billion years, given a diffusion domain size of a sphere with a 1 cm radius. This suggests that at ambient conditions this material is a very good container for volatiles over geologically long timescales. In addition, the major atmospheric gases (N2, O2, Ar, CO2) are released when this sample is crushed incrementally into a quadrupole mass spectrometer, indicating that microcrystalline quartz dominated phases can provide a record of past atmospheric compositions. The combination of the retentiveness of atmospheric gases as well as the release of inclusion gas upon crushing makes this a reliable proxy for Earth's volatile history extending at least to the Late Triassic and potentially even earlier Earth history. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon and nitrogen diffusion; Paleoclimate; Quadrupole mass spectrometry; Volatile retention in chert","Atmospheric composition; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Crushing; Diffusion; Forestry; Mass spectrometry; Nitrogen; Quartz; Temperature; Ambient conditions; Arrhenius relationship; Carbon and nitrogen; Diffusion domain; Paleoclimates; Quadrupole mass spectrometer; Quadrupole mass spectrometry; Volatile retention in chert; Microcrystals; carbon cycle; chemical composition; chert; diffusion; mass spectrometry; nitrogen cycle; paleoatmosphere; paleoclimate; quartz; reconstruction; Triassic; volatile element; Arizona; Petrified Forest National Park; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081351969

Recent literature reviews report a growing number of applications of the industrial ecology model for material flow analysis in the design of the built environment. However, applications of material flow analysis in green infrastructure development are scarce. In this article, we argue that: (i) the use of material flow analysis in green infrastructure practice can inform decision-making towards more resource-efficient urban planning; (ii) the ecosystem service concept is critical to operationalize material flow analysis for green infrastructure planning and design, and, through this, can enhance the impact of urban metabolism research on policy making and planning practice. The article draws from a systematic review of literature on urban ecosystem services and benefits provided by green infrastructure in urban regions. The review focuses on ecosystem services that can contribute to a more energy-efficient and less carbon-intensive urban metabolism. Using the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services as a baseline, we then discuss opportunities for integrating energy provision and climate regulation ecosystem services in material flow analysis. Our discussion demonstrates that the accounting of ecosystem services in material flow analysis enables expressing impacts of green infrastructure on the urban energy mix (renewable energy provision), the magnitude of energy use (mitigation of building energy demand) and the dynamics of biogeochemical processes in cities (carbon sequestration). We finally propose an expanded model for material flow analysis that illustrates a way forward to integrate the ecosystem service concept in urban metabolism models and to enable their application in green infrastructure planning and design. © The Author(s) 2018.","climate regulation; Energy metabolism; material flow analysis; nature-based solutions; renewable energy provision","decision making; ecosystem service; greenspace; infrastructure planning; literature review; material flow analysis; policy making; strategic approach; urban design; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059442747

To begin with, we calculate transport carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel-driven vehicles (light and heavy-duty) at spatial and temporal resolutions of 500 m and one hour, by means of traffic demand forecasting. These estimates, carry out for 2007 and 2012, are based on passenger and freight trips and the height of the atmospheric boundary layer, among other variables. These proxies depend also on ancillary parameters as particulate matter concentrations and dilution rates. In the second place, we evaluate the changes in CO2 emissions from the MASP (3%/year). Transport emission inventories combine mobility surveys and road network assignments with air quality data. In spite of using different methodologies, bottom-up road link assignments versus top-down vehicle activity-based and fuel consumption approaches, the estimated CO2 emissions are consistent with the Official São Paulo State's Inventory. This work found that the CO2 emissions in MASP were 10,044 and 11,503 t Ceq./day in 2007 and 2012 (73% light and 27% heavy vehicles), respectively. On-road emission patterns agree with the spatial-temporal variation of transportation journeys and corresponding passenger and freight network assignments. Temporal patterns, diurnal, weekly and monthly, were determined using traffic counts and congestion surrogates. The patterns were also crosschecked with average CO2 measurements, available for 2014 at the road (western area of MASP) and background sites (Jaraguá Peak). Kerbside road measurements showed two prominent peaks associated to the morning (437 ± 45 ppm) and night rush hours (435 ± 49 ppm), coupled to low values of boundary layer height (313 m) and dilution rate (329 m2/h). Background values (414 ± 2 ppm) were subtracted from on-road measurements to estimate excess CO2 (12 ± 8 ppm) directly attributed to vehicles. The inventory reflects the relationships between traffic patterns and emissions, and the developed methodology could be used to evaluate the impacts of forthcoming urban transport and emission control policies. In the future, our estimates will be verified with ground measurements of CO2 concentrations over a bigger monitoring network in the MASP. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; Passenger and freight mobility surveys; São Paulo; Traffic modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085642244

The influence of the geographical location on the economic performance of combined heat and electricity production (CHP) and/or PHA production from biogas generated in waste treatment plants was evaluated in 13 representative regions of the world. In addition, the sensitivity of PHA production costs toward current biotechnological limitations and commodity prices was evaluated. The geographical analysis showed a high net present value (NPV20) variability around the world (from -7.17 to +16.27 M€). Countries with the lowest NPV20 also exhibited the lowest PHA production costs (4.1 €·kg-1 PHA), which suggested that biopolymer production represents an alternative biogas valorization pathway in regions where CHP is not economically viable. In countries with high energy prices, the use of biogas surplus from anaerobic waste treatment for PHA production enhanced the economic performance and mitigated the electric market dependence of current CHP plants. CH4 elimination capacity in bioreactors and PHA accumulation yield in bacterial cells were identified as the main biotechnological bottlenecks toward production of biopolymers competitive in price (0.2-1.7 €·kg-1 PHA) with their oil-based counterparts. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","biogas valorization; biopolymers; geographical analysis; heat and power cogeneration (CHP); methanotrophic bacteria; poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs); sensitivity analysis; sustainability","Biogas; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Biotechnology; Cogeneration plants; Geographical regions; Petroleum industry; Waste treatment; Anaerobic waste treatments; Comparative evaluations; Economic performance; Geographical analysis; Geographical locations; Methanotrophic bacteria; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Waste treatment plant; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085859137

We established a stratigraphic sequence of thirteen 10 cm thick layers spanning the period c. 2370 BP to c. 580 BP and grouped these layers into three cultural components. According to this region's climate, with rain and snow concentrated in winter and dry summers, our data suggest that these components are contemporary with three climatic periods. A dry period indicated by high values of δ18Oshell, δ13Cshell and Sr/Ca ratio (Mn/Ca ratio does not show any significant trend), in the Lower component is associated with brief incursions of hunter-gatherers from the eastern steppe. In the Middle component, low δ18Oshell, δ13Cshell and Sr/Ca ratios, suggest a humid climate with increased supply of meteoric and/or melt-water along with terrestrial plants organic matter and soil carbonates to the river. According to the archaeological evidence, in this period, hunter gatherers from the Pacific coast and forest started to colonize the area across the Andes cordillera. At the beginning of the Upper component, which is mostly contemporary with the expression of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), the proxies are not totally coincident but a tendency to progressively drier conditions could be inferred. Except for layer 4 for δ18Oshell and layer 5 for Sr/Ca ratio, δ18Oshell, δ13Cshell and Sr/Ca ratio show consistently high levels in the Upper than in the Middle component. In layer 5, δ18Oshell and δ13Cshell are elevated with respect to the Middle component while Sr/Ca ratio remains low. In layer 4, δ13Cshell and Sr/Ca ratio are high while δ18Oshell shows a negative peak. In layers 3 to 1, δ18Oshell, δ13Cshell and Sr/Ca ratio remain at high levels, indicating an arid-warm climate with high aquatic plant productivity, in coincidence with the expression of the MCA reported for this region in a partially contemporaneous period (1080–1250 AD). At this time, the occupation of the site by groups of the same origin as those present in the Middle component became permanent. Extensive and intensive use of local resources in this period can be inferred from the quality and quantity of artifacts recovered. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Archaeology; Freshwater bivalves; Palaeoenvironment; Patagonia; Stable isotopes; Trace elements","archaeological evidence; bivalve; carbon isotope; climate variation; human settlement; manganese; oxygen isotope; paleoenvironment; reconstruction; shell; stable isotope; strontium; trace element; Argentina; Patagonia; Bivalvia; Diplodon chilensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081582718

China's power sector is of global importance, accounting for ∼25% of global electricity production in 2015. The carbon intensity of China's electricity is still much higher than the global average, but the country has made important strides toward a low-carbon transition based on two main pillars: improvement of energy efficiency and decreasing the share of fossil fuels. By applying a decoupling indicator, our study shows that 21 provinces achieved a ""relative decoupling"" of carbon emissions and electricity production and the remaining nine provinces achieved ""absolute decoupling"" between 2005 and 2015. We updated China's emission factors based on the most recent data by also considering the quality of imported coal and compared our results with the widely used Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change coefficients to show the sensitivity of results and the potential error.

This paper evaluated the marginal land that could be used to grow sugarcane in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Based on the meteorological data from 2009 to 2017 in this region and field observations from sugarcane plantations, the sensitivity of the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) model parameters was analyzed by an extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, and the APSIM model was validated for sugarcane phenology and yields. During the process of model validation, the value of the determination coefficient R2 of the observed and simulated values was between 0.76 and 0.91, and the consistency index D was between 0.91 and 0.97, indicating a good fit. On this basis, the APSIM sugarcane model was used to simulate the sugarcane production potential of the marginal land on a surface scale, and the distribution pattern of sugarcane production potential in the marginal land was obtained. The simulation results showed that if sugarcane was planted as an energy crop on the marginal land in Guangxi, it would likely yield approximately 42,522.05 × 104 t of cane stalks per year. It was estimated that the sugarcane grown on the marginal land plus 50% of the sugarcane grown on the cropland would be sufficient to produce approximately 3847.37 × 104 t of ethanol fuel. After meeting the demands for vehicle ethanol fuel in Guangxi, 3808.14 × 104 t of ethanol fuel would remain and could be exported to the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). © 2020 by the authors.

The computer code was incorrect by a factor of -2, which caused an overestimation of its magnitude. The correct isosurface maps are reported here for the collective threshold 0.031 a.u., which was determined via some preliminary tests. This value overrides the 0.5 a.u. value in the published article. Although the shapes of the isosurfaces are somewhat different from those in the published article, the general conclusions arrived at previously regarding the reliability of the anisotropy of the vorticity tensor as a criterion of magnetotropicity are confirmed.

A domain of enhanced anisotropy of the vorticity tensor is observed in Fig. 6 about the centre of the cyclopropane molecule, whereas the hollow regions appearing in the isosurface, in the proximity of the midpoint of C C bonds, confirm the absence of s-diatropicity.The Royal Society of Chemistry apologises for these errors and any consequent inconvenience to authors and readers.

In the literature, most of research has focused on the removal of carbon dioxide from power plants, particularly those fed with coal, which account for higher amounts of CO2 emissions if compared with those fed with natural gas. CCSU in other non-power sectors is still not fully considered, while its importance in mitigating the environmental impact of industrial activities is equivalent to that of power plants. In the field of hydrogen production, treatment of gaseous streams to remove carbon dioxide is performed for producing a stream of almost pure H2 starting from syngas and for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, so that CO2 removal units can be part of different sections of the plant. In this work, a state-of-the-art steam-methane-reforming (SMR) plant for the production of 100,000 Nm3/h of hydrogen has been considered. Hydrogen is produced from syngas by employing the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, and the exiting tail gas is fed to the burners of the SMR unit, after removal of carbon dioxide. This work focuses on the design of the units for the treatment of the PSA tail gas by employing an aqueous solution of methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Simulations have been performed with the commercial process simulator ASPEN Plus®, customized by the GASP group of Politecnico di Milano for best representing both the thermodynamics of the system and the mass transfer with reaction. For the scheme composed of the absorber and the regenerator, several column configurations have been considered, and the optimal solution, which minimizes the energy requirements of the plant, has been selected. © Copyright © 2020 Pellegrini, De Guido and Moioli.","CCS; CO2; hydrogen plant; MDEA; PSA tail gas; SMR","Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Gas plants; Global warming; Mass transfer; Natural gasoline plants; Power plants; Steam reforming; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Carbon dioxide emissions; Commercial process simulators; Energy requirements; Hydrogen production plant; Industrial activities; Methyldiethanolamine; Optimal solutions; Pressure swing adsorption technologies; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086139679

Simplifying, landfills can cause local impacts with odor emissions and global impacts with GHGs. This work focuses on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and methane (CH4) emissions, with the aim of studying how it is possible to reduce their impacts by means of biofiltration systems. Both field and laboratory investigations have been carried out in Casa Rota Landfill (Tuscany, Italy). In the field trials, four pilot-scale biocovers made of compost from a source-selected organic fraction (SS compost), compost from a mechanical biological treatment plant-the residual fractions of the MSW, a mixed compost (SS-MSW compost) and sand were monitored in the daily cover area of the landfill, where high emissions were detected. Results showed that high CH4 and H2S emissions reductions occurred in the mixed SS-MSW compost plot, given a maximum methane oxidation efficiency of greater than 98% and an average oxidation efficiency of about 75%. To assess the specific oxidation rate, laboratory tests using SS-MSW compost sampled from the biocovers were done. © 2020 by the authors.","Biocovers; Biofiltration systems; Greenhouse gases emissions mitigation; Landfill odor mitigation; Microbial methane oxidation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086097481

Herein, we report a novel fluorescent material of Mn4+ ions doped Ba2LaNbO6 (BLN:Mn4+) with nanorod-like morphology for latent fingerprint detection as well as plant growth light-emitting diodes (LEDs) through a facile citric acid-assisted sol-gel route. The crystallization, elemental composition and oxidation states present in the BLN:Mn4+ nanophosphors are confirmed by the X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The photoluminescence spectra reveal a promising red emission band at 685 nm wavelength region under both 351 and 510 nm excitations, which is the required far-red emission for phototropism in plants. Furthermore, the optimized BLN:0.25Mn4+ nanophosphors exhibited all the features required for three levels of latent fingerprint detection on various nonporous surfaces under 365 nm illumination. The fluctuation of the red value on pixel profile confirms the good affinity of BLN:0.25Mn4+ nanophosphors with the fingerprint ridges. Because of their excellent luminescent properties and brilliant performance in the latent fingerprint detection process, the synthesized BLN:Mn4+ nanophosphors can be considered as a promising fluorescent material for the fabrication of plant growth LEDs and latent fingerprint applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Far-red emission; Latent fingerprints; Nanorod-like particles; Plant growth LEDs; Sol-gel technique","Barium compounds; Boron compounds; Fluorescence; Forensic science; Lanthanum compounds; Light emitting diodes; Manganese compounds; Nanorods; Niobium compounds; Optical properties; Palmprint recognition; Photoluminescence; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Elemental compositions; Fluorescent materials; Latent fingerprint; Narrow emission bands; Photoluminescence spectrum; Plant growth; Red emissions; Sol-gel technique; Nitrogen compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077575102

The sediment cleanup remedy at this site aims to enhance the sorption capacity of native sediments in the lake to reduce the exposure of bioaccumulative pollutants that currently contribute to fish consumption advisories in the lake. In November 2013, approximately 36 t of AC was applied to the lake over a 2-week period. Posttreatment sampling indicated an average AC concentration of 4.3% by dry weight in surface sediments. The primary monitoring was performed immediately prior to AC application and 1 and 3 years following application. Sediment porewater and surface water measurement using passive samplers showed reductions of 60%-80% of total freely dissolved polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and both were reduced to below the Delaware Human Health Water Quality Criteria. Fish tissue analysis of resident fish samples collected before and 3-5 years after treatment showed reductions of approximately 70% on a lipid-normalized basis and agree with modeled predictions. In contrast, two migratory species caught in the lake showed limited changes in PCB concentrations, likely reflecting greater regional exposure while these fish migrated beyond the lake. Overall, the project demonstrates AC amendment as a viable and effective sediment remediation technology. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Biochemistry; Fish; Lakes; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Remediation; Sediments; Water quality; Full-scale applications; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Remediation projects; Sediment porewater; Sediment remediation; Sorption capacities; Water measurements; Water quality criteria; Lake pollution; activated carbon; bioavailability; dissolved matter; elemental carbon; lake pollution; PCB; pollutant source; porewater; surface water; water quality; Delaware; Dover [Delaware]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081533716

The research was carried out on a niche of the topic, namely on the carbon footprint of public buildings. The concept of a sustainable university is new and insufficiently explored, and as part of the environmental metabolism, it influences anthropic sustainability in a directly proportional manner. This indicator's monitoring systems reveal how vulnerable humanity is in front of the latency of an unprecedented and inevitable environmental catastrophe. The ecological effects may be mitigated by the academic community through green urban design. The ecological performance can be expressed in an economically efficient manner, which can, at the same time, create a precious channel of communication within the entire academic community though volunteering for sustainability. Moreover, this research has identified several solutions for optimizing the carbon footprint, which do not hinder the necessary economic development. Within the current context, when most economic activities are leading to ecological collapse, sustainability should be reprioritized with the help of the academic society, through the examples offered by applied research. The premises of this research were represented by bibliometric analyses and the results obtained have proven its importance, as well as the importance of certain scenarios involving solutions for improving the metabolism of nature. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Ecological collapse; Green vertical facades; Sustainability; Sustainable university","bibliography; carbon footprint; communication; economic activity; economic development; environmental issue; greenhouse gas; mitigation; prioritization; research work; urban design; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084791355

Despite the high vulnerability of African countries to climate change, less work has examined climate change governance within African cities. This paper investigates the constraints and enablers to climate governance in two cities located in least-developed African economies (Karonga, Malawi, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania). It does so by analysing the personal engagement of key urban decision-makers with climate change issues, along cognitive, affective and behavioural dimensions. Semi-structured interviews with a range of local government actors suggest that African cities in low-income economies are aware, concerned and motivated to act on climate change issues. The ability for large African cities to act seems to be reliant in large part on connections to international networks that provide various resources; smaller cities seem to collaborate more effectively at the ‘within the city’ scale to overcome constraints to climate change governance. The findings point to the potential for positive urban governance of climate change in developing country cities, including small cities, and pave the way for further emphasis to be placed on using the concept of engagement to deepen understanding of urban climate change governance. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adaptation; Africa; cities; climate change; climate change engagement; developing countries; local government; urban governance","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; developing world; governance approach; local participation; urban area; urban climate; urban economy; vulnerability; Dar es Salaam [Tanzania]; Karonga; Malawi; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068238333

During the last decade, soil erosion indicators have been included in monitoring the performance of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study comes five years after the assessment of soil loss by water erosion in the EU [Environmental science &amp; policy 54, 438-447 (2015)], where a soil erosion modelling baseline for 2010 was developed. Here, we present an update of the EU assessment of soil loss by water erosion for the year 2016. The estimated long-term average erosion rate decreased by 0.4% between 2010 and 2016. This small decrease of soil loss was due to a limited increase of applied soil conservation practices and land cover change observed at the EU level. The modelling results suggest that, currently, ca. 25% of the EU land has erosion rates higher than the recommended sustainable threshold (2 t ha-1 yr-1) and more than 6% of agricultural lands suffer from severe erosion (11 t ha-1 yr-1). The results suggest that a more incisive set of measures of soil conservation is needed to mitigate soil erosion across the EU. However, targeted measures are recommendable at regional and national level as soil erosion trends are diverse between countries which show heterogeneous application of conservation practices. © 2020 by the authors.","CAP; Indicators; Land degradation; Policy support; SDGs; Soil thematic strategy","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Environmental protection; Erosion; Soils; Sustainable development; Agricultural land; Common agricultural policy; Conservation practices; Environmental science; Land-cover change; Policy instruments; Soil erosion modelling; Soil Protection; Soil conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085244323

Smart Logistics distribution system is a comprehensive logistics system supported by advanced information technology, which aims to improve the operation efficiency of the logistics industry and reduce carbon emissions by optimizing resource allocation. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the effects of Smart Logistics policy (SLP) on China's carbon emissions. This paper used the binary choice model to investigate the main factors influencing the establishment of Smart Logistics in Chinese cities, and whether carbon emissions are the cause of the establishment of Smart Logistics. Secondly, it analyzed the effect of SLP on carbon emissions using a difference-in-differences (DID) model. The results reveal that freight volume, logistics employment, and total social retail are important factors determining whether a city should establish Smart Logistics or not. Additionally, the decision whether to establish Smart Logistics is an exogenous policy variable to carbon emissions. The implementation of SLP can restrain carbon emissions significantly, with a continuous impact in the second year. Based on the findings of this paper, a series of policy implications with respect to promote the development of Smart Logistics were proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Difference-in-differences model; Smart Logistics policy","carbon emission; employment; freight transport; logistics; optimization; resource allocation; traffic emission; transportation policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083286775

The performance of VTI-elastic FWI is significantly influenced by the model parameterization choice. Synthetic analysis based on specific field survey configuration is carried out to evaluate three different VTI-elastic model parameterizations. Interparameter trade-offs are quantified using the recently introduced interparameter contamination sensitivity kernel approach. Synthetic results suggest that neglecting anisotropy leads to inaccurate velocity estimations. For the conventional vertical velocity-Thomsen's parameter parameterization (i.e., vertical P-wave velocity, vertical S-wave velocity, Thomsen's parameters ϵ and ), a sequential inversion strategy is designed to reduce strong natural interparameter trade-offs. The model parameterizations of elastic-constant (c11, c13, c33, and c55) and velocity-based (vertical, horizontal, and normal move-out P-wave velocities and vertical S-wave velocity) models appear to suffer from fewer interparameter trade-offs, providing more reliable velocity and anisotropy models. Results derived from application of VTI-elastic FWI to the field W-VSP data set tend to support the synthetic conclusions. Multiparameter point spread functions are calculated to quantify the local interparameter trade-offs of the inverted models. The output inversion results are interpreted to provide valuable references regarding the target hydrocarbon reservoir. © 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","anisotropy; elastic; full-waveform inversion; multiparameter; vertical seismic profile","Acoustic wave velocity; Anisotropy; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Optical transfer function; Seismic prospecting; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shear waves; Wave propagation; Waveform analysis; Full-waveform inversion; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Model parameterization; Sensitivity kernels; Sequential inversion; Transversely isotropic medias; Vertical seismic profiles; Vertical symmetry axis; Parameterization; data inversion; elastic wave; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; model test; model validation; numerical model; P-wave; parameterization; seismic anisotropy; seismic velocity; vertical seismic profile; waveform analysis; Canada",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091258208

Despite the publication of a number of reports evaluating the performance of the processes, no study on the estimation of the global CO2 reduction potential by CO2 mineralization and utilization using alkaline solid wastes has been reported. Here, we estimate global CO2 mitigation potentials facilitated by CO2 mineralization and utilization as a result of accelerated carbonation using various types of alkaline solid wastes in different regions of the world. We find that a substantial amount of CO2 (that is, 4.02 Gt per year) could be directly fixed and indirectly avoided by CO2 mineralization and utilization, corresponding to a reduction in global anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 12.5%. In particular, China exhibits the greatest potential worldwide to implement CO2 mineralization and utilization, where it would account for a notable reduction of up to 19.2% of China’s annual total emissions. Our study reveals that CO2 mineralization and utilization using alkaline solid wastes should be regarded as one of the essential green technologies in the portfolio of strategic global CO2 mitigation. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Solid wastes; Waste utilization; Accelerated carbonation; Alkaline solid wastes; CO2 emissions; CO2 mitigation; CO2 reduction; Green technology; Potential carbon reductions; Total emissions; Mineralogy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081577667

By considering the regional differences to investigate this aim, the Theil index and Kaya factor used to analysis the provincial inequality in CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and identify the driving factor. Using the Theil approach helps us to find out the inequality trend in CO2 emissions and energy consumption and also inequality across different provinces. In that way, the Kaya identity applied to analyze the factor behind the inequality in CO2 emissions. The empirical result shows some points, primary, according to the criteria and weights in the grouping methodologies, the GDP, due to the lower level of contribution in within-group inequality, is better than the population. Further, by assessing the inequality in the consumption of different forms of energy and CO2emissions across the provinces, most of the inequality was related to within-group, and the Theil trends are decreasing in gas and electricity; this trend is unclear and fluctuated in petroleum products and increase in CO2 emissions. Secondly, the first and second phases of subsidizing targeting have reduced the consumption and inequality of petroleum products and CO2emissions in the short term. Still, the inequality in CO2 emissions continues to increase recently. Thirdly, the national inequality in CO2emission mainly attributed to energy factors across provinces, and an increase in the energy inequalities helps to explain the CO2 inequality increase. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; CO2; Inequality; Iran; Kaya; Theil","Agriculture; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Agriculture sectors; Fossil energy consumption; Inequality; Iran; Kaya; Level of contributions; Regional differences; Theil; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; petroleum derivative; agricultural development; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; consumption behavior; emission inventory; energy use; Gross Domestic Product; agricultural waste; Article; carbon footprint; electricity; energy balance; energy consumption; factor analysis; gas; gross national product; Iran; methodology; priority journal; rural area; standardization; trend study; Iran; Torreya nucifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078984918

Similarly important is understanding how environmental changes and trophic interactions shape future trajectories of key species with potential implications for ecosystem state and service provision. We here present a statistical modeling framework to assess and quantify cumulative effects on the long-term dynamics of the copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes, a key species in the Baltic Sea. Our model integrates linear and non-linear responses to changes in life stage density, climate and predation pressure as well as stochastic processes. We use the integrated life cycle model to simulate copepod dynamics under a combination of stressor scenarios and to identify conditions under which population responses are potentially mitigated or magnified. Our novel modeling approach reliably captures the historical P. acuspes population dynamics and allows us to identify females in spring and younger copepodites in summer as stages most sensitive to direct and indirect effects of the main environmental stressors, salinity and temperature. Our model simulations furthermore demonstrate that population responses to stressors are dampened through density effects. Multiple stressor interactions were mostly additive except when acting on the same life stage. Here, negative synergistic and positive dampening effects lead to a lower total population size than expected under additive interactions. As a consequence, we found that a favorable increase of oxygen and phosphate conditions together with a reduction in predation pressure by 50% each could counteract the negative effect of a 25% decrease in salinity by only 6%. Ultimately, our simulations suggest that P. acuspes will most certainly decline under a potential freshening of the Baltic Sea and increasing temperatures, which is conditional on the extent of the assumed climate change. Also the planned nutrient reduction strategy and fishery management plan will not necessarily benefit the temporal development of P. acuspes. Moving forward, there is a growing opportunity for using population modeling in cumulative effects assessments. Our modeling framework can help here as simple tool for species with a discrete life cycle to explore stressor interactions and the safe operating space under future climate change. © Copyright © 2020 Otto, Niiranen, Blenckner, Tomczak, Müller-Karulis, Rubene and Möllmann.","Baltic Sea; cumulative and cascading effects; density dependence; model simulations; polynomial regression; Pseudocalanus acuspes; stochastic life cycle model; vulnerable life stage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085599412

Public views on climate policy, renewable energy, and low-carbon technologies are explored using focus groups we conducted in Aberdeen, Peterhead, and Edinburgh and citizens' juries in Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The deliberative processes reveal strong public support for continued diversification of Scotland's energy portfolio to include more renewable energy sources, particularly at the local level. We also found support for increased state involvement in the energy sector. Pro-renewables sentiments and skepticism of industry pervade even in Aberdeen, the main oil and gas hub, alongside support for further exploration of low-carbon emission technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) that retain the ability to continue to use fossil fuels.

In addition to determining particulate number size distributions, it is crucial to have a methodology to determine size distribution of elemental concentrations down to the ultrafine size fraction. The present study shows capabilities for combination of May-type cascade impactor sampling and laboratory total-reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis on ambient aerosol samples taken in urban areas of Budapest (Hungary) and Cassino (Italy). In addition, results for a sample collected in Budapest during the fireworks provided for the Hungarian National Day are discussed. The combined novel method is suitable for determining size distributions for major and trace elemental concentrations form ultrafine to coarse particles (70 nm up to 10 μm) in seven size fractions. Moreover, short sampling times (1–4 h) are sufficient for reaching detection limits in the range of 100 pg/m3 for transition metals. The size and time resolution were found to be optimal for identifying pollution episodes with elevated elemental concentrations. The in-the-field analytical applicability of the proposed method for major and trace elements is demonstrated by comparison to elemental size distributions resulted from destructive analytical techniques. © 2020 The Authors","Atmospheric aerosols; Cascade impactor; Elemental size distribution; TXRF; Ultrafine particles","Atmospheric aerosols; Electromagnetic wave reflection; Fluorescence; Meteorological instruments; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Size distribution; Trace analysis; Trace elements; Transition metals; X rays; Cascade impactors; Elemental concentrations; Major and trace elements; Number size distribution; Particulate air pollution; Total reflection x-ray fluorescence analysis; TXRF; Ultrafine particle; Particle size analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082750597

As new innovations in engine and emissions technology have been progressively introduced to meet lower emissions targets, the impact of gradual deterioration of hardware has become more challenging to identify and quantify in the repair industry. When a pioneering emissions control programme utilising remote sensing to detect high emitting gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles was to be introduced in Hong Kong, it became apparent the repair industry needed specialised training to assist with identifying the types of failures which would lead to high vehicle emissions. To identify the impact of hardware deterioration and failures, a Toyota Crown Comfort LPG taxi was used to demonstrate simulated failures of engine hardware systems to measure their impact on emissions, fuel consumption and drivability using a chassis dynamometer. This novel study simulated a broad range of deterioration and failures covering the intake, fuel supply, ignition, and exhaust systems. The results of the study showed significant THC and CO increases of up to 317% (0.604 g/km) and 782% (5.351 g/km) respectively for a simulated oxygen sensor high voltage fault and a sticky mixture control valve. The largest increase in NOx emissions was for restricted main fuel supply in the LPG vapouriser, producing an increase of 282% (1.41 g/km). Fuel consumption varied with increases of up to 15.5%. Drivability was impacted with poor idle from a number of faults and especially by a worn throttlebody which produced rough acceleration characteristics as well. This study clearly highlights the importance of having properly maintained emissions and engine hardware systems to achieve optimal fuel economy and compliant emissions levels, which could be reproduced in other regions for prescribed emissions regulation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions; Fault simulation; High emitting vehicles; Inspection and maintenance; Training programmes","Deterioration; Dynamometers; Engines; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Particulate emissions; Petroleum industry; Remote sensing; Repair; Taxicabs; Vehicle performance; Chassis dynamometers; Emissions control systems; Emissions regulations; Fault simulation; High emitting vehicles; Inspection and maintenance; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Training programmes; Liquefied petroleum gas; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; liquefied petroleum gas; nitric oxide; engine; fuel consumption; hardware; liquefied petroleum gas; maintenance; performance assessment; simulation; taxi transport; traffic emission; training; acceleration; air pollution control; Article; chassis dynamometer; controlled study; drivability; electric potential; energy resource; engine fault; exhaust gas; fuel economy; liquefied petroleum gas taxi; motor vehicle; priority journal; simulation; traffic and transport; vehicle performance; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078991612

A total of 1833 journal articles are revealed with focus on carbon footprint in the field of construction in general, of which only 115 (6% of the total) studies have a macro-level analysis of the construction sector, providing a more holistic overview of the construction sector from various aspects. These macro-level studies were reviewed and classified based on journal, country, year, method, scope of analysis, type of construction, and period. The findings showed that approximately 60% of these studies focus on the Chinese construction industry and the majority of studies analyzed national-level (75%) and city-level (18%) carbon footprints of construction. On the contrary, global-level analysis has a lower share, which accounted for only 6% of reviewed articles. The review showed that more than 20% of studies use the input-output analysis as the main methodological approach to quantify macro-level carbon emission from construction sector, which is followed by the process-based life cycle assessment with 10% share, where more bottom-up approaches are employed. There are only a handful of articles found in the literature using a hybrid life cycle assessment and global multiregional input-output analysis for carbon footprint accounting of construction. Furthermore, there is also no study found in the literature, which presented a comprehensive regional and global supply chain analysis of construction carbon footprints. The results revealed that the largest portion of carbon emissions stem from the regional and global supply chains of the construction industries. The authors concluded that carbon reduction policies should not only consider the limited regional impacts; however, it must take into account the role of indirect, complex and interconnected global supply chains of construction industries. © 2020","Carbon footprint; Construction industry; Global review; Global supply chain analysis; Multi-region input-output analysis","Construction industry; Emission control; Life cycle; Supply chains; Bottom up approach; Chinese construction industry; Construction sectors; Global supply chain; Input output analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Methodological approach; Supply chain analysis; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080119456

In order to increase its energy efficiency, TU Darmstadt applies a new cooling concept in the next generation of its high-performance computing data center “Lichtenberg II.” Instead of the current air-cooled servers with water-cooled rear doors at 17-24°C, the new data center will be equipped with direct hot-water cooling for the high-performance computer, supplying heat at a temperature of 45°C. The high-temperature waste heat is used for heating purposes on the university's campus Lichtwiese. For waste heat utilization, two concepts are presented, either integrating the heat in the return line of the district heating network or using it locally in buildings located near the data center. Reductions in CO2 emission and annuity are generated both by decreased compression cooling demand for the data center and by decreased heat generation due to waste heat utilization. Depending on the scenario, a total of 20%-50% of the waste heat emitted by the high-performance computer can be used for heating purposes, while the remaining heat is dissipated efficiently via free cooling without additional energy demand for mechanical chillers. CO2 emission can be decreased by up to 720 (Formula presented.), representing a reduction of about 4% of the total emission at campus Lichtwiese.

Nothing like the conscious system-wide change required has been attempted before. Rapid policy decisions risk embedding existing injustices or creating new ones unless steps are taken to ameliorate those risks. We present a model that takes a whole-system view of the UK spatial economy, examining how increasing distance costs (e.g. through fuel tax hikes) have unequal impacts on regions and sectors. The model establishes an important carbon transition policy principle: change in spatial flows of internal trade, which are certain to occur rapidly during transition, have measurable energy justice implications. Peripheral economic regions, in rural and coastal areas and many city outskirts are most vulnerable, as are petrochemical, agricultural and connected sectors. Policy must go beyond identifying places and sectors most affected: it is the connections between them that matter most. The “push” of spatially aware fiscal policy needs to be combined with the “pull” of targeted interventions designed to promote low-carbon intermediate connections.

This study assesses the effects of four land use types typical for northern Ethiopia (forests, exclosures, grazing lands and intensively cultivated croplands) on various soil health indicators. We quantified and compared microbial biomass carbon (MBC), water extractable organic carbon (WOC), metabolic quotient (qCO2), substrate use efficiency (SUE) and dynamics of 14C-labelled glucose added to soil. Irrespective of the land use, MBC but not SUE decreased 2- to 8-fold with increasing depth, demonstrating the C limitation of subsoil microbial communities under all land use forms. Sandy soils, however, which permit seepage and leaching of WOC into lower layers and promote subsoil microbial communities, adapted to frequent input of easily accessible C substrates. Significantly higher qCO2 were recorded in subsoils compared to topsoils, especially in croplands with low MBC. In croplands, high glucose-14C incorporation (≈20%) into their low microbial biomass indicates a high SUE and reflects a better nutrient supply of these microbial communities. Mineralization of up to 95% of 14C-labeled glucose in topsoils of forest and grazing lands was higher than in croplands, and exclosures never reached the level of natural ecosystems. This demonstrates that 6–10 years of exclosure establishment does not result in soil microbial communities and soil C dynamics resembling those of natural forests. Our study demonstrates that land use can negatively affect the ecological performance of microbial communities and that these impacts are more severe in sandy than in clayey soils. Mitigation strategies such as minimum tillage or residue retention in intensively cultivated croplands can increase microbial abundance and activity and help ensure environmental sustainability and mitigation of climate change. Nonetheless, such measures need to be carefully accompanied by monitoring indicators of soil health to confirm the sustainability of the chosen mitigation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Land use systems; Metabolic quotient; Microbial biomass carbon; Sub-Saharan Africa; Substrate mineralization; Substrate use efficiency","Biomass; Climate change; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Forestry; Glucose; Health; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Mineralogy; Organic carbon; Soils; Substrates; Sustainable development; Land-use systems; Metabolic quotient; Microbial biomass carbon; Sub-saharan africa; Use efficiency; Land use; abundance; agricultural intensification; biomass; glucose; grazing; land use change; microbial community; soil carbon; substrate; sustainability; tillage; topsoil; Ethiopia; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078101473

Through a social enterprise, selected villagers from Khechare, Maharashtra convert local wood and plant matter into a carbonaceous material (Village carbon, “VC”) which to date has been used for sale as deodorisers in urban areas. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of VC material for bacterial filtering and arsenic adsorption. BET surface area analysis determined that VC is mesoporous with a surface area of around 95 m2 g−1. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that much of the original fibrous features and a wide range of elements from the local environment remain post carbonisation. Bacterial filtering studies using E. coli as model bacteriological contaminant have been demonstrated. Naturally relevant levels of bacteria (110 CFU/100 mL E. coli) were removed from water using a 15 g VC plug while &gt;99%–97% removal of highly contaminated (7×106 CFU/100 mL E. coli) were possible to be removed, demonstrating the capacity of the VC material for bacteria filtering. Adsorption of As(V) and As(III) was achieved using VC, which could reduce 200 μg L−1 As(III) to below 50 μg L−1 concentration, and 150 μg L−1 As(V) to 90 μg L−1 concentration. The carbon generated from waste agricultural material used here is an effective material for water purification on site. While its performance compared to other literature carbonaceous materials may be slightly lower, it has great potential for use due to its derivation from available waste products. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Developing countries; Heavy metals; Sustainable development; Water disinfection; Water treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081697050

Whereas most carbon assimilation studies have mainly focused on natural forests, understanding the spatial distribution of carbon in commercial forests is central to determining their role in the global carbon cycle. Forest soils are the largest carbon reservoir; hence soils under commercial forests could store a significant amount of carbon. However, the variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) within forest landscapes is still poorly understood. Due to limitations encountered in traditional systems of SOC determination, especially at large spatial extents, remote sensing approaches have recently emerged as a suitable option in mapping soil characteristics. Therefore, this study aimed at predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in commercial forests using Landsat 8 data. Eighty-one soil samples were processed for SOC concentration and fifteen Landsat 8 derived variables, including vegetation indices and bands were used as predictors to SOC variability. The random forest (RF) was adopted for variable selection and regression method for SOC prediction. Variable selection was done using RF backward elimination to derive three best subset predictors and improve prediction accuracy. These variables were then used to build the RF final model for SOC prediction. The RF model yielded good accuracies with root mean square error of prediction (RMSE) of 0.704 t/ha (16.50% of measured mean SOC) and 10-fold cross-validation of 0.729 t/ha (17.09% of measured mean SOC). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Landsat 8 bands and derived vegetation indices and RF algorithm in predicting SOC stocks in commercial forests.

Riparian tree cover moderates stream temperature by intercepting solar radiation, a significant heat source in affected systems. However, many aspects of hydromorphological state can shape the realised temperature regime of a river and these elements may interact with riparian tree cover. This study investigated the thermal buffering effect of tree cover on rivers with varying degrees of hydromorphological alteration for example, modified channel morphology, substrate and floodplain connectivity. Results indicated that the effectiveness of tree cover as a stream temperature management tool can change across systems depending on the extent of hydromorphological alteration. Greater tree cover had a pronounced cooling effect on stream temperature in altered study sites, but temperatures were typically still lower in more natural (less disturbed) sites, irrespective of the extent of tree cover. This finding suggests a hydromorphological threshold at which the effectiveness of riparian tree cover as a temperature management tool diminishes. Climate proofing in some rivers may thus require provision of both riparian tree cover and functioning hydromorphological processes to replicate more natural stream temperature dynamics. This perspective also suggests that more pristine rivers will retain greater resistance to projected temperature disturbance associated with a warming climate because of their inherent thermal buffering capacity. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","channelization; climate change proofing; cold-water species; hydromorphology; riparian buffers; stream temperature management","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Forestry; Morphology; channelization; Cold water species; hydromorphology; Riparian buffers; Stream temperatures; Rivers; adaptation; buffering; channel morphology; climate change; cold water; forest cover; riparian forest; river management; water temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081743566

Assessing the amount of coconut husk disposed of in a region, and the potential of this material for producing other products, will not only improve the environment, but will also contribute to the economic development and health of the population. Based on a structured face-to-face survey in a representative sample of seven municipalities in the southern coastal region of Bahia, this study identifies and maps the main points of consumption where the disposal of green coconut shells occurs, with an evaluation of the uncertainty of the data. The results show that the region annually wastes the equivalent of 1.7 M shell units with a standard uncertainty (u) of 1.2 k, and the amount of fibers that could be extracted for the manufacture of products is 632 t (u = 59 t). The use of the green coconut shells wasted in this region to create other products would lead to an annual reduction in emissions of between 10.2 t and 20.9 t of CH4. A survey conducted over the past ten years of the general framework for possible uses of the shells, and an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT), have shown that green coconut shells have potential for use in the production of gardening products, handicrafts, and briquettes. Valuation based on gardening products reveals that the region could produce 34 M (u = 47 k) units of biodegradable tubes for planting seedlings annually and could therefore generate a gross annual revenue of R$ 170 000 (u = 2 350). With regards to briquettes, considering only the municipality of Ilhéus, production could generate a gross value between R$ 2 190 and R$ 3 650 per month. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Application of possibilities; Green coconut shell; Quantification; Standard uncertainty; Waste","Briquets; Employment; Seed; Surveys; Waste disposal; Wastes; Annual revenue; Coastal regions; Coconut shells; Economic development; Opportunities and threat (SWOT); Quantification; Representative sample; Standard uncertainty; Shells (structures)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078955604

However, climate change including its impacts might not be understandable by public in Indonesia. This is because climate change is not a crucial issue in this developing country. Education can play important roles in supporting national policies in reducing GHG in Indonesia by communicating climate change and in raising environmental awareness among people including students in schools. This study aims to determine high school students' perceptions about climate change, to provide insights for curriculum planning to combat climate change. Furthermore, this study can also provide some strategies to the government changes by improving formal education in combating climate change. This study is conducted in the 6 selected high schools in Samboja district, Kutai Kartanegara regency, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia. Data collection was conducted from February to March 2017. Primary data is collected by using questionnaires, which are distributed to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade students in each selected high schools. In total there are 360 students participating in this study. Results shows that majority of students in this study have heard about climate change, however their answer are inconsistent. This indicates that these students do not fully understand about climate change. Furthermore, students also do not know about the main causes of climate change. In conclusion, climate change issues need to be elaborated in science curriculum. It is suggested that the government should introduce policies in education sectors to inform about climate change. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curricula; Developing countries; Greenhouse gases; Students; Surveys; Data collection; Education sectors; Environmental awareness; Formal education; Greenhouse gases (GHG); High school students; National policies; Science curriculum; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086566821

However, the country experiences much smaller adverse impacts (e.g., real GDP declines by 1.78%) when all industries participate in the emissions trading market. In either case of the ETS design, the coal mining, manufacturing, transportation, and electricity sectors are highly adversely affected; however, the crude oil and natural gas extraction sectors would experience expansion in their production levels due to substitutions for coal.

Damage due to sea level rise (SLR) is one of the serious problems anticipated and caused by climate change. In this study, we assess the global economic impact of inundation due to SLR by using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that incorporates detailed coastal damage information. The scenario analysis considers multiple general circulation models, socioeconomic assumptions, and stringency of climate change mitigation measures. We found that the global household consumption loss proportion will be 0.045%, with a range of 0.0270.066%, in 2100. Socioeconomic assumptions cause a difference in the loss proportion of up to 0.035% without greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation, the so-called baseline scenarios. The range of the loss proportion among GHG emission scenarios is smaller than the differences among the socioeconomic assumptions. We also observed large regional variations and, in particular, the consumption losses in low-income countries are, relatively speaking, larger than those in high-income countries. These results indicate that, even if we succeed in stabilizing the global mean temperature increase below 2 °C, economic losses caused by SLR will inevitably happen to some extent, which may imply that keeping the global mean temperature increase below 1.5 °C would be worthwhile to consider. © 2020 by the authors.","CGE model; Climate change; RCP/SSP scenario; Sea level rise","climate change; coastal zone; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic activity; greenhouse gas; macroeconomics; scenario analysis; sea level change; socioeconomic impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085323640

The carbonization was done in an electric muffle furnace with different final temperature (400/450 °C) and total time (40 min/2 h, 4 h, 6 h). The quantitative changes in anatomy of charcoal samples was not directly related to carbonization programs with respect to particular features of each species. Species are best distinguished for the NIR spectra in the region from 4000 to 5000 cm−1. In the analysis by species, charcoal produced at 450 °C—4 h were more distinct in comparison to other programs that resulted in mixed samples. Final temperature influenced more than total process time in species distinction and the use of NIR is reinforced as a potential tool to discriminate species submitted to different carbonization processes.

In fact, pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages differ in the expression of serotonin receptors, with 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 expression restricted to M-CSF–primed monocyte-derived macrophages (M-MØ). 5-HT7 drives the acquisition of profibrotic and anti-inflammatory functions in M-MØ, whereas 5-HT2B prevents the degeneration of spinal cord mononuclear phagocytes and modulates motility of murine microglial processes. Because 5-HT2B mediates clinically relevant 5-HT–related pathologies (valvular heart disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension) and is an off target of anesthetics, antiparkinsonian drugs, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, we sought to determine the transcriptional consequences of 5-HT2B engagement in human macrophages, for which 5-HT2B signaling remains unknown. Assessment of the effects of specific agonists and antagonist revealed that 5-HT2B engagement modifies the cytokine and gene signature of anti-inflammatory M-MØ, upregulates the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) target genes, and stimulates the transcriptional activation of AhR. Moreover, we found that 5-HT dose dependently upregulates the expression of AhR target genes in M-MØ and that the 5-HT–mediated activation of AhR is 5-HT2B dependent because it is abrogated by the 5-HT2B–specific antagonist SB204741. Altogether, our results demonstrate the existence of a functional 5-HT/5-HT2B/AhR axis in human macrophages and indicate that 5-HT potentiates the activity of a transcription factor (AhR) that regulates immune responses and the biological responses to xenobiotics.

Pre-turbine selective catalytic system are used with marine two-stroke diesel engines to comply with International Maritime Organization Tier III. The system solution focuses on expanding the selective catalytic reduction operation range which is limited by fuel sulphur content by increasing exhaust temperature at low engine loads. The extended operation range is to be achieved while minimizing any fuel consumption penalties. Increasing the operation range brings improvements to emission levels during manoeuvring operations which are often carried out close to populated areas. It also provides flexibility by enabling emission reduction during slow steaming operations in which mitigating fuel consumption penalties is paramount. In addition to system evaluation in still water conditions, furthermore evaluations have been carried out taking into consideration the effect of waves on the system performance. Investigating the effect of operating in waves bring additional insight that is relevant for predicting performance in operational conditions. Analysis of the system solution found that improvements in selective catalytic reduction operation range can be achieved while also improving fuel consumption.

To understand the underlying mechanism, the Weather Research Forecast with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model is used to investigate the spatial and temporal O3 variations in Hangzhou from 24 August to 6 September 2016. The model is first successfully evaluated and validated for local and regional meteorological and chemical parameters by using the ground and upper-air level observed data. High ozone concentrations, temporally during most of the daytime emission control period and spatially from the surface to the top of the planetary boundary layer, are captured in Hangzhou and even the whole Yangtze River Delta region. Various atmospheric processes are further analyzed to determine the influential factors of local ozone formation through the integrated process rate method. Interesting horizontal and vertical advection circulations of O3 are observed during several short periods, and the effects of these processes are nearly canceled out. As a result, ozone pollution is mainly attributed to the local photochemical reactions that are not obviously influenced by the emission reduction measures. The ratio of reduction of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to that of NOx is a critical parameter that needs to be carefully considered for future alleviation of ozone formation. In addition, the vertical diffusion from the upper-air background O3 also plays an important role in shaping the surface ozone concentration. These results provide insight into urban O3 formation in Hangzhou and support the Model Intercomparison Study Asia Phase III (MICS-Asia Phase III). © Author(s) 2020.",,"atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; nitrogen oxides; ozone; spatial variation; temporal variation; urban pollution; volatile organic compound; China; Hangzhou; Yangtze Delta; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085314935

The ecological problems of the modern and prospective development of the energy complex of African countries are considered. For African countries the issue of ensuring reliable and environmentally friendly access to electricity for the population is extremely acute. It is shown, that the electricity demand for industry in Sub-Saharan Africa the most problematic region is growing on a very large scale. The construction of new large coal-fired thermal power plants in the required volumes will lead to serious environmental and climatic consequences. The study of regional data allowed us to conclude that PV solar systems are of priority importance for increasing people's access to electricity in rural SubSaharan Africa. Based on numerous materials from international energy structures the estimates and calculations of volumes of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of renewable energy sources as an alternative to carbon fuel are carried out. The study has shown that of particularly great importance for reducing CO2 emissions in Kenya is the development of geothermal energy. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Ecology; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Thermoelectric power plants; CO2 emissions; Coal fired thermal power plants; Ecological problem; Electricity demands; Energy structures; Renewable energies; Sub-saharan africa; Use of renewable energies; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085942177

The scientific objective of this study is providing a reliable source apportionment, which is mandatory for the application of effective mitigation actions. Particulate matter (PM) was collected for one year, simultaneously in a traffic site, in an urban background, and in a regional background site. While the use of two filter types (quartz and Teflon) allowed obtaining a comprehensive chemical characterization (elemental and organic carbon, ions, elements) by the application of different analytical techniques, the location of the three sampling sites allowed getting a better separation among local, urban, regional and transboundary sources. During shorter periods, the aerosol was also collected by means of a streaker sampler and PIXE (Particle Induced X-ray Emission) analysis of these samples allowed the assessment of hourly resolution elemental time trends. Positive matrix factorisation (PMF) identified seven main sources: traffic, biomass burning, secondary sulphate, secondary nitrates, urban dust, Saharan dust and marine aerosol. Traffic mass concentration contributions were found to be strong only at the traffic site (8 μg m-3, 33% of PM2.5). Biomass burning turned out to be an important PM2.5 source in Florence (4 μg m-3), with very similar weights in both city sites while at the regional background site its weight was negligible. Secondary sulphate is an important PM2.5 source on a regional scale, with comparable values in all three sites (3.5 μg m-3). On average, the contribution of the ""natural"" components (e.g., mineral dust and marine aerosols) to PM2.5 is moderate (1 μg m-3) except during Saharan dust intrusions where this contribution is higher (detected simultaneously in all three sites). High-time resolution data confirmed and reinforced these results. © 2020 by the authors.","Daily samples; Hourly samples; PM2.5; PMF; Source apportionment; Urban aerosols","Aerosols; Chemical analysis; Dust; Ion beams; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Sulfur compounds; Chemical characterization; Elemental and organic carbons; High-time resolution; Particle induced X-ray emission; Positive matrix factorisation; Saharan dust intrusions; Scientific objectives; Source apportionment; Urban growth; aerosol composition; biomass burning; concentration (composition); dust; identification method; particulate matter; point source; source apportionment; traffic emission; Firenze [Tuscany]; Florence [Firenze]; Italy; Tuscany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085726868

In Ghana—the world's second biggest cocoa producer—the cocoa sector is challenged by increasing global cocoa demand, climate change impacts, as well as mounting consumer pressure over cocoa's deforestation. Climate-smart cocoa (CSC) has emerged to address these challenges as well as to improve smallholder incomes. As with CSA more widely, there are concerns that CSC discourses will override the interests of cocoa smallholders, and lead to inequitable outcomes. To better understand if and how the implementation of CSC in Ghana can meet its lofty ambitions, we examine (1) the dominant CSC discourses as perceived by stakeholders, and their reflection in policy and practice, and (2) subsequent implications for cocoa smallholders through an equity lens. Through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders in Ghana's cocoa sector, we find overwhelming consensus for an ecological modernisation discourse with the promise of a “triple win” narrative that simultaneously stops deforestation, supports climate mitigation and adaptation, and increases smallholder livelihoods. Moreover, we find that implementing CSC on the ground has generally converged around “sustainable intensification” and private-sector-led partnerships that aspire to generate a “win-win” for environment and productivity objectives, but potentially at the expense of delivering equitable outcomes that serve smallholders' interests. We find that the success of CSC and the overly-simplistic sustainable intensification narrative is constrained by the lack of clear tree tenure rights, complexities around optimal shade trees levels, potential rebound effects regarding deforestation, and the risks of agrochemical-dependence. More positively, local governance mechanisms such as Ghana's Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) may give cocoa smallholders a stronger voice to shape policy. However, we caution that the discursive power of dominant private sector actors may risk side-lining equity which could prove detrimental to the long-term wellbeing of Ghana's ~800,000 cocoa smallholders. © Copyright © 2020 Nasser, Maguire-Rajpaul, Dumenu and Wong.","climate-smart agriculture; climate-smart cocoa; discourse analysis; equity; supply-chain initiatives; sustainable intensification; zero-deforestation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086372803

To study relationships between coarse roots and tree and stand variables, we destructively sampled twelve tanoak root systems in Humboldt County, California. To estimate belowground biomass, we summed measured biomass of the root ball and a subsample of lateral roots along with predicted biomass of unmeasured coarse roots. Tree size was the best linear predictor of belowground biomass and carbon, indicating that a 25-cm diameter tanoak, for example, stored 70 kg of biomass and 34 kg of carbon in its root system. Stand density was also influential: A doubling of stand density index reduced belowground carbon by 22% for the average tanoak. The mean root-toshoot ratio of 0.35 varied between 0.11 and 0.65, with larger tanoak at high stand densities allocating proportionally less biomass belowground than small open-grown tanoak. The findings highlight the importance of accounting for stand density effects, otherwise belowground carbon will be under predicted in low-density stands managed for tree health, vigor, and resistance to drought and wildfire, or overestimated in forests managed at high densities for high carbon sequestration. © 2020, Canadian Institute of Forestry.

Food markets, supplied through both domestic production and international trade, are governed by several risks emerging from unpredictable supply chain disruptions, volatility of commodity prices, along with other unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters. To mitigate the challenges threatening the stability of food systems, decision-making within the food sector should be enhanced and robust to accommodate any changes that might cause food shortages. Dynamic models, that can predict the behavior of food systems in order to avoid potential future knock-on effects and deficits, are incumbent to ensure the sustainable performance of food systems. This study proposes a dynamic decision-making scheme that simulates strategies of the perishable food market under different circumstances. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed and implemented using python MESA library for a case study in Qatar, illustrating the potential performance of tomato under three different scenarios to be considered, namely: (a) baseline scenario - aiming to reflect current production and market conditions; (b) water resource efficiency scenario - basing decisions on crop water requirement (CWR) depending on weather conditions; and (c) economic risk scenario - applying the concept of forward contracts to hedge against future uncertainties in crop prices. The findings of this study demonstrate that under the baseline conditions, a tomato crop can be supplied through a combination of domestic production and imports depending on the available inventories and prices imposed by exporters. The results obtained for the CWR scenario suggest the need for total reliance on imports in order to meet domestic demand, as there is potentially high-water loss, which amounts to an average of 4.9 Billion m3 per year, if tomato is grown locally. In contrast, the results from the forward contract scenario recommend a 57% dependency on local production in order to mitigate the effects of volatility in global food prices, which contributes to a 63% reduction in environmental emissions. Findings of this research provide insight into the factors that influence strategic decision making by the food sector to enhance its economic and environmental performances under diverse circumstances. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","crop water requirement; Food trade; Forward contracts; Nexus; Virtual water","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Costs; Crops; Disasters; Electronic trading; Environmental management; Financial markets; Food supply; Fruits; International trade; Simulation platform; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Water resources; Crop water requirements; Dynamic decision making; Economic and environmental performance; Forward contract; Nexus; Strategic decision making; Supply-chain disruptions; Virtual water; Risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078698899

Cocoa as the largest plantation crop in Indonesia is expected to be able to absorb CO2 gas emissions in the air due to its ability to absorb carbon. A carbon analysis study was carried out on cacao plantation to determine the level of carbon uptake in each cropping system in South Sulawesi. Hence, the results of the analysis can be a reference in climate change mitigation efforts. Three regencies, each with 3 districts were selected as study locations, namely East Luwu Regency (Burau, Wotu and Mumpangana Districts), Pinrang Regency (Patampanua, Batulappa and Lembang Districts), and Bantaeng Regency (Gantarangkeke, Tompobulu, and Eremerasa Districts). Carbon stored measurements was conducted using allometric formula. Measurements were carried out on 200 m2 observation plot. Results show that carbon sequestration levels were 33.19 tons C/Ha, 25.52 tons C/Ha, 32.07 tons C/Ha in East Luwu, Pinrang and Bantaeng regencies, respectively. The amount of carbon emissions absorbed in East Luwu Regency was 57.46 t/Ha, Pinrang Regency 67.12 t/Ha, and Bantaeng Regency 60.07 t/Ha. The CO2 content based on the composition of land cover in East Luwu Regency was 121.81 tons CO2/Ha, Pinrang Regency 93.69 tons CO2/Ha, and Bantaeng Regency 117.70 tons CO2/Ha. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Food supply; Forestry; Gas emissions; Vegetation; Carbon emissions; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stocks; Climate change mitigation; Cropping systems; Forest vegetation; Natural forests; Planting systems; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086466153

This transition has been forged by a mix of macroeconomic factors (recession and recovery); technological breakthroughs (horizontal drilling coupled with hydraulic fracturing; improvements in natural gas plant efficiency); clean energy policies at federal, state, and local levels of government; and private sector demands for carbon-free energy sources. These factors have combined to reduce carbon emissions from electric power generation substantially this century. In this article we examine the extent of this transition, its causes, as well as the distinct American institutional factors steering it, including energy and environmental federalism, electoral politics, and the political economy of clean energy policy enactment and resistance. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization","electricity generation; energy policy; energy transitions; United States","carbon emission; electoral system; electricity generation; electricity supply; environmental policy; federal system; political economy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086335026

The solar photovoltaic (SPV) plants are, hence, expected to play a noteworthy role to meet energy security and sustainability goals. Contemporary studies reveal substantial ecological concerns associated with installing the ground mounted SPV plants in urban locations. Further observations depict that aforementioned plants need additional land, transmission, and distribution infrastructures. Consequently, rooftop SPV plants are the best solution to produce energy in urban locations, owing to the availability of a large number of empty rooftop spaces with least capacity expenditure. The present article discusses the techno-economic and ecological aspects of a 50 kWp rooftop SPV plant installed at ICFAI University, Jaipur. The plant has produced around 64.149 MWh in the year 2017. The technical assessment focuses on the effects of the meteorological parameters upon energy generation factors. The annual average final yield, reference yield, capacity utilization factor, and performance ratio found to be 106.9 kWh/kWp/month, 149.7 kWh/kWp/month, 14.64 and 70%, respectively. The economic parameters like net present value, internal rate of return, profitability index, and payback period are computed with 0–50% subsidy rates, which supports the financial viability of the plant. The plant contributed significantly to reducing GHG emissions by mitigating 102 t CO2, 128 kg SO2, 268 kg NOx, and 7,033 kg ash in the year 2017 as evident from the ecological investigation. Statement of industrial relevance: Manufacturing industries are extremely power intensive, as they utilize a substantial amount of energy during the production process. The utilization of sustainable energy sources can considerably curtail the major overhead cost, that is, power, and at the same time minimize pollution. Solar energy utilization is a viable option as large spaces are available not only on rooftops but also allied spaces like parking lots of the industries for installation of rooftop SPV plants. The industries by virtue of location receive extended periods of unimpeded sunlight, as these setups are positioned in separate industrial areas away from residential clusters of buildings. Hence, the problems related to shading is eliminated. This makes solar plant setup more effective and functionally robust. The findings of the present work delineate a broad view on technical, economic, and ecological viability of the rooftop solar plant. The work, thus, emboldens industries to adopt strategies toward the installation of rooftop solar plant in their premises. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","capacity utilization factor; GHG emissions; meteorological parameters; pay back period; performance ratio; rooftop solar photovoltaic plant","Climate change; Earnings; Ecology; Energy security; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Location; Manufacture; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Capacity utilization; GHG emission; Meteorological parameters; pay back period; Performance ratio; Solar photovoltaic plants; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073982238

Landscape approximately occupies 65% of the urban area, which nominates landscape to play a major role in generating energy from renewable sources (e.g. solar, wind, etc). In order to achieve this objective, “Energy-scape” elements have been introduced to generate clean and efficient energy by integrating renewable energy (RE) devices with landscape elements. Previous research presented Energy-scape database to help landscape and urban designers to replace landscape with Energy-scape elements and to focus on integrating renewable energy (RE) within the urban environment. Several architects and landscape designers still lack the basic knowledge of RE, never to mention, the complexity of Energy-scape database that is continuously updated. Furthermore, the lack of computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools that can help architects, designers and decision-makers to swiftly integrate RE devices with the urban environment is another barrier to spread the implementation of similar projects. This research attempts to overcome this challenge by introducing a new web-based application to design landscape while integrating Energy-scape elements in urban environment. The algorithm of this web-based application analyzes existing landscape based on existing resources to select suitable Energy-scape elements, required area, and the best suitable locations of these elements within a specific project. The proposed algorithm enables the users to modify suggested locations and area of the Energy-scape elements to meet the project's needs in term of the available budget, area or the required energy production. Further, the new algorithm calculates the impact of integrating Energy-scape elements within the project in term of cost (e.g. capital and running costs), lifetime, and total energy saving. Moreover, the current paper introduces a simplified user-friendly web-based tool of the proposed new algorithm that will help architects and landscape designers to use Energy-scape elements efficiently within their projects. The efficiency of the presented web-based application will be tested in a case study of Al-Azhar Park in Cairo, Egypt to validate the software capabilities in a real-case scenario. The research concludes that the proposed software application is an effective tool for landscape designers to use Energy-scape elements through identifying the optimum type and location of them within landscape design projects and calculating the impact of using them in terms of energy-savings and carbon emission (CO2) reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy-scape elements; Energy-scape software; Landscape elements; Renewable energy","Application programs; Budget control; Computer aided engineering; Decision making; Digital devices; Energy conservation; Location; Software testing; Urban planning; Web services; Websites; Energy from renewable sources; Landscape elements; On-line applications; Renewable energies; Renewable energy devices; Software applications; Software capability; Web-based applications; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077753469

This work aims to highlight the potential of such an electrosynthesis platform. For this reason, the CO2RR mechanism is postulated by considering the volume beneath the electrified PLI, termed the nanoreactor, and its chemical dynamics are evaluated by computational experiments. The commonalities noted between the reactant species in the electrified PLI and the field of radiolysis help to postulate the mechanism. The chemical dynamics not only explain the preferential synthesis of oxalate due to the promotion of a carbon-carbon bond by the high local concentration of the carboxyl radical anion (CO2-(aq)) but also elucidate the depletion of the dissolved CO2 (CO2(aq)) at the nanoreactor within the initial 0.043 s of continuous discharge, with hydrogen being produced only afterward. This work estimates ca. 98% CO2RR efficiency; of this, 97% is selective to oxalate if a flow cell is used as the electrolyte flow refills the CO2(aq) content into the nanoreactor. This study postulates a radiolysis-based mechanism for CO2RR via the electrified PLI, which provides insight in order to develop processes in the field of plasma electrochemistry.

However, the role of Mediterranean forests in deadwood carbon storage is unclear. In this regard, the European Regulation 2018/841 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, requires reports by Member States on the average annual net emissions or removals of deadwood carbon. The main purpose of this work is to explore the trends of forest deadwood carbon to clarify the role of Spanish forest as deadwood carbon storage. We also investigate the effect of forest stand, climatic and physiographic variables on the deadwood carbon trends. For the purposes of our study, we used the deadwood data from two cycles of the European large-scale forest condition-monitoring programme Level I, which spanned from 2009 to 2017. Our findings indicate that there is statistical evidence of increments in deadwood carbon stocks in Spain over the last decade. We also identified certain spatial trends of mean annual changes in deadwood carbon: positive increment in the Mediterranean and Macaronesian regions, close to zero in the Atlantic region and negative in the Alpine region. We also found significant and positive relationships between the mean height and basal area on deadwood carbon stocks as well as a bell-shaped relationship between the mean diameter of living trees as a proxy of stand age on deadwood carbon stocks. The European Level I Monitoring Programme emerged as a useful tool to explore the dynamics of deadwood carbon. However, the temporal scheme and the lack of repeated measurements of dasometric inventories preclude forecasting future deadwood carbon stocks under alternative management regimes and climate conditions. In this regard, the deadwood data collected in future cycles, together with the deadwood data from the National Forest Inventory plots may allow the development of prediction models and therefore fulfill the international requirements on Member States for deadwood forecasts at national scale for the 2021 to 2030 period. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dynamics; Climate change; Forest policy; ICP Forests; Mitigation","Biodiversity; Climate change; Condition monitoring; Digital storage; Dynamics; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Alternative management; Carbon dynamics; Forest policy; ICP Forests; Land use change and forestries; Mitigation; National forest inventories; Repeated measurements; Forestry; biodiversity; carbon storage; climate change; dead wood; environmental disturbance; environmental monitoring; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; land use change; mitigation; regulatory framework; Biodiversity; Dynamics; Forecasts; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Land Use; Atlantic Coast [Europe]; Atlantic Coast [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080091510

In the South Pars zone, elevated concentrations of reactive hydrocarbons co-emitted with nitrogen oxides from industrial facilities lead to substantial ozone production downwind. To understand the role of these emissions on the ozone formation and, to formulate appropriate control strategies in this zone, emissions of precursors of ozone were quantified, and compounds that deserve relatively more attention were determined. To do this, first, a fully-speciated ozone precursors emission inventory was prepared to provide necessary input data for air quality simulation models. Then, the emission inventory was weighted by emitted mass and incremental reactivity scales to determine which compounds deserve relatively more detailed representation in the modeling. Afterward, a photochemical model was applied to determine the ozone sensitivity to its precursors. Finally, source apportionment was done for the most important compounds. Additionally, the reactivity-based inventory was compared with other regions. Results show that nitrogen oxides sensitive chemistry is dominant in the zone thus the most effective control strategy is the mitigation of the nitrogen oxides emissions. Gas refinery plants have a larger share than petrochemical plants in the nitrogen oxides emission and, the gas turbines are the main sources of nitrogen oxides emission in this region. Emitted volatile organic compounds contain more highly reactive species in comparison with the ambient air composition of typical urban areas and areas with gas production industries. Propylene and ethylene have the most contribution to the ozone formation in comparison with other volatile organic compounds. The major sources of their emissions are the olefin processes and polymer production plants. © 2020, Iranian Institute of Research and Development in Chemical Industries.

Hence, this study aimed to describe the characteristics of nursing doctoral programs in East and South East Asian (ESEA) countries and regions from the views of doctoral program coordinators, and to explore the students' experiences of and satisfaction with their doctoral nursing program. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using two self-designed questionnaires, one focusing on PhD program coordinators and the other on doctoral students. Characteristics of the nursing doctoral programs focused on program characteristics, faculty characteristics, career pathways for graduates, and challenges for nursing doctoral education. Doctoral students' assessment of study experiences included quality of supervision, doctoral training programs, intellectual/cultural climate of institutions, general facilities/support, and the overall study experience and satisfaction. Results: In the PhD coordinators survey, 46 institutions across nine ESEA countries and regions participated. More than half of nursing departments had academic members from other health science disciplines to supervise doctoral nursing students. The majority of graduates were holding academic or research positions in higher education institutions. Faculty shortages, delays in the completion of the program and inadequate financial support were commonly reported challenges for doctoral nursing education. In the students' survey, 193 doctoral students participated. 88.3% of the students were satisfied with the supervision they received from their supervisors; however, 79% reported that their supervisors 'pushed' them to publish research papers. For doctoral training programs, 75.5% were satisfied with their curriculum; but around half reported that the teaching training components (55.9%) and mobility opportunities (54.2%) were not included in their programs. For overall satisfaction with the intellectual and cultural climate, the percentages were 76.1 and 68.1%, respectively. Only 66.7% of the students felt satisfied with the facilities provided by their universities and nursing institutions. Conclusion: Doctoral nursing programs in most of the ESEA countries value the importance of both research and coursework. Doctoral nursing students generally hold positive experiences of their study. However, incorporating more teaching training components, providing more opportunities for international mobility, and making more effort to improve research-related facilities may further enhance the student experience. There is also a need to have international guidelines and standards for quality indicators of doctoral programs to maintain quality and find solutions to global challenges in nursing doctoral education. © 2020 The Author(s).","Asia; Doctoral education; Nursing; PhD degree; Student experience","article; career; climate; curriculum; doctoral education; financial management; human; human experiment; major clinical study; nursing education; nursing student; practice guideline; questionnaire; satisfaction; Southeast Asia; teaching; cross-sectional study; female; male; nursing education; Southeast Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Education, Nursing; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Female; Humans; Male; Nursing Education Research; Personal Satisfaction; Students, Nursing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084721917

Since liquefied petroleum gas is prolific in Iraq at a lower price than other fuels and is clean and environmentally friendly, one of the important research topics is the use of liquefied petroleum gas in diesel engines because LPG has a high heat value, and the state of its gas makes mixing with air a burning issue simple and improved, reduces emissions and helps to harvest total energy. A new electronic control unit (ECU) is designed and used to inject liquefied petroleum gas via intake manifold as air enters the combustion chamber and a sensor is installed over a single-cylinder diesel engine, aircooling. The test engine operation for fuel modes that were initially used is the D-100, after which the LPG-25, LPG-50 and LPG-100 fuel were used. The test under loads was 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% at different speeds of 1000, 1500 and 2000 rpm.

The way architecture responds to climate change is important. Thus, this research attempted, by using the new bioclimatic chart, to prepare the new climate classification of Nigeria. The research was aimed at establishing a bioclimatically based approach for architecture in Nigeria. By retrieving the climatic data from thirty-six Nigerian meteorological stations about characteristics of each region, bioclimatic analysis was achieved. According to the bioclimatic analysis of this research, Nigeria can be divided into five different climatic regions, such as hot-dry, hot-humid, temperate-dry, temperate-humid, and temperate-dry with a cool climate.

Design/methodology/approach: The case study approach has been proposed to highlight the applicability of value stream mapping (VSM) in an Indian bonnet manufacturing organization. The methodology used relies on formulation of VSM being the main tool used to identify the opportunities for classifying and eliminating bottlenecks with the help of various lean techniques. A contrast of present and past scenarios is highlighted to underscore the importance of using VSM with ARENA simulation. Findings: Application of the proposed simulation approach has helped the organization reduce the cycle time significantly by 30 per cent over the entire production time. The average number of work-in-progress pieces has also decreased by about ten. In addition, enhancements have been seen with respect to ecological parameters, e.g. carbon footprint has been reduced to 83.7 percent across the process. Research limitations/implications: The proposed approach of using a simulation-based VSM helps in reducing the time involved in traditional VSM method. This approach is also easy to implement at any organizational level. Practical implications: It is believed that this paper will aid not just industrialists but also academic professionals to appreciate the role of simulation using ARENA in helping them understand how to attack the various problems faced by industries. The results of the study indicate that by applying this methodology, there will be a reduction not only in cost but also in environmental impacts.

In this regard, AERMOD dispersion model coupled with WRF model has been used to predict the ground level concentration of pollutants emitted from gas flares. The accuracy of the dispersion model has been verified with measured ambient SO2 data. The risk assessment results have shown that the chronic noncarcinogenic risk of BTEX emitted from gas flares is in the acceptable range in the residential area and most of refineries site. Regarding acute noncarcinogenic risk, the hazard indices (HIs) are only greater than one in refineries sites and are less than permitted level elsewhere in the study area. For carcinogenic risk, the cumulative risk of benzene and ethylbenzene are greater than 10−6 in refineries sites and two cities (Asalouyeh and Nakhl Taghi), but in two camps nearby the gas flaring sites, the value is less than the allowable limit. Besides, the relative contribution of gas flaring in health risk assessment of BTEX is accomplished by calculating the health risk parameters with the measured BTEX concentrations at 10 receptors, which reveal the cumulative effects of all potential sources of BTEX throughout the study area. The comparison of health risk parameters has shown that the health risk of BTEX associated with flaring is in average 42 %, 2.6 % and 10.8 % of the overall health risk of BTEX in industrial areas, two cities and camps, respectively. It can be concluded that the contribution of gas flaring in industrial areas is noticeable and application of emission reduction policies at gas flaring, has a major effect on industrial areas and maybe has minor effects on the air quality of the residential areas. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","AERMOD; Cancer risk; Flaring; Gas refinery; Noncancer risk; WRF","Air quality; Benzene; Emission control; Ethylbenzene; Flare stacks; Gases; Health; Health hazards; Health risks; Housing; AERMOD; Cancer risk; Flaring; Gas refineries; Non-cancer risks; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080046845

Climate change is likely to increase the scale of displacement in the Asia Pacific region, leading to intensified patterns of migration as well as resettlement. These two processes, though differing in terms of individual agency and the role of the state, are likely to further exacerbate pressure on urban areas. As the limits to adaptation in risky places are reached, people are increasingly pursuing migration as a way of coping. This strategy demonstrates people’s agency to respond to risks and opportunities. Resettlement, in contrast, tends to undermine people’s agency. This risk response is increasingly being implemented by states as part of climate change adaptation plans, yet, it often results in the creation of new vulnerabilities for those forcibly resettled. Through a focus on the ‘climate hotspot’ of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, this paper explores how communities and governments might anticipate and resolve some of the humanitarian, livelihood and ecological challenges associated with resettlement in an increasingly resource-constrained and risky climate future. The concept of just resilience is proposed as a lens through which the consequences of resettlement for people’s connections to place, each other and familiar ways of life can be understood. It is argued that a focus on just resilience reveals opportunities and threats to procedural, distributive and recognition elements of justice associated with adapting to climate change. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.","adaptation; climate change; displacement; just resilience; migration; resettlement; Vietnam","action plan; adaptive management; climate change; environmental justice; environmental risk; exploration; government; migratory population; resettlement policy; urban area; vulnerability; Mekong Delta; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063607468

It combines institutional data and semi-structured interviews with policymakers to elucidate the process of implementation of these instruments, with a focus on the enabling factors and (missing) connections in the policy mix. Coordination gaps between the enabling instruments and climate adaptation instruments, caused by institutional and political factors, resulted in implementation issues and a policy mix inclined to promote social vulnerability goals rather than sustainable production and climate risk management. The analysis provides insights into the challenges of achieving a coherent policy framework. It also contributes to the policy mix literature by defining criteria for a typology of interactions between policy instruments and by unpacking the functional ties of instruments in the policy mix. Key policy insights Policy coordination is a political rather than technical process. The policy mix includes climate adaptation instruments, enabling instruments, and complementary instruments, each of which play different functional roles. Both formal and informal mechanisms connect policy instruments. A policy mix analysis must be specific to both context and time. A network analysis of instrument interactions can provide methods and comparative outlooks that are more robust.

They consist of policy instruments that target different actors and address multiple goals across several policy sectors and levels. The analysis of these complex arrangements extends beyond purely technical efficiency criteria, as several sources of tension between instruments may be identified, such as conflicting interests, goals, and approaches to implementation. The proliferation of governance networks complicates the understanding of actors’ interactions, the types of authority influencing the outcomes of policy mixes, and importance of different levels of governance. This article provides a framework to address these analytical challenges, particularly the interconnected networks of policy actors and policy instruments. It draws on polycentric governance literature to analyse how power matters in policy networks. This includes identifying distinct types of power, actors’ position, and variables that explain patterns of conflict, competition, convergence, and divergence in policy choices and outcomes. The framework is applied to the climate and land use policies implemented in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Several methods were used to clarify these variables and to characterise policy mixes being implemented in the region, including social network analysis. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Brazil; climate change; land use change; Mato Grosso; network analysis; Policy mix; polycentric governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081715402

Due to the very high thermal energy demand of this technology and the potential impact on the power production, solar-assisted PCC (SPCC) was proposed to offset part of this energy penalty. However this option is far from commercialization readiness, because of the solar intermittence and the costly thermal energy storage (TES). This paper promotes a dynamic carbon capture using innovative solar collector field (SCF). By eliminating the complex and costly stripper/s from the conventional PCC, we propose regenerating the solvent directly in the SCF and proportionally to the solar thermal energy gain. We also propose an underground solvent storage system instead of TES to buffer in-between the dynamic solvent regeneration via SCF and the steady-state absorption process in the absorber/s. For capturing 1.5 million tonneCO2/y from a 660 MWe coal-fired power plant in three representative locations in Australia, it is found that the equivalent annual cost of desorption is quite reasonable, particularly at higher solar multiples (SM). For SM = 1.5, the levelized cost of desorption is the lowest in Townsville ($ 12.34 per tonneCO2), followed by Sydney ($16.31 per tonneCO2), while Melbourne would need larger SCF (SM = 2.0) to lower the levelized cost of desorption ($ 22.52 per tonneCO2). These costs are calculated irrespective of the credits gained from steam preservation for power production and the resulted positive impact on the overall life cycle analysis. Noting the trajectory trend of GHG reduction cost, this novel approach in solarising carbon capture may bring SPCC to the competitive advantage in short/mid-term. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Parabolic trough collector; Post-combustion carbon capture; Solar collector field; Solvent storage; Stripper; Underground storage tanks","Buffer storage; Carbon capture; Coal; Coal combustion; Competition; Desorption; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Life cycle; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solvents; Thermal energy; Coal-fired power plant; Competitive advantage; Parabolic trough collectors; Post-combustion carbon captures; Solvent regenerations; Steady-state absorption; Stripper; Underground storage tanks; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080022837

In this context, a novel integrated methodological approach is proposed to identify the most suitable strategy to improve the sustainability of the water softening industry via the treatment and recycling of the produced wastewater. Different concentration technologies and energy supply systems are compared to find economically feasible and environmentally friendly treatment systems. The investigated chains present the same pre-treatment step (nanofiltration and crystallization) and different concentration technologies: Multi-Effect Distillation (MED), Membrane Distillation (MD) and the coupling of Reverse Osmosis and Membrane Distillation (RO-MD). In the case of electricity supplied by the grid, the MED and the RO-MD chain are economically competitive with the state of the art (Levelized Brine Cost (LBC) between 4 and 6$/m3, lower than the regenerant solution cost, equal to 8$/m3). Moreover, the specific CO2 emissions due to the energy required by the treatment processes (10.8 kgCO2/m3 regenerant for the MED chain and 16.7kgCO2/m3 regenerant for the RO-MD chain) are lower than those produced by the current system (19.7kgCO2/m3 regenerant). Varying the feed flow rate, the MED-chain is more feasible at larger plant sizes for its lower energy demand, while the chain including RO-MD shows lower costs at smaller plant sizes for its lower investment costs. When a photovoltaic-battery system is coupled, both the MED-chain and RO-MD-chain show a CO2 emission reduction of more than 75% with respect to the state of the art. Furthermore, their LBC values are very competitive, especially if the plant is located in a region with high solar potential. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; CO2 emissions; Industrial wastewater; Membrane processes; Recycling; Treatment chain","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Distillation; Effluents; Emission control; Industrial water treatment; Investments; Recycling; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Circular economy; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Environmental analysis; Industrial wastewaters; Membrane process; Methodological approach; Multieffect distillation; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079008449

One approach to reconstructing past ENSO dynamics uses planktonic foraminifera as recorders of past climate to assess past spatio-temporal changes in upper ocean conditions. In this paper, we utilise a model of planktonic foraminifera populations, Foraminifera as Modelled Entities (FAME), to forward model the potential monthly average 18Oc and temperature signal proxy values for Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides sacculifer, and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei from input variables covering the period of the instrumental record. We test whether the modelled foraminifera population 18Oc and Tc associated with El Niño events statistically differ from the values associated with other climate states. Provided the assumptions of the model are correct, our results indicate that the values of El Niño events can be differentiated from other climate states using these species. Our model computes the proxy values of foraminifera in the water, suggesting that, in theory, water locations for a large portion of the tropical Pacific should be suitable for differentiating El Niño events from other climate states. However, in practice it may not be possible to differentiate climate states in the sediment record. Specifically, comparison of our model results with the sedimentological features of the Pacific Ocean shows that a large portion of the hydrographically/ecologically suitable water regions coincide with low sediment accumulation rate at the sea floor and/or of sea floor that lie below threshold water depths for calcite preservation. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

This study deals with this issue by means of a characterisation of air pollution near an industrial area including a biogas production (from biomass) and combustion plant located in South Italy. The methodology consists in advanced statistical analysis on concentration of gaseous pollutants, particles concentration and size distribution in number and mass, and PM2.5 chemical composition. High-temporal resolution measurements, supported by ancillary meteorological parameters, and source apportionment of PM2.5 using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model, are performed. The integrated approach provides the emissive picture consisting in different anthropogenic sources (i.e. traffic, biomass burning, and industrial facilities) with particular focus on biogas plant emissions. Results showed that CO and nitrogen oxides were influenced by vehicular traffic and biomass combustion, however, a contribution of the plant to NO was observed. SO2 was influenced mainly by transport from the industrial zone, but a second local contribution compatible with the emissions of the biogas plant was detected. Number particle concentrations were analysed in four size ranges: nanoparticles (D &lt; 0.05 μm), ultrafine particles (D &lt; 0.3 μm), accumulation (0.3 &lt; D &lt; 1 μm) and coarse particles (D &gt; 1 μm). Nanoparticles and ultrafine particles were mainly influenced by vehicular traffic and biomass burning, instead, a contribution of the plant was individuated in the accumulation mode. PMF5 identified the contribution of six sources: crustal (14.7% ± 2.1% of measured PM2.5); marine aerosol (aged) (12.9% ± 2.3%); biomass burning (32.8% ± 1.4%); secondary sulphate (19.7% ± 2.4%); primary industrial emissions (5.4% ± 2.3%); traffic and secondary nitrate (17.0% ± 3.9%). The plant is likely to contribute to both sources, the industrial and the traffic plus secondary nitrate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biogas production plant; Industrial emissions; Nanoparticles; PM2.5; Source apportionment","Air quality; Biogas; Biomass; Chemical analysis; Combustion; Factorization; Fog; Nanoparticles; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size analysis; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Biogas production; Comprehensive evaluation; High temporal resolution measurement; Meteorological parameters; Particles concentration; PM2.5; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source apportionment; Industrial emissions; biogas; carbon monoxide; nanoparticle; nitrate; nitric oxide; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; biofuel; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biogas; combustion; industrial waste; nanoparticle; particulate matter; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; Article; biofuel production; biomass; chemical composition; combustion; concentration (parameter); industrial area; Italy; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Italy; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biofuels; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079534608

In this work, we explore opportunities to leverage synergies between oil recovery and emission reduction targets through a regional case study in the Eagle Ford shale, where natural gas co-produced with oil (i.e., casinghead gas) is still frequently flared at the wellhead rather than sold due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure. We demonstrate that reinjecting casinghead gas for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) would be a profitable and environmentally favorable alternative to flaring, particularly considering the extent of oil that remains trapped in shales following primary recovery. On the basis of our projections of oil and casinghead gas production through 2025, this approach could prevent a cumulative 370 Bcf of flared gas (or abated emissions of 22 Mt CO2 eq) while recovering an additional 42.5 MMbbl of oil. Supplementing casinghead gas with anthropogenic CO2 emissions from natural gas processing facilities in the Haynesville shale could produce another 46.1 MMbbl of oil while sequestering 19.8 Mt CO2. We discuss the operational costs of this strategy, which could be competitive with traditional CO2-EOR (particularly in a carbon-constrained economy), but motivating industry adoption over cheaper conventional EOR approaches will require policy intervention and market assurances to mitigate long-term risks.

Three constituents, i.e., composting, reuse and recycle are analysed using extreme vertices mixture design to determine the model. Mixture design enables identifying of optimum combination of each constituent producing the lowest GHGs emission. Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a regress and were analysed how they change when the amount of waste changes. The result showed that there are four possible models. One best model is chosen for its least standard deviation, lowest P-value and the highest adjusted R2 which is 5.764 10-3, less than 0.005, and 0.9908 respectively. The model describes that lowest GHGs emission can be achieved by maximizing plastic recycle (into flakes), limiting composting and increasing paper, glass and metal reuse. Composting, reuse and recycle is proportional to the GHGs emission individually, while combination of two constituents is inversely proportional to GHGs emission. The lowest GHGs may be emitted from the plant is 0.107 Gg CO2 equivalent/year with the composition of constituents as followed: 14 % composting, 50 % reuse, and 26 % recycle equals to 1.3 m3, 4.7 m3 and 2.1 m3 waste from each method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Greenhouse gases; Mixtures; Municipal solid waste; Recycling; Best model; GHGs emissions; Mixture design; Optimisations; Optimum combination; P-values; Standard deviation; Treatment methods; Waste treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084991768

Setting these parameters traditionally relies heavily on insights from those involved in parameterisation of the underlying climate processes. Given the many degrees of freedom and computational expense involved in evaluating such a selection, this can be imperfect leaving open questions about whether any subsequent simulated biases result from mis-set parameters or wider structural model errors (such as missing or partially parameterised processes). Here, we present a complementary approach to identifying plausible climate model parameters, with a method of bias correcting subcomponents of a climate model using a Gaussian process emulator that allows credible values of model input parameters to be found even in the presence of a significant model bias. A previous study (McNeall et al., 2016) found that a climate model had to be run using land surface input parameter values from very different, almost non-overlapping, parts of parameter space to satisfactorily simulate the Amazon and other forests respectively. As the forest fraction of modelled non-Amazon forests was broadly correct at the default parameter settings and the Amazon too low, that study suggested that the problem most likely lay in the model's treatment of non-plant processes in the Amazon region. This might be due to modelling errors such as missing deep rooting in the Amazon in the land surface component of the climate model, to a warm-dry bias in the Amazon climate of the model or a combination of both. In this study, we bias correct the climate of the Amazon in the climate model from McNeall et al. (2016) using an ""augmented"" Gaussian process emulator, where temperature and precipitation, variables usually regarded as model outputs, are treated as model inputs alongside land surface input parameters. A sensitivity analysis finds that the forest fraction is nearly as sensitive to climate variables as it is to changes in its land surface parameter values. Bias correcting the climate in the Amazon region using the emulator corrects the forest fraction to tolerable levels in the Amazon at many candidates for land surface input parameter values, including the default ones, and increases the valid input space shared with the other forests. We need not invoke a structural model error in the land surface model, beyond having too dry and hot a climate in the Amazon region. The augmented emulator allows bias correction of an ensemble of climate model runs and reduces the risk of choosing poor parameter values because of an error in a subcomponent of the model. We discuss the potential of the augmented emulator to act as a translational layer between model subcomponents, simplifying the process of model tuning when there are compensating errors and helping model developers discover and prioritise model errors to target. © 2020 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

This paper evaluates the potential environmental and financial benefits of switching from traditional van-based deliveries to an alternative operating model, where porters or cycle couriers undertake deliveries supported by a substantially reduced van fleet. Results using a specially-developed algorithm to model operations of a real carrier in an area of central London, UK, suggested that the carrier could reduce CO2 emissions by 45%, NOx emissions by 33%, driving distance by 78% and curbside parking time by 45%. Overall cost savings to the carrier were estimated to be in the range 34–39%. Scaling up the modelled emissions savings to London's Central Activities Zone, an area of approximately 30 km2 and with current total annual parcel delivery distance of around 15 million km, could see annual emissions savings in the region of 2 million kg CO2 and 1633 kg NOx if all carriers utilised porters or cycle couriers.

At the same time, it is a challenge for these energy technologies which can only be solved by integrated solutions. Carbon capture and storage combined with geothermal energy could serve as a novel approach to reduce CO2 emissions and at the same time facilitate some of the negative impacts associated with fossil fuel-based power plants. This study focuses on the technical and economic feasibility of combining these technologies based on a published model, data and market research. In the European Union, Germany is the most energy intensive country, and it also has an untapped potential for geothermal energy in the northern as well as the western regions. The CO2 plume geothermal system using supercritical carbon dioxide as the working fluid can be utilized in natural high porosity (10–20%) and permeability (2.5 × 10−14–8.4 × 10−16 m2) reservoirs with temperatures as low as 65.8 ◦C. The feasibility of the project was assessed based on market conditions and policy support in Germany as well as the geologic background of sandstone reservoirs near industrialized areas (Dortmund, Frankfurt) and the possibility of carbon capture integration and CO2 injection. The levelized cost of electricity for a base case results in € 0.060/kWh. Optimal system type was assessed in a system optimization model. The project has a potential to supply 6600/12000 households with clean energy (electricity/heat) and sequester carbon dioxide at the same time. A trading scheme for carbon dioxide further expands potential opportunities. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The total emissions per area were analyzed and the emissions for particular pollutants per unit area (km²) and per citizen were considered. The obsolete vehicles determined a substantial impact on the local atmospheric pollution.

The vision strategy is critical but not well researched and is the focus of this article. Using Strategic Energy Planning (SEP) as an analytical framework, the vision strategy of eight forerunner European cities are analysed. Some critical elements of SEP include the use of long-term targets, holistic energy system thinking, and retention of scenarios. The results indicate that the level of understanding and practice of the vision strategy is still deficient in the cities. Cities often use the practice of urban planning, which does not fit very well with energy planning, particularly with the vision strategy. The energy planning in the cities mostly focuses on shorter-term goals and actions, and they often abandon energy scenarios once extracted. However, through trial and error, some cities are finding ways forward. The article concludes with several recommendations, particularly that cities need to see scenarios as retainable long-term servants providing information desired by the planner, rather than serving as a guide to the planner. © 2020 by the authors.","City; Climate change; Decarbonisation; Strategic energy planning","Computer science; Energy management; Critical elements; Decarbonisation; Energy planning; Energy scenarios; Integration strategy; Strategic energy planning; Strategic level; Trial and error; Urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084286705

In the last few years, disasters from extreme weather events such as typhoons have increased and have breached records, with typhoon Haiyan being the strongest ever typhoon to make landfall. Such an event solicited global compassion and altruism where Canada and the USA, apart from doling out traditional humanitarian aid, also offered immigration relief opportunities to typhoon Haiyan victims who have familial connections to their residents. Drawing from these immigration relief interventions, this paper uses a sociopolitical approach in proposing a climate humanitarian visa that would be offered to climate change victims on the basis of transnational family networks and skilled labor. Noting that several countries such as in Europe have demographic deficits and labor shortages, such a scheme would benefit both climate change victims and receiving countries. To counter the risk of selective compassion against economically trapped populations, potential receiving countries could provide skills upgrading geared toward addressing their labor shortages through their existing development programs. While migration is only one strategy in a spectrum of responses to climate change impacts, a climate humanitarian visa could provide climate change victims a legal choice for mobility while invoking altruism, hospitality, and compassion from potential receiving countries, whether or not they historically cause climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change; Displacement; Emigration; Extreme weather events; UNFCCC","Disasters; Extreme weather; Hurricanes; Regional planning; Weather information services; Climate change impact; Development programs; Displacement; Emigration; Extreme weather events; Skills upgrading; Transnational families; UNFCCC; Climate change; climate change; extreme event; immigration; international migration; Typhoon Haiyan 2013; Canada; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082956644

Therefore, air quality monitoring has become a necessity in urban and industrial areas. Recently, the emergence of Machine Learning techniques justifies the application of statistical approaches for environmental modeling, especially in air quality forecasting. In this context, we propose a novel feature ranking method, termed as Ensemble of Regressor Chains-guided Feature Ranking (ERCFR) to forecast multiple air pollutants simultaneously over two cities. This approach is based on a combination of one of the most powerful ensemble methods for Multi-Target Regression problems (Ensemble of Regressor Chains) and the Random Forest permutation importance measure. Thus, feature selection allowed the model to obtain the best results with a restricted subset of features. The experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach compared to other state-of-the-art methods, although some cautions have to be considered to improve the runtime performance and to decrease its sensitivity over extreme and outlier values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Feature ranking; Forecasting; Machine learning; Multi-target regression (MTR)","Air pollution; Air quality; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Air quality forecasting; Air quality monitoring; Feature ranking; Machine learning techniques; Multi-targets; Run-time performance; State-of-the-art methods; Statistical approach; Feature extraction; air quality; atmospheric pollution; ensemble forecasting; machine learning; numerical model; random walk method; ranking; regression analysis; sensitivity analysis; air pollutant; air quality; article; city; ecosystem; feature ranking; feature selection; forecasting; human; industrial area; random forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078984547

Making cities more sustainable is a global priority, which is highlighted by ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ being listed as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015. This Virtual Special Issue (VSI) explores the implementation and assessment of policies and technologies that contribute to the transition to a sustainable, energy efficient and regenerative society. We organized the issue according to four main research themes: 1) Renewable Energy Systems (i.e., different types of systems, qualitative assessments and public acceptance); 2) Sustainable Built Environment (which includes construction, operation and refurbishment); 3) Multi-Scale Models (considering urban sustainability transition from building to districts, or cities and regions to multi-country comparisons and their scaling across different countries); and 4) Governance and Policy (climate change mitigation and adaptation plans/policies that are reported across countries, urban services and infrastructures). This paper serves two purposes. The first is to provide an analysis about patterns, correlations and synergies found across the different topics that have been addressed over the last 20 years in the literature about cities’ sustainability paths. A bibliometric analysis and a contingency matrix show the degree of correlation between scientific journals and main topics addressed by published articles. Secondly, the paper acts as an Editorial to the VSI, introducing the wealth of research articles and topics included in it. Both the bibliometric analysis and the papers published in this VSI demonstrate the interconnectedness of energy consumption, pollutant emissions and the competition for finite resources. The aim is to present advances and challenges of this exciting and ever-evolving research field to inform and guide future studies of urban sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Cities; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Mitigation; Network analysis; Renewable energy; SDG; Sustainability","Climate change; Climate models; Electric network analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Renewable energy resources; Adaptation; Cities; Climate change mitigation; Degree of correlations; Mitigation; Qualitative assessments; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081037467

Effective Electrical Energy Storage (EES) solutions need therefore to be developed to deal with the issue of fitting locally available RES and loads. Hydrogen can become an interesting option because of its high energy density, long-term storage capability and modularity. In particular, in isolated micro-grid and off-grid remote areas, intermittent RES integrated with H2-based storage systems can allow to lower, or even eliminate, the usage of diesel engines and avoid the need for expensive and invasive grid connections. The present study is part of the European REMOTE project, whose main goal is to prove the added value of H2-based energy storage solutions with respect to alternative technologies in terms of economics, technical and environmental benefits. Four demonstration sites supplied by renewable electricity will be installed in either isolated micro-grids or off-grid remote areas throughout all Europe, from Italy (two sites) and Greece to Norway. The aim of this work is to perform a techno-economic analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid H2-battery Power-To-Power (P2P) solution in reducing the usage of external sources (e.g., diesel engines or grid) in a cost-effective way, with different load and environment conditions. The economic viability of the considered scenarios was outlined by computing the Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE). For each of the four sites, the innovative renewable configuration was compared with the current/alternative one. The REMOTE project partners provided main input data for the analysis: techno-economic data from the technology suppliers, whereas electricity consumption and RES production values from the end users of the four isolated locations. LCOE values derived using cost inputs both from REMOTE and literature are presented for a comparison. Results from the energy simulations revealed that the need for an external source is significantly reduced thanks to RES together with the hybrid storage system.

This study evaluates the impact of the provision of point-of-care ultrasounds (POCUS) by primary care (PC) to avoid the patient’s need to travel to a specialized service. The study estimates the costs and air pollution avoided during 2019. The results confirm that performing this ultrasound at the point of care reduces the emission of 61.4 gr of carbon monoxide, 14.8 gr of nitric oxide and 2.7 gr of sulfur dioxide on each trip. During the study, an average of 17.8 km, 21.4 min per trip and almost 2000 L of fuel consumed in a year were avoided. Performing POCUS from PC reduces fuel consumption and the emission of air pollutants and also saves time and money. Furthermore, only 0.3% of the scans had to be repeated by radiologists. However, more studies with more participants need to be done to calculate the exact impact that these pollution reductions will have on human health. © 2020 by the authors.

Radical changes in a settlement texture are only possible when the existing texture is completely demolished and a new settlement texture is built in place of the old one during urban redevelopment processes. Therefore, a multi-scale approach evaluating building component scale, building scale, and settlement scale was developed in this study to design settlement textures based on environmental and climate data. This approach intended to evaluate the energy and economic performance of the reference residential building in different settlement texture alternatives and to determine the effects of settlement texture alternatives on outdoor thermal comfort conditions. Additionally, the goal was to evaluate the existing thermal properties of building envelope components to improve the energy and economic performance of the reference residential building as well as to evaluate the use of trees on streets to enhance existing outdoor thermal comfort. In this way, mistakes in the construction of settlement textures affecting many occupants could be prevented, and the development of sustainable urban neighbourhood designs with efficient buildings and settlements would be possible. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost efficiency; Energy efficiency; Outdoor thermal comfort; Residential building performance; Settlement texture","Housing; Textures; Thermal comfort; Building envelopes; Cost efficiency; Economic performance; Efficient buildings; Multi-scale approaches; Outdoor thermal comfort; Residential building; Urban redevelopment; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081591646

(1962), there is the common model of the viscosimetric behavior where the residual viscosity is represented by a polynomial function of 4th degree involving the reduced density. This study shows that JOSSI’s method depends on three main factors including the adjustment quality of the coefficients, the characterization of the pseudo-critical coordinates via the rules of mixing and the density determination by the equations-of-state. Accordingly, it is important to determine the suitable correlation coupling among viscosity, equation-of-state and mixing rules. Thus, the results obtained from the initial set of JOSSI coefficients have been compared with the new values, for five density determinations’ possibilities and for ten mixing rules, in order to estimate the pseudo-critical coordinates and the characteristics of the mixtures. The results of this paper reveal that the new set of coefficients gives a more precise representation on the hydrocarbon mixtures than the method of JOSSI. The results also show that the equation-of-state established by Peng D.X., Robinson D.B is not suitable to generate the density values. The use of equation-of-state induces more correct prediction of viscosity than the density’s experimental values. Moreover, only 4/10 of mixing rules seem to lead to the most appropriate results. Finally, the method of JOSSI seems to be especially interesting for the viscosities restitution of systems containing light and non-contrast paraffins, but it is not suitable for complex mixtures and heavy hydrocarbons.

This paper synthesizes insights from relevant literature on urban climate change governance, climate adaptation, urban planning, social justice theory, and policy implementation to develop three propositions concerning the conditions that must occur to implement just adaptation. First, just adaptation requires the inclusion of socially vulnerable populations as full participants with agency to shape the decisions that affect them. Second, just adaptation requires that adaptation framings explicitly recognize the causes of systemic injustice. Third, just adaptation requires a focus on incremental evaluations of implementation to avoid timeframes inconsistent with advancing justice. We then integrate the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) with the just adaptation literature to develop a framework to evaluate the implementation of climate adaptation. We present two novel modifications to the ACF aimed at fostering policy analysis of the previously presented three propositions for implementation of just adaptation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate adaptation; Climate governance; Policy implementation; Social justice; Urban planning","Climate models; Adaptation policies; Advocacy coalition framework; Climate change adaptation; Incremental evaluation; Policy analysis; Policy implementations; Social justice; Vulnerable groups; Climate change; adaptive management; advocacy; climate change; governance approach; policy analysis; policy implementation; social justice; urban climate; urban planning; vulnerability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083793708

Applying Weather Research and Forecasting atmosphere model (WRF), Finite Volume Community Ocean model (FVCOM-SWAVE) and the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model, the changes in initial conditions in atmospheric air temperature, sea surface temperature and relative humidity were considered on the basis of 14 CMIP5 general circulation models ensemble. According to the future scenario results, no notable changes are expected in minimum atmospheric pressure within the ETCs of the future; however, the low pressure area was slightly larger and the strong wind zone was extending further south with greater peak wind speeds in the future (year 2081–2100) simulations. This, in turn, yielded a small surge height increase at Pärnu under RCP4.5 scenario; however, under RCP8.5 scenario the surge increase was up to 22–59 cm. Westerly approaching ETCs will bring more precipitation to the Baltic Sea area in the (warmer) future. In case of a southerly cyclone, the results were more mixed. An insignificant increase in wave heights during extreme storm conditions occurred. Although RCP8.5 future scenario is usually considered as unrealistic, the results of this study still suggest that the extreme ETCs may become more dangerous in the future, although probably not as certainly as tropical cyclones. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Cyclone tracks; ETC; FVCOM-SWAVE; Precipitation; Sea level; Storm surge","air temperature; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; extratropical cyclone; extreme event; relative humidity; storm surge; surface temperature; wave height; weather forecasting; westerly; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084284217

These developments affect how societies can utilise and benefit from the woodland areas in the future, be it for example climate change mitigation as carbon sinks, lumber for wood industry, or preserved for nature tourism and recreational activities. We assess the effect and the relative magnitude of different uncertainty sources in ecosystem model simulations from the year 1980 to 2100 for two Finnish boreal forest sites. The models used in this study are the land ecosystem model JSBACH and the forest growth model PREBAS. The considered uncertainty sources for both models are model parameters and four prescribed climates with two RCP (representative concentration pathway) scenarios. Usually, model parameter uncertainty is not included in these types of uncertainty studies. PREBAS simulations also include two forest management scenarios. We assess the effect of these sources of variation at four different points in time on several ecosystem indicators, e.g. gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration, soil moisture, recurrence of drought, length of the vegetation active period (VAP), length of the snow melting period and the stand volume. The uncertainty induced by the climate models remains roughly the same throughout the simulations and is overtaken by the RCP scenario impact halfway through the experiment. The management actions are the most dominant uncertainty factors for Hyytiälä and as important as RCP scenarios at the end of the simulations, but they contribute only half as much for Sodankylä. The parameter uncertainty is the least influential of the examined uncertainty sources, but it is also the most elusive to estimate due to non-linear and adverse effects on the simulated ecosystem indicators. Our analysis underlines the importance of carefully considering the implementation of forest use when simulating future ecosystem conditions, as human impact is evident and even increasing in boreal forested regions. © 2020 Author(s).",,"boreal forest; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; climate change; climate modeling; concentration (composition); drought; environmental change; environmental conditions; environmental indicator; experimental study; forest management; management practice; melting; mitigation; parameterization; primary production; sensitivity analysis; soil moisture; twenty first century; woodland; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085066401

The fast track expansion of this modern olive farming in these recent years casts doubts on the sustainability of such important tree plantation across the Mediterranean. In this work, we performed a spatial modelling analysis to investigate the implications of climate variability and farming management on the productivity and environmental performances of olive orchards around the Mediterranean. Implementation of this research is based on the use of OliveCan; a process-based model able to illustrate responses of water and carbon balances to weather variables, soil characteristics and management techniques enabling the comprehension of olive orchard dynamics under heterogeneous conditions of climate and agricultural practices. Four main intensification levels were adopted to reflect the main olive grove types from traditional to new intensive plantations: low density LD (100 trees ha−1), medium density MD (200 trees ha−1), high density HD (400 trees ha−1) and super high density SHD (1650 trees ha−1). Managements tested were intensification, water supply (rainfed, deficit and full irrigated) and the fate of pruning residues (exported or left on the soil). Two cases studies in two of the main Mediterranean olive-growing regions with contrasting environmental conditions, Tuscany and Jaen regions, focused on mitigation alternative managements for carbon sequestration. Results showed that olive orchards responses in terms of yield and Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) vary along with climatic conditions. Water supply was the main driver with a production function that varies for different atmospheric demands. Application of deficit irrigation proved to boost water use efficiency. Besides, intensification from LD to SHD, presented the greatest improvements, 28–73% for yield and 50–100% for NEP. The C sequestration potential of olive orchards was confirmed. In fact, soil organic carbon (SOC) increased continuously over 400 years of simulation, reaching a state of equilibrium. Moreover, intensification and irrigation improved total carbon sequestration. Management of incorporating pruning residues in the soil increased SOC of 10.5 t C ha−1 for Tuscany and 10.8 t C ha−1 for Jaen. Findings of this research enabled the identification of the main drivers influencing the productive and environmental performance of olive groves in the different Mediterranean sub-climates. Impacts of management innovations on olive farming sustainability were also quantified which may help improve production systems for a more sustainable olive cultivation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural management; Carbon sequestration; Climate; Mitigation; Olea europaea; OliveCan","agricultural management; carbon sequestration; climate change; evergreen tree; irrigation system; mitigation; performance assessment; simulation; sustainability; water supply; water use; Italy; Tuscany; Olea europaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081891155

Either way it can be approached using multi-sectoral data based on an input-output or on a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) framework, although a suitable database and the proposal of appropriate indicators are needed. A suitable database is developed through the estimation of new SAMs for the latest possible period, that of year 2015. This paper focuses on the demand approach: that of changes in the demand for products. It analyzes the different impacts among activities and commodities of a change in domestic household consumption patterns, compares the potential reductions in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions obtained through the reduction of specific demands, and considers the consequent reduction in output and employment. For this purpose, a linear multi-sectoral analysis is employed that focuses on the main EU member states. Despite major differences between countries, the results show that a decrease in emissions through demand-reduction policies exerts greater negative effects on those less polluting sectors with a higher intensity in the labor force, and offers a more suitable option for those highly polluting sectors with a lower concentration of the work factor. Richer countries that are based on service sectors therefore suffer a sharper drop in employment using this kind of policy. © 2020 by the authors.","Effect of adoption of mitigation measures on society; GHG mitigation; Impact analysis; Multi-sectoral model; Social accounting matrices","Consumer behavior; Costs; Gas emissions; Service industry; Demand reduction; Economic costs; European Countries; Household Consumption; Potential reduction; Sectoral analysis; Service sectors; Sustainable consumption; Greenhouse gases; cost analysis; demand analysis; emission control; employment; European Union; greenhouse gas; household structure; pollution policy; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085959440

Many governments have indistinctly transited away from fossil fuels towards renewable energies. However, a sustainable turnaround calls for limiting the overall impact of this transition on environmental resources and the economy. This study identifies the most desirable energy alternatives for the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries based on their environmental and economic footprints using the Relative Aggregate Footprint (RAF) indicator. The RAFs of eleven widespread electricity generation technologies are computed for each country by considering the availability of four resources – energy, water, land, and the economy – which were weighted according to the national resource availability conditions. The results indicate that the MENA region must adapt their electricity mix to mitigate the impacts of climate change with respect to resource availability conditions, especially their scarce water resources. Due to the specificities of this region, deploying biomass and large-scale hydropower may lower greenhouse gases but significantly alter the impact on other valuable natural resources. Therefore, wind, geothermal, and nuclear power plants seem more desirable for a transition away from carbon-intensive technologies while their secondary effects on other resources (e.g. nuclear energy's possible water and environmental impacts) must be carefully considered. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Energy sustainability; MENA; Nexus; Relative aggregate footprint","Aggregates; Availability; Climate change; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Geothermal energy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Sustainable development; Electricity generation; Electricity-generation technology; Energy sustainability; Environmental resources; MENA; Middle East and North Africa; Nexus; Relative aggregate footprint; Geothermal water resources; carbon; water; carbon footprint; climate change; electricity generation; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; global warming; sustainability; Article; biomass; climate change; controlled study; economic aspect; economics; electricity; energy; energy resource; environment; environmental impact; geography; geothermal energy; greenhouse gas; hydropower; Middle East; natural resource; North Africa; nuclear power plant; planning; priority journal; Relative Aggregate Footprint; statistical analysis; water supply; wind power; Middle East; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076553742

Cool summer air temperatures are currently thought to be the ultimate limiter of upright tree growth at alpine treelines globally. However, winter damage has long been recognized as a shaping force near alpine treelines. Low-growing krummholz growth forms provide an opportunity to test hypotheses about the controls of upright growth in environments above current treelines. To distinguish between effects of growing season temperature, winter damage and their interaction on preventing upright growth in krummholz, we conducted a field experiment on krummholz growth forms of Pinus albicaulis over the summer and winter of 2015–2016 at 10 mountain top sites in the Tobacco Root Mountains, Montana, USA. We experimentally manipulated four factors using a fully crossed design: shoot position (natural low position in the krummholz mat vs. propped up above the krummholz mat), summer warming (warming chamber vs. ambient), winter exposure (shelter cage vs. exposed), and elevation position (local high vs. low krummholz limits). We also conducted an observational study of the climatic conditions associated with recent natural emergent stem establishment from krummholz. Experimentally propped shoots that were exposed in winter experienced the highest mortality (10%–50%), while propped shoots in shelter cages and shoots located within the krummholz mat, whether caged or not, had low mortality (0%–10%). Summer warming had little influence on shoot mortality. Surviving mat shoots had marginally higher growth rates than surviving propped shoots during the early growing season after treatments were established. Natural emergent stem establishment was associated with warmer than average summer temperatures, but also warmer winter temperatures, lower winter wind speeds, and lower snowpack. Synthesis. Our results suggest winter damage plays a more important role than does growing season temperature in maintaining the krummholz growth form. While warming may increase opportunities for emergent shoot establishment above krummholz mats, establishment of upright trees in the krummholz zone will also require climatic change that reduces wind and snow transport which cause winter damage. © 2019 The Authors.

China is a global hotspot of NH3 emissions and, as a consequence, comprehensive and high-resolution temporal and spatial assessments and mitigation potential of NH3 emissions are particularly important for the environment, human and ecosystem health. This study demonstrates that national NH3 emissions in China have increased by 102% from 1978 to 2017. Cropland was the major emitter accounting for 38–52% of the emissions, followed by livestock and waste disposal. These three sources accounted for approximately 80% of total emissions nationwide over the past four decades. NH3 hotspots (NH3 emission densities &gt; 5 Mg N km−2 yr−1) were scattered in the Bohai Rim region, North China Plain, the Middle and Lower Yangtze River and the southeast coast in 1978. By 2017, the hotspots had expanded to a larger area of the North China Plain, the Middle and Lower Yangtze River and the Sichuan Basin. In 1978, these hotspots occupied about 2% the land area and contributed to about 46% of total NH3 emissions. By 2017, the hotspots expanded to about 12% of the land area and contributed to more than 70% of the emissions. This study also performed the driving force analysis and found that the population growth had a crucial impact on NH3 emissions with an annual contribution degree of 183%, while the per capita GDP and the urbanization were negatively correlated with NH3 emissions. The analysis of six mitigation scenarios indicates that adopting measures from the production side (including larger farm size, 4 R nutrient stewardship, low emission housing and waste treatment tail gas management) will generate 10–15% reduction potential, whereas encouraging healthy and reasonable diet scenario will reduce 26% by 2030. These findings substantially improve our understanding on NH3 emissions and have implications for air pollution control strategies and policy measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia emission; Driving force; Mitigation; Policy implications; Spatial variation; Temporal evolution","Agriculture; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Ecosystems; Landforms; Population statistics; River pollution; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Ammonia emissions; Atmospheric ammonia; Contribution degree; Driving force analysis; Middle and lower yangtze rivers; North China Plain; Population growth; Temporal and spatial; Ammonia; ammonia; ammonia; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; emission; emission inventory; Gross Domestic Product; mitigation; resolution; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric deposition; carbon footprint; China; correlation analysis; cropland; oxidation reduction potential; population growth; priority journal; river; urbanization; waste disposal; waste management; Bohai Rim; China; North China Plain; Sichuan Basin; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082770006

Rapid urbanization and heatwave events with increasing frequencies need a quantitative analysis on the supply and demand for an urban temperature regulating service, which is a gap in urban heat island (UHI) studies in rapidly urbanizing cities. In order to study the quantitative relationship between landscape metrics (including area index and shape index) and temperature regulating service, this study applied a temperature regulating service in an urban thermal environment study based on the ""source-sink"" landscape theory in western Shenzhen in different periods. The identification of source and sink landscapes is based on the spatial relationship of unusual surface features derived from Landsat-5 and -8 and the consideration of the temperature difference. We found that the source landscapes at different periods provide temperature regulating services for different distances, which directly lead to the difference between the theoretical service value based on the Alternative Cost Method and the actual service value considering demand, changing in the same trend. The results show that the supply distance of temperature regulating services in 2005, 2010, and 2013 is 150 m, 180 m, and 210 m, respectively. The temperature regulating service value is 3.043, 3.273, and 4.308 billion yuan in 2005, 2010, and 2013, which is lower than the estimation value without considering supply and demand (16.638, 23.728, and 37.495 billion yuan, respectively). The value of the temperature regulating service has a positive correlation with the increase of the patch area index. With the gradual complexity of the shape, the service value increases first and then decreases. Moreover, the landscapes with the smallest shape index and area index have the shortest distance for service supplying. The assessment of the temperature regulating service needs to consider the presence of demand landscapes. Furthermore, the interaction of landscapes under different conditions requires further consideration. The setting of the cooling landscape shape and area for mitigating the ""urban heat island"" effect can provide references to urban planners and policymakers in the practice of urban climate adaptation and regulation. © 2020 by the authors.

This difference is consistent with a lower nitrification rate in Stellera soils when urine was added to simulate the dynamics in animal urine patches.

Areas of overlap between wildlife living spaces and human activity spaces were determined by overlay analysis. Then, the areas of construction and arable land that would conflict with wildlife were redistributed outside highly suitable wildlife living spaces. In addition, ecological corridors connecting current and future living spaces were planned for the migration of certain species in response to climate change based on the minimum cumulative resistance model. The results showed that the areas of highly suitable wildlife living spaces will decrease under the influence of climate change if global warming occurs. In the future, the area of overlap between highly suitable wildlife living spaces and construction land will be 125 km2, and that between highly suitable wildlife living spaces and arable land will be 340 km2. The redistribution of these areas will cause human activity spaces to become more concentrated. Moreover, 110 ecological corridors should be constructed across roads in the Three-River Source Region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Ecological corridor; Land use adjustment; Protected area; Spatial conflict; Wildlife distribution change","arable land; cellular automaton; climate change; climate conditions; global warming; habitat corridor; human activity; identification method; land use change; protected area; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; wildlife management; arable land; article; climate change; greenhouse effect; human; river; species distribution; wildlife; animal; ecology; human activities; wild animal; China; Heilongjiang; Sanjiang Plain; Animals; Animals, Wild; Climate Change; Ecology; Human Activities; Humans; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080873877

Elevating standards is an effective method of controlling vehicular emissions and improving air quality. Light-duty vehicles are the major contributors to HC and CO emissions as they constitute a large proportion of all vehicles. Consequently, controlling light-duty vehicular emissions has been the primary means of air pollution prevention in China. This paper first reviews the progress of emission control standards in mainland China. Second, it analyzes features of the China 6 emissions standards, namely the continuation of European standards, the harmony of global technology regulations, and fusion with the standards of the USA. This is followed by a description and discussion of the status of research on mainstream after-treatment technologies such as the gasoline particulate filter, lean-NOx trap, and selective catalytic reduction. Finally, this study argues that the technical routes for implementing three-way catalysts, gasoline particulate filters, and onboard refueling vapor recovery in gasoline vehicles and diesel oxidation catalysts, diesel particulate filters, and selective catalyst reduction in diesel vehicles meet China 6 standards. Moreover, onboard diagnostics-based control of light vehicle emissions is introduced, and the development directions of vehicle gasoline (the reduction in sulfur, olefin, and aromatic content and vapor pressure control in summer) and vehicle diesel (an increase in the Cetane number and reduction in the forecasted polycyclic aromatic content) are discussed.

In this study, vehicle emissions from both the New European Driving Cycle and the Worldwide harmonized Light-duty driving Test Cycle were analyzed by employing on-road test data collected from typical roads in a high-altitude city. On-road measurements were conducted on five light-duty vehicles using a portable emissions measurement system. The certification cycle parameters were synthesized from real-world driving data using the vehicle specific power methodology. The analysis revealed that under real-world driving conditions, all emissions were generally higher than the estimated values for both the New European Driving Cycle and Worldwide harmonized Light-duty driving Test Cycle. Concerning emissions standards, more CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons were emitted by China 3 vehicles than by China 4 vehicles, whereas the CO2 emissions exhibited interesting trends with vehicle displacement and emissions standards. These results have potential implications for policymakers in regard to vehicle emissions management and control strategies aimed at emissions reduction, fleet inspection, and maintenance programs. © IMechE 2020.","driving cycle; emissions; High-altitude; portable emissions measurement system; vehicle specific power","Emission control; Fleet operations; Particulate emissions; Roads and streets; Driving cycle; High-altitude; Light duty vehicles; Maintenance programs; New european driving cycles; Portable emissions measurement systems; Real-world drivings; Vehicle specific power; Road vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079453610

This study conducts the meteorological and chemical simulations based on WRF-Chem, and explores the impacts of meteorology and emissions on PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 2.5 μm) pollutions. Simulations show a noticeable seasonal variation in planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and relative humidity (RH), but a similar trend in wind speed (WS). Compared to PM2.5 good condition (≤75 μg m−3), daily PBLH decreased by 7.6–39.6% in January and 9.2–44.1% in July during PM2.5 polluted condition (75~150 μg m−3), and by 22.3–51.2% in January during severely polluted condition (≥150 μg m−3). PBLH is thought of as the key factor for PM2.5. Then, the synergy between PBLH and other meteorological factors are studied. For a 100 m failing in PBLH, the decrease in surface WS reaches 0.2–0.8 m s−1 0.1–0.3 m s−1 in January and July. It means a synergic effect of unfavorable horizontal and vertical dispersions, more adversely in January than in July. While, RH presents an increasing trend with PBLH falling, about +2.1~+3.2% in January and +2.7~+4.6% in July per 100 m falling in PBLH. Considering the improvement of high RH in heterogeneous chemistry to form the secondary PM2.5, we believe that the disadvantaged dispersion condition is always accompanied by enhanced secondary PM2.5 formation chemistry. Then, we summarize the average simulated PM2.5 under various combinations of PBLH, WS and RH, and find that under the same meteorological combination, PM2.5 in January was about 1.7–3.6 times that of July, which could be explained by the more emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors in January. Finally, we determine the unfavorable meteorology condition based on current regional emissions and China's standard (hourly PM2.5&lt;75 μg m−3), low PBLH (&lt;600 m) or middle-high RH (&gt;40%) for January, high RH (&gt;60%) &amp; low-middle WS (&lt;4 m·s-1), or middle RH (40~60%) &amp; low PBLH (&lt;400 m) for July. These unfavorable meteorological conditions accounted for 75.8% in January and 47.8% in July. Therefore, it is still necessary to continuously reduce anthropogenic emissions in this region for attainment of China's PM2.5 standards. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Meteorological factors; North China; PBLH; PM2.5 pollutions; WRF-Chem","Air quality; Boundary layer flow; Dispersions; Meteorology; Wind; Aerodynamic diameters; Air pollution in chinas; Anthropogenic emissions; Dispersion condition; Heterogeneous chemistry; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Planetary boundary layers; Boundary layers; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; meteorology; particulate matter; relative humidity; wind velocity; article; boundary layer; China; city; humidity; mental capacity; meteorology; particulate matter; seasonal variation; simulation; wind speed; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Henan; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong; Shanxi; Shijiazhuang; Taiyuan; Tianjin; Zhengzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082762187

However, these two roles performed by earthworms have not been separately quantified. Here, we focused on how the pantropical widespread earthworm, Pontoscolex corethrurus, affected CO2 emission by changing soil microbiota community and substrate availability in infertile subtropical soils. Two experiments were performed. Firstly, we conducted a 3-year field experiment wherein P. corethrurus population was manipulated by electrical shocking. The two treatments were earthworm reduction (ER) and earthworm addition (EA). Thereby, we tried to understand CO2 emission pattern through the earthworm-induced changes in soil microbiota community and C-related enzyme activities in field plots. Secondly, a cross-soil inoculation microcosm experiment was conducted to partition the contributions of earthworm-regulated microbiota community and substrate quality to CO2 emission. The four treatments were 1) autoclaved ER soil + ER microbiota, 2) autoclaved EA soil + ER microbiota, 3) autoclaved ER soil + EA microbiota, and 4) autoclaved EA soil + EA microbiota. We found that, in the field experiment, earthworm addition changed soil microbiota community structure, but increased CO2 emission despite decreasing soil β-glucosidase activity by 12%. In the cross-inoculation experiment, the β-glucosidase activity and CO2 emission (1-day incubation) in EA soils was 65.5% and 35.5% greater than that in the ER soils, respectively; the cumulative CO2 emission (30-day incubation) in EA soils was also significantly greater than that in ER soils. However, no significant effects of microbiota inoculation on soil CO2 emissions were observed. These results suggested that the earthworm-enhanced substrate availability, rather than the earthworm-induced changing in the microbiota community structure and enzymatic activities, played a key role in C mineralization. This study implies that P. corethrurus occupies a “bottom niche” in infertile subtropical soils. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Earthworm; Ecological niche; Soil C mineralization; Soil enzyme activity; Soil microbiota community; Soil substrate quality","Carbon dioxide; Enzyme activity; Mineralogy; Substrates; Tropics; C mineralization; Earthworm; Ecological niche; Soil enzyme activity; Soil microbiota; Substrate quality; Soil quality; beta glucosidase; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; community structure; earthworm; enzyme activity; microbial community; mineralization; soil carbon; substrate; Article; carbon footprint; carbon mineralization; earthworm; enzyme activity; field experiment; incubation time; microcosm; nonhuman; Pontoscolex corethrurus; priority journal; soil change; soil inoculation; soil microflora; soil pollution; animal; microflora; Oligochaeta; soil; Pontoscolex corethrurus; Animals; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Microbiota; Oligochaeta; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079244123

One open question concerns trade-offs between latitudinal profiles of insolation reduction and climate response. Here, a moist energy balance model is used to evaluate several SRM proposals, providing fundamental insight into how the insolation reduction profile affects the climate response. The optimal SRM profile is found to depend on the intensity of the intervention, as the most effective profile for moderate SRM focuses the reduction at high latitudes, whereas the most effective profile for strong SRM is tropically amplified. The effectiveness of SRM is also shown to depend on when it is applied, an important factor to consider when designing SRM proposals. Using an energy balance model allows us to provide physical explanations for these results while also suggesting future avenues of research with comprehensive climate models. ©2020.

We used patterns of divaricate plant abundance across present-day landscapes to test a novel synthetic hypothesis: that the divaricate form is of most value to plants on fertile soils that attract herbivores, on sites where climatic constraints prevent plants from quickly growing out of the browse zone. This hypothesis predicts that divaricate species should be most abundant on terraces (landforms that are both fertile and frost-prone) in regions that are cold and dry, and should be scarce across all topographic positions in the warmest (largely frost-free) regions. To address our hypothesis, we first tested the influence of topography on frost regimes and nutrient levels by measuring temperatures and soil total C, N, and P at four standard topographic positions at five localities differing widely in macroclimate. We then extracted a dataset of 236 surveys comprising 9,877 relevé plots from the New Zealand National Vegetation Survey databank. We calculated the proportion of arborescent species with a divaricate growth form and the proportion of total arborescentcover contributed by divaricates on each plot; we then fitted linear mixed-effect models predicting these response variables as functions of topographic position and climate. The number of frosts recorded averaged &lt;1 yr–1 at the warmest of the five sites studied, to &gt;60 yr–1 on all topographic positions at the coldest site. Terraces were subject to more frequent and harder frosts than any other topographic position. Topography had no significant influence on total N or C:N, but total P was higher on terraces and in gullies than on faces or ridges. Frost-free period was the dominant influence on both species representation and cover of divaricate plants throughout the country. The effect of topography was also significant, but weaker. The effect of frost-free period was stronger on sites with water deficits than on sites where precipitation exceeded evapotranspiration. Divaricates made their largest contributions on terraces in cold, dry regions; as predicted, they were scarce on all topographic positions on sites with frost-free periods &gt;300 days. Our hypothesis was generally supported, although the effect of topography on divaricate abundance was not as strong as some previous studies led us to expect. Divaricates made their largest contributions to arborescent species richness and cover on sites where climatic restrictions on growth coincide with relatively high nutrient availability. The contemporary distribution of the divaricate form across New Zealand landscapes thus appears to be reasonably well explained by the hypothesized interaction of climate and fertility-mediated browsing, although experiments may provide more conclusive tests of this hypothesis. © Copyright © 2020 Lusk, Wiser and Laughlin.","browsing; divaricating plants; drought; frost; landform; plant structural defenses; soil nitrogen; soil phosphorus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085893420

Nutrient addition can increase C inputs into soil via increased above- and belowground plant productivity, but at the same time can accelerate organic matter decomposition in the soil. The mechanisms underlying these effects on soil organic C (SOC) dynamics remain unclear, especially in nutrient-limited alpine ecosystems that have been subjected to increasing N and P availability in recent decades. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms underlying SOC decomposition and stabilization in an alpine grassland soil after four years of N and P additions. The soil aggregate size distribution, microbial community structure (lipid biomarkers), microbial C use efficiency (CUE) and microbial necromass composition (amino sugar biomarkers) were analyzed. Nutrient addition increased dominance of fast-growing bacteria (copiotrophs), while P addition alone intensified the competitive interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. These changes led to decreases in the microbial CUE of glucose by 1.6–3.5% and of vanillin by 8.5%, and therefore, reduced SOC content in the topsoil. The total microbial necromass remained unaffected by nutrient addition, but the contribution of fungal necromass to SOC increased. The increased abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and fungal necromass under elevated N availability raised the mass proportion of soil macroaggregates (>250 μm) by 16.5–20.3%. Therefore, fungi were highly involved in macroaggregation following N addition, and so, moderated the SOC losses through enhanced physical protection. Overall, the complex interactions between microbial physiology (CUE), necromass composition (amino sugars) and physical protection (macroaggregation) in mediating SOC dynamics in response to nutrient enrichment were disentangled to better predict the capability of alpine grassland soils to act as a C sink or source under global change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregation; Microbial carbon use efficiency; Microbial community composition; Microbial necromass; Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization; Soil organic carbon","Agglomeration; Amino sugars; Biomarkers; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Forestry; Fungi; Microorganisms; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Soils; Microbial carbons; Microbial community composition; Necromass; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Soil organic carbon; Stabilization; abundance; arbuscular mycorrhiza; community composition; community structure; fungus; grassland soil; microbial activity; microbial community; nutrient use efficiency; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; topsoil; China; Xizang; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080040221

However, this early growth performance on indigenous goats is affected by cold and heat climatic environments and is still unclear in subtropical climate. In this study, we continuously measured (July 2011 to June 2016) the birth weight and mortality of an indigenous goat species (n = 530), and collected temperature, humidity, temperature–humidity index (THI) in original farming area, Chongqing, southwest China. As the result, the mean birth weights in cold months (January and February, mean temperature < 10 °C and THI < 56) and heat months (July and August, mean temperature > 29 °C and THI > 76) were significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared to the other months (June and October, mean temperature = 16~25 °C and THI = 61~75). Meanwhile, the birth weight was positively correlated (P < 0.01) with gestational THI from November to May, and was negatively correlated (P < 0.01) with those parameters from June to October, respectively. The maximum pre-weaning mortality, occurring in the 1st month after birth, is 16.17 ± 2.56%. However, when the birth weight was 20% lower than annual average (2.09 ± 0.54 kg), the mortality was significantly enhanced (P < 0.01) to 46%. In addition, cold and heat climates respectively enhanced mortality in the 1st month and 2nd~4th months after birth. In conclusion, annually chronic heat and cold climates could play important roles in lowering birth weight and their survival in subtropical monsoon region. Low birth weight and cold temperature play critical role to contribute the advent of higher mortality after birth. Our results potentially provide the appropriate ranges of temperature (16~26 °C) and THI (61~75) as pregnant goat and kids raising condition to avoid these negative influences. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Cold and heat stress; Goat; Low birth weight; Mortality; Temperature-humidity index","animal; birth; birth weight; China; cold; female; goat; heat; heat injury; heat shock response; humidity; mortality; newborn; physiology; pregnancy; temperature; veterinary medicine; weaning; weather; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Birth Weight; China; Cold Temperature; Female; Goats; Heat Stress Disorders; Heat-Shock Response; Hot Temperature; Humidity; Mortality; Parturition; Pregnancy; Temperature; Weaning; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075241583

We estimate residential energy demand and GHG emissions from 2015 to 2050 for household activities (including upstream electricity generation) and passenger (road) transport (Scopes 1 and 2). We project that by 2050, Dar es Salaam's total residential emissions would increase from 1,400 ktCO2e (in 2015) up to 25,000–33,000 ktCO2e (SSP1); 11,000–19,000 ktCO2e (SSP2); and 5,700–11,000 ktCO2e (SSP3), with ranges corresponding to different assumptions about household size. This correlates with an increase in per capita emissions from 0.2 tCO2e in 2015 to 1.5–2 tCO2e (SSP1); 0.7–1.3 tCO2e (SSP2); and 0.5–0.9 tCO2e (SSP3). Higher emissions in SSP1 (the sustainability scenario) are driven by a higher urban population in 2050 and increased energy access and electricity consumption. Through aggressive GHG mitigation policies focused on decarbonization of the electricity sector and road transport, total emissions under SSP1 can be reduced by ∼66% in 2050.

Two problems were identified in this work, deviations in policy diffusion and the completeness of energy consumption data. In this study, four standards on heating in China are summarized in relation to different historical stages. By combining the historical energy consumption data with a questionnaire survey, it indicates actual heating energy consumption is far from the expectation of standards put in the past. The energy use intensity of surveyed boiler systems is 12.46 kgce/m2. For these situations, energy saving percentage, used widely in building energy policy in China, needs to be abolished and a scientific statistic indicators on heating according to the new standard should be established. In addition, only constant supervision and timely adjustment of policy implementation based on monitoring energy heating use could make heating policy well-enforced.

It requires the measurement of real drive emission to be an additional type approval test in order to take into account the influence of road profile, ambient conditions and traffic situations. An important amendment has been included in Commission regulation (European Union) 2016/646, limiting the driving dynamics and hence avoiding the biased testing of the vehicle. In this work, a drive cycle generator has been developed to synthesise cycles meeting all the regulatory requirements of the real drive emission testing. The generator is based on the transition probability matrix obtained from each phase of the World harmonised Light vehicle Test Procedure cycle. Driving dynamics have been varied based on real drive emission regulations, and several trips have been generated with dynamics ranging from soft to aggressive. A direct injection compression ignition 1.5 L engine with a state-of-the-art aftertreatment system has been utilised to run the generated synthetic cycles. The analysis of the results obtained in the tests (all of them complying with real drive emission restrictions in terms of driving dynamics) points out a noticeable 60% relative dispersion in the NOx emissions downstream of the catalyst. The contribution of the proposed method lies not only in the fact that it synthesises driving cycles as stochastic process and is capable of tuning the driving dynamics based on real drive emission regulations, but it also presents the range of dispersion possible in NOx emissions solely due to the driving dynamics. The methodology followed in the present work could be an essential step in future engine developments, where testing engine prototypes on the entire range of driving dynamics in the engine test bench facility could provide interesting insights about the expected NOx emissions in real drive emission testing. © IMechE 2019.","drive cycle generator; driving dynamics; Real drive NOx emissions","Direct injection; Dispersions; Engines; Nitrogen oxides; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Aftertreatment systems; Drive cycles; Driving dynamics; Engine test benches; Injection compression; NOx emissions; Regulatory requirements; Transition probability matrix; Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074724153

Various structural and electronic parameters such as adsorption distances, adsorption energies, band structures, and projected density of states were analyzed. The results revealed that the adsorption of the gas molecule on Pt-decorated and Au-decorated WSe2 was more energetically favorable than the adsorption on the intrinsic WSe2, indicating the enhanced sensing capability of Pt-decorated and Au-decorated WSe2. Strong interaction between transition metal embedded WSe2 sheet and gas molecule suggested the stability of the complex system at ambient conditions.

To date, cultivation of microalgae using wastewater is regarded as a promising approach for simultaneous nutrients bioremediation and biofuels production due to their high photosynthesis efficiency and environmental benefits. However, the efficiency of nutrients removal and biomass production strongly depends on wastewater properties and microalgae species. Moreover, the high production cost is still the largest limitation to the commercialization of microalgae biofuels. In this review paper, the state-of-the-art algae species employed in livestock farm wastes have been summarized. Further, microalgae cultivation systems and impact factors in livestock wastewater to microalgae growth have been thoroughly discussed. In addition, technologies reported for microalgal biomass harvesting and CO2 mass transfer enhancement in the coupling process were presented and discussed. Finally, this article discusses the potential benefits and challenges of coupling nutrient bioremediation, CO2 capture, and microalgal production.

However, its mathematical model has not been established yet. Based on the theory of ‘dual-porosity and dual-permeability’ fluid seepage, a mathematical model is established, with the cleat structure, main hydraulic fracture and methane driven by hydraulic fracturing considered simultaneously. With the help of the COMSOL Multiphysics software, the numerical solution of the mathematical model is obtained. In addition, the space–time rules of water and methane saturation, pore pressure and its gradient are obtained. It is concluded that (1) along the direction of the methane driven by hydraulic fracturing, the pore pressure at the cleat demonstrates a trend of first decreasing and later increasing. The pore pressure gradient exhibits certain regional characteristics along the direction of the methane driven by hydraulic fracturing. (2) Along the direction of the methane driven by hydraulic fracturing, the water saturation exhibits a decreasing trend; however, near the cleat or hydraulic fracture, the water saturation first increases and later decreases. The water saturation in the central region of the coal matrix block is smaller than that of its surrounding region, while the saturation of water in the entire matrix block is greater than that in the cleat or hydraulic fracture surrounding the matrix block. The water saturation at the same space point increases gradually with the time progression. The space–time distribution rules of methane saturation are contrary to those of the water saturation.

Nitrate-dependent Anaerobic Methane Oxidation (NdAMO) is a bioprocess coupling nitrate reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation, which could mitigate of these two environmental issues simultaneously. In this study, a newly granular active carbon-NdAMO-membrane bioreactor (GAC-NdAMO-MBR) system was established to evaluate its nitrogen removal efficiency, membrane fouling property and the probable strengthening mechanism was also uncovered. Results indicated that the nitrate removal rate in GAC-NdAMO-MBR reached 31.85 ± 3.19 mgN·L−1·d−1 while it was only 10.35 ± 2.02 mgN·L−1·d−1 in NdAMO-MBR system (lack of GAC), which was multiplied three-fold. The membrane flux decay rate of GAC- NdAMO -MBR was 0.15 L/m2·h·d while it was 0.49 L/m2·h·d without GAC, and the addition of GAC could extend membrane fouling time for 2.5 times. Notablely, the relative abundance of NdAMO bacteria sharply increased from 27.15% to 56.91% after GAC addition while the NdAMO archaea showed similar variation trend. The physicochemical property of GAC mainly contributed the strengthening effect. The porous structure of GAC absorbed methane and adhered by microorganism, which enhance microorganism amount and metabolic activity. The mechanical strength of GAC scoured membrane surface to mitigate external fouling and pores absorbed EPS to reduce internal fouling. The combined effects could improve NdAMO microorganism growth and metabolism activity and finally improved nitrogen removal performance and controlled membrane fouling. These findings could deep the knowledge of NdAMO process and help extend its application potential in environment science and engineering. © 2020 The Authors","Granular activated carbon; Mechanism; Membrane bioreactor; Nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation; Process properties","Activated carbon; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Decay (organic); Eutrophication; Global warming; Granular materials; Mechanisms; Membrane fouling; Metabolism; Methane; Microorganisms; Nitrates; Nitrogen removal; Oxidation; Physicochemical properties; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Environmental issues; Environmental problems; Granular activated carbons; Membrane bioreactor; Nitrogen removal efficiency; Process properties; Strengthening mechanisms; Membranes; activated carbon; granular activated carbon; methane; nitrogen; unclassified drug; charcoal; methane; activated carbon; bioreactor; fouling; membrane; metabolism; methane; microorganism; nitrate; oxidation; absorption; archaeon; Article; bacterium; bioprocess; community succession; fouling control; greenhouse gas; oxidation; priority journal; stoichiometry; anaerobic growth; artificial membrane; bioreactor; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Charcoal; Membranes, Artificial; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081976913

The combination of industrial symbiosis and urban symbiosis (IS/UrS) offers a new solution to environmental and ecological challenges for resource-dependent cities. To quantify the benefits of IS/UrS in resource-dependent cities, this study assessed triple benefits including environmental (raw materials saving and wastes reuse), reduced CO2 emission, and ecological (emergy saving) benefits via IS/UrS in Yongcheng (China) by combining material flow analysis and emergy analysis. The results indicate that a total of thirty-nine IS/UrS activities (including twenty-nine in-use and ten potential IS/UrS activities) are identified, which can achieve remarkable resources saving including 2.37 Mt slag substitution for feedstock mix in cement clinker production (96% from existing in-use activities), 0.43 Mt municipal solid waste reduction (100% from potential activities), 1.07 Mt coal saving (35% from potential activities), 4.88 Mt CO2 emission reduction (23% from potential activities) and 5.53E+21 sej emergy saving (17% from potential activities). Urban symbiosis activities can contribute additional CO2 reduction and emergy saving by 11% and 7% respectively. Based on the performance of CO2 reduction and emergy saving, recycling of slag/fly ash and scrap steel should be given top priority in the local IS/UrS policy making process. The case study shows that IS/UrS is a useful approach to facilitate the sustainable development of resource-dependent cities, and could be expanded to other similar cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emergy analysis; Industrial symbiosis; Material flow analysis; Resource-dependent cities; Urban symbiosis","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Municipal solid waste; Scrap metal reprocessing; Slags; Steel scrap; Sustainable development; Emergy analysis; Industrial symbiosis; Material flow analysis; Resource-dependent cities; Urban symbiosis; Coal deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078437482

In response to these challenges, “responsible research and innovation” (RRI) has emerged as a framework to critique and correct for technocratic governance of emerging technologies, and CE has emerged as a prime case of where it can be helpfully applied. However, a critical lens is rarely applied to RRI itself. In this review, we first survey how RRI thinking has already been applied to both carbon removal and sunlight reflection methods for climate intervention. We examine how RRI is employed in four types of activities: Assessment processes and reports, principles and protocols for research governance, critical mappings of research, and deliberative and futuring engagements. Drawing upon this review, we identify tensions in RRI practice, including whether RRI forms or informs choices, the positionalities of RRI practitioners, and ways in which RRI activities enable or disable particular climate interventions. Finally, we recommend that RRI should situate CE within the long arc of sociotechnical proposals for addressing climate change, more actively connect interrogations of the knowledge economy with reparative engagements, include local or actor-specific contexts, design authoritative assessments grounded in RRI, and go beyond treating critique and engagement as “de facto” governance.

NO2, SO2, PM10, temperature and relative humidity data were obtained from the South African Weather Services and the City of Cape Town. A case-crossover epidemiological study design and conditional logistic regression model were applied. Various cut-off values were applied to classify cold and warm days. In total, 54,818 CVD hospital admissions were included in the study. In general, on warm and cold days the 15–64 years old group was more at risk for CVD hospitalization with increasing air pollution levels compared to all ages combined or the ≥ 65 years old group. Females appeared to be more at risk than males with increasing PM10 levels. In contrast, males were more vulnerable to the effects of NO2 and SO2 than females. The study showed the modification effect of temperature on air pollution associated with CVD hospital admissions.

The sustainable forest management is a way to mitigate climate change owing to the carbon storage capacity of forests. This study highlights the priority of forest management according to the integrated assessment of carbon storage under anthropogenic impacts in the administrative units of Ecuador. In the obtained map, the provinces Guayas, Esmeraldas, and Manabí showed the highest values of 25, 22.85 and 19.9, respectively, followed by two Amazon provinces, Morona Santiago and Sucumbíos. Therefore, we concluded that deforestation, soil erosion, and carbon dioxide emissions were more pronounced on the coast mainly due to agriculture and livestock activities and the forests in these provinces must have priority management. This analysis is useful for planning environmental practices in order to increase carbon storage as a strategy of mitigation for global warming. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Ecology; Erosion; Global warming; Planning; Storage management; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic impacts; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon storage; Ecuador; Environmental practices; Integrated assessment; Soil erosion; Sustainable forest management; Environmental management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085911596

These services, often referred to as on-demand public transport, are aimed at meeting personal travel demands through the use of shared vehicles that run on flexible routes using advanced tools for dynamic scheduling. This paper presents an agent-based traffic simulation model that was developed to evaluate the performance of on-demand public transport and compare it with existing scheduled bus services using a case study of the inner city of Melbourne in Australia. The key performance measures used in the comparative evaluation included quality of service and passenger experience in terms of waiting times, the efficiency of service and operations in terms of hourly vehicle utilization, and system efficiency in terms of trip completion rates, passenger kilometers travelled and total passenger trip times. The results showed significant benefits for passengers who use on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services. The on-demand bus service was found to reduce average total passenger waiting times by 89% during the Morning Peak; by 78% during the Mid-Day period; by 81% during the Afternoon Peak; and by more than 95% during other periods of the day. From an operator's perspective, the on-demand services were found to achieve around 70% vehicle utilization rates during peak hours compared to a utilization rate not exceeding 16% for the scheduled bus services. Even during off-peak periods, the occupancies for on-demand services were almost twice the vehicle occupancies for scheduled bus services. In terms of system efficiency, the on-demand services achieved a trip completion rate of 85% compared to a trip completion rate of 67% for the scheduled bus services. The total passenger-kilometers travelled was similar for both scheduled and on-demand bus services, which refutes claims that on-demand bus services induce more kilometers of travel. The trip completion times were around 55% shorter for on-demand bus services compared to scheduled services, which represents a significant saving in travel time for users. Finally, the paper presents average emissions per completed trip for both types of services and shows a significant reduction in emissions for on-demand services compared to conventional bus services. These include, on average, a 48% reduction in CO2 emissions per trip; 82% reduction in NO emissions per trip; and 41% reduction in PM10 emissions per trip. These findings clearly demonstrate the superior benefits of on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services. © 2020 by the authors.","Agent-based modelling; Disruptive mobility; Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD); Shared mobility; Smart urban mobility; Sustainable public transport","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; demand analysis; particulate matter; perception; performance assessment; public transport; strategic approach; traffic congestion; traffic emission; transportation safety; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085592576

However, the effects of acid rain on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles of terrestrial ecosystems are still far from fully understood, though some studies have reported the sensitivity of living organisms and soil physicochemical properties to acidic conditions. Herein, we conducted intact soil core experiments to understand the effects of artificial acid rains of pH 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0 on soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes and microbial communities in an agricultural soil of southern China. We did not detect any effect of acid rain on CO2 and N2O fluxes as compared to the control; however, acid rain of pH 3.0 significantly reduced the cumulative CH4 flux from the soil. Most noticeably, both acid rains of pH 4.0 and pH 3.0 significantly increased the total amount of soil microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) by increasing the PLFA contents of gram-positive bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, though all the acid rain treatments did not change the relative abundance of microbial groups. In addition, both CO2 and CH4 fluxes negatively correlated with the total amount of soil microbial PLFAs; however, the N2O flux positively correlated to soil NO3 −-N contents (p &lt; 0.05). These results confirm the recent theoretical predictions that N-addition (e.g., by acid rain) may alter microbial C utilization pattern by allocating more C to the microbial biomass than to respiration. Overall, our results demonstrated that acid rain substantially altered the soil microbial biomass, and reduced the cumulative CH4 flux from the agricultural soil during the experimental period. Given these findings, we suggest further research to investigate the responses of soil greenhouse gas emissions and microbial communities to long-term acid rain exposures in the context of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acid deposition; Agricultural soils; Greenhouse gas emissions; Microorganisms; Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis","Acid rain; Agriculture; Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Fungi; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; pH effects; Phospholipids; Physicochemical properties; Soils; Acid deposition; Agricultural soils; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Gram-positive bacterium; Phospholipid fatty acids; Soil microbial biomass; Soil physico-chemical properties; Terrestrial ecosystems; Fatty acids; acid deposition; acid rain; agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; fatty acid; greenhouse gas; methane; microbial activity; microbial community; microorganism; nitrous oxide; soil carbon; Actinobacteria (class); Fungi; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078998936

In this study, the relationships between the boiling points of various planar PAHs and their thermodynamic properties are systematically investigated, to find a satisfactory marker for the phase transition event. Temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties, including entropy, specific heat capacity, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, are simultaneously calculated for PAHs, using density functional theory and three composite compound methods. Comparison of the results indicates that the individual G3 method, plus an atomization reaction approach, produces the most accurate thermochemistry parameters. Compared to entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, the specific heat capacity at 298 K is found to be a better marker for the boiling point of PAHs due to the observed linear correlation, predictable characteristics, and fidelity of accuracy as a function of temperature. The correlation equation Y = 10.996X + 122.111 is proposed (where Y is the boiling temperature (K) and X is Cp at 298 K (cal/K/mol)). The standard deviation is as low as 16.7 K when comparing the calculated boiling points and experimentally determined values for 25 different aromatic species ranging from benzene to ovalene (C32H14). The effects of carbon number, structural arrangement, and partial pressure on the boiling point of large planar PAH are discussed. The results reveal that the carbon number in large planar PAH is the dominant factor determining its boiling points. It is shown that PAHs containing about 60-65 carbon atoms are likely to exist as liquids in flames, although the partial pressure of such species is very low. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Boiling point; Carbon; Density functional theory; Enthalpy; Entropy; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Liquids; Soot; Specific heat; Boiling temperature; Correlation equation; Flame temperatures; Linear correlation; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Standard deviation; Structural arrangement; Temperature dependent; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084693096

However, the mechanisms underlying community assemblages and promoting temporal succession are often overlooked in microbial ecology, and comparisons of the relative roles of bacteria and fungi during long-term secondary succession are rare. Using both 16S and ITS rRNA gene sequencing, we studied shifts in bacterial and fungal communities in a well-established secondary successional chronosequence that spanned approximately 160 years in an ecosystem. Our results showed that the abundance of both bacteria and fungi increased with succession in the early stages but then reached a relatively stable state in later successional stages. Diversity showed a fairly linear increase with succession, and there were inconsistent changes between the bacterial and fungal communities. During succession, soil bulk density, soluble carbon, total nitrogen and plant richness had large effects on the microbial community. The abundance of most phyla showed parabolic trends with succession; however, Verrucomicrobia and Basidiomycota showed linear increases with succession, and Cercozoa and Chytridiomycota showed linear decreases with succession. These microbial taxa may be considered collaborative development microbial biomarkers of secondary succession. The predicted microbial functions related to C and N cycle genes showed corresponding changes in succession, which need further study. Our findings suggest that the relationships between soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities mutually influence one another, leading to their ongoing relationship in the course of secondary succession. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bacterial community; fungal community; high-throughput sequencing; secondary succession; soil physicochemical properties","Bacteria; Ecosystems; Genes; Physicochemical properties; RNA; Soils; Bacterial community; Fungal community; High-throughput sequencing; Secondary succession; Soil physico-chemical properties; Fungi; biomarker; community structure; microbial community; secondary succession; soil microorganism; Bacteria (microorganisms); Basidiomycota; Cercozoa; Chytridiomycota; Fungi; Verrucomicrobia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078763793

However, it remains unclear if climatic-niche evolution is similar in plants and animals or is intrinsically different. For example, previous authors have proposed that plants have broader environmental tolerances than animals but are more sensitive to climate change. Here, we test ten predictions about climatic-niche evolution in plants and animals, using phylogenetic and climatic data for 19 plant clades and 17 vertebrate clades (2,087 species total). Surprisingly, we find that for all ten predictions, plants and animals show similar patterns. For example, in both groups, climatic niches change at similar mean rates and species have similar mean niche breadths, and niche breadths show similar relationships with latitude across groups. Our results suggest that there are general ‘rules’ of climatic-niche evolution that span plants and animals, despite the fundamental differences in their biology. These results may help to explain why plants and animals have similar responses to climate change and why they often have shared species richness patterns, biogeographic regions, biomes and biodiversity hotspots. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; evolution; phylogeny; plant; Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Phylogeny; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083399174

Financial development may affect an economy and hence carbon emissions significantly. No research has examined their relationship since this crisis up to now. Against this background, the effect of financial development on carbon intensity in China from 2007 to 2016 is investigated. The spatial and temporal patterns, and the dynamic evolution of both China's provincial carbon emissions and financial development were firstly investigated. Then a Spatial Durbin Model was employed to explore the effects of financial development, since this crisis, on carbon intensity, controlling related variables. The results show that financial development will significantly increase the local province's emissions but significantly decrease adjacent areas' emissions to a larger extent, so that the overall effect is that financial development will curb carbon emissions. The paper concludes that carbon emission reductions in China since 2007 may not be caused by the financial resources being channeled into the research and development of emission-reduction technologies or into high value-added firms. Hence, it is suggested that measures be taken to channel financial resources into the right projects and firms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon intensity; Economic growth; Financial development; Kernel density distribution; Spatial econometric analysis","Carbon; Economic analysis; Emission control; Spatial variables measurement; Carbon intensity; Econometric analysis; Economic growths; Financial development; Kernel density; Finance; carbon emission; econometrics; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; financial crisis; modeling; spatiotemporal analysis; air analysis; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; economic aspect; economic development; economic recession; environmental impact; environmental policy; financial development; geographic distribution; priority journal; resource management; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078785590

Whether there is an association between high ambient air pollutant concentrations and PTB has not been fully explored. Methods: Bayesian spatial-temporal models were constructed to analyse the association between ambient air pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of ≤10 μm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) and PTB incidence, adjusting for socioeconomic covariates. We collected data on pulmonary TB, ambient air pollution (PM10, SO2 and NO2) concentrations and socioeconomic covariates from 17 prefectures in the central Chinese province of Hubei between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2015. Results: For every annual 10 μg/m3 increase in SO2, the relative risk (RR) of PTB incidence was 1.046 (95% credible interval [CI], 1.038-1.054) in the study area. Moreover, we found positive associations with each annual 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient air pollutants (PM10, SO2 and NO2) in females but only with SO2 in males. A significant association for each 10 μg/m3 increase in SO2 was observed in all the age groups, with a significant association for PM10 only in children under 14 years of age. A significant response relationship was also observed at a 0-1 month moving average lag for each 10 μg/m3 increase in SO2. Conclusions: High ambient air pollution concentrations in areas of developing countries might increase the risk of regional PTB incidence, especially for women and young people. Precautions and protective measures and efforts to reduce ambient air pollutant concentrations should be strengthened in developing countries. © 2020 The Author(s).","Air pollutants; Pulmonary tuberculosis; Spatial-temporal analysis","nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; age structure; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; child health; concentration (composition); developing world; disease incidence; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; tuberculosis; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; Article; Bayes theorem; child; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; disease association; environmental impact; female; groups by age; human; incidence; infant; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; newborn; particulate matter; pediatrics; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; socioeconomics; adverse event; air pollutant; Bayes theorem; environmental exposure; incidence; lung tuberculosis; middle aged; preschool child; spatiotemporal analysis; very elderly; young adult; China; Hubei; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Sulfur Dioxide; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084787818

Simulations at the scale of a 1000 household community and hourly intervals were used to find the optimal energy generation mix that minimises the total annual carbon emissions (embedded and operational). Three different locations in the UK were studied. Results show that the integrated idealised system is able to satisfy the heat demand for up to 63% of the time across a year with no carbon emissions, and reduce the annual associated CO2 by 60% when compared to all heat demand being satisfied by natural gas.

Second messengers, such as c-di-GMP and cAMP, participate in the regulation of biofilm formation. c-di-GMP is a major molecule that is involved in modulating the bacterial transition between a planktonic lifestyle and biofilm formation. Aside from regulating carbon catabolism repression in most bacteria, cAMP has also been found to mediate biofilm formation in many bacteria. Although the underlying mechanisms of biofilm formation mediated by cAMP-CRP have been well-investigated in several bacteria, the regulatory pathways of cAMP-CRP are still poorly understood compared to those of c-di-GMP. Moreover, some bacteria appear to form biofilm in response to changes in carbon source type or concentration. However, the relationship between the carbon metabolisms and biofilm formation remains unclear. This mini-review provides an overview of the cAMP-CRP-regulated pathways involved in biofilm formation in some bacteria. This information will benefit future investigations of the underlying mechanisms that connect between biofilm formation with nutrient metabolism, as well as the cross-regulation between multiple second messengers. © Copyright © 2020 Liu, Sun, Zhu, Liu and Liu.","biofilm; c-di-GMP; cAMP-CRP; carbon catabolite repression; second messengers","C reactive protein; cyclic AMP; tricarboxylic acid; bacterial virulence; biofilm; carbon metabolism; carbon source; catabolite repression; cell migration; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli; extracellular matrix; gene control; gene expression; Klebsiella pneumoniae; nonhuman; osmolarity; osmotic stress; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Review; Serratia marcescens; signal transduction; Yersinia pestis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085502001

Because of the synergy between the well-dispersed Fe active species and the Brønsted acidic framework of zeolites, the Fe-containing ZSM-5 catalyst displayed excellent catalytic performance, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation data indicated that capturing NH3 was the main factor that mediates the NH3-SCR process. In addition, the resultant zeolite catalysts exhibited a good resistance to SO2 and H2O, which was very competitive for practical application to reduce NOx emissions. Furthermore, in situ DRIFT measurements revealed that the generation of inactive nitrate species led to the decrease of zeolite activity in a high-temperature region.

Here, an adaptive method is proposed to estimate BLH from measurements of radar wind profilers (RWPs) in Beijing (BJ), Nanjing (NJ), Chongqing (CQ), and Wulumuqi (WQ), China, during the summer of 2019. Validation against simultaneous BLH estimates from radiosondes (RSs) yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.66, indicating that the method can be used to derive BLH from RWPs. Diurnal variations of BLH and the ventilation coefficient (VC) at four sites were then examined. A distinct diurnal cycle of BLH was observed over all four cities; BLH gradually increased from sunset, reached a maximum in the afternoon, and then dropped sharply after sunset. The maximum hourly average BLH (1.426 ± 0.46 km) occurred in WQ, consistent with the maximum hourly mean VC larger than 5000 m2/s observed there. By comparison, the diurnal variation of VC was not strong, with values ranging between 2000 and 3000 m2/s, likely owing to the high-humidity environment. Furthermore, surface sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and dry mass of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) concentrations were found to somehow affect the vertical structure of wind and thermodynamic features, leading to a difference between RS and RWP BLH estimates. This indicates that the atmospheric environment can affect BLH estimates using RWP data. The BLH results from RWPs were better in some specific cases. These findings show great potential of RWP measurements in air quality research, and will provide key data references for policy-making toward emission reductions. © 2020 by the authors.","Boundary layer height; Radar wind profiler; Radiosonde; Remote sensing","Air; Air quality; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric movements; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Emission control; Heat flux; Radar; Aerodynamic diameters; Atmospheric environment; Boundary layer heights; Correlation coefficient; High-humidity environment; Radar wind profilers; Relative contribution; Vertical structures; Radar measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085579625

Determination of the product carbon footprint (CF), identifying carbon hotspots and examining ways for CF reduction is an essential step towards mitigation actions. Viticulture and winemaking are very important for the economy of Mediterranean regions, especially for the sustainability of rural areas. To determine the CF for wine, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was adopted with system boundaries from vineyard to market. Input data were collected from 20 vineyards on the island of Cyprus, where the indigenous Xynisteri variety is cultivated and from an SME winery that uses the grapes to produce wine. The winery CF was 99,586 kg CO2-eq for 76,000 bottles produced (1.31 kg/0.75 L bottle). The uncertainty factor was determined to be ±50%, which was considered adequate for the methodology followed. The share of electrical energy was 46%, of packaging 18% and of the vineyard 16%. Fuel (transportation and heating), as well as waste management (solid and wastewater) contributed 10% each to the CF. There is potential for mitigation of the CF by replacing the bottles currently used by lighter ones, lowering the energy use and reusing a part of the solid waste as fertilizer. Research towards eco-innovation of viticulture/winemaking is essential for reducing the footprint of the sector to promote sustainable wine production. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon balance; Grapes; Greenhouse gases; LCA; Sustainable winemaking","Bottles; Breweries; Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Waste management; Wine; Electrical energy; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mediterranean region; Product carbon footprints; System boundary; Temperature rise; Uncertainty factors; Wine production; Carbon footprint; carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; international agreement; life cycle analysis; pollution policy; viticulture; wine industry; Cyprus; Vitaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085500064

In order to explore the characteristics of CH4 and N2O emissions from rice field in the Northeast cold region, this paper takes rice field in Qing'an County of Heilong'iang Province as the research object, and three factors as water, nitrogen fertilizer and biocarbon are selects. In this paper, the DNDC model is used to simulate and estimate the CH4 and N2O emissions under traditional management and optimization modes. The results show that the CH4 emissions in the optimized mode reduced by 54.64% compared with the traditional model, which is from rice fields in the county during the growing season. Under the optimized model, the N2O emissions during the growing season of rice fields in the county were reduced by 20.45% compared with the traditional model. The results of sensitivity factor analysis show that the effect of water depth on CH4 emissions from rice field is positively correlated, while the effect on N2O emissions is reversed. The total amount of nitrogen fertilization in the test range showed a certain inhibitory effect on rice field CH4 emissions, and it significantly promoted N2O emissions. The growth of biocarbon would inhibit rice field CH4 and N2O emissions. The results provide a scientific basis, which scientifically estimates greenhouse gas emissions from rice fields in China and formulates strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cold temperate rice fields. © 2020 Parlar Scientific Publications.

Due to the uneven management level and especially the major fossil fuel production process, the Chinese textile industry needs to be transformed and upgraded for emission-reduction as a national backbone industry. Using a global meta-frontier approach founded on a non-radial distance function, energy performance is measured at the provincial level from 1985 to 2016. Given the study's long interval, all data samples in different statistical calibers are successively adjusted and standardized. From different spatial and time scales, the dynamic energy efficiency goes up and becomes more balanced over time in three geographical regions of China. Examined by statistics, the study also reveals that during the implementation of low-carbon textile policies, the energy performance improved significantly, which mainly benefits from speeding up of technological innovation. Besides, the dynamic performance of the eastern region rises by 11.347%, while the central and western regions obtain a higher growth rate of 27.295% and 32.980% respectively.

As the most important part of household energy consumption, electricity and its demand-side management play fundamental roles when exploring the methods of energy reform in China. Based on the framework of household production theory, this paper estimates the elasticities of Chinese residential electricity from 2006 to 2016 by using the data of 286 cities, and the first difference generalized method of moment estimator is employed. The results show that the demand for residential electricity is inelastic to price and is mainly affected by total expenditure, price of appliance and temperature. We also find that factors impacting electricity consumption vary among regions, and the demand is elastic to price change with the samples of the lowest domestic product. With the elasticity we estimated, a Ramsey tariff is calculated and compared with the current tariff, and the subsidy for residential electricity consumption is also analyzed. Based on the results, we propose to raise the price appropriately, and suggest the implementation of diversified pricing schemes according to regional characteristics to control the consumption by realizing the price mechanism, and to promote energy-saving and emission reduction in the residential sector. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Elasticity; Ramsey tariff; Residential electricity consumption; Subsidy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079015187

It is necessary to assess the air quality and health impacts of E10 gasoline in China. This study compares two E10 gasoline fuels, ELA (lower content of aromatics) and ELO (lower content of olefins), assuming 100% utilization in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Yangtze-River Delta (YRD) regions in 2030. We found that reduced emissions of primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and increased emissions of NOX could be achieved by using both E10 fuels. For nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), on-road emissions would be increased by 8% under Scenario ELA and reduced by 3% under Scenario ELO because of the different impacts of the two E10 fuels on evaporation. By using an atmospheric chemical transport model, the annual average reduction in PM2.5 concentrations is estimated to reach nearly 0.2 μg m−3 in the urban areas under Scenario ELO, while the benefit of the decline of the ambient PM2.5 concentrations is smaller under Scenario ELA (&lt;0.1 μg m−3). E10 fuels could increase ambient NO2 concentrations, and the greatest increase, up to 0.4–0.5 μg m−3 (0.7%–1.5%), is estimated to occur in Beijing. For ozone (O3) formation, the impacts of the two E10 fuels are different. Scenario ELA is estimated to increase ambient O3 concentrations while Scenario ELO would help reduce O3, both exhibiting VOC-limited characteristics. We further found that positive health impacts could be achieved by using E10 fuels based on the estimated mortality attributable to long-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 and O3. 1015 (679–1258) and 790 (522–991) premature deaths are estimated to be avoided in the BTH and YRD regions, respectively, by using the ELO fuel. Future analysis is recommended to investigate detailed species-resolved emissions, more fuel formulas and future vehicle technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality simulation; China; Ethanol blended fuels; Gasoline; Mortality; Vehicle emissions","Air quality; Blending; Ethanol; Gasoline; Health; Urban transportation; Volatile organic compounds; Chemical transport models; Ethanol-blended gasoline; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Long term exposure; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; PM2.5 concentration; Vehicle technology; Yangtze river delta; Ethanol fuels; alcohol; alkene; butanol; gasoline; hydrocarbon; nitrate; nitric oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; estimation method; ethanol; fuel; government; health impact; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; air pollution; air quality; alcohol production; Article; cerebrovascular accident; China; chronic obstructive lung disease; death; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; ischemic heart disease; long term exposure; lung cancer; mortality; mortality rate; particulate matter; priority journal; urban area; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082863156

By comparing the efficiency values of the two indices of installed capacity and CO2 emission reduction, we are able to analyze the differences between installed hydropower electricity generation capacity efficiency and carbon emission reduction efficiency in various provinces and cities. The findings show that the western region is the best, followed by the central region and then the eastern region in terms of the input-output index level, total efficiency score of hydropower, and comparison of installed capacity-carbon emission reduction efficiency. Natural water resources and geographical advantages have a great positive effect on hydropower efficiency, while economic development has little effect on it.

This study compares the spatial characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations and CO2 emissions using 10 km × 10 km grid data. The increase and decrease of CO2 emissions and PM2.5 concentrations are divided into four quadrants, which indicates four different conditions. Then, spatial autocorrelation method is conducted to analysis the spatial relationships. The empirical results show that (1) In the four quadrants, the increase of CO2 emissions and the decrease of PM2.5 concentrations accounted for the highest proportion (25.9%). (2) The spatial differences in CO2 emissions are large, but the PM2.5 concentrations show strong spatial aggregation. (3) China's three major urban agglomerations contain more than half of the areas in which both CO2 emissions and PM2.5 concentrations increased, and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration exhibits the best synergistic reduction effect. By contrast, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei urban agglomeration has the worst synergistic reduction of CO2 emissions and PM2.5 concentrations. (4) At the urban level, as a typical city in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei urban agglomeration, Tianjin's overreliance on heavy chemical industries has led to co-increases in its CO2 emissions and PM2.5 concentrations. Shaoxing and Jiangmen, in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration, are among the few cities where CO2 emissions and PM2.5 concentrations have both been reduced.

ZEHs with wide implementation of HEMS are expected to provide energy and cost-saving chances and are playing more as prosumers under collaboratively designed power-pricing schemes. This research focused on investigating the techno-economic performance of real ZEH applications in Japan. Firstly, we introduced the current technological innovations and coordinated smart management strategies to optimize the cost or energy-saving performance of the ZEHs. Then, we illustrated the operational performances of four typical ZEHs focused on the power of self-sufficiency and dynamic power balance. Meanwhile, we examined the role of HEMS in managing integrated on-site generators based on how they operated according to historical data. Results indicated that day-ahead prediction helped enhance the matching scenario between daily thermal consumption and preproduction of heat pumps, fuel cells could respond effectively to changes in simultaneous electricity and heating loads, and cogeneration systems could enhance the local electricity self-sufficiency ratio and reduce net load fluctuations, especially under high heating demand periods. We also concluded that efficient performance of ZEHs is not just a matter of advanced technologies but is also highly dependent on real-time demand-side management and local load-matching scenarios. Finally, we analyzed and compared the impacts of integrated on-site generators among ZEHs on improving economic and environmental performance from an overall energy system. The analysis indicated that PV contributed to a significant ratio of annual ZEH's economic profit.

Based on the severe air polluted region in China, that is Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, this evaluation model consists of four parts, including economic benefits, public service, government management and development potential, and uses the balanced scorecard theory. The weights of the indexes are measured by comprehensive evaluation method, which combined entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). To test the applicability of the evaluation method to different stages, back propagation (BP) neural network is introduced to simulate air pollution control in the future. The results reveal that the environmental performance of air pollution control in Beijing had an upward trend during 2010–2016, and the trend would continue in the next five years. The environmental performance of Tianjin continuously increased, especially from 2014 to 2016. Tianjin has great potential of air pollution control in the future. The environmental performance of air pollution control in Hebei fluctuated from 2010 to 2016 and it dropped to the lowest level in 2015, which mainly due to the large increase in number of days with air quality levelⅡor above compared with 2014 and the nonsignificant growth in the amount of expenditure on atmospheric prevention and control, the amount of investment in the control of industrial pollution sources and the number of law enforcement personnel. Moreover, the environmental performance of air pollution control closely related with industrial structure, especially with the proportion of the tertiary industry. The upgrading of urban industrial structure and the coordinated development of green industry should be implemented to restructure the environmental transformation in air-polluted region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control; Balanced scorecard; BP neural network; Entropy weight method and AHP; Environmental performance evaluation","Air quality; Analytic hierarchy process; Backpropagation; Economics; Entropy; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Hierarchical systems; Investments; Neural networks; Quality control; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Back propagation neural networks; Balanced scorecards; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; BP neural networks; Entropy weight method; Environmental performance evaluations; Law enforcement personnel; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078060198

Minimizing the lifecycle cost of the system while ensuring the thermal comfort of the pool are considered as the optimization objectives. The volume of phase change material storage tank and the heating capacity of air-source heat pumps are selected as design variables. To improve computational efficiency, surrogate models are developed using the response surface approach, in which the dataset is generated from the simulation platform established using MATLAB and TRNSYS. Generic algorithm and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II are adopted to conduct single-objective and double-objective optimizations, respectively. Case studies indicate that optimal combinations for the size of main components can be identified using the proposed optimization approach.

In order to avoid the problem of two efficiency decomposition terms which includes the best practice gap ratio and technical gap ratio greater than 1, the non-radial directional distance function is modified. The results are concluded as follows: (1) Carbon emissions efficiency in China's construction industry is at low level and grows rapidly during 2004–2017, the potential for CO2 emission reduction is huge. (2) Decomposition analysis reveals that the increase of NMTCPI principally attributed to technical progress. Technical efficiency has gone through a process of first decline and then rise, which means that the construction industry has changed from extensive development to a low-carbon development model. However, the regional technology gap continues to widen after 2011. (3) Different regions have different driving forces. The improvement of carbon emission efficiency in the eastern region comes from the narrowing technical gap and technical progress, while the increase of carbon emission efficiency in the central and western regions is due to rapid technical progress. For most provinces in western group, the sharp decline in technical efficiency hinders the growth of carbon emission efficiency. © 2020","China's construction industry; Metafrontier; Non-radial DDF; Technology gap; Total factor carbon emissions performance","Construction industry; Efficiency; Emission control; Carbon emission efficiencies; Carbon emissions; Directional distance function; Efficiency decomposition; Low-carbon development; Metafrontier; Non-radial DDF; Technology gap; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079182566

However, three existing research gaps prevent a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the IGD level. These gaps include the ignorance of the underlying conditions, lack of spatio-temporal comparability in the IGD indicator system, and absence of more reasonable assumptions within the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and slack-based measure (SBM) methods. The main goals of this study are to propose an improved evaluation framework to fill these gaps and to provide new knowledge by analyzing the IGD status, weaknesses, and spatio-temporal differences. With the collected panel data across 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2015, the following findings were revealed based on the proposed evaluation framework: 1) both the performance and quality of IGD increased but their growth rates had significantly declined in the later years; 2) pollution abatement had the maximum improvement, followed by low-carbon production, resource reduction, and economic operation; 3) coastal provinces had higher performance and quality of IGD than inland provinces, especially for low-carbon production and pure technical efficiency; 4) provinces with higher IGD performance usually had higher pure technical efficiency, but not scale efficiency; 5) the traditional evaluation framework either significantly overestimated or underestimated the IGD efforts in some provinces. Our findings highlight the importance of differentiated policies between coastal provinces and inland provinces or between high-IGD-performance/quality provinces and low-IGD-performance/quality provinces, as well as call for effective measures in response to slowing growth. Moreover, our methodology can comprehensively and accurately evaluate the IGD level by applying an extensive process considering underlying conditions/inputs, a spatio-temporal indicator system, and new integrated methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Epsilon-based measure; Evaluation framework; Indicator system; Industrial green development; Underlying conditions","Carbon; Efficiency; Pollution; Telecommunication industry; Epsilon-based measure; Evaluation framework; Indicator system; Industrial green development; Underlying conditions; Quality control; abatement cost; economic growth; environmental indicator; industrial development; instrumentation; natural resource; panel data; performance assessment; pollution control; research work; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077945201

Much effort has been devoted to mitigating air pollution in China leading to a significant reduction in primary pollutants emissions from 2013 to 2017, while a continuously worsening trend of surface ozone (O3, a secondary pollutant and greenhouse gas) was observed over the same period. Atmospheric oxidation, dominated by daytime reactions involving hydroxyl radicals (OH), is the critical process to convert freshly-emitted compounds into secondary pollutants, and is underestimated in current models of China's air pollution. Halogens (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) are known to profoundly influence oxidation chemistry in the marine environment; however, their impact on atmospheric oxidation and air pollution in China is unknown. In the present study, we report for the first time that halogens substantially enhance the total atmospheric oxidation capacity in polluted areas of China, typically 10% to 20% (up to 87% in winter) and mainly by significantly increasing OH level. The enhanced oxidation along the coast is driven by oceanic emissions, and that over the inland areas by anthropogenic emission. The extent and seasonality of halogen impact are largely explained by the dynamics of Asian monsoon, location and intensity of halogen emissions, and O3 formation regime. The omission of halogen emissions and chemistry may lead to significant errors in historical re-assessments and future projections of the evolution of atmospheric oxidation in polluted regions. ©2020.

Winter snowfall is an important source of water during early spring in these water-limited ecosystems, and it can also affect nutrient supply. However, we know little about how changes in winter snowfall will affect ecosystem productivity and plant community structure during the growing season. Here, we conducted a 5-year winter snow manipulation experiment in a temperate grassland in Inner Mongolia. We measured ecosystem carbon flux from 2014 to 2018 and plant biomass and species composition from 2015 to 2018. We found that soil moisture increased under deepened winter snow in early growing season, particularly in deeper soil layers. Deepened snow increased the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and reduced intra- and inter-annual variation in NEE. Deepened snow did not affect aboveground plant biomass (AGB) but significantly increased root biomass. This suggested that the enhanced NEE was allocated to the belowground, which improved water acquisition and thus contributed to greater stability in NEE in deep-snow plots. Interestingly, the AGB of grasses in the control plots declined over time, resulting in a shift towards a forb-dominated system. Similar declines in grass AGB were also observed at three other locations in the region over the same time frame and are attributed to 4 years of below-average precipitation during the growing season. By contrast, grass AGB was stabilized under deepened winter snow and plant community composition remained unchanged. Hence, our study demonstrates that increased winter snowfall may stabilize arid grassland systems by reducing resource competition, promoting coexistence between plant functional groups, which ultimately mitigates the impacts of chronic drought during the growing season. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","community composition; net ecosystem exchange; plant biomass; semiarid grassland; stability; winter snow cover","biomass; carbon flux; community composition; community structure; drought; global warming; grassland; net ecosystem exchange; snow cover; soil moisture; China; Nei Monggol; Poaceae; snow; China; ecosystem; grassland; season; China; Ecosystem; Grassland; Seasons; Snow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082186863

In this work, we demonstrate a significant correlation between the selectivity of CO2R to formate and the duration of tin (Sn) electrodeposition over a cuprous oxide (Cu2O)-derived substrate. A Sn electrodeposition time of 120 s led to a cathode with a formate Faradaic efficiency of around 81% at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which was more than 37% higher than those of the Sn foil and the sample treated for 684 s. This result highlights the significant role of the interface between deposited Sn and the cuprous-derived substrate in determining the selectivity of CO2R. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra revealed that the residual cuprous species at the Cu/Sn interfaces could stabilize Sn species in oxidation states of 2+ and 4+, a mixture of which is essential for a selective formate conversion. Such modulation effects likely arise from the moderate electronegativity of the cuprous species that is lower than that of Sn2+ but higher than that of Sn4+. Our work highlights the significant role of the substrate in the selectivity of the deposited catalyst and provides a new avenue to advance selective electrodes for CO2 electrochemical reduction. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","catalyst substrate; CO2 electrochemical reduction; electronegativity; formate production; tin electrocatalyst","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical bonds; Copper oxides; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodeposition; Electrolytic reduction; Electronegativity; Interface states; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Tin oxides; Electrochemical reductions; Faradaic efficiencies; High resolution; Modulation effects; Oxidation state; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Selective electrodes; X ray photoelectron spectra; Tin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085265380

This study proposes an innovative method integrating Geographic Information System (GIS), fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and fuzzy VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) for site selection of wind farms in the Wafangdian region, China. The uncertainties caused by subjective judgments of the stakeholders were tackled by the FAHP method firstly, where weight values of six criteria were identified. Next, the fuzzy VIKOR method and GIS tool were used to generate the Qi value of each location for ranking their appropriate degrees for wind energy development. The results demonstrated that the middle and upper parts of the studied area are suitable for the exploitation of wind energy, while the central and eastern areas are unfavorable. The influences exerted by various weight combinations and climate change on a site suitability assessment were examined. The resulting comparison with existing wind farms reflected the practicability and reliability of the proposed method; the estimation of climate change impacts on site selection provided the suggestion and support of a long-term plan for wind power development, and even the energy structure adjustment scheme adapted to climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

Understanding the biophysical effects and identifying the potential of vegetation will help to mitigate climate change. Here, we propose a vegetation-adjusted temperature index to understand how terrestrial vegetation growth in China affects the air temperature for 2001–2013, based on satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index, near-surface air temperature (Ta) and the land surface temperature. Grassland growth and cropland growth are found to cool the Ta by −0.08 ± 0.32 °C (mean ± one standard deviation) and −0.06 ± 0.28 °C, respectively. Forest growth results in net climate warming by 0.05 ± 0.29 °C. Biophysical effects, elevation and background climate are used to explain the climate impacts of vegetation. Results show that the biophysical effects dominate the climate impact. More specifically, evapotranspiration (ET) controls the daytime climate impact, and at night, an indirect effect of albedo (the release of daytime heat storage) dominates it. Lower precipitation, temperature and elevation reinforce the warming potential. Moreover, the effects of albedo and ET on climate are nonlinear. During the day, although lower albedo absorbs more incoming radiation, it releases more extra heat per unit ET that can compensate for the increased incoming radiation. At night, the warming effect reflects the release of daytime heat storage. Overall, tropical vegetation growth (−0.04 ± 0.10 °C) and warm temperate vegetation growth (−0.08 ± 0.15 °C) achieve the climatic benefits. Overall, the method proposed contributes to quantitatively evaluate the role of afforestation plan on regional climate cooling, and provides some policy/practical implications for future afforestation projects. Future afforestation projects should carefully consider the biophysical process and background climate to mitigate climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biophysical effects; Climate mitigation; MODIS; Remote sensing; Terrestrial vegetation; VATI","afforestation; air temperature; biophysics; climate change; cooling; evapotranspiration; MODIS; regional climate; remote sensing; vegetation structure; afforestation; air temperature; albedo; article; biophysics; China; climate warming; cooling; cropland; evapotranspiration; forest; grassland; heat; night; precipitation; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; vegetation; China; China; Climate Change; Forests; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080068696

The analysis based on the biochemical methane potential test model indicated that the methane production potential (B0) and hydrolysis coefficient (k) decreased at nearly all tested conditions. The reactor digestate with microplastics retained higher organic matter and nutrient concentration and had slightly lower dewaterability than the control. The inhibition of methane production potential could be attributed to the incomplete digestion with the existence of microplastics.

Energy industry is a key field for greenhouse gas emission, and investment in the energy industry plays a crucial part in promoting the low-carbon development of China's energy industry. Energy investment can effectively break the high carbon ″lock-in effect″ of energy industry and achieve the low-carbon development of energy industry by guiding, regulating and gathering social funds into the field of cleaner production and the field of low-carbon technology. Based on the unified framework of energy, economy and environment, this article takes 30 provinces in China as the research object, and constructs a spatial econometric model to investigate the impact of energy investment and economic growth on carbon emission reduction. The results indicate that both energy investment and economic growth are responsible for the increase of China's provincial CO2 emissions, but their driving mechanisms are significantly different.

Numerous correction algorithms have been introduced to minimize the artifacts due to the presence of the filter in these instruments. However, from our recent studies conducted during the Fire Influence on Regional and Global Environments Experiment (FIREX) laboratory campaign, corrected filter-based Babs remains biased high by roughly a factor of 2.5 when compared to a reference value using a photoacoustic instrument for biomass burning emissions. Similar overestimations of Babs from filterbased instruments exist when implementing the algorithms on 6 months of ambient data from the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) user facility from 2013 (factor of roughly 3). In both datasets, we observed an apparent dependency on single-scattering albedo (SSA) and the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) in the agreement between Babs based on existing correction factors and the reference Babs. Consequently, we developed a new correction approach that is applicable to any filter-based absorption photometer that includes light transmission from the filter-based instrument as well as the derived AAE and SSA. For the FIREX and SGP datasets, our algorithm results in good agreement between all corrected filter-based Babs values from different filter-based instruments and the reference (slopes ≈ 1 and R2 ≈ 0:98 for biomass burning aerosols and slopes ≈ 1:05 and R2 ≈ 0:65 for ambient aerosols). Moreover, for both the corrected Babs and the derived optical properties (SSA and AAE), our new algorithms work better or at least as well as the two common correction algorithms applied to a particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP).

Due to the influence of the scale effect, a systematic evaluation of the CE at different scales will help to develop more reasonable strategies for low-carbon urban planning. However, corresponding studies are still lacking. Hence, two administrative scales (e.g., region and county) in Chongqing were selected as experimental objects to compare and analyze the CE at different scales using the spatiotemporal coupling and coupling coordination models. The results show that urban land and carbon emissions presented a significant growth trend in Chongqing at different scales from 2000 to 2015. The strength of the spatiotemporal coupling relationship between urban land and total carbon emissions gradually increased with increasing scale. At the regional scale, the high coupling coordination between urban land and total carbon emissions was mainly concentrated in the urban functional development region. Additionally, the high coupling coordination between urban land and carbon emission intensity (OI) was still located in the counties within the metropolitan region of Chongqing, but the low OI was mainly distributed in the counties in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Chongqing at the county level. This study illustrates the multiscale trend of CE and suggests differentiated urban land and carbon emission reduction policies for controlling urban land sprawl and reducing carbon emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

Through this mechanism, it is expected that the role of the community in forest management will be stronger and the benefits of forests to improve community welfare can be realized. This study aims to determine the impacts of community forestry programs and also to observe further how the community rehabilitates marginal forest areas as an effort to reduce the effects of climate change. Surveys, FGD and interviews to stakeholders and community groups that obtain forest management rights are conducted to collect data. The research-results explain that community-forestry-permit provides a freedom for the community, hence they could manage the land optimally. The implementation of community forestry still requires assistance from local government as a facilitator so that the programs carried out are truly useful and provide optimal results. Furthermore, the establishment of institutions, program design, and planning in the management system also still needs to be strengthened. The term of climate change has not been widely known by the community in rural areas of South Sumatra. However, they have realized the impact of climate change. Rehabilitation activities and several efforts to increase the number of land cover in community forestry area will be an opportunity to improve the ecosystems condition, mitigate the climate change and diversify commodity choices of the community for better livelihoods. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Forestry; Rural areas; Timber; Climate change mitigation; Community forestry; Community group; Forest management systems; Local government; Management systems; Rehabilitation activities; Research results; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086579563

Properly managing plantations requires accurate information about stand timber stocks. In this study, we used the area (ABA) and individual tree (ITD) based approaches for estimating stem volume in fast-growing Eucalyptus spp forest plantations. Herein, we propose a new method to improve individual tree detection (ITD) in dense canopy homogeneous forests and assess the effects of stand age, slope and scan angle on ITD accuracy. Field and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were collected in Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis even-aged forest stands located in the mountainous region of the Rio Doce Valley, southeastern Brazil. We tested five methods to estimate volume from LiDAR-derived metrics using ABA: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and linear and Gompertz models. LiDAR-derived canopy metrics were selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm and Spearman's correlation, for nonparametric and parametric methods, respectively. For the ITD, we tested three ITD methods: two local maxima filters and the watershed method. All methods were tested adding our proposed procedure of Tree Buffer Exclusion (TBE), resulting in 35 possibilities for treetop detection. Stem volume for this approach was estimated using the Schumacher and Hall model. Estimated volumes in both ABA and ITD approaches were compared to the field observed values using the F-test. Overall, the ABA with ANN was found to be better for stand volume estimation (ryŷ = 0.95 and RMSE = 14.4%). Although the ITD results showed similar precision (ryŷ = 0.94 and RMSE = 16.4%) to the ABA, the results underestimated stem volume in younger stands and in gently sloping terrain (<25%). Stem volume maps also differed between the approaches; ITD represented the stand variability better. In addition, we discuss the importance of LiDAR metrics as input variables for stem volume estimation methods and the possible issues related to the ABA and ITD performance. © 2020 by the authors.","Eucalyptus; LiDAR; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Tree detection","Decision trees; Forestry; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Carbon sequestration; Eucalyptus plantations; Even-aged forest stands; Individual tree detections; Light detection and ranging; Mountainous regions; Recursive feature elimination; Southeastern Brazil; Optical radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085996346

It is found that the precipitation records over southern China exhibit relatively weak long-term correlation characteristics. The scaling exponents in coastal areas are close to 0.6 showing long-term correlation while in inland areas, uncorrelation can be found with the scaling exponents close to 0.5. Based on the long-term correlation characteristics of the observed precipitation records, the performance of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1) in simulating precipitation over southern China is evaluated and the results show that the CESM1 can simulate the internal dynamics characteristics of precipitation series in southern China. As indicated by the DFA results of simulated precipitation data from CESM1, the long-term correlation of precipitation records during the late-21st century (2071–2100) will increase in the Huai river basin under the RCP8.5 simulation scenario in summer and decrease in most regions of southern China under both the RCP8.5 and RCP8.5_FixA scenarios in comparison with the present condition (1987–2016). Additionally, the differences of precipitation scaling exponents between the RCP8.5 and RCP8.5_FixA simulation scenarios further indicate that the future reduced aerosols emissions will contribute to strengthening the long-term correlation of precipitation records in the Huai river basin in summer. Compared to present condition, the precipitation scaling exponents will increase by more than 0.1 during the late-21st century. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosols; Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA); Precipitation","Aerosols; Precipitation (chemical); Watersheds; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Earth system model; Internal dynamics; Long-term correlations; Potential impacts; Precipitation data; Precipitation scaling; Scaling exponent; Scaling laws",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077714080

Here, alpine ice-cores were used to document cadmium and lead pollution in western Europe between 1890 and 2000. The ice-core trends show that while lead pollution largely from leaded gasoline reached a maximum in ~1975 as expected, cadmium pollution primarily from zinc smelters peaked in the early-1980s rather than in ~1965 and was up to fourfold higher than estimated after 1975. Comparisons between ice-core trends, estimated past emissions, and state-of-the-art atmospheric aerosol transport and deposition modeling suggest that the estimated decreases in cadmium emissions after 1970 were based on overly optimistic emissions reductions from the introduction of pollution control devices and other technological improvements. © 2020.

In this review, we synthesize literature relating to 8- to 19-year-old's perceptions and understandings of climate change, in order to identify trends and inconsistencies, potential gaps in knowledge, and directions for future research. A comprehensive search strategy identified 51 international studies, using quantitative (n = 36), qualitative (n = 9), and mixed methods (n = 6). The included studies date from 1993 to 2018. The analysis outlines levels of reported belief and concern about climate change and perceptions of its causes and consequences. It also details reported perceptions of viable solutions to climate change and notions of responsibility for implementing these. Scientifically accurate knowledge generally increased with age, although misconceptions persisted across the age range. In some studies, younger children expressed greater concern and were more willing to take action than older adolescents. Levels of belief, concern, and willingness to take action were lower in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia than in other countries. In conclusion, we discuss potential explanations for these age and place-related differences, examining the age-related findings in the context of concepts and theories in developmental psychology. We outline the limitations of our review and the reviewed studies, and note potential avenues for future research and implications for educational policy and practice.

We simulated the effect of organic matter addition (manure and compost) on all cropland soils in Switzerland, with reduced tillage and winter cover cropping in combination. The DayCent model was run for the period 1991–2013 by accounting for factors such as soils, land use, and climate to evaluate alternative practices. Converting conventional cropping with only chemical fertilizers to organic cropping led to a regional mitigation in soil GHG emissions by 0.34–1.10 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1. Soil organic C (SOC) stocks increased by 104–259 kg C ha−1 yr−1, accounting for 86–100% of the GHG mitigation. Adopting organic practices with reduced tillage or cover cropping increased SOC stocks up to 433 kg C ha−1 yr−1. Our results suggest that the alternative practices could reverse C decline in conventional soils, predicted to be −241 kg C ha−1 yr−1. Organic practices combined with reduced tillage or cover cropping had varying effects on N2O emissions, ranging from a mean decrease of −0.60 kg N ha−1 yr−1 to an increase of 0.29 kg N ha−1 yr−1. Model results suggest the need to deliver mitigation that is more permanent with the careful combination of alternative practices. Also, risks such as increased N2O emission, especially when using organic amendments with high N decomposition potential, and yield penalty must be managed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","N2O emissions regional DAYCENT simulation; Organic cropping; Residue management; Soil organic C; Tillage","agricultural management; agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; crop residue; farming system; greenhouse gas; organic carbon; organic farming; simulation; soil carbon; soil organic matter; tillage; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082191678

Multi-actor collaboration usually characterizes the drafting of regional plans, which act as bridges between national and local administrative levels. Regional administrations address resilience issues, through spatial planning processes. This study focuses on the regional plans adopted by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia (Italy), south European Mediterranean region, an area that will be negatively affected by climate change in the coming decades. We aim at proposing a method for scrutinizing regional plans related to spatial planning issues, by using criteria rooted in the scientific literature and adaptation strategies. We found out that (i) the scientific literature did not sufficiently address the role of regional plans in the context of adaptation to climate change and (ii) the method proposed and applied in this study highlights whether some key adaptation issues are included in the plans, and might make aware planners and policy makers of basic information concerning the interplay 'regional planning vs. adaptation to climate change'. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation to climate change; Climate change; Content analysis; Scrutiny of regional plans; Spatial planning","adaptive management; climate change; literature review; policy making; regional planning; spatial planning; Italy; Sardinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085998859

Three composite indicators for financial inclusion are constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) based on normalized variables. To estimate the model, we adopted the Hoechle (2007) procedure which produces Driscoll-Kraay standard errors for linear panel models that are not only heteroskedasticity consistent but also robust to general forms of cross-sectional dependence. We find that income, energy consumption, industrialization, urbanization, FDI and financial inclusion appear to have led to higher emissions of CO2 in the region. Meanwhile, increased openness to trade seems to have reduced CO2 emissions. The findings are qualitatively robust to different proxies of financial inclusions and reasonable modifications to specification of the model. The empirical results imply that there are currently no policy synergies between growing financial inclusion and mitigating CO2 emissions. Thus, financial inclusion should be integrated into climate change adaptation strategies at local, national and regional levels, especially to address the side effect of higher CO2 emissions associated with improved financial inclusion. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Asia; Climate change; CO2 emissions; Financial inclusion; Panel data analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080068066

Manufacturing has advanced from steam power to electric power, to computing controls, and now to the fourth industrial revolution of digitization of industrial processes and increased connectivity, delivering unprecedented optimization capabilities. This Industrial Internet of Things (MoT, also called Industry 4.0) is beginning to shape the way aluminum processors are designed and operated, introducing new ways of working, with increased data access for all levels of personnel, from maintenance to management. Smart systems, incorporating sensors and wireless communication, together with internet-enabled data storage and processing technology (commonly referred to as the Cloud) are making more and more data available, which brings about new challenges in analyzing and managing large data sets. In-depth process knowledge is key to filtering through the data to identify key performance in-dicators ana interpret trends and associations correctly, leading to the creation of computer models of the aluminum processing equipment (or digital twins). The growth of self-learning computer programs (i.e., machine learning and artificial intelligence), along with the increased computing power that tne Cloud brings, has led to capabilities that can be used to streamline data analysis and improve the understanding of relationships between key parameters in aluminum manufacturing processes.

Concerns for the environment, individual health or animal welfare are raising consumers’ willingness to adopt such diets. Dietary shifts in Western countries may modify the way human-environment systems interact over distances, primarily as a result of existing trade flows in food products. Global studies have focused on the amount of water, land, and CO2 emissions embodied in plant-based versus animal-based proteins, but the potential of alternative diets to shift the location of environmental impacts has not yet been investigated. We build on footprint and trade-based analyses to compare the magnitude and spatial allocation of the impacts of six diets of consumers in the United States of America (USA). We used data on declared diets as well as a stylized average diet and a recent dietary guideline integrating health and environmental targets. We demonstrate that low-meat and no-meat diets have a lower demand for land and utilize more crops with natural nitrogen fixation potential, yet also rely more widely on pollinator abundance and diversity, and can increase impacts on freshwater ecosystems in some countries. We recommend that governments carefully consider the local impacts of the alternative diets they promote, and minimize trade-offs between the global and local consequences of dietary shifts through regulation or incentives. © 2020 The Authors","Dietary change; EAT diet; Ecosystem services; Land use change; Telecoupling; Trade; Trade-offs","animal welfare; ecosystem service; environmental impact; food consumption; land use change; nature-society relations; nitrogen fixation; trade-off; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082198797

Butanol is desirable among renewable fuels due to its properties favorable to diesel engines. This study focused on the suitability of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and optimum injection timing on the performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of common-rail direct-injection (CRDI) engine fueled with n-butanol-blended diesel using experimental and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Various EGR rates and injection timings are considered for different butanol–diesel blends (0, 10, 20 and 30%). Obtained simulation results are validated with experimental data and found to be in good agreement. For all EGR rates and blends, nitrogen oxide (NO) emission is reduced drastically, whereas carbon monoxide (CO) and soot emissions are decreased moderately, with increase in n-butanol–diesel blends. The CO and soot emissions increase with EGR rate due to oxygen deficiency as well. Brake thermal efficiency is reduced by approximately 1% for neat diesel (Bu0) with increase in EGR rates. Soot emission for Bu30 (15 ° Before top dead centre (BTDC) is decreased by 23, 25, 24 and 26% for 0, 10, 20 and 30% EGR rates, respectively, compared to Bu0 (12° BTDC). © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CFD; combustion analysis; CRDI; emission; exhaust gas recirculation; n-butanol","Alternative fuels; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Fossil fuels; Gases; Neutron emission; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Combustion analysis; Combustion characteristics; Common rail diesel engines; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; CRDI; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Exhaust gas recirculation rates; N-butanol; Exhaust gas recirculation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029447864

However, concerns have been raised with regard to its use because it can increase respiratory resistance and dead space. Therefore, this study assessed the safety of N95 use in patients with COPD and air-flow limitation. METHODS: This prospective study was performed at a tertiary hospital and enrolled 97 subjects with COPD. The subjects were monitored for symptoms and physiologic variables during a 10-min rest period and 6-min walking test while wearing an N95. RESULTS: Of the 97 subjects, 7 with COPD did not wear the N95 for the entire test duration. This mask-failure group showed higher British modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale scores and lower FEV1 percent of predicted values than did the successful mask use group. A modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score 6 3 (odds ratio 167, 95% CI 8.4 to &gt;999.9; P 5 .008) or a FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted (odds ratio 163, 95% CI 7.4 to &gt;999.9; P 5 .001) was associated with a risk of failure to wear the N95.

Situated on the Czech-Polish border, these mountains were heavily affected by extreme SO2 and NOx loads emitted from coal power plants in the piedmont. During the 1970s and 1980s, the upper plateau of the Jizera Mountains experienced substantial forest decline due to air pollution. Dying stands were felled on more than 12,000 ha. Modernization of the energy industry after 1989 has led to a significant reduction in air pollution in the Black Triangle. Therefore, replanting the clear-cut areas in the Jizera Mountains became possible during the 1990s, and a new generation of forests has covered the upper plateau of the mountains. However, these even-Aged, mainly spruce stands urgently need to be diversified in terms of age, structure, and species composition. This is not an easy task due to extreme microclimate, acidified soils, and damage to plants by rodents and deer. In 2007, a project aimed at the diversification of local ecosystems was initiated. The project is based on a system of diversification centers and corridors containing a species admixture (broadleaf trees and silver fir), which is protected from game, to form a web that enriches the age and spatial structure of forests on the upper plateau and complements their species composition. Initially, these centers and corridors were placed in more sheltered and accessible places and planted with the standard planting stock in combination with large-sized transplants (<100 cm). Through silvicultural measures, the web became successively denser and expanded to sites with less environmental protection. Supportive measures like initial fertilization of plantations and the biochemical amelioration of depleted soils have also been implemented. ©","biodiversity; Black Triangle; broadleaf; forest restoration; planting stock; silver fir","atmospheric pollution; biodiversity; broad-leaved forest; clearcutting; coal-fired power plant; coniferous tree; environmental degradation; forest ecosystem; population decline; restoration ecology; stand structure; Czech Republic; Jizera Mountains; Sudetes; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100923705

Also, being a renewable source of energy, it has the significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions releasing from the fossil fuel based technologies. Therefore, energy from biomass is becoming a favourable technology to convert solid fuel to valuable gas and one of the effective approaches is gasification. In this research, a three dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) steady-state thermochemical model is developed to simulate biomass (rubber wood) gasification in a downdraft gasifier. Simulated CFD model includes all the four zones (drying, pyrolysis, oxidation and reduction) of gasifer. For optimising the gasifier temperature and syngas composition, a sensitivity analysis of homogeneous oxidation reactions is carried out, with the model identifying the suitable kinetic reactions for gasification. Predicted CFD modelling results are compared with those from the kinetic modelling and experimental results, where a good agreement is obtained. The effect of gasifier temperature, equivalence ratio (ER) and biomass feed rate on the syngas production is studied. Further, the effect of volatile composition and rate of Boudouard reaction at different ERs along the gasifier height is investigated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass gasification; CFD modelling; Chemical kinetics; Discrete phase model","Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Computational fluid dynamics; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Kinetics; Reaction kinetics; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Biomass Gasification; CFD modelling; Discrete phase model; Homogeneous oxidation; Oxidation and reduction; Thermochemical Conversion; Thermochemical modeling; Threedimensional (3-d); Sensitivity analysis; biomass; computational fluid dynamics; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; oxidation; reaction kinetics; sensitivity analysis; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075337280

Rising CO2 level and temperature have begun to impact life cycles, distribution and yield of various plants yet, how medicinal plants will respond to changing environment is largely unknown. Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth. (Plantaginaceae) is a medicinal plant species that has been used for treatment of various diseases, particularly hepatic disease. Here, we have performed leaf and rhizome specific proteomic and metabolomic analysis to investigate the effect of elevated CO2 and temperature on adaptive responses of P. kurroa. We observed differentially abundant proteins related to photosynthesis and carbon metabolism under free air carbon dioxide enhancement, whereas cytoskeleton proteins in free air temperature increase besides signaling, antioxidant, stress-responsive and chromatin remodeling proteins in both conditions. We also found an increased accumulation of metabolites, particularly picroside-I and picroside-II, sugars and sugar alcohol in rhizomes, whereas, decrease in picroside-I and increase in picroside-II content in leaves at FACE condition. Biochemical indices like total protein, phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant activity were altered in a tissue-specific manner to elevated CO2 and temperature. The results would provide new insights into possible adaptive mechanism, particularly in P. kurroa and medicinal plants in general. Significance: Picrorhiza kurroa is an endangered medicinal plant of Himalayan region having immense medicinal values due to the presence of iridoid glycosides. This endangered plant species is particularly, more vulnerable to climate change. P. kurroa provides an opportunity to investigate the interaction between high altitude plant and their environment. Therefore, it will be essential to elucidate the adaptation mechanism at molecular level under e[CO2] and e[t] conditions. The e[CO2] and e[t] will likely alter the proteome and metabolite composition of plant and thereby, enhance plant adaptation. Proteomic and metabolomic studies would facilitate to explore the adaptive mechanism of P. kurroa which is poorly understood. Collectively, the findings will be helpful for better understanding of plant response to future CO2 and temperature enriched environment and are of key importance to agriculture and ecosystem. © 2020","Elevated CO2; Elevated temperature; Medicinal plants; Picrorhiza kurroa; Picrosides","antioxidant; aromatic amino acid; carbon dioxide; cyp86b1 protein; cytoskeleton protein; flavonoid; fructose; glucose; guanosine triphosphatase activating protein; heat shock cognate protein 70; heat shock protein 70; mannitol; mannose; picroside I; picroside II; plant protein; proteome; small heat shock protein; SUMO protein; unclassified drug; antioxidant; carbon dioxide; air temperature; antioxidant activity; Article; carbon metabolism; chloroplast; chromatin assembly and disassembly; climate change; controlled study; gene ontology; metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; mitochondrion; nonhuman; nutritional value; photosynthesis; Picrorhiza kurroa; plant leaf; plant stress; priority journal; protein content; proteomics; rhizome; secondary metabolism; ecosystem; photosynthesis; temperature; Antioxidants; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Picrorhiza; Proteomics; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082551428

Today’s energy consumption and its utilization at an optimum level is a big challenge in the nation. There are various factors like a demand to mitigate global energy, availability, accessibility, cost, environmental change and storage facility of energy which are important in modern days. Majority of the population is shifting towards the city in comparison to a rural area (town, village and kasbah). According to this fact, the consumption of energy is increasing in cities. The small- and large-scale industries are located nearby the city, because of the easy availability of raw materials, better transportation services and other resources. So, the requirement of energy in a continuous manner is the prime need in these areas. In rural areas, people are using low-grade energy, and thereby there is not so much burden of energy required. It is also observed that there is a maximum loss of electricity due to transmission in India. Oil, gas and electricity are major resources to supply the energy need of the countrymen. However, the fuel situation of the nation with the shortage of fossil fuels creates pressure to drive the nuclear investment for electricity and nearly 25% contribution by 2050. The nation’s dependency on oil and gas is a critical issue, so the country is looking forward to various renewable energy resources. To accomplish this target, various government organizations are investing in solar and wind energy-related projects along with remote location pilot projects. The role of policymakers in this direction is to develop future strategies to decrease the gap between demand and supply of electricity for the growth of sustainable development. In the present work, energy production from various resources, supply, new policy implementation and import of energy is discussed in India. The study concludes that coal and petroleum product import is continuously increasing in the country for power generation and increasing the level of greenhouse gases. So, the Indian government is investing in power generation projects based on renewable energies in the country. ‘Solar Mission’ to achieve a goal of 20 000 MW solar electricity and 60 GW wind power generation by 2022 is already running in this direction. © The Author(s) 2019.

To this end we constructed several mitigation scenarios that implement all currently existing legislation and then implement further reductions of BC in a successively increasing global area, starting from the eight member states of the Arctic Council, expanding to its active observer states, then to all observer states, and finally to the entire globe. These scenarios also account for the reduction of the co-emitted organic carbon (OC) and sulfate (SU). We find that, even though the additional BC emission reductions in the member states of the Arctic Council are small, the resulting reductions in Arctic BC mass burdens can be substantial, especially in the lower troposphere close to the surface. This in turn means that reducing BC emissions only in the Arctic Council member states can reduce BC deposition in the Arctic by about 30&thinsp;% compared to the current legislation, which is about 60&thinsp;% of what could be achieved if emissions were reduced globally. Emission reductions further south affect Arctic BC concentrations at higher altitudes and thus only have small additional effects on BC deposition in the Arctic. The direct radiative forcing scales fairly well with the total amount of BC emission reduction, independent of the location of the emission source, with a maximum direct radiative forcing in the Arctic of about span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-0.4/span&thinsp;W&thinsp;mspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-2/span for a global BC emission reduction. On the other hand, the Arctic effective radiative forcing due to the BC emission reductions, which accounts for aerosol-cloud interactions, is small compared to the direct aerosol radiative forcing. This happens because BC-and OC-containing particles can act as cloud condensation nuclei, which affects cloud reflectivity and lifetime and counteracts the direct radiative forcing of BC. Additionally, the effective radiative forcing is accompanied by very large uncertainties that originate from the strong natural variability of meteorology, cloud cover, and surface albedo in the Arctic. We further used the TM5-FASST model to assess the benefits of the aerosol emission reductions for human health. We found that a full implementation in all Arctic Council member and observer states could reduce the annual global number of premature deaths by 329&thinsp;000 by the year 2030, which amounts to 9&thinsp;% of the total global premature deaths due to particulate matter. © Author(s) 2020.",,"arctic environment; black carbon; climate modeling; emission control; mitigation; mortality; radiative forcing; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085115138

A new method uses the silicification of diatoms that correlates with temperature and nutrients. The so-called silicification value (SiVa) overcomes problems of descriptive statistics or absent indicator species. Averaged over diatom communities, it related inversely to lake surface temperatures in mountain lakes. Hence, its change over time (δ SiVa) in a lake was hypothesised to reflect global change-driven lake warming quantitatively, which supposedly climaxes in shallow lakes. Sixteen different δ SiVa calculation approaches were tested. They (1) included or excluded planktic diatoms, (2) integrated fixed or variable time series referring to climate data or changes in diatom assemblages, (3) employed a top-bottom or regression approach and (4) expressed the δ SiVa as relative or absolute values. Subfossil diatom assemblages from 24 sediment cores from Bavarian and north Tyrolian mountain lakes served as sample set. All possible approaches were evaluated for their explanatory power for lake characteristics using GLMs. The top-bottom benthic approach with fixed climate data-based time series appeared to be the best model based on AIC and the extent of variable integration. In line with the hypothesis, the strongest decrease of δ SiVa was evident in most shallow lakes. Segmented regression further highlighted a positive correlation with depth if shallower than 10 m. By referring to the negative SiVa-summer temperature relation, δ SiVa also enabled the quantification of lake warming within the last decades, which ranged mainly between 0.1 °C and 1.1 °C per decade, consistent with existing literature. Additionally, a 100 year temperature reconstruction from a varved sediment core successfully validated the approach. Further studies may focus and extend its application to deeper lakes, but it can already serve as a powerful tool in palaeolimnological studies of shallow lakes like hard-water mountain lakes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Beta diversity; Diatoms; Mountain lakes; Temperature; Transfer function; Warming","Climate models; Function evaluation; Lakes; Landforms; Phytoplankton; Temperature; Time series; Transfer functions; Beta diversities; Calculation approaches; Descriptive statistics; Diatoms; Lake surface temperature; Mountain lakes; Temperature reconstruction; Warming; Climate change; climate change; diatom; freshwater ecosystem; mountain stream; paleolimnology; regression analysis; silicification; surface temperature; temperature effect; warming; article; calculation; climate change; diatom; global change; lake; nonhuman; sediment; summer; time series analysis; warming; water hardness; Austria; Bavaria; Germany; Tyrol; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078467015

The defense response of soybean plants to a cold climate entails the secretion of specific compounds which help mitigate oxidative stress, i.e., antioxidants, including phenolic compounds. The objective of this study was to examine differences in the concentrations of phenolic compounds, their antioxidant properties, and the concentration of key isoflavones (namely genistein, daidzein, malonyl daidzein, malonyl genistein, and daidzin) in the seeds of six soybean cultivars from two different regions of Europe, namely Poland and France. The total phenolic contents, isoflavone levels, and in vitro antioxidant capacities of soybean seeds from most of the investigated cultivars of northeast Europe were found to be greater than those from southwest Europe. The phenolic compounds of seed extracts are primarily responsible for the free-radical scavenging of soybeans. Factors regulating the production of phenolic compounds in the seeds have not been thoroughly elucidated. Hence, the results presented in this paper can be useful in the selection of soybean cultivars with higher levels of seed phenolics, because of their beneficial impact on human health and on the soybean’s defense mechanism against plant stresses. © 2020 MDPI AG.

Despite a growing recognition of the role of herbivores in above-ground–below-ground interactions, our current understanding is mainly restricted to studies of vertebrates in grassland and tundra ecosystems, while ecosystems with tree-like canopies (termed forests below) and invertebrates remain understudied. Here, we assess the current state of knowledge of one key aspect of plant–herbivore interactions by conducting a meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on the below-ground consequences of above-ground insect herbivory in forest ecosystems. Main results are reported as aggregated relative effect sizes (Cohen's d). We find that above-ground insect herbivory reduced below-ground carbon (C) allocation by plants to roots (−0.56) and root exudation (−0.85), causing shifts in root–symbiont communities, for example, a decrease (−0.67) in the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Microbial decomposer abundances showed no significant responses, while soil faunal abundances increased (0.50). C and nitrogen (N) mineralization rates (C: 0.48, N: 0.48) along with nutrient leaching (C: 0.30, N: 0.77) increased, with a stronger response to outbreak relative to background insect densities. The negative responses increased in strength in colder and dryer biomes while positive responses were reinforced in warmer and wetter biomes, thus extending previously shown effects for vertebrate herbivores to also include insect herbivory. The positive response by soil fauna to insect herbivory was the notable exception. This may be associated with the limited physical soil disturbance caused by insects compared to ungulates. Furthermore, we identified an under-representation in the literature of large areas of boreal and tropical biomes calling for research priorities to fill these knowledge gaps. We present three recommendations for future research: addressing (a) biological drivers of biogeochemistry and response pathways, (b) knowledge gap from boreal and tropical forests, and (c) heterogeneity of herbivore disturbances. Synthesis. Insect herbivores significantly accelerate soil C and N cycling during outbreaks in forest ecosystems, but we lack knowledge on the underlying biological drivers. Overall, below-ground responses to insect herbivory are similar to vertebrate herbivory responses, which may simplify implementing herbivory effects into ecosystem models. Nonetheless, we identify a few important differences and general knowledge gaps on which we base recommendations for future research. © 2019 The Authors.

Experts call for an expansion of central heating by renewable energy systems to ensure a decarbonization of energy systems. In this context, district heating could play a significant role in city and district planning. Nonetheless, for private households, environmental aspects are only one factor amongst others as, e.g., capital costs, comfort and security. In this study, we focus on private household preferences and willingness-to-pay for district heating and district heating from renewables compared to gas condensing boilers and heat pumps. For the study, we decided to apply a discrete-choice experiment and collected data on attitudes towards sustainability, economic aspects and demands for providers of heat supply as dimensions for a factor and cluster analysis in order to apply a market segmentation. The results show that district heating by renewables is the most preferred heating option for households followed by district heating from fossil fuels, heat pumps and gas boilers. Furthermore, the study offers more profound insight into the willingness-to-pay for each heating option and reports interaction effects for the different market segments that could be identified in the analysis. © 2020 by the authors.","Discrete-choice; District heating; Household preferences; Renewables; WTP-space","alternative energy; carbon emission; electricity supply; heating; household energy; market conditions; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085708799

Here we conduct a novel cross-sectoral assessment of regional carbon mitigation potential by running an ecosystem model with an explicit representation of forest structure and climate impacts for Bavaria, Germany, as a case study. We drive the model with four high-resolution climate projections (EURO-CORDEX) for the representative concentration pathway RCP4.5 and present-day land-cover from three satellite-derived datasets (CORINE, ESA-CCI, MODIS) and identify total mitigation potential by not only accounting for carbon storage but also material and energy substitution effects. The model represents the current state in Bavaria adequately, with a simulated forest biomass 12.9 ± 0.4% lower than data from national forest inventories. Future land-use changes according to two ambitious land-use harmonization scenarios (SSP1xRCP2.6, SSP4xRCP3.4) achieve a mitigation of 206 and 247 Mt C (2015–2100 period) via reforestation and the cultivation and burning of dedicated bioenergy crops, partly combined with carbon capture and storage. Sensitivity simulations suggest that converting croplands or pastures to bioenergy plantations could deliver a carbon mitigation of 40.9 and 37.7 kg C/m2, respectively, by the year 2100 if used to replace carbon-intensive energy systems and combined with CCS. However, under less optimistic assumptions (including no CCS), only 15.3 and 12.2 kg C/m2 are mitigated and reforestation might be the better option (20.0 and 16.8 kg C/m2). Mitigation potential in existing forests is limited (converting coniferous into mixed forests, nitrogen fertilization) or even negative (suspending wood harvest) due to decreased carbon storage in product pools and associated substitution effects. Our simulations provide guidelines to policy makers, farmers, foresters, and private forest owners for sustainable and climate-benefitting ecosystem management in temperate regions. They also emphasize the importance of the CCS technology which is regarded critically by many people, making its implementation in the short or medium term currently doubtable. © 2020 The Authors.

Long-term phenological monitoring data are often limited in duration and geographic scope, but recent efforts to digitize herbaria collections make it possible to reliably reconstruct historic flowering phenology across broad geographic scales and multiple species, lending to an increased understanding of community response to climate change. In this study, we examined collection dates (1901 to 2015) of 8540 flowering specimens from 39 native species in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of North America. We hypothesized that flowering phenology would be sensitive to temperature but that sensitivity would vary depending on blooming season and geographic range position. As expected, we found that early-season bloomers are more sensitive to temperature than later-season bloomers. Sensitivity to temperature was significantly greater at low elevations and in the maritime (western) portion of the PNW than at higher elevations and in the eastern interior, respectively. The elevational and longitudinal effects on flowering sensitivity reflect spring “arriving” earlier at low elevations and in the maritime portion of the PNW. These results demonstrate that phenological responses to warming vary substantially across climatically diverse regions, warranting careful and nuanced consideration of climate warming’s effects on plant phenology. © 2020, ISB.","Climate change; Geographic gradients; Herbarium specimens; Pacific Northwest; Phenological sensitivity; Phenology","climate change; flower; North America; season; temperature; United States; Climate Change; Flowers; North America; Northwestern United States; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081336254

The regularities of the interaction process between dust particles and droplets of a liquid (water) in polluted air flow are determined. It is established that when the pressure of compressed air is changed from 0.1 to 0.4 MPa (approximately in the range of 1 to 4 atm.), the average size of droplets decreases from 26 to 9 microns. Justification of the localization method of dust emissions into the atmosphere, arriving from the units of dust formation in crushing and sorting complexes of quarries, is done with the use of air-and-water ejectors-irrigators with highly efficient water use, sprayed with separate nozzles. Variants of air-and-water ejectors placement on dust formation sources are grounded. The choice of the optimal mode of air-and-water ejectors operation depends on the characteristic sizes of the formed dust particles, which are determined by the parameters of the crushing and sorting equipment in the quarry.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate all potential technologies for efficiency improvement. In a combustion engine, about 2/3 of the chemical energy of the fuel is dissipated as waste heat. Due to its high temperature level, the waste heat in the exhaust gas is very promising for the technology of thermoelectric generators (TEG). In this work the methodology for a holistic TEG optimization for automotive vehicle applications will be presented. Thereby, all system interactions between the vehicle and the TEG are modelled and the CO2 reduction can be optimized within the vehicle system. Moreover the costs are calculated for each TEG design, and the method realizes an optimization of the cost–benefit ratio in a direct way. The optimization method is applied with a highly integrated TEG design, which has been developed to be compact and lightweight. Through the combination of improvements in TEG design and system optimization, a gravimetric power density of 267 W/kg and a volumetric power density of 478 W/dm^3 could be achieved. These power densities are about 900% and 700%, respectively, higher than the state of the art. The optimization method was applied exemplarily to a conventional vehicle (Volkswagen Golf VII) and a hybrid vehicle (Opel Ampera/Chevrolet Volt). As a result, reductions in consumption and CO2 emissions of up to 2.2% for the conventional and 3.4% for the hybrid vehicle could be achieved within the worldwide harmonized light duty driving test cycle. The cost–benefit optimum is 81.3 €/(g/km) for the conventional vehicle and 54.8 €/(g/km) for the hybrid vehicle in charge sustaining mode. © 2020, The Author(s).","automotive application; conventional and hybrid vehicles; cost–benefit ratio; holistic overall system development; Thermoelectric generator; waste heat recovery","Carbon dioxide; Electronic equipment; Solid wastes; Thermoelectric equipment; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Waste incineration; Automotive applications; Automotive development; Efficiency improvement; Gravimetric power density; Potential technologies; System development; Thermoelectric generators; Volumetric power density; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079224745

While it is clear that differences in exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity all contribute to heterogeneity in climate change vulnerability, predicting these features at macroecological scales remains a critical challenge. We explore multiple drivers of heterogeneous vulnerability across the distributions of 96 vegetation types of the ecologically diverse western US, using data on observed climate trends from 1948 to 2014 to highlight emerging patterns of change. We ask three novel questions about factors potentially shaping vulnerability across the region: (a) How does sensitivity to different climate variables vary geographically and across vegetation classes? (b) How do multivariate climate exposure patterns interact with these sensitivities to shape vulnerability patterns? (c) How different are these vulnerability patterns according to three widely implemented vulnerability paradigms—niche novelty (decline in modeled suitability), temporal novelty (standardized anomaly), and spatial novelty (inbound climate velocity)—each of which uses a distinct frame of reference to quantify climate departure? We propose that considering these three novelty paradigms in combination could help improve our understanding and prediction of heterogeneous climate change responses, and we discuss the distinct climate adaptation strategies connected with different combinations of high and low novelty across the three metrics. Our results reveal a diverse mosaic of climate change vulnerability signatures across the region's plant communities. Each of the above factors contributes strongly to this heterogeneity: climate variable sensitivity exhibits clear patterns across vegetation types, multivariate climate change data reveal highly diverse exposure signatures across locations, and the three novelty paradigms diverge widely in their climate change vulnerability predictions. Together, these results shed light on potential drivers of individualistic climate change responses and may help to inform effective management strategies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biogeography; climate change; climate departure; climate velocity; niche model; novel climate; resource management; vegetation; vulnerability","climate change; climate effect; conservation management; global change; sensitivity analysis; temporal analysis; vegetation type; vulnerability; United States; acclimatization; climate change; ecosystem; plant; Acclimatization; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079156551

To address how methane exposure may affect microbial communities and methane- and sulfur-cycling gene abundances in Arctic marine sediments, we collected sediments from offshore Svalbard that represent geochemical horizons where anaerobic methanotrophy is expected to be active, previously active, and long-inactive based on reaction-transport biogeochemical modelling of porewater sulfate profiles. Sediment slurries were incubated at in situ temperature and pressure with different added methane concentrations. Sediments from an active area of seepage began to reduce sulfate in a methane-dependent manner within months, preceding increased relative abundances of anaerobic methanotrophs ANME-1 within communities. In previously active and long-inactive sediments, sulfur-cycling Deltaproteobacteria became more dominant after 30 days, though these communities showed no evidence of methanotrophy after nearly 8 months of enrichment. Overall, enrichment conditions, but not methane, broadly altered microbial community structure across different enrichment times and sediment types. These results suggest that active ANME populations may require years to develop, and consequently microbial community composition may affect methanotrophic responses to potential large-scale seafloor methane releases in ways that provide insight for future modelling studies. © 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"methane; RNA 16S; sea water; sulfate; anaerobic growth; archaeon; Arctic; Deltaproteobacteria; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; physiology; sediment; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Arctic Regions; Deltaproteobacteria; Geologic Sediments; Methane; Microbiota; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sulfates; Svalbard",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078588452

While there is a significant number of studies on the process for biomacromolecules in solution, there are only a few reports on gas-phase FRET. Here we report on a simple gas-phase model system, synthesized with the rhodamine 575 (R575+) and rhodamine 640 (R640+) FRET pair and a covalent linker with four methylenes, R575+-(CH2)4-R640+. Each dye carries a positive charge which allows for mass-spectroscopy experiments. We have recorded gas-phase dispersed fluorescence spectra of the mass-selected dications excited at different wavelengths using the homebuilt LUNA (LUminescence iNstrument in Aarhus) setup and find in all cases that emission is exclusively from the R640+ acceptor dye. The linker does not interfere electronically with the dyes and simply acts as a spacer. We can therefore establish the direct effect of the interaction between the two dyes when it comes to emission band maximum. Indeed, we find that R640+ experiences a significant shift in its maximum from 560 ± 1 nm for the monomer cation to 577 ± 2 nm in the presence of R575+, independent of initial excitation of R575+ or R640+. This redshift is ascribed to the large polarizability along the long axis of the xanthene core structure, and that this polarizability is larger in the excited state than in the ground state. Experiments were also done on a triply charged 11-mer peptide labelled with the same two dyes, R575+-(Gly-Gln)5-Lys-R640+ + H+ (Gly = glycine, Gln = glutamine, and Lys = lysine) where the extra positive charge is located on the peptide. Again a redshifted emission spectrum of the donor is observed with maximum at 582 ± 2 nm. Our work clearly demonstrates strong sensitivity of the photophysics of one dye to the nearby environment, and that caution is needed when using the energy transfer efficiency to infer dye-dye separations in gas-phase experiments.

This study evaluated longitudinal changes in Kco and their relationship with other clinical outcomes. Methods: We evaluated patients with COPD from the Korean Obstructive Lung Disease cohort, followed up for up to ten years. Random coefficient models were used to assess the annual change in Kco over time. Participants were categorized into tertiles according to Kco decline rate. Baseline characteristics and outcomes, including changes in FEV1 and emphysema index, incidence of exacerbations, and mortality, were compared between categories. Results: A decline in Kco was observed in 92.9% of the 211 enrolled participants with COPD. Those with the most rapid decline (tertile 1) had a lower FEV1/FVC% (tertile 1: 43.8% ± 9.7%, tertile 2: 46.4% ± 10.5%, tertile 3: 49.2% ± 10.4%, p = 0.008) and a higher emphysema index at baseline (27.7 ± 14.8, 22.4 ± 16.1, 18.1 ± 14.5, respectively, p = 0.001). Tertile 3 showed a lower decline rate in FEV1 (16.3 vs. 27.1 mL/yr, p = 0.017) and a lower incidence of exacerbations (incidence rate ratio = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.44–0.99) than tertile 1. There were no differences in the change in emphysema index and mortality between categories. Conclusion: Most patients with COPD experienced Kco decline over time, which was greater in patients with more severe airflow limitation and emphysema. Decline in Kco was associated with an accelerated decline in FEV1 and more frequent exacerbations; hence, this should be considered as an important outcome measure in further studies. © 2020 by the authors.

Marine aerosol samples were collected during the ARA08 cruise with the R/V Araon between 28 August and 28 September 2017. We investigated molecular distributions of n-alkanes (homologous series of C16 to C34) and compound-specific stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) of n-C27, n-C29, and n-C31. Unresolved complex mixtures (UCM) showed a latitudinal trend from the Arctic Ocean to the northwest Pacific Ocean, highlighting an increasing influence of the plume of polluted air exported from East Asian countries. The anthropogenic input was further evidenced by high U/R ratios (&gt;5) and low CPI17-23 (0.6-1.4). The occurrence of high molecular weight (HMW) n-alkanes with high CPI27-31 (&gt;3) indicated the biogenic input of terrestrial higher plant leaf waxes in all studied samples. The δ13C of HMW n-alkanes was influenced by both the relative contributions from the C3/C4 plant sources and from fossil fuel combustions. The back-trajectory analyses provided evidence that changes in molecular distributions and ffi13C of n-alkanes were due to the long-range atmospheric transport of anthropogenic and biogenic organic materials from North American and EastAsian countries to the Arctic Ocean and the remote northwest Pacific Ocean, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.","Arctic Ocean; Compound-specific carbon isotopes; Marine aerosol; N-alkanes; Northwest pacific ocean","Aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Carbon; Fossil fuels; Hydrocarbons; Isotopes; Oceanography; Back trajectory analysis; Biogenic organic materials; Fossil fuel combustion; High molecular weight; Long-range atmospheric transports; Molecular distribution; Stable carbon isotopes; Unresolved complex mixtures; Paraffins; aerosol; alkane; carbon isotope; isotopic composition; plume; spatial distribution; stable isotope; trend analysis; Arctic Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085652076

We summarized the measured CO2 and CH4 concentrations for the 2012-2014 period. In addition, we characterized the major source of the rise of CO2 and CH4 in Ganseong (GS) by employing bivariate polar plots (BPP) and the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) method together with currently available information on emission sources. For the three years, CO2 was generally high in the order of winter, spring, autumn and summer and CH4 high in the order of winter, autumn, spring and summer. The observed positive correlations between the hourly CO2 and CH4 in every season suggested the possibility of shared common emission sources, but there is a necessity for elucidation on this in the future. The BPP analysis indicated the local sources that are likely to be associated with the rise of greenhouse gases (GHGs) observed at GS (combustion in the village, plant respirations nearby GS, and mobile emissions on the nearby road for CO2 and leakages from the gas stations along the road and agricultural activities for CH4). Synthesizing the CWT results together with emission source information from national and global emission inventories, we identified likely major source areas and characterized major emission sources. For example, the identified major sources for the winter CO2 are coal combustion, coal washing and industrial activities in Inner Mongolia, northern and the northeastern China, fuel burning for the energy for the infrastructure of a northwestern city in South Korea, and the manufacturing industry and fuel combustion in the northern parts of North Korea. Hopefully, these kinds of results will aid environmental researchers and decision-makers in performing more in-depth studies for GHG sources in order to derive effective mitigation strategies. © 2020 by the authors.","Bivariate polar plot; Concentration weighted trajectory; Emission inventory; Ganseong Observatory; Greenhouse gas measurements; Source characterization","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Coal industry; Decision making; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Roads and streets; Springs (components); Agricultural activities; Emission sources; Industrial activities; Manufacturing industries; Mitigation strategy; Plant respiration; Positive correlations; Source characteristics; Coal combustion; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); emission inventory; greenhouse gas; methane; pollutant source; seasonal variation; upland region; China; China; Nei Monggol; North Korea; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085738434

The subsequent natural revegetation following abandonment in rural areas has been widely documented to have substantial implications on the hydrological cycle and the vegetation. The Spanish Pyrenees are one of the most affected areas by these land transformations which could threaten their importance for water supply and agricultural activities in the downstream lowland areas. Land managers as well as scientists around the world have taken different positions on how to deal with these land use changes. Some are in favor of active management (AM) (i.e. density reduction) while others are supporting passive management (PM) (letting the process of revegetation continue). This study aims to investigate the implication of AM and PM on hydrological and vegetation dynamics under different climate trajectories in a representative abandoned cropland catchment in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. A coupled ecohydrologic model is used to estimate the post management response of streamflow (STR), evapotranspiration (ET), soil saturation deficit (SD) and plant carbon (PC) following shrub clearing. Clearing increased annual STR by 16%, while ET and SD decreased by around −9% and −6% respectively during the first year after management with changes to monthly flows. These changes to water regimes may be even higher in wetter years. Over a 10-years period of vegetation recovery annual STR increased between 7.1% and 24.2%, while annual ET and SD decreased between −2.6% to −8.7% and −2.7% to −6% respectively due to shrub clearing, with the highest changes occurring in the first three years of AM. On the effect of climate change, our results show that a 2 °C increase in temperature could reduce AM effects on water regimes and accelerate the recovery of PC given averaged rainfall conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Evapotranspiration; Land abandonment; Natural revegetation; Plant carbon; Shrub clearing; Streamflow","Catchments; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Revegetation; Soil conservation; Stream flow; Vegetation; Water supply; Agricultural activities; Ecohydrologic models; Hydrological cycles; Land abandonments; Land-use management; Mediterranean mountains; Shrub clearing; Vegetation dynamics; Land use; carbon; rain; water; abandoned land; agricultural land; ecohydrology; evapotranspiration; land use planning; revegetation; shrub; streamflow; vegetation dynamics; active land use management; Article; calibration; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; climate warming; cropland; environmental management; environmental parameters; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; humidity; land use; nonbiological model; nonhuman; passive land use management; plant carbon; priority journal; regional ecohydrological simulation system model; seasonal variation; shrub; shrub clearing; soil saturation deficit; stream (river); temperature dependence; validation process; vegetation dynamics; water flow; water supply; agriculture; crop; soil; Spain; Pyrenees; Spain; Agriculture; Carbon; Crops, Agricultural; Soil; Spain; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079321564

Casablanca, which exhibits the highest urbanization rate and population density in Morocco, possesses a concentration of industrial units as well as a large vehicle fleet. Marrakech, another of the most populated cities in the country, has also witnessed an increased rate of motorization during the recent years. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the atmospheric circulation and the PM10 concentrations in Casablanca and Marrakech (based on daily measurements from 2013 to 2016). First, we assessed the correlations between the concentrations and the climate indexes (the North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO] and the Mediterranean Oscillation [MO]). Then, we characterized the contribution of large-scale atmospheric patterns related to extreme PM10 events. Finally, we created the Saharan Oscillation Index (SaOI), a climate index for characterizing the oscillation in the country’s southern desert, between the Saharan depression and the Azores High, and calculated its time series. Our results elucidate the relationship between the MO and the average PM10 concentrations, demonstrating that particulate pollution in the study area is partly induced by a northeasterly to southwesterly continental flow that is triggered by the Saharan trough and influenced by the high-pressure area in the north. The significant statistical correlations, mainly found in winter, confirm the relationships between the Saharan Oscillation Index, the average PM10 concentrations and the MO and NAO indexes—and thus the applicability of the SaOI—during this season. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Air quality; Climate index; Correlation; Particulate matter (PM10); Saharan depression; Saharan Oscillation Index (SaOI)","Atmospheric pressure; Fleet operations; Industrial emissions; Population statistics; Anthropogenic sources; Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric pattern; High pressure area; North Atlantic oscillations; Particulate pollution; Population densities; Statistical correlation; Air pollution; atmospheric circulation; concentration (composition); correlation; North Atlantic Oscillation; particulate matter; population density; urbanization; Azores; Casablanca [Morocco]; Marrakech [(CTY) Marrakech-Safi]; Marrakech-Safi; Morocco; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084086284

Furthermore, the electric bikes have low noise emission and no exhaust gases produced, which improves the environmental footprint. Due to the Vietnam regulations, most electric bikes use brushless wheel-hub motors as the main drivetrain solution paired with various types of batteries. The key challenges in the design of the drivetrains are related to the efficiency and controllability areas, so the response of the drivetrain can be improved. The key area of improvement lies in the control system design to optimize the performance and energy consumption.

The target object of the current research is a Kirsanovskoe oil field confined to the North Kinelsky oil and gas region. Kirsanovskoye field is a carbonate reservoir with an average depth in the range of 1300–1350 m, average porosity of 11.5%, and average permeability of 70.6 mD. The HPAI process, which includes intensive oxidation and combustion reactions, phase transitions of components and change in the composition and properties of coexisting phases, is not fully explored yet. Its complexity and lack of reliable chemical and kinetic models both for light and heavy oils cause several limiting factors for the construction of a field numerical model with the high predicting level in the respect to the HPAI as the EOR method. The presented work is devoted to the construction and validation of laboratory-scale numerical models of oxidation experiments to provide proper HPAI kinetic model for oxidation and combustion reactions for the Kirsanovskoye oil field. For these purposes, high-pressure ramped temperature oxidation (HPRTO) and subsequent Medium pressure combustion tube (MPCT) experiments were conducted and analyzed. HPRTO test is used for the determination of the reaction kinetics together with such characteristics as a function of temperature, O2 uptake, CO2 generation, oxidation front velocity, peak temperatures, residual coke, and amount of burned and recovered oil. MPCT provides information on stoichiometry for the high-temperature process and optimal airflow rate. A significant part of the research is dedicated to the construction of 3D numerical models (multilayer design, proper heater regime, etc.) of HPRTO and MPCT experiments to avoid constructional uncertainties and their further validation against the experimental data. To describe the chemical behavior of hydrocarbons during the HPAI process we use the reaction scheme which includes polymerization of Malthenes and Asphaltenes in low-temperature oxidation region, thermal cracking and coke combustion in the high-temperature oxidation region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonate reservoir; Combustion tube; Enhanced oil recovery; High-pressure air injection; Kinetic model; Ramped-temperature oxidation","Carbonation; Coke; Combustion; Cracking (chemical); Crude oil; Heavy oil production; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Multilayers; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Reaction kinetics; Temperature; Thermooxidation; Carbonate reservoir; Combustion tubes; Enhanced oil recovery; High pressure air; Kinetic modeling; Ramped temperatures; Enhanced recovery; carbonate rock; combustion; enhanced oil recovery; experimental study; fluid injection; high pressure; hydrocarbon reservoir; hydrocarbon technology; kinetics; numerical model; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077654555

Towards solving the puzzle, the intrinsic mechanism of SMR is examined by performing density functional theory computations and transition state theory analyses on 80 elementary reaction steps involved in SMR over Ni(111). A microkinetic model is developed by combining the thermochemical data of the elementary reactions with a continuous stirring tank reactor model. The microkinetic model is used to investigate the reaction pathways, the rate determining steps and the abundances of surface species. Reaction rates predicted by the microkinetic model are in good agreement with the experimental data obtained under very different temperature and pressure conditions. An analytical expression of the SMR rate is derived based on the dominant reaction pathway and the abundances of surface species. The rate equation is verified to accurately reflect the microkinetic modeling. Applying the analytical rate equation yields a coherent explanation of the seemingly incompatible experimental data on the reaction orders of CH4, H2O and H2 and the activation energy of SMR. The rate equation is very useful for the optimization of the operating conditions of SMR. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activation energy; Catalysis; Density functional theory; Methane; Reaction rates; Small nuclear reactors; Surface reactions; Analytical expressions; Continuous stirring tank reactor; Intrinsic mechanisms; Macrokinetic modeling; Microkinetic modeling; Rate determining step; Temperature and pressures; Transition state theories; Steam reforming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082796954

Thus, they are of great value to incorporate into climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. In response, a global network of mangrove plots was established to provide policy-relevant ecological data relating to interactions of mangrove C stocks with climatic, tidal, plant community, and geomorphic factors. Mangroves from 190 sites were sampled across five continents encompassing large biological, physical, and climatic gradients using consistent methodologies for the quantification of total ecosystem C stocks (TECS). Carbon stock data were collected along with vegetation, physical, and climatic data to explore potential predictive relationships. There was a 28-fold range in TECS (79–2,208 Mg C/ha) with a mean of 856 ± 32 Mg C/ha. Belowground C comprised an average 85% of the TECS. Mean soil depth was 216 cm, ranging from 22 to &gt;300 cm, with 68 sites (35%) exceeding a depth of 300 cm. TECS were weakly correlated with metrics of forest structure, suggesting that aboveground forest structure alone cannot accurately predict TECS. Similarly, precipitation was not a strong predictor of TECS. Reasonable estimates of TECS were derived via multiple regression analysis using precipitation, soil depth, tree mass, and latitude (R2 = 0.54) as variables. Soil carbon to a 1 m depth averaged 44% of the TECS. Limiting analyses of soil C stocks to the top 1 m of soils result in large underestimates of TECS as well as in the greenhouse gas emissions that would arise from their conversion to other land uses. The current IPCC Tier 1 default TECS value for mangroves is 511 Mg C/ha, which is only 60% of our calculated global mean. This study improves current assessments of mangrove C stocks providing a foundation necessary for C valuation related to climate change mitigation. We estimate mangroves globally store about 11.7 Pg C: an aboveground carbon stock of 1.6 Pg C and a belowground carbon stock of 10.2 Pg C). The differences in the estimates of total ecosystem carbon stocks based on climate, salinity, forest structure, geomorphology, or geopolitical boundaries are not as much of an influence as the choice of soil depth included in the estimate. Choosing to limit soils to a 1 m depth resulted in estimates of &lt;5 Pg whereas those that included the soil profile &gt;1 m depth resulted in global carbon stock estimates that exceeded 11.2 Pg C. © 2020 The Authors.

Usually harvesting is done during the peak growing season to maximize the amount of nutrients removed from the system. This, however, can create huge methane fluxes that escape from plant tissues to the atmosphere. We used manual chambers and eddy covariance measurements to analyze the increase in methane emissions due to the harvesting of two common wetland species, Typha spp. and Schoenoplectus spp., in two climatically different constructed wetlands in Estonia and California. In addition, we determined the biomass nutrient and carbon concentrations from harvested biomass. We found that harvesting during the summer season, e.g. June and August, resulted in a significant release of methane at both sites. At the California site, baseline median methane emissions were 217.6 nmol m− 2 s− 1, and harvesting resulted in increases to 395.4 nmol m− 2 s− 1 that decreased to baseline emission within three days. Footprint modeling demonstrated that the emission increases measured by eddy covariance were dominated by contributions from the cut area to the total footprint signal. At the Estonian site, harvesting resulted in methane increases of 15.9 nmol m− 2 s− 1 to 110.4 nmol m− 2 s− 1 in August. However, in September and October the emission was significantly lower. Plant biomass analyses showed clear temporal dynamics in terms of nutrient concentration, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. Our experiments indicate that the optimal time for aboveground biomass harvesting is at the end of the growing season before nutrient translocation to belowground plant structures begins coinciding with lowest methane emissions. Therefore, strategic planning of the harvest timing may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from managed wetlands and thus improve their multi-faceted ecological benefit. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass harvesting; Eddy covariance; Methane; Nutrients; Wetland management; Wetlands","Biomass; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Methane; Water treatment; Wetlands; Above ground biomass; Biomass harvesting; Carbon concentrations; Eddy covariance; Eddy covariance measurements; Nutrient concentrations; Nutrient translocation; Wetland management; Nutrients; methane; carbon dioxide; methane; aboveground biomass; carbon emission; concentration (composition); constructed wetland; eddy covariance; grass; harvesting; methane; nutrient; trade-off; wetland management; Article; biomass; California; carbon footprint; constructed wetland; controlled study; Eddy covariance; Estonia; harvesting; nonhuman; nutrient; nutrient concentration; plant nutrient; priority journal; Schoenoplectus; seasonal variation; Typha; biomass; wetland; California; Estonia; United States; Schoenoplectus; Typha; Biomass; California; Carbon Dioxide; Estonia; Methane; Nutrients; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078702272

However, while goal failures in environmental governance are studied in a number of disciplines, the knowledge on the various causes behind delayed goal achievement is still incomplete. In this article we propose a new framework for analysis of delay mechanisms in science and policy, with the intention to provide a complementary lens for describing, analysing and counteracting delay in environmental governance. The framework is based on case-study findings from recent research focusing on goal-failures in policies for climate change, hazardous chemicals, biodiversity loss and eutrophication. It is also related to previous research on science and policy processes and their interactions. We exemplify the framework with two delay mechanisms that we consider particularly important to highlight—denial of science and decision thresholds. We call for further research in the field, for development of the framework, and not least for increased attention to delay mechanisms in environmental policy review and development on national as well as international levels. © 2019, The Author(s).","Decision-making; Delay; Environmental goals; Environmental science and policy; Science denial","biodiversity; climate change; decision making; environmental policy; governance approach; climate change; coping behavior; environmental policy; environmental protection; public policy; Adaptation, Psychological; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Public Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074510419

We use a comprehensive dataset for the 483 sub-districts (Upazilas) in Bangladesh, tracking disaster risk reduction and adaptation funding provided to each sub-district by the central government during fiscal years’ 2010–11 to 2013–14, disaggregated by the various types of social protection programs. We assess to what extent the primary determinants of such funding flows—such as current hazard risk, socio-economic vulnerability, and political economy considerations—contribute to these funding allocation decisions. We find that flood hazard risk and socio-economic vulnerability are both positively correlated with the sub-district fiscal allocations. We find that political factors do not seem to significantly correlate with these allocations and neither does proximity to the centres of Dhaka and Chittagong. Public spending for adaptive disaster risk reduction, as investigated here, can be a useful complementary intervention tool to other DRR programs, such as insurance or broader social transfers, provided that it is allocated rationally. Broadly, this appears to be the case in Bangladesh.

Existing research on the consistency of different land cover products has mainly focused on administrative divisions (continental or national scales). However, the ongoing production of large regional or global land cover products with higher resolutions requires us to have a better grasp of confusing land types and their geographical locations for different zoning (e.g., geographical zoning) in order to guide the optimization of strategies such as zoning and sample selection in automated land cover classification. Therefore, we selected the GlobeLand30-2010, GLC_FCS30-2015, and FROM_GLC2015 global land cover products with a 30-m resolution covering Indonesia, which has a tropical rainforest climate, as a case study, and then analyzed these products in terms of areal consistency, spatial consistency, and accuracy evaluation. The results revealed that (a) all three land cover products revealed that forest is the main land cover type in Indonesia. The area correlation coefficient of any two products is better than 0.89; (b) the areas that are completely consistent among the three products account for 58% of the total area of Indonesia, mainly distributed in the central and northern parts of Kalimantan and Papua, which are dominated by forest land types. The spatial consistency of the three products is low, however, due to the complex surface types and staggered distributions of grassland, shrub, cultivated land, artificial surface, and other land cover types in Java, eastern Sumatra, and the eastern, southern, and northwestern sections of Kalimantan, where the elevation is less than 200 m. Given these results, land cover producers should take heed of the classification accuracy of these areas; (c) the absolute accuracy evaluation demonstrated that the GLC_FCS30-2015 product has the highest overall accuracy (65.59%), followed by the overall accuracy of the GlobeLand30-2010 product (61.65%), while the FROM_GLC2015 exhibits the lowest overall accuracy (57.71%). The mapping accuracy of the three products is higher for forests and artificial surfaces. The cropland mapping accuracy of the GLC_FCS30-2015 product is higher than those of the other two products. The mapping accuracy of all products is low for grassland, shrubland, bareland, and wetland. The classification accuracy of these land cover types requires further improvement and cannot be used directly by land cover users when conducting relevant research in tropical rainforest climate zones, since the utilization of these products could lead to serious errors. © 2020 by the authors.","30-meter; Accuracy evaluation; Land cover products; Spatial consistency; Tropical rainforest","Forestry; Mapping; Remote sensing; Tropics; Zoning; Accuracy evaluation; Artificial surfaces; Classification accuracy; Consistency analysis; Geographical locations; Global climate changes; Land cover classification; Tropical rain forest; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085256930

A panel regression model with propensity score matching was employed to minimize endogeneity bias. The results indicate that environmental compensation is a compelling incentive to motivate managers to invest in long-term and highly uncertain environmental projects. Likewise, the presence of an environmental board committee appears to be significant, suggesting that directors contribute to a firm's strategy with their expertise and political influence.

The benefit of this research lies in the exact identification of the flood risk areas along the course of the Toudgha river through the city of Tinghir, using a flood model of the area created on a Geographic Information System platform. By its geographical position on the southern flank of the Central High Atlas of Morocco, the valley of Toudgha is classified among the sites with a particular vulnerability to flooding (almost every year). Toudgha River was under constant threat of flooding, mainly during torrential rainstorms, endangering the inhabitants and their property. Over the course of several years, they have suffered many floods, the most severe extreme events in August 2014 and September 2019 (torrential floods) caused devastating damages. Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of floods is important for disaster risk and water resources management. Sustainable Development Goal number 13, Climate Action, supports the need for disaster risk reduction, early warning systems, adaptation to climate change and strengthened resilience7. This study allowed us to simulate spatiotemporal flood level, one of the most frequent natural disasters in Tinghir valley, using statistical methods, identifying floodplains and determining the different water levels for the modeled section of Toudgha River.

We build models using MaxEnt for Egyptian medicinal plants as a model system, projecting them to different future times under two IPCC 4th assessment emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. We compare the effect of two indices of socioeconomic activity [Human Influence Index (HII) and human population density/km2] as cost layers in spatial prioritization for conservation using zonation. We assess the efficacy of Egypt's network of Protected Areas (PAs) by comparing the predicted conservation value inside and outside each PA under the various scenarios. The results show that there are many locations in Egypt (the main cities, agricultural land, coastal areas) that are highly ranked for conservation before human socioeconomic impacts are included. The HII had a stronger impact than using human population density. The PA value excess (inside–outside) varied significantly with the type of cost and dispersal, but not with climate-change scenario or Zonation settings. We conclude that human socioeconomic impacts add new scope and insights for future conservation; and conservation planning without consideration of such impacts cannot be complete. © 2019, © 2019 Societá Botanica Italiana.","conservation planning; Egypt; plants; Socioeconomic impact; species distribution models; Zonation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066603194

Our goal is to determine factors that might help build awareness and knowledge of CCS so that citizens can make informed decisions about it. Specifically, we focus on perceived risks, benefits and emotions associated with CCS and intentions to seek information about it. We surveyed 970 adults from a region of Texas that has seen recent growth in the application of CCS technology. Consistent with prior research, most respondents were not aware of CCS or the risks and benefits associated with it. To explore CCS-related information -seeking intent, we sought guidance from the planned risk information -seeking model, which identifies factors that contribute to intentions to seek information about risk-related topics. The majority of the hypothesized relationships were supported, and the model accounted for 48% of the variance in intent to seek information about CCS risks and benefits. Furthermore, perceived benefits and hope played significant roles in explaining information-seeking intent.

However, there is growing evidence that ethnocentrism and privilege are shaping coastal management policies while many communities with climate justice issues struggle to build resilience. Particularly, rural coastal communities, contrasting urban areas, have limited access to centralized planning efforts, unique local contexts for outreach, compounding social vulnerabilities (job loss, out-migration, limited social services), and receive less attention from resilience researchers. Following calls to integrate climate justice into resilience praxis, we assess perceptions of adaptive capacity within predominately African American communities in a rural low-lying coastal region in eastern North Carolina. We add a climate justice lens to evaluate the previously-validated Rural Coastal Community Resilience (RCCR) framework. The RCCR is intended to improve planning efforts by providing climate change information, initiating conversations, and contributing to resilience theory. In contrast to its previous applications, engagement led to declines in perceived adaptive capacity. This result highlights that the information sharing goals of the engagement efforts were poorly aligned with community concerns and threat perceptions. Additionally, perceived climate injustices emerged revealing instances of adaptation oppression. This study recommends strategies to rethink traditional extension efforts to improve inclusiveness by deeply interrogating the inherent whiteness of standard modes of communicating climate science. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Colorblindness; Ethnocentrism; Resilience; Sea level rise","adaptive management; coastal zone management; environmental justice; environmental policy; rural area; sea level change; strategic approach; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080041534

We aimed to determine whether epidemic growth is globally associated with climate or public health interventions intended to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of all 144 geopolitical areas worldwide (375 609 cases) with at least 10 COVID-19 cases and local transmission by Mar. 20, 2020, excluding China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Using weighted random-effects regression, we determined the association between epidemic growth (expressed as ratios of rate ratios [RRR] comparing cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases on Mar. 27, 2020, with cumulative counts on Mar. 20, 2020) and latitude, temperature, humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing during an exposure period 14 days previously (Mar. 7 to 13, 2020). RESULTS: In univariate analyses, there were no associations of epidemic growth with latitude and temperature, but weak negative associations with relative humidity (RRR per 10% 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and absolute humidity (RRR per 5 g/m3 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Strong associations were found for restrictions of mass gatherings (RRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79), school closures (RRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52- 0.78) and measures of social distancing (RRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85). In a multivariable model, there was a strong association with the number of implemented public health interventions (p for trend = 0.001), whereas the association with absolute humidity was no longer significant. © 2020 Joule Inc.",,"Article; climate; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; environmental impact; environmental temperature; human; humidity; latitude; major clinical study; pandemic; prospective study; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virus transmission; Coronavirus infection; global health; pandemic; procedures; public health; virus pneumonia; Climate; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084617807

Energy-rich reduced substrates, namely hydrocarbons, support accelerated biogeochemical dynamics, creating unique geobiological habitats. Subseafloor geology dictates the surficial expression of seeps, generating hydrocarbon (gas and/or oil) seeps, brine seeps, and mud volcanoes. Biogeochemical processes across the redox spectrum are amplified at hydrocarbon seeps due to the abundance and diversity of reductant; anaerobic metabolism dominates within the sediment column since oxygen is consumed rapidly near the sediment surface. Microbial activity is constrained by electron acceptor availability, with rapid recycling required to support observed rates of hydrocarbon consumption. Geobiologic structures, from gas hydrate to solid asphalt to authigenic minerals, form as a result of hydrocarbon and associated fluid discharge. Animal-microbial associations and symbioses thrive at hydrocarbon seeps, generating diverse and dense deep sea oases that provide nutrition to mobile predators. Hydrocarbon seeps are abundant deep sea oases that support immense biodiversity and where specialization and adaptation create extraordinary lifestyles. Subseafloor geology shapes and defines the geochemical nature of fluid seepage and regulates the flux regime, which dictate the surface expression. High rates of anaerobic oxidation of methane require coupling to multiple processes and promote diversity in the anaerobic methanotroph microbial community. The recent discovery of novel phyla possessing hydrocarbon oxidation potential signals that aspects of seep biogeochemistry and geobiology remain to be discovered. © Copyright 2020 by Annual Reviews.

Climatic factors such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, direct and indirect solar radiation and wind speed influence feed and water availability, fodder quality and disease occurrence, with production being most efficient in optimal environmental conditions. Among these climatic variables, ambient temperature fluctuations have the most impact on livestock production and animal welfare. Continuous exposure of the animals to heat stress compromises growth, milk and meat production and reproduction. The capacity of an animal to mitigate effects of increased environmental temperature, without progressing into stress response, differs within and between species. Comparatively, small ruminants are better adapted to hot environments than large ruminants and have better ability to survive, produce and reproduce in harsh climatic regions. Nevertheless, the physiological and behavioral changes in response to hot environments affect small ruminant production. It has been found that tropical breeds are more adaptive to hot climates than high-producing temperate breeds. The growing body of knowledge on the negative impact of heat stress on small ruminant production and welfare will assist in the development of suitable strategies to mitigate heat stress. Selection of thermotolerant breeds, through identification of genetic traits for adaption to extreme environmental conditions (high temperature, feed scarcity, water scarcity), is a viable strategy to combat climate change and minimize the impact on small ruminant production and welfare. This review highlights such adaption within and among different breeds of small ruminants challenged by heat stress. © 2020 by the authors.

To develop an active and selective electrocatalyst and engineer the reaction environment to achieve high energy conversion efficiency, we need to improve our knowledge of the reaction mechanism and material structure under reaction conditions. In situ spectroscopies are among the most powerful tools which enable measurements of the system under real conditions. These methods provide information about reaction intermediates and possible reaction pathways, electrocatalyst structure and active sites, as well as the effect of the reaction environment on products distribution.

It is also pointed out by existing studies that influential factors of household emissions range from socioeconomic to geographic aspects. Promoting efficient and feasible decarbonization actions therefore calls for the quantification of the variability in emission patterns and its relationship with contextual factors. In this study, using data on monthly household expenditures at the city level, direct and indirect carbon emissions resulting from household consumption in 51 major Japanese cities in 2011 are calculated. A regression analysis is also conducted to explore the relationship between emissions from the household sector and the socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic characteristics of Japanese cities. Our results indicate seasonality and categorical differences in residential carbon emissions for cities in Japan. We also find per capita income, urban population density, and proportion of the population over 65 years old to be the most influential variables that shape the residential emission landscape of Japanese cities. We thus suggest that seasonality, categories of consumption, and city characteristics be considered as crucial factors in policy making for emission mitigation targeting consumption behavior of urban residents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","City characteristics; City-level estimation; Decarbonization policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Household consumption","Carbon; Decarbonization; Economics; Gas emissions; Housing; Petroleum prospecting; Population statistics; Regression analysis; City characteristics; Contextual factors; Emission mitigation; Household Consumption; Household expenditure; Indirect carbon emissions; Influential factors; Residential emissions; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; energy policy; energy use; estimation method; greenhouse gas; household energy; policy making; urban area; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082423832

Unlike previous studies that mainly consider the bilateral and direct connection between two sectors, this study identifies path-based key sectors by considering the cascading effect of a sector on other sectors on paths of the entire economic system. We first construct an embodied CO2 emission flow network of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, combining environmental input-output analysis and complex network theory. Then, the path-based key sectors are identified by traversing the path of each sector in the network based on cascading failure theory and hypothesis extraction method. On the one hand, the results show that a small number of sectors shoulder a large proportion of the embodied CO2 emission flows from both path and sector perspectives. On the other hand, we identify some path-based key sectors that did not receive enough attention from the sector perspective. Additionally, the sum of the embodied CO2 emission flows in about 30 steps accounts for 90% of the total embodied CO2 emission flows on its supply chain path. To more effectively reduce carbon emission, sectors that connect these 30 steps should be concerned in some policy recommendations. The method proposed in this paper can complement existing methods and contribute to further reducing CO2 emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cascading effect; Embodied carbon dioxide; Environmental accounting; Input-output analysis; Key sectors; Network analysis","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; input-output analysis; policy approach; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; carbon dioxide; China; Beijing; Carbon Dioxide; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081649683

The aim of this study is to employ a set of machine learning classifiers for detecting invasive plant species using remote sensing data. The target species is Kudzu vine, which mostly grows in the south-eastern states of the US and quickly outcompetes other plants, making it a relevant and threatening species to consider. Our study area is Atlanta, Georgia and the surrounding area. Five different algorithms: Boosted Logistic Regression (BLR), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were tested with the aim of testing their performance and identifying the most optimal one. Furthermore, the influence of temporal, spectral and spatial resolution in detecting Kudzu was also tested and reviewed. Our finding shows that random forest, neural network and support vector machine classifiers outperformed. While the achieved internal accuracies were about 97%, an external validation conducted over an expanded area of interest resulted in 79.5% accuracy. Furthermore, the study indicates that high accuracy classification can be achieved using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery and can be improved while integrating with airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral data. Finally, this study indicates that dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) should be applied cautiously to the hyperspectral AVIRIS data to preserve its utility. The applied approach and the utilized set of methods can be of interest for detecting other kinds of invasive species as part of fulfilling UN sustainable development goals, particularly number 12: responsible consumption and production, 13: climate action, and 15: life on land. © 2020 by the authors.","Classification; Hyperspectral imagery; Invasive species; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Sentinel","AVIRIS; invasive species; machine learning; multispectral image; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; support vector machine; vine; Atlanta; Georgia; United States; Pueraria montana var. lobata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086003332

That was not always the case. Odors, whether pleasant or unpleasant, can evoke strong emotions and physiological responses. Odors from animal feeding operations are normally considered unpleasant and offensive if strong smelling and smelled often or for long periods of time. Animal feeding operation owners need to be aware of their odor emissions and the impacts the odors have on their neighbors and community. Good neighbor relations and effective communications can help identify odor problems and communicate what is being done to manage them. Odor management research and education includes odor basics, key processes including generation, emissions and dispersion, impacts, community and neighbor relations, and numerous mitigation practices. Animal feeding operation owners considering practices to reduce odor emissions or their impacts need to weigh the costs, expected effectiveness, and how the practice fits into the overall operation. Policymakers need science-based information to make informed decisions that balance the concerns and needs of neighbors and the community and the businesswomen and men that own and operate the animal feeding operations.

In order to understand the climatic role of Amazon runoff into the ocean, sensitivity experiments were carried out using the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Without Amazon runoff, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strengthens and the associated increase in northward heat transport induces a positive temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic Ocean with a spatial structure similar to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). A positive phase of AMV developed in the absence of Amazon runoff triggers a bipolar seesaw in SST across the thermal equator with warming to the north and cooling to the south. The boreal summer rainfall in the tropical Atlantic Ocean sector responds to this change in SST by displacing the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) to the north of its mean position. An alternate experiment by doubling the Amazon runoff shows a weakening of AMOC and AMV and a southward shift in the summer-time ITCZ. In both the experiments, we find that the largest change in rainfall is exhibited over the region where the AMV-induced decadal variability in rainfall is prominent, confirming the source of rainfall variability. Based on sensitivity experiments by varying the runoff, we propose that the Amazon discharge can affect the multidecadal variabilities, the AMOC and AMV, and thereby the low-frequency variability of rainfall over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and northwest Africa. We conclude that the freshwater input from the Amazon plays a significant role in the sustained wet and dry climatic phases of rainfall events over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and West African nations and thus have an impact on the regional hydrological cycle and economy. © 2020 The Author(s).

Although many countries have policies and programs to expand hydrogen production, the potential for hydrogen production in different regions of Qatar has not yet been evaluated. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, evaluates the possibility of an average annual cogeneration of 14 kWh of electricity and 85 kg/day of hydrogen by a home-scale solar-wind system connected to the grid in Qatar. NASA's 20-year average of meteorological data, the electricity tariff and gasoline price in 2018, along with annual real interest rate, were used as inputs to HOMER software. The techno-econo-enviro analysis was done over a one-year period hour by hour. From the results, it was found that the lowest prices of hydrogen and electricity generated, with $ 2.092/kg and $ 11.495/kWh, were related to Grid and PV-Wind-Grid scenarios, respectively. Also, results indicated that Ar-Ruways station and PV-Wind-Grid scenario were the most environmentally suitable options that resulted in a CO2 emission rate of 1434 kg annually. To select just one station among five areas, a fuzzy method was deployed as a prioritization technique. Its results suggested that Doha Intl Airport site is the most suitable one for constructing solar-wind hybrid energy generation system. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Cost of energy; Cost of hydrogen; Fuzzy method; Grid-connected; Micro-grid","Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Meteorology; NASA; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar wind; Cost of energies; Electricity tariff; Fuzzy methods; Grid-connected; Meteorological data; Micro grid; Prioritization techniques; Real interest rates; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082851963

In contrast to forest plants, steppe plants possessed less chlorophylls and carotenoids per leaf mass (2 and 1.5 times, respectively), a low Сhl/Сar ratio, a greater (1.5 times) content of carotenoids per leaf area, and a high Сhl a/b ratio. In spite of the low chlorophyll content per leaf mass in steppe plants, their content per leaf area was similar to forest species (3–4 mg/dm2) owing to their thicker and denser leaves. This suggests that the plants of steppe and forest communities have the same potential ability to intercept solar energy in this locality. In the period of active vegetation (mid-June -early August), parameters of the pigment complex were stable both in steppe and forest communities. However, steppe plants demonstrated the modified in content of Car and Сhl b, as well as Сhl/Сar and Chl a/b ratios, in the beginning and at the end of the season that indicated a reorganization of the light-harvesting complex. Intraspecific variation of parameters during the season was two or three times lower than interspecific. High interspecific variation in forest plants were achieved due to the presence of species with thick long-lived leaves. It was concluded that the chlorophyll content per leaf area reflects the adaptation of plants to climatic conditions of the geographic region, whereas pigment contents per leaf mass shows adaptation to local irradiation in plant community (forest or steppe). © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","carotenoids; chlorophyll; diffuse light; forest; leaf thickness; LMA; plants; shade tolerance; steppe; variation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084830285

We study the decline of coal-fired power generation in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2017 by analyzing the discourse in The Guardian. We find scientists and environmental NGOs criticizing coal for climate and health reasons. Government and incumbent businesses tried to re-legitimate coal but eventually, their resistance collapsed and coal was almost completely abandoned in just a few years. Particularly devastating for coal were failed promises around carbon capture and storage, rapid diffusion of wind energy, and pressure from various policies.

It is intended to play a central role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to both jurisdictions’ 2030 limits on economy-wide emissions, but the programme features a growing bank of surplus compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) that could put participating governments’ climate targets at risk. To aid in understanding the range of possible outcomes, we built WCI-RULES, an open-source model that simulates the WCI programme’s supply-demand balance through to 2030. By using the latest historical data and representing all relevant programme regulations in computer code, WCI-RULES accurately depicts the supply side of the WCI programme and allows users to explore programme outcomes across a range of future demand-side scenarios. Model users can specify three demand-side inputs that have the largest effect on projections of the programme’s supply-demand balance: future trends in emissions covered by the programme, allowance auction outcomes, and regulated parties’ use of carbon offset credits. The model simulates neither allowance prices nor price-induced mitigation, but is interoperable with other analyses that do, and can therefore serve as a basis for inter-model comparison with other studies. We find that oversupply conditions persist across a wide range of scenarios, including one that matches the assumptions of California’s official 2030 climate strategy. If unaddressed, these conditions could frustrate participating governments’ ability to reach their economy-wide 2030 climate targets. Key policy insights WCI programme caps have exceeded regulated emissions since the programme’s inception, creating an oversupply that could jeopardize the programme’s ability to achieve its expected emission reductions. Using a new open-source model, WCI-RULES, we show that oversupply conditions persist across a range of modelled emission scenarios through to 2030, so that emissions could significantly exceed programme caps in the mid-to-late 2020s. If regulated emissions exceed programme caps in the mid-to-late 2020s, it will be difficult for California and Québec to reduce their economy-wide emissions below statutory limits. WCI-RULES can be extended in future work to simulate the effects of potential regulatory reforms as well as any new entrants to the WCI programme. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","California; cap-and-trade; carbon markets; carbon pricing; Québec; Western Climate Initiative","demand analysis; emission inventory; emissions trading; environmental economics; future prospect; mitigation; policy analysis; pollution tax; regulatory framework; California; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085054031

High penetration of solar UV radiation in clear shallow lake affects the distribution and abundance of the zooplankton communities. Survival of copepods in such habitats often relies on available photoprotective compounds. We estimated species diversity and distribution patterns of copepods with detectable carotenoids in 7 lakes of the central Himalayas along the altitudinal gradients. To determine the factors influencing the accumulation of high-level photoprotective compounds, we analyzed the physicochemical parameters of water and the concentration of Lignin like Compounds (LLCs), Aromaticity (ARO), Humic Compounds (HCs), Degree of Humification (DoH) and percent Total Organic Matter (TOM) in littoral sediments. In the shallow lakes, copepod abundance and diversity correlate with water transparency. Humic compounds (HCs) derived from ligninaceous plants stimulate the accumulation of photoprotective compounds that allow for the domination of diaptomidae. Copepods receive photoprotective compounds from the humic-bounded sediment substrate. The amount of photoprotectants in the aquatic food chain of the central Himalayas is largely influenced by ligninaceous compounds derived from catchment vegetation. In copepods of shallow clear lakes, the remnant of dead trees in the littoral zones helps to minimize hazards caused by exposure effect and climatic stress. The reduction of vegetative covers in the shorelines may alter the community structure of zooplankton, particularly in the upland ecosystem. © 2020","Adaptation; Copepods; Himalaya Lake; Photoprotective compounds","Catchments; Ecosystems; Lakes; Population distribution; Sediments; Vegetation; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Copepods; Distribution patterns; Himalayas; Photoprotective compounds; Physicochemical parameters; Zooplankton communities; Climate change; aromatic compound; astaxanthin; carotene; humic acid; lignin; organic matter; water; abundance; adaptive management; climate change; community structure; humic substance; pigment; population distribution; vegetation cover; adaptation; Article; chemical parameters; climate change; community structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; copepod; diaptomidae; ecosystem; food chain; geographic distribution; Himalayan lake; humification; India; lake; lake sediment; littoral; male; nonhuman; physical parameters; plankton; population abundance; priority journal; species diversity; vegetation; water quality; animal; zooplankton; Accumulation; Adaptation; Distribution; Ecosystems; Lakes; Plants; Sediments; Water; Himalayas; Copepoda; Diaptomidae; Animals; Climate Change; Copepoda; Ecosystem; Lakes; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079104687

PARS was adapted from the previously tested Community Readiness Survey-Short. In February/April 2016, key informants (N = 17) involved in PA activities from two rural communities were invited to complete the PARS, representing six dimensions: knowledge, leadership, resources, community climate, existing voluntary PA policies, and political climate. First, participants were asked to respond to a presurvey to screen for overall readiness for up to four evidence-based PA policies. A main survey readiness score (0-6) was determined by averaging the key informants’ ratings across items: Raw scores were rescaled to range from 0 to 1, and dimension scores were summed. Participants identified two PA policies in the presurvey: neighborhood availability and point-of-decision prompts. For both policies, political climate had the highest dimension score (1.0) and the knowledge dimension scored lowest (0.05-0.38). Overall readiness scores ranged from 3.19 to 3.62, revealing the preparation stage for both policies. Readiness for the two PA policies were similar, but specific dimension scores varied by policy type and community, reinforcing the need for tailored interventions. © 2018 Society for Public Health Education.","community assessment; health promotion; physical activity/exercise; program planning and evaluation","adult; article; averaging; climate; clinical article; community assessment; exercise; female; health promotion; human; human experiment; leadership; male; neighborhood; physical activity; program development; rural population; demography; health promotion; policy; Exercise; Health Promotion; Humans; Leadership; Policy; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059344421

However, few studies have explored how the urbanization influences urban building carbon emissions. This study attempts to establish a comprehensive framework for urbanization and systematically explore the multiple effects exerted by urbanization on urban building carbon emissions from both quantity and structure dimensions based on the STIRPAT model, using the panel data of China's 30 provinces from 2000 to 2015. Urbanization is measured from three perspectives: population, economy and space. Results show that the urban population and urban building floor space contribute negatively to the carbon emissions in the urban building sector, while the added value of the tertiary industry positively influences urban building carbon emissions in the quantity dimension. In the structure dimension, the percentage of the urban population on the total population exerts a positive impact on the increase of urban building carbon emissions, but the percentage of the tertiary industry and the plot ratio of the urban buildings play a role in cutting down urban building carbon emissions. This study provides deeper insights for the concomitant effects of urbanization on carbon emissions and can be conducive to the realization of energy conservation and carbon emission targets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Provincial panel data model; STIRPAT model; Urban building carbon emissions; Urbanization","Carbon; Urban growth; Carbon emissions; Concomitant effects; Panel data models; Stirpat models; Structure dimensions; Tertiary industries; Urban population; Urbanization; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080117087

Non-noble electrocatalysts have shown their capabilities to practical catalytic applications as compared to noble ones, whose scarcity and high price limit the development. However, the puzzling catalytic processes in non-noble electrocatalysts hinder their advancement. In-situ techniques allow us to unveil the mystery of electrocatalysis and boost the catalytic performances. Recently, various in-situ X-ray techniques have been rapidly developed, so that the whole picture of electrocatalysis becomes clear and explicit. In this review, the in-situ X-ray techniques exploring the structural evolution and chemical-state variation during electrocatalysis are summarized for mainly oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). These approaches include X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The information seized from these in-situ X-ray techniques can effectively decipher the electrocatalysis and thus provide promising strategies for advancing the electrocatalysts. It is expected that this review could be conducive to understanding these in-situ X-ray approaches and, accordingly, the catalytic mechanism to better the electrocatalysis. © 2020 IUPAC & De Gruyter.

It was designed with two goals in mind: to lead to significant emission reductions that will help reduce the cost of climate mitigation in countries with commitments as well as contribute to sustainable development in the host countries. However, there has been significant discussion about the degree to which these projects fulfilled their dual mission of emissions reductions and sustainable development, particularly with respect to fostering local community co-benefits as part of broader sustainable development outcomes. In this paper, we review literature on the co-benefits delivered by the CDM at the local or community level, based on a group of 84 peer-reviewed articles and other reports. While perspectives on co-benefits are diverse, most sources argue or acknowledge that even with more recent procedural improvements, the CDM has not consistently delivered significant co-benefits to local communities. It appears likely that the situation has improved somewhat in recent years as CDM procedures have been refined, and there may be more opportunities for enhancing procedures to favor such benefits. There is overall variability in delivering co-benefits depending on the technology type, design features and the country context. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this review article we seek to rectify this by first examining the different strains of justice scholarship (environmental, energy, climate, urban) that are informing and should inform JUT. We then turn to a discussion of just transitions in general, tracing the history of the term and current understandings in the literature.

Pilot projects are one means by which cities are experimenting with new ways of governing and financing climate change mitigation. In this paper, we develop a framework for understanding the role of pilot projects in urban policy innovation: their emergence and rationale, and the means by which they ultimately scale up and out to reduce GHG emissions. We use this framework to evaluate a pilot project for retrofitting social housing buildings in Toronto. We find the initial pilot project helped address the challenges of pursuing deep retrofits of social housing. Scaling these lessons up to the city level required overcoming challenges to financing and coordinating a larger project; scaling out to the provincial level revealed institutional and political obstacles to pursuing the co-benefits of deep building retrofits in social housing. Bridging agents play an important role in both scaling processes. The analysis reveals the additive nature of urban policy innovation and the dynamic interplay of change agents and institutional and political context in innovation processes. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization","climate change; energy efficiency; mitigation; pilot projects; policy innovation; social housing; urban policy","climate change; conceptual framework; emission control; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; policy development; social housing; urban policy; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055053612

Scientific estimates posit that by 2050, we will begin to experience some of the most damaging consequences of climate change, which will only worsen as the world becomes more populated and resources become scarcer. Considerable progress has been made to explore technological solutions, yet useful insights from a psychological perspective are still lacking. Understanding whether and how individuals and groups cope with environmental dilemmas is the first step to combatting climate change. The key challenge is how can we reduce a tendency to inaction and to understand the psychological obstacles for behavioral change that reduce climate change. We provide a social dilemma analysis of climate change, emphasizing three important ingredients: people need to recognize their own impact on the climate, there is conflict between self-interest and collective interests, and there is a temporal dilemma involving a conflict between short-term and longer-term interest. Acknowledging these features, we provide a comprehensive overview of psychological mechanisms that support inaction, and close by discussing potential solutions. In particular, we offer recommendations at the level of individuals, communities, and governments. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Human cooperation; Social dilemma; Temporal dilemma","carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; collective action; environmental impact; government; nature-society relations; psychology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084841068

The objective of this work is conducted to investigate how introduced CO2 and flue gas affect the adsorption behavior of CH4 and C2H6, which are two main components in shale gas, on shale, which is critical for understanding the fundamental mechanism of shale gas recovery. In this work, the adsorption isotherms are first measured to evaluate the relative adsorption capacity of CO2, flue gas, CH4, and C2H6 on typical shale samples. The low-field nuclear magnetic resonance technique is consequently applied to study the influence of injected CO2 and flue gas on the adsorption behavior of CH4 and C2H6 at the reservoir pressure and temperature conditions. Test results show that flue gas presents the highest adsorption capacity on shale, which is followed by C2H6, CO2, and CH4, respectively. On the basis of the measured T2 signals, CH4 and C2H6 exist in shale within the two patterns, i.e., the adsorbed pattern in pores and the free-state pattern at the pore center. After injection of CO2 and flue gas, the amount of adsorbed CH4 is reduced, accompanying with the increase of the quantity of free gas state that appeared at the pore center. In comparison to CO2, flue gas can further replace adsorbed CH4 and C2H6 from the shale surface, suggesting more feasibility of flue gas for enhancing CH4 and C2H6 recovery. This study may inspire new strategies that can be applied for shale reservoir development; more importantly, it may provide a new way for the usage of flue gas for energy supply while reducing the possibility for environmental pollution.

Complex photonic crystals and bulk materials for multilayer films are mostly considered as ideal passive cooling materials. However, we have synthesized a novel efficient single passive cooling powder Ca0.5Mg10.5(HPO3)8(OH)3F3 (CFM). The average reflectivity is as high as 0.98 in solar spectrum region (0.2–2.5 μm), while the average emissivity of the atmospheric window (8–13 μm) is 0.91, and explored its reflection and emission mechanism. In order to obtain the cooling effect in the natural environment (without convection shielding), we apply CFM powder coating on commercial wall tiles. Under summer direct sunlight, the surface temperature of CFM coating is 5.1 °C lower than the ambient temperature on average, and at night 2–5.3 °C below the ambient temperature. A CFM coating daytime cooling power up to 84.25 W/m2 was obtained by using the feedback heating method. This simple and cheap, while easy to produce, CFM material can be applied in large scale to urban buildings to reduce the surface temperature, to save energy, and to possibly ameliorate the heat island effect. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society","Ca0.5Mg10.5(HPO3)8(OH)3F3 coating; Cool roof; Heat island effect; Radiative cooling","Building materials; Multilayer films; Powder coatings; Radiative Cooling; Surface properties; Atmospheric window; Complex photonic crystals; Cool roofs; Emission mechanism; Heat island effect; Natural environments; Passive cooling; Surface temperatures; Atmospheric temperature; coating; cooling; heat island; inorganic compound; roof; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082663920

Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the interpolyhedral O-O bond is formed in pyrite-type CoO2 with low-spin Co2+ similar to the case of FeO2, whereas ferromagnetic CrO2 and antiferromagnetic MnO2 belong to dioxides with separate O2- anions. The oxidation state of the cation and the potential formation of O-O bonding are affected by the crystal-field splitting, charge transfer between the cation and the anion, but primarily by the magnetic coupling among 3d electrons in a pyrite-type 3d TMO2. The spin crossover-induced magnetism-vanishing at high pressures contributes to a smaller cell volume and a weaker electronic correlation, facilitating the formation of an O-O bond and a reduction of the oxidation state of the cation. These results provide critical physical insights into the formation mechanism of 3d TM peroxides with O2 2- dimers. Based on this conclusion, we have further theoretically predicted the formation of the hydrogen-bearing cobalt peroxide at high pressures. This shows another example for exploring the nature of hydrogen-bearing TM peroxides and sheds light on synthesizing novel TM peroxide materials under high pressure. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Chromium compounds; Dimers; High pressure engineering; Iron oxides; Magnetism; Manganese oxide; Negative ions; Oxidation; Peroxides; Positive ions; Pyrites; Transition metals; 3d transition metals; Antiferromagnetics; Crystal-field splitting; Different pressures; Electronic correlation; Formation mechanism; Physical and chemical properties; Theoretical calculations; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084953016

Statistical inference is also performed on the GMPI results using the bootstrapping method. Empirical research was conducted on 15 international airlines during 2011-2017. The obtained results showed that the productivity of all airlines had been fluctuating and experienced a slight increase over 2011–2017. Most of these 15 airlines made more progress in managing punctuality than CO2 emissions. High punctuality policy may not be the best choice for all airlines when considering financial constraints, while airlines in more liberalized aviation markets are more likely to improve productivity by reducing flight delays. Efficiency change and technological change were the major driving factors for the growth of airline productivity. European and US airlines benefitted more from superior technology, while most Asian and Oceanian airlines still benefitted from the advantage of efficiency.

This paper analyses the effects of the trade liberalization of EG based on macroeconomic and electricity sector models and attempts to find a more efficient EG trade policy by comparing different EG lists, considering end-use control and combining the EG policy with a carbon tax. The results show that the trade liberalization of EG does not necessarily benefit the environment without other policies, as the effects of the multiple end-uses of EG on conventional energy might result in environmental damage. We find that merging an EGA into a global carbon tax system would enhance the effects of carbon tax on CO2 reduction by 33%, and simultaneously lower the GDP loss due to the carbon tax by 75%. The economic benefits from the EGA could offset the costs of other environmental policies. Thus, end-use control and other environmental policies should be considered at both the global and regional levels in the setting of international trade agreements that target EG. © 2019","Carbon tax; E3ME model; Energy technology; Environmental goods agreement; Trade liberalization of environmental goods","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Environmental protection; International trade; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Effectiveness analysis; Energy technologies; Environmental damage; Environmental goods; Environmental policy; Low carbon electricity technologies; Trade liberalizations; Environmental technology; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy use; environmental conditions; environmental economics; international trade; numerical model; pollution tax; trade agreement; trade liberalization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082611747

However, there is lack of information to track the changes in cooling patterns of Chinese urban households and little research to reveal factors relating with cooling behavior. This has become barriers for China's green and efficient action plan on cooling. Therefore, this research conducted a national-wide online questionnaire survey across China, and try to explore the cooling usage pattern change in urban households and factors impacting this change. By comparative analysis, correlation analysis and Jonckheere-Terpstra test on surveyed result, conclusions concerning changes in cooling patterns and the essential influential factors were obtained.

Based on a 3D geological model and oil production history, 16 scenarios of water-alternating-CO2 injection operations with different water alternating gas (WAG) ratios and slug sizes, as well as continuous CO2 injection (Con-CO2) and primary depletion production (No-CO2) scenarios, have been simulated spanning 20 years. The results represent a significant improvement in oil recovery by CO2 WAG over both Con-CO2 and No-CO2 scenarios. TheWAG ratio and slug size of water affect the efficiency of oil recovery and CO2 injection. The optimum operations are those with WAG ratios lower than 1:2, which have the higher ultimate oil recovery factor of 24%. AlthoughWAG reduced the CO2 injection volume, the CO2 storage efficiency is still high, more than 84% of the injected CO2 was sequestered in the reservoir. Results indicate that the immiscible water-alternating-CO2 processes can be optimized to improve significantly the performance of pressure maintenance and oil recovery in offshore reef heavy-oil reservoirs significantly. The simulation results suggest that the LH11-1 field is a good candidate site for immiscible CO2 enhanced oil recovery and storage for the Guangdong carbon capture, utilization and storage (GDCCUS) project. © 2020 by the authors.

As an incentive environmental regulation measure, an environmental tax has been proven to effectively alleviate environmental problems and reduce corporate pollutant emissions. From the perspective of environmental tax equity and efficiency, this study collects more than 100,000 enterprises' pollutant-discharge and pollutant-discharge fee data from 4300 pollutant disposal enterprises in Yunnan Province, China in 2017. The study analyzes the marginal abatement cost (MAC) of water pollution and air pollution in key industries by using the MAC accounting method. Under the three scenarios of low, medium and high tax rates set by the study, the study evaluates the applicable tax rates of environmental tax of enterprises under different tax rates. The main findings of the study are: (1) the MAC of pollutants in various industries is quite different in different industries; (2) the environmental tax rate of 2018 is generally low and is not enough to encourage enterprises to reduce more pollution; (3) most enterprises will not invest a large amount of funds to carry out technological transformation for green production, without the government's mandatory environmental regulation measure. The study recommends that the government needs to increase the environmental tax rate, gradually approach the cost of corporate pollutant-treatment and force the technological transformation of enterprises. At the same time, the government itself needs to do a good job of tax neutrality, increase the compensation for environmental protection behaviors of enterprises, and encourage green development of enterprises. Finally, the taxation supervision should be strengthened, and the tax violations of enterprises should be checked strictly for avoidance of tax cuts against rules. © 2020 by the authors.","China; Enterprises; Environmental tax rate; Pollution control cost; Tax efficiency; Yunnan province","abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; environmental protection; environmental tax; equity; poverty alleviation; water pollution; China; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085704224

The future structure of plant microbiomes will depend on the, largely unknown, relative importance of each. This uncertainty is particularly relevant for arctic peatlands, which are undergoing large shifts in plant communities and soil microbiomes as permafrost thaws, and are potentially appreciable sources of climate change feedbacks due to their soil carbon (C) storage. We characterized phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes of six plant species, and bulk peat, across a permafrost thaw progression (from intact permafrost, to partially- and fully-thawed stages) via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We tested the hypothesis that the relative influence of biotic versus environmental filtering (the role of plant species versus thaw-defined habitat) in structuring microbial communities would differ among phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and bulk peat. Using both abundance- and phylogenetic-based approaches, we found that phyllosphere microbial composition was more strongly explained by plant associate, with little influence of habitat, whereas in the rhizosphere, plant and habitat had similar influence. Network-based community analyses showed that keystone taxa exhibited similar patterns with stronger responses to drivers. However, plant associates appeared to have a larger influence on organisms belonging to families associated with methane-cycling than the bulk community. Putative methanogens were more strongly influenced by plant than habitat in the rhizosphere, and in the phyllosphere putative methanotrophs were more strongly influenced by plant than was the community at large. We conclude that biotic effects can be stronger than environmental filtering, but their relative importance varies among microbial groups. For most microbes in this system, biotic filtering was stronger aboveground than belowground. However, for putative methane-cyclers, plant associations have a stronger influence on community composition than environment despite major hydrological changes with thaw. This suggests that plant successional dynamics may be as important as hydrological changes in determining microbial relevance to C-cycling climate feedbacks. By partitioning the degree that plant versus environmental filtering drives microbiome composition and function we can improve our ability to predict the consequences of warming for C-cycling in other arctic areas undergoing similar permafrost thaw transitions. © Copyright © 2020 Hough, McClure, Bolduc, Dorrepaal, Saleska, Klepac-Ceraj and Rich.","climate feedbacks; IsoGenie Project; keystone species; microbial community assembly; permafrost thaw; plant–microbial interactions; Stordalen Mire","methane; peat; RNA 16S; Arctic; Article; bioinformatics; carbon cycling; climate change; community structure; environmental factor; habitat; hydrology; keystone species; methanogen; methanotroph; microbial community; microbiome; microorganism; nonhuman; peatland; permafrost; phyllosphere; phylogeny; plant; plant community; plant microorganism interaction; rhizosphere; thawing; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085591191

However, effective electron transfer between biosynthesized NPs and electrode remains a challenge due to the uncontrollable and poor conductive property of cell substrates. In this study, graphene oxide (GO) was introduced into a bio-Pd synthesis process governed by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, which was demonstrated to be simultaneously reduced with Pd(II) and transformed to reduced GO (rGO), resulting in the formation of a Pd-cells-rGO composite. Compared to the control without rGO (Pd-cells), the electrochemical conductivity of Pd-cells-rGO composite increased from almost zero to 196 μS cm−1, indicating the rGO facilities the electron transport across the composite. Electrochemical characterizations revealed the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of Pd in Pd-cells-rGO was enlarged by increasing the amount of rGO in the composite, clearly indicating that the conductive network created by rGO enable the Pd NPs receive electrons from electrode and become electrochemical active. A considerable enhancement of electrocatalytic activity was further confirmed for Pd-cells-rGO as indicated by 36.7- and 17.2-fold increase (Pd-cells-rGO with Pd/GO ratio of 5/1 vs Pd-cells) of steady state current density toward hydrogen evolution and nitrobenzene reduction at −0.7 V and −0.55 V vs Ag/AgCl, respectively. We also compared the electrocatalytic performance with MWCNTs hybrids Pd-cells-CNTs. It was found that the association of Pd, cells and rGO creates an interactive and synergistic environment to allow higher conductivity and catalytic activity under the same amount of carbon nanomaterial.

Using tree ring 14C archives, we reconstruct an historical CO2ff time series from 1991 to 2015 in the greater Xi'an region, China. CO2ff concentrations from the urban sites reached 22.5 ppm, with an average of 14.0 ppm, while average values from rural and mountain sites averaged about 6.0 ppm. These values provide a good measure of the distribution of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the region. We also observed CO2ff concentration increases from both urban and rural sites during the study period, with more significant increases among urban sites. The persistent rise in CO2ff was attributed to increasing energy consumption caused by regional socio-economic development, which are corroborated by strong correlations between CO2ff and socioeconomic parameters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Fossil fuel-derived CO2; Radiocarbon; Tree rings; Xi'an","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Forestry; Time series; Urban growth; Carbon emissions; Emission reduction; Radiocarbon; Socio-economic development; Strong correlation; Tree rings; Urban and rural sites; Xi'an; Fossil fuels; carbon 14; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; carbon dioxide; accelerator mass spectrometry; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); correlation; fossil fuel; radiocarbon dating; reconstruction; tree ring; accelerator mass spectrometry; Article; China; concentration (parameter); energy consumption; mass spectrometry; plant parameters; priority journal; rural area; tree ring; trend study; urban area; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; China; Shaanxi; Xian; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; China; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078658809

Coal/natural gas combustion, gasoline emission, diesel emission and oil leakage were identified as potential PAH sources for both road runoffs, but made different contributions. The potential toxicological effects of PAH sources in runoff were assessed by combining the total toxic BaP equivalent (TEQ) values with estimated source contributions. Results showed that (gasoline and diesel) vehicle emissions had the highest TEQ values, while coal/natural gas combustion and oil leakage had relatively low TEQ values.

However, due to a lack of data representativeness in many parts of the world, considerable variations were observed among studies, and thus makes life cycle assessment (LCA) results difficult for the decision-making purpose. In addition, the selection of low impact materials and the management of end-of-life building waste are the most important concern. By considering several strategies including data representativeness, low carbon material, and end-of-life building waste management, this study aimed to enhance the accuracy of such assessment and sustainability performance of building. An integrated LCA framework is proposed for implementing those strategies through a case specific high-rise residential building in Hong Kong. Based on case-specific/regional data, carbon emission of building was evaluated with a cradle-to-construction system boundary with the functional unit of 1 m2 of gross floor area using the IMPACT 2002+ method, and then compared to that of selecting generic databases under different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the application of case-specific and generic data would significantly influence the outcomes of the case study, as the deviations of certain magnitudes were mostly derived from different building materials that it can lead to an underestimation of carbon emissions of up to 28%. Along with using alternative materials, the adoption of the proposed materials cycling and resource recovery approach at the end-of-life building could lead to a reduction of 14% of the total emissions (i.e. excluding the use and renovation of building). The results would support data selection for accuracy of evaluation which can be used as benchmark where recognized database is not available and promote sustainability performance of buildings locally, while the proposed framework could be adopted for comprehensive evaluation globally. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building construction; Carbon emissions; Data representativeness; Generic data; Life cycle assessment","accuracy assessment; benchmarking; building; building construction; carbon emission; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; sustainability; valuation; waste management; Article; building industry; clinical evaluation; comparative study; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; exhaust gas; recycling; waste management; building material; Hong Kong; waste management; China; Hong Kong; Construction Industry; Construction Materials; Hong Kong; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078998321

The oceanic processes governing these fluxes are often sensitive to the changes in ocean pH (or pCO2) accompanying ocean acidification (OA), with potential for future climate feedbacks. Here, we review current understanding (from observational, experimental and model studies) on the impact of OA on marine sources of key climate-active trace gases, including dimethyl sulfide (DMS), nitrous oxide (N2O), ammonia and halocarbons. We focus on DMS, for which available information is considerably greater than for other trace gases. We highlight OA-sensitive regions such as polar oceans and upwelling systems, and discuss the combined effect of multiple climate stressors (ocean warming and deoxygenation) on trace gas fluxes. To unravel the biological mechanisms responsible for trace gas production, and to detect adaptation, we propose combining process rate measurements of trace gases with longer term experiments using both model organisms in the laboratory and natural planktonic communities in the field. Future ocean observations of trace gases should be routinely accompanied by measurements of two components of the carbonate system to improve our understanding of how in situ carbonate chemistry influences trace gas production. Together, this will lead to improvements in current process model capabilities and more reliable predictions of future global marine trace gas fluxes. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We herein report a case of recurrent lumbar spine osteoblastoma that was treated by repeated surgery and carbon ion radiotherapy. Case presentation: A 13-year-old Japanese girl presented with left side lumbar pain. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine demonstrated a tumorous lesion in the left side pedicle of L4. Although gross total resection of the mass, including the nidus, was performed in the initial surgery, recurrence was observed repeatedly in the short term and the pathological diagnosis of all of the resected tumors was conventional osteoblastoma. We finally performed carbon ion radiotherapy after the patient's 3rd palliative operation, and achieved a good outcome. No further recurrence has been observed in 10 years of follow-up. Conclusion: We performed carbon ion radiotherapy for a case of recurrent spinal osteoblastoma and achieved a good outcome without recurrence at 10 years after carbon ion radiotherapy treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of osteoblastoma that was treated with carbon ion radiotherapy after multiple surgeries. © 2020 The Author(s).","Carbon ion radiotherapy; Multiple surgery; Recurrent osteoblastoma","adolescent; Article; cancer palliative therapy; cancer surgery; case report; clinical article; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; female; fibrosis; follow up; hematoma; histopathology; human; human tissue; image guided biopsy; ion therapy; Japanese (people); limb pain; low back pain; lumbar spine; muscle weakness; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteoblastoma; recurrent disease; spine tumor; tumor recurrence; lumbar vertebra; osteoblastoma; pathology; reoperation; spine tumor; tumor recurrence; x-ray computed tomography; Adolescent; Female; Heavy Ion Radiotherapy; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Osteoblastoma; Reoperation; Spinal Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085263715

Currently the major issues in Ethiopia, as a least developed country with a rapid urbanisation, include a high level of income inequality, lack of formal employment opportunities, deeply rooted poverty, tenure insecurity, poor infrastructure, and limited access to electricity and energy. The Erasmus+ Project “Social Inclusion and Energy Management for Informal Urban Settlements”, enables European and Ethiopian universities to develop new university courses integrating the aspects of sustainability for future professionals in the field of architecture, urban planning but also social sciences. The paper investigates the respective situation in Ethiopia, and demonstrates the interactions of six selected Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations highly linked with this topic. These six Sustainable Development Goals were identified in a participative process, involving different stakeholders like government officials, urban planners or informal settlers by interviews, focus groups, workshops and conferences. The focus is on SDG1 “No Poverty”, SDG3 “Good Health and Well-being”, SDG7 “Affordable and Clean Energy”, SDG11 “Sustainable Cities and Communities”, SDG13 “Climate Action” and SDG15 “Life on Land”. In the context of Ethiopian cities, energy production and distribution have been highly centralised under state entities and the scope for exploring local/business driven and decentralised energy systems has been limited. Transitions can be implemented towards sustainability and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, if collective identification and structuring of issues along with collective envisioning of the future, and the interactions and trade-offs of different goals are taken into consideration. © 2020 WITPress.

We present a new method that remotely detects, locates, and quantifies gas emission rates by sequentially steering an optical beam between multiple retro-reflectors. The novel open-path laser gas sensor uses Laser Dispersion Spectroscopy (LDS), with seven beams up to 98 meters long deployed across open, flat terrain. LDS offers high precision (10–20 ppb), high dynamic range and linearity, enhanced immunity to atmospheric perturbations, with fast response to probe an area in 3 s. Simultaneous wind and concentration data were collected for four calibrated methane gas release schemes with emission rates of ~1.3 kg/hr. The resulting data were processed using a Bayesian, Markov chain Monte-Carlo inverse solver to locate the sources and quantify their mass emission rates and uncertainty bounds.

In order to better apply such materials, the local chemistry and reaction pathways governing hydrothermal carbon growth must be understood. We report the use of scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) to observe chemical changes in the functionality of carbon between the interface and bulk regions of HTC. Spatially-resolved, element-specific X-ray photo-absorption spectra show the presence of differing local carbon chemistry between bulk “core” and interface “shell” regions of a glucose-derived hydrothermal carbon spherule. STXM provides direct evidence to suggest that mechanistic pathways differ between the core and shell of the hydrothermal carbon. In the shell region, at the water-carbon interface, more aldehyde and/or carboxylic species are suspected to provide a reactive interface for bridging reactions to occur with local furan-based monomers. In contrast, condensation reactions appear to dominate in the core, removing aryl-linking units between polyfuranic domains. The application of STXM to HTC presents opportunities for a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution of carbon species within hydrothermal carbon, especially at the solvent-carbon interface. © 2020 The Authors",,"Carbonization; Condensation reactions; Hydrochemistry; Shells (structures); X rays; Bridging reactions; Core shell structure; Hydrothermal carbons; Mechanistic pathways; Reaction pathways; Scanning transmission x ray microscopy; Spatially resolved; Thermo chemical process; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078706978

Methane emissions from ruminant fermentation are of particular relevance in the context of greenhouse gas mitigation. The emission dynamics are so far insufficiently understood. We analyzed hourly methane emission data collected during contrasting seasons from two naturally ventilated dairy cattle buildings with concrete floor and performed a second order polynomial regression. We found a parabolic temperature dependence of the methane emissions irrespective of the measurement site and setup. The position of the parabola vertex varied when considering different hours of the day. The circadian rhythm of methane emissions was represented by the pattern of the fitted values of the constant term of the polynomial and could be well explained by feeding management and air flow conditions. We found barn specific emission minima at ambient temperatures around 10 °C to 15 °C. As this identified temperature optimum coincides with the welfare temperature of dairy cows, we concluded that temperature regulation of dairy cow buildings with concrete floor should be considered and further investigated as an emission mitigation measure. Our results further indicated that empirical modeling of methane emissions from the considered type of buildings with a second order polynomial for the independent variable air temperature can increase the accuracy of predicted long-term emission values for regions with pronounced seasonal temperature fluctuations. © 2020 by the authors.","Barn-specific pattern; Greenhouse gas; Livestock; Temperature dependency","air temperature; carbon emission; cattle; dairy farming; fermentation; food supplementation; livestock farming; methane; ruminant; temperature effect; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085705445

Within the terrestrial biosphere, the magnitude of carbon storage can vary in response to environmental perturbations such as changing temperature or hydroclimate1, potentially generating feedback on the atmospheric inventory of carbon dioxide. Although temperature controls the storage of soil organic carbon at mid and high latitudes2,3, hydroclimate may be the dominant driver of soil carbon persistence in the tropics4,5; however, the sensitivity of tropical soil carbon turnover to large-scale hydroclimate variability remains poorly understood. Here we show that changes in Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall have controlled the residence time of soil carbon in the Ganges–Brahmaputra basin over the past 18,000 years. Comparison of radiocarbon ages of bulk organic carbon and terrestrial higher-plant biomarkers with co-located palaeohydrological records6 reveals a negative relationship between monsoon rainfall and soil organic carbon stocks on a millennial timescale. Across the deglaciation period, a depletion of basin-wide soil carbon stocks was triggered by increasing rainfall and associated enhanced soil respiration rates. Our results suggest that future hydroclimate changes in tropical regions are likely to accelerate soil carbon destabilization, further increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon dioxide; fatty acid; rain; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; concentration (composition); deglaciation; organic carbon; residence time; soil organic matter; soil respiration; tropical soil; Article; atmospheric moisture; carbon cycle; carbon storage; climate change; hydroclimate; monsoon climate; priority journal; seasonal variation; sediment; soil; soil carbon; soil respiration; summer; atmosphere; carbon sequestration; chemistry; history; season; soil; temperature; time factor; tropic climate; Brahmani Basin; Ganges Basin; India; Odisha; Embryophyta; Atmosphere; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Earth, Planet; History, Ancient; Rain; Seasons; Soil; Temperature; Time Factors; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085128319

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can provide a bridge that connects transport electrification to renewable bioenergy sources such as ethanol. However, it remains unclear how this pathway can simultaneously address economic, energy and environmental goals. To tackle this challenge, the present study explores, for the first time, the multiobjective optimal sizing of PHEVs powered by low-carbon sources of electricity and ethanol-gasoline blend. The empirical ethanol-gasoline blend model is incorporated into the PHEV simulation whose relevant parameters are validated using laboratory data from the European Commission – Joint Research Centre. We develop a full picture of the use-phase well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG emissions from ethanol, gasoline and grid electricity and their energy consumptions. Consequently, market-oriented PHEV sizing solutions are provided as per the power utility generation portfolio and automobile fuel properties of the target region. The results indicate that better performances of the PHEV, regarding GHG emissions and energy consumption, are associated with larger battery size and smaller engine displacement but result in a higher cost-to-power ratio. Specifically, for E25-fuelled PHEVs in markets with world average electricity carbon intensity, every 1.0 USD/kW increase in cost-to-power ratio leads to savings of 1.6 MJ energy consumption and 1.7 g CO2-eq/km WTW GHG emissions. Moreover, a clear benefit of using E25 in the hybrid propulsion system is identified, where the energy consumption and GHG emissions can be reduced by 5.9% and 12.3%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ethanol-gasoline blends; Low carbon propulsion; Multiobjective optimization; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle","Carbon; Commerce; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Propulsion; Advanced propulsion technology; Ethanol gasoline blend; European Commission; Generation portfolios; Hybrid propulsion systems; Low carbon; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Vehicle propulsion systems; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; electric vehicle; electricity; energy efficiency; ethanol; European Commission; greenhouse gas; optimization; performance assessment; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082008537

The pulse stage is a complex but usual discharge process in corona discharge. In this paper, we investigate the pulse characteristics of negative corona discharge in a needle-to-plane electrode configuration in SF6/N2 gas mixtures under DC voltages. With an increase in mean current, a stage transition phenomenon from the Townsend stage through the pulse stage to the breakdown stage is observed. The variation in pulse amplitude and pulse time characteristics at the pulse stage is analyzed. In addition, the effects of gas pressure, gap spacing, and N2 content on onset voltage and pulse characteristic parameters, including pulse time parameters and the pulse repetition rate, at the pulse stage are presented. The results show that the current pulses mainly exhibit an irregular distribution of small amplitude. The pulse time parameters are not affected by gas pressure, gap spacing, or N2 content at pressures higher than 0.1 MPa. The pulse repetition rate decreases with an increase in gas pressure and N2 content but is only weakly affected by gap spacing, ranging from 1 kHz to dozens of kHz. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Electric corona; Gases; Sulfur hexafluoride; Corona discharges; Discharge process; Electrode configurations; Insulation degradation; Negative corona discharges; Pulse characteristics; Reliable operation; Stage transitions; Pulse repetition rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090825873

However, no studies have examined responses of airway mechanics to air pollution exposure in asthmatic children. Methods: In this panel study involving indoor air filtration manipulation that created a large gradient of personal exposure to PM2.5, the airway mechanics and lung function of 43 asthmatic children 5–13 years old in a suburb of Shanghai were measured four times within 3 consecutive months. Concentrations of indoor and outdoor PM2.5 and ozone were coupled with individual time-activity data to calculate personal exposures. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the relationships of personal exposure with indicators of airway mechanics and lung function, respectively. Results: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in 24-hour average PM2.5 personal exposure (30.3 µg/m3) in the prior day was associated with significant increases in small airway resistance (R5-R20) of 15.8%, total airway resistance (R5) of 6.3%, and airway inflammation (FeNO) of 9.6%. These associations were stronger in children with lower blood eosinophil counts (&lt;450/µL). No significant associations were found between personal PM2.5 exposure and lung function. Low-level ozone exposure (daily maximum 8-hour exposure range 1.1–56.4 ppb) was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusion: Changes in personal PM2.5 exposure, partly enhanced by air filtration, were associated with significant changes in airway resistance and inflammation in children with asthma. These findings suggest the importance of reducing PM2.5 exposure, via personal air quality management, in improving airflow limitation in the airways, especially the small airways. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution exposure; Airway mechanics; Asthma management; Asthmatic children; Impulse oscillometry; Pulmonary physiology","Air filters; Air quality; Biological organs; Exposure controls; Indoor air pollution; Iron compounds; Mechanics; Nitrogen compounds; Ozone; Pathology; Quality management; Air pollution exposures; Airway mechanics; Asthma managements; Asthmatic children; Impulse oscillometry; Pulmonary physiology; Diseases; ozone; ozone; air quality; asthma; atmospheric pollution; child health; concentration (composition); health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; adolescent; air pollutant; airway resistance; Article; asthma; breathing mechanics; child; clinical article; eosinophil count; exposure; female; human; lung mechanics; male; particulate matter; priority journal; respiratory tract inflammation; adverse event; air pollution; China; environmental exposure; epidemiology; preschool child; Adolescent; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Ozone; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081207557

Reasonable urban planning and design can allow cooler wind penetration and thereby UHI mitigation. Upon the local climate zone, the precinct ventilation zone is developed at the local scale with the consideration of wind influence during planning and design. Nevertheless, the precinct ventilation performance (PVP) and its potential influence on precinct outdoor thermal environment (POTE) and precinct outdoor thermal comfort (POTC) have not been well understood. As a result, this study aims to examine PVP and its associated influence on POTE and POTC. This is achieved by a case study within an open midrise gridiron (OMG) precinct in Sydney, Australia during summertime. Result indicates the combinations of the OMG precinct with different external meteorological conditions (EMC) resulted in significant variations in PVP, POTE and POTC. Street orientation in the OMG precinct was not a determinant of PVP, POTE and POTC variations. Compared with the inland wind, sea breeze resulted in weaker UHII within the OMG precinct and more areas underwent cool island effects. Nevertheless, wind could not fully explain the variation of POTE and POTC, while it still had cooling potentials under specific conditions. When the sea breeze prevailed, wind exhibited its cooling potential under the combination of negative UHII and shading as well as that of positive UHII and solar exposure. Forced by the inland wind, precinct ventilation could still have cooling potential under positive UHII and solar exposure combination. Moreover, for cities like Sydney with not high air moisture, moisture increase could result in UHI mitigation and POTC improvement, which was also a way of sea breeze cooling under certain conditions. Afterwards, some implications for local warming mitigation through precinct planning and design have been presented. Overall, this study provides the understandings of the PVP and its associated influence on POTE and POTC within the OMG precinct, and can practically inform urban planners and designers with the wind-sensitive urban planning and design for local warming mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air temperature; Open midrise gridiron precinct; Precinct ventilation cooling; Precinct ventilation zone; Sea breeze; Wind velocity","Air; Atmospheric temperature; Moisture; Urban planning; Air temperature; Meteorological condition; Open midrise gridiron precinct; Outdoor thermal comfort; Outdoor thermal environment; Sea breeze; Ventilation performance; Wind velocities; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077060839

This study focused on the speed of expansions of land-use area related to the biomass-based NETs and assessed the feasibility of climate change mitigation scenarios to achieve the temperature targets. Our model analysis shows that expansions at unprecedented speeds are required for total cropland area (including energy cropland) in Sub-Saharan Africa and for planted forest area for carbon sink in many regions in the next decades, under the assumption of global least-cost measures for CO2 emission reduction. On the other hand, when the speed of the land-use expansions is limited as observed in the real world, the CO2 emission reduction costs become unrealistically high around the middle of this century, particularly in scenarios for the 1.5 °C target; relatively low-cost measures such as BECCS in Sub-Saharan Africa and AR in many regions are limited in deployment due to the limited speed of the land-use expansion, and yet energy systems must be transformed to nearly net-zero/negative CO2 emissions for the 2 °C/1.5 °C target, which necessitates using other mitigation technologies of much higher costs. These results may cause concern over the feasibility of achieving the temperature targets, especially for the 1.5 °C target, and point to technical and scenario design aspects that will need further research for biomass-based NETs and their allowable expansion speed. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","2 °C and 1.5 °C targets; Afforestation/reforestation; Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; Climate change; Land-use change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081652612

However, the main perceived added value of the studied network organisations is around their function as facilitator of personal networking among local policymakers. While learning certainly takes place and is actively promoted by some networks, most peer-exchanges are about the sharing of knowledge and do not qualify as learning. Therefore, we suggest to distinguish thoroughly between mere ‘knowledge sharing’ and processes of in-depth learning.

The inventory showed that evaporative emissions were high in metropolitan and urban areas because of the large populations in these areas and the high vehicle parking frequency. Using the new inventory, the sensitivity of evaporative emissions to the concentration of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol was evaluated using the chemical transport modeling solver, the community multiscale air quality modeling system (CMAQ), coupled with the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The calculation results showed that the evaporative emissions from permeation through fuel related parts were more significant in the generation of the tropospheric ozone than those from fuel tank venting. This was because the permeation emissions included a high proportion of high maximum incremental reactivity value components, such as aromatics. Neither of the evaporative emission types were significant secondary organic aerosol generators. Whole reduction of the evaporative emissions contributed an approximate 3 ppb decrease in tropospheric ozone in urban areas during the daytime.

Consequently, in addition to architects, planners must consider different urban strategies to limit the pollution risks from vehicular emissions using air pollutant dispersion in order to promote outdoor air quality. Therefore, urban morphology as a passive strategy has gradually reflected new challenge to promote air pollutants dispersion. In this context, this paper aims to investigate the effect of the urban morphology on promoting outdoor air quality at the Mubarak residential blocks in Port Said city. To this aim, four alternatives with various urban forms, and morphological indicators are proposed, and quantitatively assessed to investigate their influence on the dispersion of air pollutants using Ansys Fluent. A transient three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is performed with two specific inflow conditions to assess the performance of each alternative. The results confirmed that the integration of the urban form, and morphological indicators can affect the dispersion of air pollutants. In addition, vertical morphological indicators can dilute the concentrations of air pollutants more so than horizontal indicators over the same time sequence. The proposed alternatives reduced the concentrations of air pollutants by approximately 20–85% compared with the current case, hence promoting both outdoor, and indoor air quality. Such promoting enables residential units to utilize natural ventilation from roadside windows. Moreover, this study will help designers, and policymakers to regrade urban extended in the future from numerous alternatives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CFD simulation; Outdoor air quality; Passive strategy; PM10 dispersion; Urban morphology","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Computational fluid dynamics; Health risks; Housing; Morphology; Ventilation; Air pollutant dispersion; CFD simulations; Morphological indicator; Natural ventilation; Outdoor air qualities; Passive strategy; Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics; Urban morphology; Indoor air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078655908

This means that net C emission could vary depending on rice cultivation techniques, which is not well documented in Asian regions. In the present investigation, the effect of different C sources on major greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and their relationships between C inputs and outputs were established by using closed static chamber technique. Total methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and CO2 emissions were significantly higher with integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) based fertilization with cowdung (CD), poultry manure (PM) and vermicompost (VC) than chemical fertilizer alone. Net ecosystem C budget (NECB) was positive with CD-IPNS (52–54 kg C ha−1), PM-IPNS (62–64 kg C ha−1) and VC-IPNS (53–56 kg C ha−1) but negative with chemical fertilization (−7 to −8 kg C ha−1). In control and chemical fertilizer treatments, net CO2 sequestration was negative (−602 and −87 kg CO2 ha−1), but organic amendments showed positive CO2 sequestration that varied from 68 to 94 kg CO2 ha−1 during the study periods. Organic amendment significantly improved CO2 capturing capacity by about 17–22 gm kg−1 grain yield compared to chemical fertilization (−24 to −25 gm kg−1). Rice yield also enhanced by about 14–23% with organic amendments compared to chemical fertilizer treatment. In conclusion, use of organic C sources would be very valuable practice to increase net CO2 sequestration and wet season rice yield under tropical climatic conditions. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cowdung; greenhouse gas emission; net primary production; poultry manure; vermicompost","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Nitrogen oxides; Carbon sequestration; Chemical fertilizers; Cow dung; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Net primary production; Poultry manure; Static chamber technique; Vermicomposts; Fertilizers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082324977

Petrography, microthermometric measurements and laser Raman spectroscopy of fluid inclusions in quartz grains associated with scheelite indicate that the ore-forming fluid of the tungsten mineralisation in Yangbishan deposit belonged to the moderate-temperature NaCl–H2O–CH4±N2 system. Fluid inclusion analyses indicate that ore-forming fluid experienced decreasing temperatures and fluid degassing, inducing scheelite precipitation. Analysis of C, H and O isotopes of fluid inclusions within scheelite grains show δ13C values varying from −20.7 to −24.9‰, δD from −109.9 to −119.9‰, δ18O from 6.8 to 10.0‰ and δ18OH2O from 8.7 to 11.9‰.

Since the Belt and Road Initiative has increasing influence on manufacturing-oriented developing countries, more attention should be paid to carbon emission reduction in these regions. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis by analyzing the carbon inequality and regional development and compares the carbon emissions driven by final demand among countries in and outside the Belt and Road area from 1990 to 2015. It is found that the majority of the Belt and Road regions achieved a rapid GDP growth rate with increasing carbon emissions, in which the investment-driven type demonstrated a significant growth. In contrast, the developed countries outside the Belt and Road area maintained their economic growth while decreasing the carbon emissions owed to the declining of investment-driven emissions; however the consumption-driven emissions stably remained a relatively high level. Our results showed that the inequality of carbon emission within Belt and Road regions is lower than the global average, while the inequality of the investment-driven emissions showed an obviously increasing trend. By discussing the carbon inequality and regional development, rational and feasible strategies for countries and regions within and outside the Belt and Road area are essential, and different types of strategies such as low-carbon technologies transfers and overseas financial cooperation are suggested for regional carbon emission reduction and sustainable regional development under the Belt and Road Initiative. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Belt and Road Initiative; Carbon inequality; Global climate change; Regional development","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; economic growth; environmental economics; global climate; global warming; regional development; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; air quality; Article; biotechnology; carbon footprint; controlled study; developed country; developing country; economic development; environmental economics; environmental sustainability; greenhouse effect; gross national product; growth rate; harm reduction; historical period; investment; sustainable development; China; greenhouse effect; socioeconomics; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Global Warming; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079685511

We thus proposed an improved method for quantifying both single- and multicontaminant air pollution. Our approach uses China's major cities as an example because they have an operational national urban air quality monitoring network. We found that our proposed method could remove the duplicated consideration under both single- and multicontaminant conditions, thus proving to be an improved and more accurate way to understand complex urban air pollution conditions. Our method involved monitoring 3 contaminants (PM2.5, PM10, and SO2) in cities in Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei Provinces and 2 contaminants (PM2.5 and PM10) in the cities between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, and these pollutants were the major contributors to multicontaminant air pollution. We argue that both the research community and the government should pay increased attention to multicontaminant air pollution beyond the current single major pollutant–based air pollution method when building a sustainable city.

However, the SEI on the anode and CEI on the cathode are vulnerable to the reactive species of PF5 and HF produced by the decomposition and hydrolysis of the conventional LiPF6 electrolyte in a battery inevitably containing a trace amount of water. Here, we report a new class of cyclic carbonate-based electrolyte additives to preserve the integrity of SEI and CEI in LIBs. This new class of additives is designed and synthesized by an ecofriendly approach that involves fixing CO2 with functional epoxides bearing various reactive side chains. It was found that the cyclic carbonates of 3-(1-ethoxyethoxy)-1,2-propylene carbonate and 3-trimethoxysilylpropyloxy-1,2-propylene carbonate, possessing high capability for the stabilization of Lewis-acidic PF5, exhibit a capacity retention of 79.0% after 1000 cycles, which is superior to that of the pristine electrolyte of 54.7%. Moreover, TMSPC has HF-scavenging capability, which, along with PF5 stabilization, results in enhanced rate capability of commercial LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NCM622)/graphite full cells, posing a significant potential for high-energy-density LIBs with long cycle stability. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","electrolyte additives; HF scavenging; LiPF6-based electrolytes; lithium-ion batteries; PF5 stabilization","Additives; Anodes; Carbonation; Cathodes; Cobalt compounds; Environmental protection; Lithium compounds; Manganese compounds; Nickel compounds; Nitrogen compounds; Seebeck effect; Solid electrolytes; Solid-State Batteries; Stabilization; Capacity retention; Electrolyte interfaces; Functional electrolytes; High capabilities; High energy densities; Interfacial degradation; Long term stability; Solid electrolyte interphase; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085531382

Nonetheless, possible negative impacts of metal recyclers (MRs) include the potential for emissions of metal aerosols and other dusts, noise, traffic and fire during operations. In Houston, Texas, there were more than 180 resident complaints about air quality related to MRs from 2006 to 2011 that were reported to the city’s 311 call system. As a part of a community-based participatory research study, Metal Air Pollution Partnership Solutions (MAPPS), we evaluated the impact of metal emissions from MRs on air quality over two years in four environmental justice communities. We simultaneously collected samples of inhalable particles (aerodynamic particle size less than 10 µm, PM10) using a sampling strategy to capture emissions from the MRs while they were in operation at four locations within each community: an upwind location, the fence line of MR and two downwind locations and analyzed the samples for 10 metals. The highest values of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr) were detected at the fence lines of MRs. The normalized ratios of these metals at near and far neighborhood locations were 0.01 to 0.64 and 0.01 to 0.34, respectively, as compared with the metals at the fence line. The concentrations of metals rapidly decreased by 57–70% within 100 meters and reached similar levels at upwind (background) locations at approximately 600 meters. After adjusting the measured data for wind direction, rain and operating hours, we calculated non-carcinogenic hazard index values and carcinogenic risks for adult residents from breathing metals emitted from the facilities. Estimated inhalation cancer risks ranged from 0.12 case to 24 cases in 1 million people and the hazard index values ranged from 0.04 to 11. Implications: In Houston, Texas, residents complained about air quality related to metal recyclers from 2006 to 2011. Using a community-based participatory research method, metal emissions were characterized at four environmental justice communities. The results indicate that metal concentrations were the highest at the fence line and decreased by 57–70% within 100 meters and reached similar levels of background at 600 meters. After adjusting the measured data for meteorological parameters and operating hours, estimated inhalation cancer risks ranged from 0.12 cases to 24 cases in 1 million people and hazard index values ranged from 0.04 to 11. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

In 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established to coor-dinate the research. The first scientific publications on the effects of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Finland appeared in the early 1980´s. After the launch of the Finnish Research Program on Climate Change (SILMU) in 1990, the number of climate-related projects and publications, and the input of Finnish researchers in the work of the IPCC started to increase. During the subsequent programs, the initial optimism about future crop production conditions changed into an awareness of the threats represented by climate change. Diversity of production and breeding of heat and flooding tolerant, disease resistant and nutrient-use efficient crop varieties were identified as being crucial for adaptation of agriculture. Efficient water management, measures to limit nutrient leaching and timely control of pests and pathogens are also crucial adaptation measures. Carbon storage in soils and biomass and reduced use of organic fields are suggested to be mitigation measures. By 2019, the awareness of the threats of climate change prompted citizens worldwide to demand action, and government programs have begun to include policies addressing reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020, The Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland.

Otherwise, risk of opportunistic policy-making will impair investments into low-carbon technologies. However, the future benefits and costs of decarbonization are subject to substantial uncertainties. Thus, there may also be societal gains from allowing policy-makers the discretion to adjust the policies as new information becomes available. We examine how this trade-off between policy commitment—either unconditional or state-contingent—and discretion affects the optimal intertemporal design of market-based instruments in the power sector. Using a dynamic partial equilibrium model, we show that commitment to a state-contingent level of ambition for the market-based instrument leads to higher welfare than both unconditional commitment and discretion. With benefit uncertainty, the choice between the practically more feasible approaches of unconditional commitment and discretion is analytically ambiguous. A basic numerical illustration suggests that policy discretion may outperform unconditional commitment in terms of welfare. However, this result is reversed when only a limited fraction of benefit uncertainty resolves in reasonable time, when future policy-makers have own agendas, or when investors are risk-averse. With cost uncertainty, policy discretion is welfare-superior if the government can commit to a technology deployment target. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change; Commitment; Hold-up; Public policy; Renewable energy; Subsidies; Uncertainty","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Cost uncertainty; Future benefits; Low-carbon technologies; Market-based instruments; Partial equilibrium model; Policy discretions; Policy makers; Technology deployment; Investments; design; energy policy; environmental policy; governance approach; investment; policy making; trade-off; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084655926

Inspired by the ionic cluster network in polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) for fast ion transport, designing a unique CO2-philic cluster network structure is a promising strategy to construct efficient CO2 transport channels in membranes. Herein, a forced induction method is presented to construct a CO2-philic cluster network in membranes. Sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (sβ-CD) is introduced in a quaternary ammonium polysulfone (QAPSf) matrix. During the membrane formation process, the quaternary ammonium groups on QAPSf are attracted by the sulfonic acid groups on sβ-CD, assembling around and thus forming hybrid clusters. These clusters are swollen and interconnected by water under a humidified state. The hybrid cluster network acts as an effective CO2 transport pathway via clustering quaternary ammonium ion pairs as continuous CO2-facilitated transport sites. Simultaneously, the internal cavity of sβ-CD in hybrid clusters affords additional free volume in membranes, thus enhancing the CO2 permeability. The resultant QAPSf/sβ-CD membrane exhibits an optimal CO2 permeability of 1303 Barrer, a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 39, and good long-term operation stability for 30 days, surpassing the 2008 Robeson upper bound limit.

In this study, various design parameters that meet the principle of climate adaptation are proposed to achieve the unity of energy utilization and indoor thermal comfort level. According to the local energy conservation codes, five typical benchmark geometric models were established in Open Studio (Sketch-Up plug-in) for sites representative of various climates, meanwhile, adopting the engine of Energy Plus (EP-Launch) to calculate the instrument definition file (IDF), respectively, for assessing the coupling relationship between energy consumption as well as thermal comfort. Results implied that based on the time proportion (8760 h) that met the level 1 comfort range, total energy reductions of different Chinese climate regions were different. Among them, the severe cold zone (SCZ-Changchun) and hot summer and cold winter zone (HSCW-Shanghai) appeared to have the greatest energy saving potential with 18-24% and 16-19%, respectively, while the cold zone (CZ-Beijing) and mild zone (MZ-Kunming) approximately equaled 15% and 12-15%, and the saving space of the hot summer and warm winter zone (HSWW-Haikou) appeared relatively low, only around 5-7%. Although the simulation results may be limited by the number of parameter settings, the main ones are under consideration seriously, which is further indication that there is still much room for appropriate improvements in the local public building energy efficiency codes. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the expensive computational requirements of dynamical downscaling inevitably add a limit to the spatial resolution of the resulting regional climate simulations. In order to find a balance between computational requirements and simulation improvements, it is extremely important to investigate how the spatial resolution of regional climate simulation affects the added values of dynamical downscaling; yet, it is still not well understood. Therefore, in this study, we conduct long-term climate simulations for the entire country of China with the PRECIS regional climate model at two different spatial resolutions (i.e., 25 and 50 km). The purpose is to evaluate whether a fine-resolution model simulation, given its considerable requirements for computational resources, would add more valuable information for understanding regional climatology than a coarse-resolution model simulation. Our results show that the PRECIS can reasonably reproduce the spatial distribution of seasonal and monthly mean temperature and precipitation over the most of regions in China. However, in the process of downscaling, RCM with higher resolution cannot always produce more accurate output. In regard to precipitation simulations, compared with the host GCM, it is difficult to determine exactly a homogeneous improvement of performance in downscaling, both in terms of spatial patterns as well as magnitude of errors. For interannual variability, variations in temperature are closer to observation than precipitation and the high-resolution R25 has better skills over the northwest than R50. Moreover, except for the west, it is shown that PRECIS is able to better reproduce the probability distribution function of precipitation and some impact-relevant indices such as the number of consecutive wet days and simple precipitation intensity index in spatial distribution. © 2020","Added value; China; Dynamic downscaling; High resolution","Distribution functions; Image resolution; Spatial distribution; Added values; China; Coarse-resolution model; Computational requirements; Dynamic downscaling; High resolution; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate simulation; Climate models; climate modeling; computer simulation; downscaling; numerical model; regional climate; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; weather forecasting; article; China; climate; precipitation; probability; simulation; skill; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079655659

Local governments are responding in kind, by adopting their own goals and/or establishing policies to facilitate successful implementations of RE in their jurisdiction. One factor to successful RE development is to locate the most suitable lands, while continuing to sustain land-based economies and ecosystem services. Local governments often have limited resources; and this is especially true for small, land-constrained local governments. In this paper, we illustrate how a standardized RE technical mapping framework can be used by local governments to advance the implementation of RE in land-constrained areas, through a case study in the Town of Canmore, Alberta. Canmore has a limited municipal area surrounded by the Canadian Rockies, along with complex land-use bylaw and environmentally sensitive habitats. This mapping framework accounts for these conditions as it considers theoretical resources, technically recoverable lands, legally accessible lands, and the spatial capital cost of connecting new RE facilities. Different land-use planning scenarios are considered including changing setback buffers and expanding restrictions on development to all environmentally sensitive districts. The total RE potentials are then estimated based on the least-conflict lands. Technically speaking, even under restrictive land suitability scenarios, Canmore holds enough land to achieve ambitious RE targets, but opportunities and challenges to implementation remain. To eventually succeed in its long-term emission reduction goal, the most decisive step for Canmore is to balance the growth of energy demands, land-use changes, and practicable RE development. Mapping systems that can study the influence of land-use planning decisions on RE potential are critical to achieving this balance. © 2020 by the authors.","GIS; Land suitability; Scenario mapping; Solar energy; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085640708

Coal samples with different weathering degrees in the three coal-producing areas from Wuhai in Inner Mongolia, Jincheng and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province in China were selected for the experiment. The biogas production, physical properties and conversion potential of CH4 in regards to weathered coal were analyzed by biogas production simulations, mercury injection tests, isothermal absorption tests and estimation of the Gompertz model. The results showed that the biogas production potential of coal evidently increased with the increase in degree of weathering. The porosity of coal increased, whereas the specific surface area and affinity for methane were reduced, which provide a convenient environment for biogas collection and utilization. The estimation results from the Gompertz model showed that the potential of surface weathered coal conversion to biomethane was significant, and the greenhouse effect cannot be ignored. Therefore, a new model of the in situ conversion of weathered coal conversion to biomethane that facilitates clean utilization was proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomethane; Greenhouse effect; In situ conversion; Physical properties characteristics; Weathered coal","Biogas; Coal; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouses; Physical properties; Proven reserves; Weathering; Biogas collections; Biogas production; Biomethane; Estimation results; Feasibility analysis; Mercury injection; Weathered coal; Weathering degree; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079224497

Here, biochar was used to mitigate the global warming potential (GWP) from CWs and promote the removal of contaminants from simulated domestic wastewater under different influent chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen ratios (COD/N = 3, 6, 9, 12). Results demonstrated that biochar could improve the removal of COD, NH4+- N, and TN. The average N2O and CO2 fluxes were significantly lower and CH4 fluxes were higher in biochar-added CWs than those in none-biochar CWs. Biochar reduced GWP values of N2O and CH4 from 18.5% to 24.0%. N2O fluxes and GWP decreased, while CH4 and CO2 fluxes increased as COD/N ratios increased. Additionally, biochar increased the abundance of Geobacter and denitrifiers such as Hydrogenophaga.

However, existing studies have generally found low marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for mitigating such damages. To understand the determinants and the extent of WTP for air quality improvements, we collected comprehensive socio-demographic and stated preference information from more than 3000 random respondents in three cities in China. Combining the survey data with air quality data from ground-level monitoring stations, we find that exposure to persistent air pollution is a significant determinant of the extent individuals are willing to pay for cleaner air. On average, urban residents are willing to pay 65 CNY (~10 USD) each year to improve air quality to World Health Organization standards. Males and individuals that are younger and more educated tend to have higher WTP. We also find that individuals with more knowledge of sustainability and who engage in more pro-environmental behaviors are willing to pay more. Compared to existing government monetary incentives to reduce air pollution, the public's total WTP for cleaner air is much higher. Overall, these results highlight the potential welfare gain for policymakers to implement more stringent air quality regulations to reduce pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; China; Contingent valuation; Willingness to pay","air quality; atmospheric pollution; government; industrialization; policy making; pollution exposure; sustainability; urban pollution; urban population; urbanization; willingness to pay; World Health Organization; adult; air pollution; air quality; article; China; contingent valuation; demography; government; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; urban population; welfare; World Health Organization; China; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079185891

Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to investigate the associations between ambient PM2.5 and deaths from gastrointestinal, stomach, colorectal and liver cancers. Results: We found that each 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an increased hazard risk (HR) of 1.09 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.16) and 1.13 (95%CI: 1.02–1.24) in deaths from gastrointestinal and liver cancers, respectively. The association between PM2.5 and death from colorectal cancer was marginally statistically significant [HR: 1.13 (95%CI: 1.00–1.26)]. We did not find significant associations between PM2.5 and mortality from stomach cancer. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of deaths from gastrointestinal cancers, liver cancer and also potentially colorectal cancer. Air pollution control strategies are necessary to reduce the burden of gastrointestinal cancer. © 2020 The Authors","Gastrointestinal cancer mortality; Live cancer mortality; Long-term exposure; PM2.5 air pollution; Taiwan","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Diagnosis; Hazards; Regression analysis; Cancer mortality; Colorectal cancer; Confidence interval; Long term exposure; PM2.5 concentration; Proportional hazards; Spatio-temporal models; Taiwan; Diseases; atmospheric pollution; cancer; concentration (composition); mortality; particulate matter; adult; ambient fine particle; Article; cancer mortality; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; digestive system cancer; environmental exposure; female; high risk population; human; liver cancer; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; material state; mortality risk; particulate matter; priority journal; risk assessment; stomach cancer; Taiwan; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental exposure; epidemiology; gastrointestinal tumor; toxicity; Taiwan; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Humans; Particulate Matter; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081228276

Reuse on-site represents, in particular for remote sites, a significant contribution to sustainable business practice as it provides a higher value end use when used to develop on-site mulch to enable soil improvement, reducing transport emissions (from the least preferred option of off-site disposal to landfill), reducing costs, and employing local contractors. The objective of the study was to enable on-site reuse, which was primarily achieved through chemical and physicochemical characterization of EOLPM streams; cardboard, and wood. Given the common occurrence of these materials in the rapidly growing renewable energy sector, it represents an important scope of work for the sector internationally. The methods used for characterization of the EOLPM, the first of its type reported, included a range of organic and inorganic chemical analyses, phytotoxicity testing, followed by an environmental and high-level (or initial) financial benefit cost analysis. Key scientific findings were that only trace concentrations of chemicals of potential concern (COPC) were detected; the material was not phytotoxic and has potential for soil improvement at the site, and the selected option of on-site reuse (of the materials as a mulch) had a global warming potential of 50 times less than the business as usual option (transport to landfill). The results also demonstrated the broader potential for using EOLPMs from USSE sites for soil improvement at remote locations rather than transporting offsite for disposal or reuse. Structural changes will need to be made to the way in which markets operate to achieve circular economy outcomes for these EOLPMs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Circular economy; Cost-benefit analysis; Mulch; Packaging; Waste","Chemical analysis; Costs; Energy policy; Global warming; Inorganic chemicals; Land fill; Packaging materials; Soil pollution; Soils; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Disposal to landfills; Global warming potential; Physico-chemical characterization; Phytotoxicity testing; Renewable energy sector; Sustainable business; Trace concentrations; Transport emissions; Cost benefit analysis; inorganic compound; organic compound; alternative energy; packaging waste; photovoltaic system; physicochemical property; renewable resource; soil improvement; solar power; Article; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; electric power plant; greenhouse effect; landfill; physical chemistry; phytotoxicity assay; recycling; renewable energy; soil management; solar energy; solar photovoltaic; waste disposal; waste management; Chemical Analysis; Costs; Land Fill; Packaging Materials; Reuse; Sites; Soil; Upgrading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084705265

Although water-based coatings are relatively safe and economical, and contain low volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the realization of coatings with excellent anti-condensation, anti-frosting, anti-icing, and passive self-cleaning properties remains challenging, owing to the Wenzel state of small-sized condensate microdrops. Herein, a water-based transparent superamphiphobic coating is developed through a single-step spraying method performed at ambient temperature using water and liquid rheological additives to disperse fluorinated SiO2 nanochains. The coating exhibits resistance to damage induced by low- and high-temperature processing, chemical solution attacks, outdoor exposure, and freeze–thaw cycles. Most importantly, the porous structure consisting of nanopores and sub-micropores, results in the suppression of condensation, frosting, and icing as well as facile removal of condensate micro-drops, sparse frost, and ice. Furthermore, fouling can be eliminated via condensation or a cycle of frosting and defrosting utilizing the moisture in the air.

This paper uses the broad literature on the relationship between general foreign direct investment (FDI) and inequality in FDI host countries to develop expectations about the likely impact of past and future international mitigation investment on inequality, unemployment and poverty outcomes. Using 2000 and 2010 census data for small geographic areas in Brazil, we compare the change in those outcomes in areas that experienced CDM project activity to the same in areas that did not, using a difference-in-difference approach. We find that areas with CDM project activity experienced improvements in those outcomes, which appear to be driven by project types that are associated with ‘primary’ sector activity. Including measurement and reporting procedures for these broader sustainable development outcomes in the rulebook of a post-2020 agreement could be favourable to the interests of both developed and developing countries. Key policy insights We find evidence that CDM project activity drove reductions in inequality, poverty and unemployment in Brazilian regions from 2000 to 2010, relative to Brazilian regions where no CDM projects were present. This evidence fits with the idea that investment into primary and secondary sector activities (as opposed to tertiary sector ones) creates new demand for lower-skilled labour. Future supranational and national-level climate and emissions mitigation frameworks could take this into account at the design stage and specifically target inequality, unemployment, and poverty reduction through the new mechanism to be developed under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Brazil; clean development mechanism (CDM); difference-in-difference method; Foreign direct investment; income inequality","clean development mechanism; developing world; foreign direct investment; investment; poverty alleviation; skilled labor; sustainable development; unemployment; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085000573

Exposure to pollutants by area is converted, via dose response relationships, into disease averted. Health benefits and National Health Service costs from diseases are estimated conditional on population demographics and index of multiple deprivation. The net health benefits from alternative strategies are expressed as distributions of quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), which are compared using dominance criteria and societal aversion to health inequality. Net production is estimated from intervention costs and the effects of health improvement on production and consumption. Social care outcomes are estimated from health improvement among care recipients and changes in care expenditure. A switch to less polluting private vehicles is dominant in terms of the distribution of QALE and social care outcomes but not consumption.

In order to accurately predict the lifted flame, a finite-rate chemistry model is used, which requires no assumptions concerning the combustion regime. Furthermore, feedback effects between all gaseous species and soot are captured inherently, by simultaneously solving the thermo-chemical state equations in a fully coupled way. Soot evolution is described by a sectional model, coupled to the gas phase by another sectional model for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The entire approach has already been comprehensively validated in premixed and non-premixed flames. The first aim of the present work is to extend the validation for LES. It is found that the simulated lift-off height and flame structure agree well with the measurements. A good prediction of soot evolution is achieved, which enables detailed investigations of soot formation and oxidation. Consequently, the second aim of the paper is to analyze the soot evolution by means of correlated statistics. It will be shown that the statistics depend on axial distance over the entire flame and on radial distance close to the base of the flame. These trends in temperature - soot volume fraction space can be attributed to the changing dominance of growth and oxidation of soot. Soot evolution is strongly affected by an oxygen leakage into the core of the flame caused by the flame lift-off. A combustion regime analysis reveals that the leakage leads to soot growth under premixed conditions, which causes the dependency of the correlated statistics on radial distance. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","Correlated soot statistics; Large-Eddy Simulation; Sectional soot model; Soot; Sooting lifted turbulent jet flame","Dust; Equations of state; Large eddy simulation; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Soot; Combustion regime; Correlated statistics; Feedback effects; Finite-rate chemistry; Non-premixed flame; Soot model; Soot volume fraction; Turbulent jet flames; Combustion; aircraft; Article; chemical structure; combustion; evolution; flame; height; oxidation; priority journal; simulation; soot; space; statistics; temperature; volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081232465

To detect data errors, adequate quality check procedures must be designed. This paper presents procedures that take advantage of the ever-growing observation databases that provide climatological knowledge of the ocean variability in the neighborhood of an observation location. Local validity intervals are used to estimate binarily whether the observed values are considered as good or erroneous. Whereas a classical approach estimates validity bounds from first-and second-order moments of the climatological parameter distribution, that is, mean and variance, this work proposes to infer them directly from minimum and maximum observed values. Such an approach avoids any assumption of the parameter distribution such as unimodality, symmetry around the mean, peakedness, or homogeneous distribution tail height relative to distribution peak. To reach adequate statistical robustness, an extensive manual quality control of the reference dataset is critical. Once the data have been quality checked, the local minima and maxima reference fields are derived and the method is compared with the classical mean/variance-based approach. Performance is assessed in terms of statistics of good and bad detections. It is shown that the present size of the reference datasets allows the parameter estimates to reach a satisfactory robustness level to always make the method more efficient than the classical one.

Although agricultural land uses are sometimes combined into a single unit when quantifying landscape heterogeneity, diverse cropping systems are a valuable alternative to near-monocultural croplands and contribute more strongly to ecosystem service provision, including services such as pest regulation and carbon sequestration that are of direct interest for agriculture. The USDA Cropland Data Layer was used to characterize crop diversity across the contiguous US for 2008–2018. Percentage of each crop type, along with non-crop uses such as forest and development, were calculated for each 4 km PRISM climate data grid cell. To better understand the drivers of crop diversity, Random Forest modeling was used to assess the importance of climate, soils, and irrigation for patterns of crop effective richness for the contiguous United States, stratified by USDA Land Resource Region. The models explained 57–89% of the variation in maximum crop diversity, with irrigation being by far the most important explanatory variable in regions where it was employed. The drivers of change from 2008 to 2018 were less clear. Random Forest models explained only 20–60% of the change in agricultural diversity over the 11-year period; both soil and climate properties were important, with no clear dominant drivers. Potential crop effective richness was greater than actual across the entire region studied, but substantial increases would require irrigation. Major changes in agricultural systems and infrastructure may be necessary to increase agricultural diversity at large spatial extents, and declining availability of water for irrigation could threaten the agricultural systems that are now most diverse. © Copyright © 2020 Goslee.","agricultural diversity; Cropland Data Layer; ecosystem services; irrigation; Random Forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086157172

Based on the comments on residents, improved technology in building and in heating and cooling is likely to remain the most viable strategy towards sustainable thermal comfort. © 2019, © 2019 IBF, The Institute for Housing and Urban Research.","green village; Home; household practises; oral history; sustainable comfort","air conditioning; cooling; heating; innovation; material culture; modernity; residential energy; technology adoption; Australia; South Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064043342

This paper discusses the environmental impacts of the decarbonisation plan proposed by the Spanish Government, comparing the current situation with those foreseen for 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, climate change will vary the thermal demands of buildings. The paper thus investigates the heating and cooling demands of a type of single-family house located in eight Spanish cities with very different climates and altitude. The combined effects of the decarbonisation plan and climate change are analysed based on the environmental impacts caused by the electricity required to meet thermal demands. Both effects led to a reduction of the damage in the categories Human Health (59-68%), Climate Change (57-67%) and Resources (54-65%). However, the damage to Ecosystem Quality will increase (5-28%) as a result of the greater impact on this damage category from the energy production scenario for 2030, although thermal requirements in households will decrease. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Decarbonisation; Electric generation; Energy transition; Heating and cooling energy demand","climate change; cooling; electricity; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental quality; heating; residential energy; spatiotemporal analysis; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085620035

In this study, we assessed and mapped the supply and demand of three ES (water provision, climate regulation, and outdoor recreation) along an urban-rural gradient in the Madrid region (Spain) from 1990 to 2012. We mapped ES supply, based on land use/land cover (LULC) data, using InVEST models and complementary methods, and ES demand, using population density and demand indicators. Then, we explored spatial supply-demand mismatches at a municipality spatial scale. Despite an increase in ES supply in some areas, a general increase in ES demand led to increasing dependence by the Madrid metropolitan area on outlying areas. We found that the number of municipalities that exhibited mismatches between the supply and demand in ES increased throughout the study period, due mainly to urban sprawl. Our results suggest the need for comprehensive land-use planning at the regional scale, taking into account that many ES flows reach beyond municipality boundaries. Finally, we discuss the utility of analyzing spatial mismatches in the supply and demand of ES for land-use planning and decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","InVEST; Land use and land cover; Protected areas; Territorial planning; Urban sprawl; Urban-rural gradient","demand analysis; ecosystem service; land cover; land use planning; protected area; quantitative analysis; spatial analysis; territorial planning; urban sprawl; Madrid [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078809819

This poses tremendous influences on physical and the socio-economic vulnerability of the coastal communities, in the form of negative impacts on lives and livelihoods. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the vulnerability of households to the impacts of coastal erosion. As a result, this study focused on the assessment and mapping of the social vulnerability of households to coastal erosion in Gunjur village. An interdisciplinary and mixed-method approaches were used in the study. The MOVE system-thinking framework was used to develop and select social vulnerability indicators. Geographic Information Systems technique was employed in data integration and mapping of the vulnerability of households. The outcome of the study revealed that 90% of the households were highly vulnerable to coastal erosion, however, women were perceived to be relatively more vulnerable. The study found high levels of exposure and susceptibility of the households to coastal erosion, given the limited adaptation capacity. It was found that 74% of the households do not have sustainable adaptation strategies to the impacts of coastal erosion. Integrating coastal protection measures into climate change adaptation and mitigation policy framework was a key recommendation towards reducing the impacts of human factors on coastal erosion. Alternative sources of livelihoods and mind building are required to build the resilience of households and enhance human security in the coastal communities of The Gambia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal erosion; MOVE framework; Resilience; Sea-level rise; Social vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077219976

This includes an extensive review of distinguished low-pressure catalytic CO2-hydrogenation systems. Specifically, the results of the conducted systematic experimental investigation on the impacts of synthesis and micro-scale characteristics of the selected Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 model-catalysts on their activity and stability are discussed. The performance of the investigated Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, synthesized via different methods, were tested under a targeted range of operating conditions in this research. Specifically, the performances of these tested Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts with regard to the impacts of the main operating parameters, namely H2/CO2 ratio (at stoichiometric-3-, average-6-and high-9-ratios), temperature (in the range of 160–260 ˚C) and the lower and upper values of physically achievable gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) (corresponding to 200 h−1 and 684 h−1, respectively), were analyzed. It was found that the catalyst prepared by the hydrolysis co-precipitation method, with a homogenously distributed copper content over its entire surface, provides a promising methanol yield of 21% at a reaction temperature of 200 ˚C, lowest tested GHSV, highest tested H2/CO2 ratio (9) and operating pressure (10 bar). This is in line with other promising results so far reported for this catalytic system even in pilot-plant scale, highlighting its potential for large-scale methanol production. To analyze the findings in more details, the thermal-reaction performance of the system, specifically with regard to the impact of GHSV on the CO2-conversion and methanol selectivity, and yield were experimentally investigated. Moreover, the stability of the selected catalysts, as another crucial factor for potential industrial operation of this system, was tested under continual long-term operation for 150 h, the reaction-reductive shifting-atmospheres and also even after introducing oxygen to the catalyst surface followed by hydrogen reduction-reaction tests. Only the latter state was found to affect the stable performance of the screened catalysts in this research. In addition, the reported experimental reactor performances have been analyzed in the light of equilibrium-based calculated achievable performance of this reaction system. In the performed multi-scale analysis in this research, the requirements for establishing a selective-stable catalytic performance based on the catalyst-and reactor-scale analyses have been identified. This will be combined with the techno– economic performance analysis of the industrial-scale novel integrated process, utilizing the selected catalyst in this research, in the form of an add-on catalytic system under 10 bar pressure and H2/CO2 ratio (3), for efficiently reducing the overall CO2-emission from oxidative coupling of methane reactors, as reported in the second part (part II) of this paper. © 2020 by the authors.

Within the agricultural sector of many developing nations, farmers must make long-term decisions to adapt to climate change impacts in order to provide food security and sustainable livelihoods. However, deeper understanding of farmers’ decision-making, as a key stakeholder group, is of vital importance in forming adaptive land use policy ‘from the bottom-up’. This study investigates the psychosocial factors that influence farmers’ adaptation intention in the critical case of Marvdasht County in Iran – a case that exemplifies agricultural stakeholder decision-making in arid and drought-prone regions. We present a conceptual combination-model grounded in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), employing a correlational survey among 256 farmer-stakeholders. First, we discuss the relative value of the combined model to understanding adaptation intentions. Second, we find that the factors that represent the externalities of farmers' behaviour need to be more thoroughly integrated in to adaptation planning. Third, we find that farmers’ adaptation intention is directly affected by maladaptation, and indirectly by economic disincentives, barriers to belief in anthropogenic climate change and broader risk perceptions. © 2020","Adaptation; Climate change; Combined model; Marvdasht township; PMT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080144300

There is little information on aerosol BrC over the South China Sea (SCS). In this study, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in a round-year set of aerosol samples from a remote island in the northern SCS were characterized for optical properties. In-depth information about the sources and input pathways of water-soluble BrC was obtained using molecular markers and statistic tools. The highest WSOC concentrations, light absorption coefficients at 365 nm (Abs365) and mass absorption efficiencies at 365 nm (MAE365) were observed in winter when atmospheric outflow from mainland China and the northern Indo-China Peninsula prevailed. Through the year, primary emissions from biomass burning and urban secondary organic aerosols (SOA) &amp; waste combustion, respectively, were observed to be associated with higher MAE365 (2.47 ± 0.40 m2 g−1 and 1.97 ± 0.22 m2 g−1) and to be the main contributors to Abs365 (22.0 ± 3.6% and 31.6 ± 3.6%), while biogenic SOA showed little contribution. For the first time, microorganism/plankton primary emissions, mainly from the sea, was identified to be an important contributor to water-soluble BrC (13.6 ± 4.2% of Abs365, MAE365: 0.98 ± 0.30 m2 g−1), especially in spring (31% of Abs365). This implies that emissions from microorganism/plankton warrants careful consideration in the assessment of global aerosol light absorbance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric outflow; Light absorption properties; Molecular markers; Source apportionment; Water-soluble brown carbon","Aerosols; Atmospheric radiation; Climate change; Light absorption; Microorganisms; Optical properties; Organic carbon; Waste incineration; Aerosol radiative forcing; Depth information; Light absorption coefficients; Northern South China Sea; Primary emissions; Secondary organic aerosols; Source apportionment; Water-soluble organic carbon; Bromine compounds; alkane; arabinitol; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; benz[a]anthracene; brown carbon; carbon; chrysene; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; erythritol; fatty acid; fluoranthene; hopanoid; levoglucosan; mannitol; molecular marker; oleic acid; organic carbon; prednisolone; pyrene; syringic acid; terephthalic acid; unclassified drug; vanillic acid; vanillin; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; brown carbon; organic carbon; pollution monitoring; radiative forcing; solubility; source apportionment; aerosol; Article; combustion; light absorption; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; South China Sea; spring; waste; winter; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083108799

More attention has been paid to optimization of biofuel supply chain in recent years. In this paper, a scientific, rational and practical biodiesel processing plant location with waste oil as the raw material was proposed in order to provide a theoretical basis for guiding the planning and management of restaurants, waste oil collection points, and processing plants. Considering the merits and demerits of the subjective and objective weighting methods, this paper proposes a new weighting method which is namely the combination of rough set theory and clustering algorithm. It then verifies the location results with a plant carbon emission. At last, this paper analyzes the location of biodiesel processing plant in the Yangtze River Delta of China and finds that the precision has been greatly improved with the new method comparing the RMSE and the R2 of the Delphi method with the improved rough set theory. By using this method, the weights of the influencing factors of biodiesel processing plants are the following: Waste oil supply 0.143, Fixed construction cost factor 0.343, Biodiesel demand 0.143 and Location convenience 0.371. In the comparison between the robust optimization method and the improved rough set theory, it was found that the final location results are the same, all being Jiaxing City. However, the improved rough set theory is much simpler than the robust optimization algorithm in the calculation process. © 2020 University of Rijeka.

Previous studies that analyzed modifications of cirrus clouds by seeding of ice nucleating particles showed large uncertainties in both cloud and surface climate responses, ranging from no effect or even a small warming to a globally averaged cooling of about 2.5 C. We use two general circulation models that showed very different responses in previous studies, ECHAM6-HAM and CESM-CAM5, to determine which radiative and climatic responses to cirrus cloud seeding in a 1.5 CO2 world are common and which are not. Seeding reduces the net cirrus radiative effect for -1.8 W m-2 in CESM compared with only -0.8 W m-2 in ECHAM. Accordingly, the surface temperature decrease is larger in CESM, counteracting about 70% of the global mean temperature increase due to CO2 and only 30% in ECHAM. While seeding impacts on mean precipitation were addressed in past studies, we are the first to analyze extreme precipitation responses to cirrus seeding. Seeding decreases the frequency of the most extreme precipitation globally. However, the extreme precipitation events occur more frequently in the Sahel and Central America, following the mean precipitation increase due to a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, we use a quadratic climate damage metric to evaluate the amount of CO2-induced damage cirrus seeding can counteract. Seeding decreases the damage by about 50% in ECHAM, and by 85% in CESM over the 21 selected land regions. Climate damage due to CO2 increase is significantly reduced as a result of seeding in all of the considered land regions. © 2020 The Author(s).

The cap's survival depends on its radiation budget, controlled by the visible albedo and infrared emissivity. We investigated the role of CO2 snowfall in altering the albedo and emissivity, leading to the observed asymmetry in the net CO2 accumulation at the two poles. Uncontaminated snowfall increases albedo, and lowers emissivity, due to scattering by optically thick clouds and granular surface deposits. Data from the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) show that fall and winter snowfall is correlated with higher springtime albedo at both poles. For the seasonal CO2 deposits in each polar region &gt;60° latitude, we find mean albedo values of 0.39 in the north and 0.51 in the south, and winter 32-μm emissivity values of 0.84 in the north and 0.87 in the south. Using a radiative transfer model and the MCS data, we find that the north polar deposits have ∼10× higher dust content than those in the south, explaining the ∼31% lower albedo of the north seasonal cap during spring. Our model shows that greater amounts of snowfall can explain the ∼4% lower emissivity of the north polar seasonal cap. These findings demonstrate that winter snowfall and dust transport affect the composition of Mars' seasonal ice caps and polar energy balance. Snowfall and dust loading are therefore important in modeling the CO2 cycle on Mars, as well as the planet's long-term climate variations. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

It can also forewarn about emerging issues especially in regions under long-term intensive cropping. To meet this objective, 500 surface soil (0–15 cm) samples were collected from the five agroecological regions of Punjab state (India). The regions were Sub-mountainous Siwalik Hills (SSH), Northeastern Undulating (NEU), Piedmont and Alluvial Plain (PAP), Central Alluvial Plain (CAP), and Southwestern Alluvial Plain (SWAP) running from northeast Punjab to southwest Punjab in that order. Highest soil organic carbon (SOC) content (mean, 0.77%) was observed in the SSH region, despite it being dominated by coarse-textured soils (mean sand content 74.2%). The Piedmont and Alluvial Plain region showed the highest mean available potassium (K) content (mean 173.2 kg ha−1 with 76–865 kg ha−1 range) which can be attributed to K-rich mineralogy and higher K fertilizer use in the region. In contrast, relatively lower K levels in the Central Alluvial Plain region warned about K mining under predominant rice-wheat system. Higher electrical conductivity (EC, mean 0.95 dS m−1) values in the SWAP region and in some areas in the CAP region hinted at the risk of land degradation due to salinity. The study revealed impending micronutrient deficiencies in certain areas.

However, its practical industrial applications are hindered by the low catalytic efficiency and poor thermostability of naturally occurring enzymes. In this work, we report the molecular modification of (R)-selective ω-TA from Aspergillus terreus (AtTA) to allow asymmetric reductive amination of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, producing (R)-3-amino-1-butanol. Based on substrate docking analysis, 4 residues in the substrate tunnel and binding pocket of AtTA were selected as mutation hotspots. The screening procedure was facilitated by the construction of a “small-intelligent” library and the use of thin-layer chromatography for preliminary screening. The resulting mutant AtTA-M5 exhibited a 9.6-fold higher kcat/Km value and 9.4 °C higher T1/210min than that of wild-type AtTA. Furthermore, the conversion of 20 and 50 g L−1 4-hydroxy-2-butanone by AtTA-M5 reached 90.8% and 79.1%, suggesting significant potential for production of (R)-3-amino-1-butanol. Under the same conditions, wild-type AtTA achieved less than 5% conversion. Moreover, the key mutation (S215P in AtTA) was validated in 7 other (R)-selective ω-TAs, indicating its general applicability in improving the catalytic efficiency of homologous (R)-selective ω-TAs. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","(R)-3-Amino-1-butanol; (R)-Selective ω-transaminase; Asymmetric synthesis; Chiral amine; Protein engineering","Amines; Aspergillus; Biochemical engineering; Biosynthesis; Carbonyl compounds; Efficiency; Enzymes; Thin layer chromatography; Asymmetric reductive amination; Asymmetric synthesis; Catalytic efficiencies; Chiral amines; Molecular modification; Protein engineering; Screening procedures; Therapeutic compounds; Amination; 2 butanone; 3 amino 1 butanol; aminotransferase; butanol; unclassified drug; aminoalcohol; aminotransferase; fungal protein; protein binding; carbonyl compound; catalysis; catalyst; chemical binding; enzyme; enzyme activity; fungus; molecular analysis; mutation; Article; Aspergillus terreus; asymmetric synthesis; catalytic efficiency; controlled study; enzyme binding; gene mutation; molecular docking; molecular library; nonhuman; thin layer chromatography; amination; Aspergillus; catalysis; enzyme active site; enzyme specificity; genetics; kinetics; metabolism; mutation; Aspergillus terreus; Atta; Amination; Amino Alcohols; Aspergillus; Catalysis; Catalytic Domain; Fungal Proteins; Kinetics; Molecular Docking Simulation; Mutation; Protein Binding; Substrate Specificity; Transaminases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082799421

This paper presents a multi-risk approach integrating multiple climate-related hazards and exposure and vulnerability factors across different spatial units and temporal scales. The multi-hazard assessment employs an influence matrix to analyze the relationships among hazards (sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and storm surge) and their disjoint probability. The multi-vulnerability considers the susceptibility of the exposed receptors (wetlands, beaches, and urban areas) to different hazards based on multiple indicators (dunes, shoreline evolution, and urbanization rate). The methodology was applied in the North Adriatic coast, producing a ranking of multi-hazard risks by means of GIS maps and statistics. The results highlight that the higher multi-hazard score (meaning presence of all investigated hazards) is near the coastline while multi-vulnerability is relatively high in the whole case study, especially for beaches, wetlands, protected areas, and river mouths. The overall multi-risk score presents a trend similar to multi-hazard and shows that beaches is the receptor most affected by multiple risks (60% of surface in the higher multi-risk classes).

Existing atmospheric models typically assume instant dilution of emissions into large-scale grid cells, neglecting non-linear, small-scale processes occurring in aircraft wakes. They also do not explicitly simulate the formation of ice crystals, which could drive local chemical processing. This assumption may lead to errors in estimates of aircraft-attributable ozone production, and in turn to biased estimates of aviation's current impacts on the atmosphere and the effect of future changes in emissions. This includes black carbon emissions, on which contrail ice forms. These emissions are expected to reduce as biofuel usage increases, but their chemical effects are not well captured by existing models. To address this problem, we develop a Lagrangian model that explicitly models the chemical and microphysical evolution of an aircraft plume. It includes a unified tropospheric-stratospheric chemical mechanism that incorporates heterogeneous chemistry on background and aircraft-induced aerosols. Microphysical processes are also simulated, including the formation, persistence, and chemical influence of contrails. The plume model is used to quantify how the longterm (24 h) atmospheric chemical response to an aircraft plume varies in response to different environmental conditions, engine characteristics, and fuel properties. We find that an instant-dilution model consistently overestimates ozone production compared to the plume model, up to a maximum error of ~ 200 % at cruise altitudes. Instant dilution of emissions also underestimates the fraction of remaining NOx, although the magnitude and sign of the error vary with season, altitude, and latitude. We also quantify how changes in black carbon emissions affect plume behavior. Our results suggest that a 50 % reduction in black carbon emissions, as may be possible through blending with certain biofuels, may lead to thinner, shorter-lived contrails. For the cases that we modeled, these contrails sublimate ∼ 5 % to 15 % sooner and are 10 % to 22 % optically thinner. The conversion of emitted NOx to HNO3 and N2O5 falls by 16 % and 33 %, respectively, resulting in chemical feedbacks that are not resolved by instant-dilution approaches. The persistent discrepancies between results from the instant-dilution approach and from the aircraft plume model demonstrate that a parameterization of effective emission indices should be incorporated into 3-D atmospheric chemistry transport models. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air quality; aircraft emission; atmospheric plume; black carbon; carbon emission; nitrogen oxides; ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085129833

Climate change is expected to result in higher temperatures, thus increasing the incidence of heat stress, but lowering the risk of frosts in mid-altitude areas. Increasing ambient carbon dioxide levels can enhance photosynthetic rates and reduce water use of potato. This study assessed the impact of climate change on potential yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in twelve potato production regions of South Africa using the LINTUL-POTATO crop model. With current planting times, simulated yields between 1 961 and 2 050 increased by 0.02 and 0.40 t ha−1 y−1 and WUE by 0.00 and 0.08 g l−1 y−1 evapotranspired. Improvements in yields and WUE were close to zero when the crop was grown in hot periods, as an increasing incidence of heat stress and higher evapotranspiration largely discounted benefits of higher CO2 levels. This was particularly the case in the interior production regions, where expected temperature increases were most severe. In many regions, potato growers are likely to respond to climate change by advancing planting time. Often a trade-off existed between maximising yield and WUE. A compromise could be achieved by planting as early as possible in the optimum spring planting window for summer crops. © 2020 Southern African Plant & Soil Sciences Committee.","climate change adaptation; CO2 fertilization; crop modelling; heat stress; yield variability","carbon dioxide; climate change; crop production; crop yield; evapotranspiration; potato; trade-off; water use efficiency; South Africa; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086788387

Methods: After having reformulated the problem of assessing the short-term impact of air pollution on health within the potential outcome approach to causal inference, we developed a method based on the generalized propensity score (GPS) to estimate the average dose-response function (aDRF) and quantify attributable deaths under different counterfactual scenarios of air pollution reduction. We applied the proposed approach to assess the impact of airborne particles with a diameter less than or equal to 10 μm (PM10) on deaths from natural, cardiovascular and respiratory causes in the city of Milan, Italy (2003-2006). Results: As opposed to what is commonly assumed, the estimated aDRFs were not linear, being steeper for low-moderate values of exposure. In the case of natural mortality, the curve became flatter for higher levels; this behavior was less pronounced for cause-specific mortality. The effect was larger in days characterized by higher temperature. According to the curves, we estimated that a hypothetical intervention able to set the daily exposure levels exceeding 40 μg/m3 to exactly 40 would have avoided 1157 deaths (90%CI: 689, 1645) in the whole study period, 312 of which for respiratory causes and 771 for cardiovascular causes. These impacts were higher than those obtained previously from regression-based methods. Conclusion: This novel method based on the GPS allowed estimating the average dose-response function and calculating attributable deaths, without requiring strong assumptions about the shape of the relationship. Its potential as a tool for investigating effect modification by temperature and its use in other environmental epidemiology contexts deserve further investigation. © 2020 The Author(s).","Attributable deaths; Exposure-response function; Generalized propensity score; Health impact assessment; Potential outcomes; Short-term effects of air pollution","atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; dose-response relationship; epidemiology; GPS; high temperature; mortality; particulate matter; pollution control; air pollution; airborne particle; article; controlled study; dose response; health impact assessment; human; Italy; major clinical study; mortality; propensity score; quantitative analysis; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental exposure; environmental health; epidemiology; particulate matter; procedures; Italy; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Italy; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Propensity Score",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084383491

One enabling technology to achieve this goal, could be the transition from conventional gas turbines to hybrid-electric drive trains. However, the requirements concerning weight and efficiency that come from applications like short range aircraft are significantly higher than what state-of-the-art technology can offer. A key technology that potentially allows to achieve the necessary power and volume densities for rotating electric machines is superconductivity. In this paper we present the concept of a high power density generator that matches the speed of typical airborne turbines in its power class. The design is based on studies that cover topology selection and further electromagnetic, HTS, thermal, structural and cryogenics aspects. All domains were analyzed by means of analytical sizing and 2D/3D FEA modeling.

In addition to direct effects of climate on species, there can also be indirect effects through an intermediary species, such as in host–plant interactions. Indirect effects are expected to be more pronounced in alpine environments because these ecosystems are sensitive to temperature changes and there are limited areas for migration of both species (i.e. closed systems), and because of simpler trophic interactions. We tested the hypothesis that climate change will reduce the range of an alpine butterfly (Parnassius smintheus) because of indirect effects through its host plant (Sedum sp.). To test for direct and indirect effects, we used the simulations of climate change to assess the distribution of P. smintheus with and without Sedum sp. We also compared the projected ranges of P. smintheus to four other butterfly species that are found in the alpine, but that are generalists feeding on many plant genera. We found that P. smintheus gained distributional area in climate-only models, but these gains were significantly reduced with the inclusion of Sedum sp. and in dry-climate scenarios which resulted in a reduction in net area. When compared to the more generalist butterfly species, P. smintheus exhibited the largest loss in suitable habitat. Our findings support the importance of including indirect effects in modelling species distributions in response to climate change. We highlight the potentially large and still neglected impacts climate change can have on the trophic structure of communities, which can lead to significant losses of biodiversity. In the future, communities will continue to favour species that are generalists as climate change induces asynchronies in the migration of species. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alpine; biotic interactions; butterfly; global change; host-plant; maxent; species distribution modelling","alpine environment; biodiversity; butterfly; climate change; climate effect; community response; generalist; plant-insect interaction; temperature effect; trophic interaction; trophic structure; vulnerability; Parnassius smintheus; Sedum; animal; biodiversity; butterfly; climate change; ecosystem; plant; Animals; Biodiversity; Butterflies; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082040203

Here, for the first time, we simultaneously linked glacial-interglacial climate change, contemporary climate, plant species richness and altitudinal range with endemic bird distribution in China. Methods: Ordinary least squares models and simultaneous autoregressive models were used to assess the associations between endemic bird richness, endemic bird ratio and each explanatory variable. Structural Equation Models were also performed to test the direct and indirect effects of these variables on endemic bird richness and endemic bird ratio. Results: Higher endemic bird richness and endemic bird ratio occurred in regions with stable glacial-interglacial temperature, i.e., southwest China. Plant species richness and altitudinal range were also positively correlated with endemic bird richness and endemic bird ratio. Glacial-interglacial temperature change, contemporary precipitation, plant species richness and altitudinal range were all included in the best combination of variables for endemic bird richness. Importantly, glacial-interglacial temperature change had strong direct effects on both endemic bird richness and endemic bird ratio, while plant species richness only had a direct effect on endemic bird richness. Conclusions: Our results indicate that endemic birds in China concentrate in southwest regions where there are stable glacial-interglacial temperature, more plant species and larger altitudinal range.

Importantly, the recent anthropogenic activities have also significantly intensified in this region, which would pose huge challenge for biodiversity conservation in China. © 2020 The Author(s).","Anthropogenic activities; Biodiversity conservation; Endemic bird ratio; Endemic bird richness; Glacial-interglacial climate change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085579650

In this context, clarifying the features, temporal variations, and potential factors of global carbon emissions are of great significance for controlling its carbon emissions. This paper adopted the logarithmic mean Divisia index to investigate the potential factors of CO2 emissions from the global, region, and country perspectives, with the purpose of providing more accurate information for the emissions mitigation efforts of various countries. The results show that during 1990–2014 period, the Asia-Pacific countries were the largest CO2 emitters worldwide, while the Europe and Eurasian countries were contributors to global carbon abatement. Economic output growth contributed the most in promoting global CO2 emissions growth, especially in Asia-Pacific, Europe and Eurasia, and North America. Population scale expansion was another determinant leading to emissions growth, and particularly for the countries in Middle East and Africa. Fortunately, the significant decline of energy intensity contributed most to global emission-reduction. However, except for European and Eurasian countries, the inhibiting effects resulted from energy intensity decline cannot completely counteract the promoting effects in most cases. From the perspective of country level, the performances of different factors were distinctly various in different countries, thus emission-mitigation policies should be established and implemented tailored to their characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emission abatement; Global CO2 emissions; LMDI; Sustainable development","Emission control; Global warming; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Asia-pacific countries; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Emission abatement; Emission mitigation; Emissions mitigation; Global carbon emission; LMDI; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078668506

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are important actors whose use of energy, and potential for energy and carbon savings, are largely overlooked by current efficiency policy in the UK and EU. Using theory, empirical evidence and policy analysis, this paper sets out the case for increased policy focus on SMEs, and proposes ways forward. SMEs account for more than half of industrial and commercial energy use, however, the details of their energy use and the potential for savings is poorly understood. While energy end-uses are similar to those in larger enterprises, SMEs’ capacity for paying attention to energy and responding to policy are different, as are their decision-making processes. Designing and delivering effective policy for this heterogenous group will require strategic segmentation and targeted interventions, in turn demanding improved data.

Drawing on mixed methods (policy analysis, semi-structured interviews, participatory site visits and focus groups) in two different forestry contexts, weshow that by strengthening access to capital availability, projects can enhance local adaptive capacity and mitigation and deliver local development. We show that active consideration of ecological conservation and action plans early in project design and implementation can co-develop and support monitoring and reporting systems, needed to progress towards integrated climate-compatible development approaches. Climate mitigation benefits remain poorly quantified due to limited interest in, and low capacity to generate, carbon revenues. Monitoring alone does not ensure carbon benefits will materialize, and this research stresses that institutional considerations and strengthened engagement and cooperation between practitioners and communities are key in achieving both climate mitigation and community development impacts. Multiple benefits can be fostered by aligning objectives of multiple landscape actors (i.e., community needs and project developers) and by systematically linking project deliverables, outputs, outcomes and impacts over time, grounded in a theory of change focused on ensuring community buy-in and planning for delivery of tangible benefits. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate and development; Forest conservation; Mangroves; Project monitoring and evaluation; REDD; Sustainable land management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094107221

This research aimed to determine the amount of carbon storage in cocoa plantations in East Luwu Regency. The research was carried out in cacao plantation in three districts namely Burau, Wotu and Mangkutana. Measurement of carbon storage was conducted using the allometric formula on an observation plot of 200 m2. Six sampling points were selected consisted of four location with shading trees planted in multistrata agroforestry planting system and two locations with a monoculture planting system. The results of measurements on cocoa plants show that carbon storage increased with the variety of plant species that exist in the cocoa farm. The size of the carbon stocks depends on the planting system. Cacao plantation with multistrata shades system showed carbon absorption of 148.92 tons/Ha that was greater than the amount of carbon absorption in cocoa plantation with monoculture shades system of 50.24 tons/Ha. The level of carbon uptake in East Luwu Regency is 33.19 tons C/Ha. The amount of carbon emissions absorbed is 57.46 t/Ha.

Heat localization systems have opened a new route to enhance the solar steam efficiency with localizing the absorbed solar energy and minimizing the heat losses. Many carbon-based, organic and plasmonic absorbers have been developed to achieve high-efficiency vapor evaporation in the past years. To provide a low cost and operability strategy, the carbonized rice husk, a biogenic carbon, is first used to construct a three-dimensional (3D) foam absorber in this paper. By employing surfactant foaming method, many micron pore channels are formed to ensure convenient water transfer. Meanwhile, due to the multiple internal reflections of light-rays in these cross pores, the light absorption can be enhanced up to ∼92%. Under a solar intensity of 1 kW m−2, the foam absorber achieves a solar steam conversion efficiency at ∼71%.

However, a focus on the distribution and drivers of PM2.5 concentrations in BRI is lacking. To fill in the gap, this study explores the spatio-temporal distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in 74 nations partnering the BRI and identifies the socioeconomic and natural drivers behind the variation through the joint use of spatial autocorrelation and regression analyses. We find that the PM2.5 concentrations of BRI show significant spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity on the national scale. The most heavily polluted regions are observed mainly in China, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia and North Africa, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Energy intensity and per capita electricity consumption act as the major drivers of the PM2.5 concentrations, whereas the expanding forest area contributes to the decrease in PM2.5 concentrations notably. Our findings highlight the need for speeding up new-type urbanization as part of the green BRI practice, calling for international cooperation and coordinated action aimed at enhancing synergies of air-quality and climate policies that at present are mostly launched and implemented in isolation. From a broader point of view, in struggling towards BRI's cleaner air, more attention should be paid to creating policy synergies between the green BRI, the Paris Agreement, and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Belt and Road Initiative; PM2.5 concentrations; Spatial econometrics; Urbanization","Air pollution; Air quality; Autocorrelation; Economics; Environmental protection; International cooperation; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Statistics; Sustainable development; Electricity-consumption; Environmental sustainability; PM2.5 concentration; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial econometrics; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatiotemporal distributions; Urbanization; Air cleaners; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental economics; particle size; particulate matter; spatial distribution; sustainability; trade performance; trade-environment relations; urban area; urban atmosphere; urbanization; air pollution; air quality; article; attention; autocorrelation; China; climate; electricity; forest; France; human; North Africa; Persian Gulf; South Asia; Southeast Asia; sustainable development; United Nations; urbanization; China; North Africa; South Asia; Southeast Asia; West Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078992951

The interaction and efficiency of use of land, water, and energy in agricultural activities are the principal factors affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and food production. However, comprehensive analysis exploring the mechanism of the land–water–energy system in agricultural production remains lacking. This study developed such a framework based on regional agricultural GHG emissions by combining top-down analysis that considered cross-sectoral interactions with bottom-up analysis that addressed the context-specific conditions of resources and technology. We employed the proposed framework to analyze the interaction of land–water–energy and factors influencing agricultural GHG emissions and to explore mitigation measures based on a case study of the Sanjiang Plain (China). Results showed cropland on the Sanjiang Plain produced 1.8 million tonnes of protein and released 10.9 million tonnes of CO2eq in 2015 using 3.0 million ha of arable land, 12.1 billion m3 of water, and 100.4 PJ of energy. Owing to their high input of resources and flooded cultivation, rice fields produced 29% of total crop protein but consumed 51% of total crop water use, 43% of total crop energy use, and emitted 54% of total crop GHG (CO2eq). Structural adjustment through conversion of half the paddy fields into dryland crops (e.g., wheat) could mitigate GHG emissions by 18.8% in 2020 compared with the baseline scenario. However, such change would be almost impossible given the Sanjiang Plain is one of China's most important rice-producing areas.

Most industries and businesses were closed, traffic was largely reduced, and people were restrained to their homes. This resulted in the reduction of emissions of trace gases and aerosols, the concentrations of which were strongly reduced in many cities around the country. Satellite imagery from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) showed an enormous reduction of tropospheric NO2 concentrations, but aerosol optical depth (AOD), as a measure of the amount of aerosols, was less affected, likely due to the different formation mechanisms and the influence of meteorological factors. In this study, satellite data and ground-based observations were used together to estimate the separate effects of the Spring Festival and the COVID-19 containment measures on atmospheric composition in the winter of 2020. To achieve this, data were analyzed for a period from 30 days before to 60 days after the Spring Festivals in 2017-2020. This extended period of time, including similar periods in previous years, were selected to account for both the decreasing concentrations in response to air pollution control measures, and meteorological effects on concentrations of trace gases and aerosols. Satellite data from TROPOMI provided the spatial distributions over mainland China of the tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) of NO2, and VCD of SO2 and CO. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provided the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The comparison of the satellite data for different periods showed a large reduction of, e.g., NO2 tropospheric VCDs due to the Spring Festival of up to 80% in some regions, and an additional reduction due to the COVID-19 containment measures of up to 70% in highly populated areas with intensive anthropogenic activities. In other areas, both effects are very small. Ground-based in situ observations from 26 provincial capitals provided concentrations of NO2, SO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10. The analysis of these data was focused on the situation in Wuhan, based on daily averaged concentrations. The NO2 concentrations started to decrease a few days before the Spring Festival and increased after about two weeks, except in 2020 when they continued to be low. SO2 concentrations behaved in a similar way, whereas CO, PM2.5, and PM10 also decreased during the Spring Festival but did not trace NO2 concentrations as SO2 did. As could be expected from atmospheric chemistry considerations, O3 concentrations increased. The analysis of the effects of the Spring Festival and the COVID-19 containment measures was complicated due to meteorological influences. Uncertainties contributing to the estimates of the different effects on the trace gas concentrations are discussed. The situation inWuhan is compared with that in 26 provincial capitals based on 30-day averages for four years, showing different effects across China. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Spring festival","Aerosols; Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Data reduction; Gases; Nitrogen oxides; Optical properties; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Springs (components); Troposphere; Uncertainty analysis; Viruses; Aerosol optical depths; Air pollution in chinas; Anthropogenic activity; Ground-based observations; Meteorological influence; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Trace gas concentrations; Vertical column densities; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085578554

Botha et al. (2020, this issue), and others have demonstrated the rich resource that such plants might offer to early human gatherers. However, such studies do not correct for the likely reduction in plant productivity and USO yields related to much reduced CO2 concentrations typical of Pleistocene glacial periods. To assess the need for such a correction, we grew Oxalis pes-caprae, a species harvested by the human gatherers, at a range of CO2 concentrations from glacial to current. Decreasing CO2 concentrations to glacial levels almost halved the mass of bulbs produced, while biomass was preferentially allocated to roots and shoots, which were not significantly decreased relative to plants grown at current CO2 concentrations. This would have major implications for estimating the potential calorific return to foraging effort, as modelled using anthropological data and assuming that USO yields would be similarly affected. The model suggests that an almost doubled foraging effort would have been required at glacial compared to current conditions. This highlights the need to consider plant growth conditions and particularly atmospheric CO2 concentrations when extrapolating current anthropological studies to the past, which could be a major gap in understanding human dietary preferences in glacial conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Geophytes; Glacial CO2; Pleistocene","Digital storage; Glacial geology; Carbohydrate sources; CO2 concentration; Glacial refugia; Human inhabitants; Middle Pleistocene; Plant productivity; Pleistocene glacial; Underground storage; Carbon dioxide; biomass allocation; Cape Floristic Region; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); hunter-gatherer; paleobotany; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; root-shoot ratio; Agulhas Plain; South Africa; Western Cape; Oxalis pes-caprae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065025562

What should be the primary objective, reducing or eliminating surplus food production, requires great change within social, cultural and economic structures. The secondary approach of redistributing surplus food to areas of deficit (in terms of socio-economic groups and/or geographic regions) involves a significant logistical burden, and suffers the same issues as with the elimination of waste. The least desirable, but perhaps most practicable approach, is the use of food waste as a feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion (AD). The strategic adoption of AD can therefore be seen as an important step towards mitigating food waste, but the implementation of efficient AD systems on a large (county/region) scale involves significant complexity. The optimal number, size and location of AD plants, and whether they are centralised versus decentralised, may be determined by considering factors such as supply and proximity to feedstock, transport links, emission hazards and social impact. Reaching balanced and objective decisions when faced with such disparate criteria is inevitably very difficult. To address this problem we prototype and evaluate a decision support tool for county-scale AD planning. Our approach is a hybridised Agent Based Model (ABM) with a Multi Objective Optimisation. We capture the spatio-temporal dependencies that exist in the water, energy and food systems associated with energy derived from food waste using Agent Based Modelling (ABM). The use of Interactive Multi Criteria Analysis as visual analytics offers a means to communicate the co-benefits and trade-offs that may emerge, as well as prioritise the AD strategies, based on the prioritization of criteria. Specifically, the method supports exploration of the social, environmental and economic impact of different AD strategies and decisions, linked to current issues, namely AD scale and adoption. The results highlight a trade-off between transport costs and social acceptability for the AD centralised versus decentralised strategies. When low carbon options are weighted higher then slow, steady and aggressive decentralised strategies are the best strategic adoption of AD. Conversely, when Energy production is considered a priority, then aggressive scaling up in a centralised approach is best with slow and steady approaches being further from the ideal. The framework has demonstrated that it permits a space for dialogue and transparent prioritization of AD strategies based on WEF nexus impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based model; Complex systems; Decision support tool; Energy; Food; Hybrid approaches; Nexus; Uncertainty; Water","Anaerobic digestion; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Feedstocks; Food products; Large scale systems; Multiobjective optimization; Simulation platform; Visualization; Water; Water conservation; Agent-based model; Decision support tools; Energy; Hybrid approach; Nexus; Uncertainty; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078660298

However, it constitutes an important ‘green lung’ and water source, supporting biodiversity, tourism, recreation, and additional benefits both locally and remotely. To safeguard and enhance the park ecosystem, there is a need to recognise and demonstrate the diversity of values associated with these multiple benefits, identify potential conflicts, and establish the management measures necessary to protect them. This study explores outcomes from SGNP across a systemically connected range of ecosystem services, and the geographical scales over which service benefits accrue. This informs potential novel ‘payment for ecosystem services’ (PES) opportunities. The protected status of the landscape is reflected in low values from provisioning services (material or energy exploitation), but substantial values from supporting (such as habitat for wildlife), regulating (including global climate, microclimate and hydrological regulation) and cultural (particularly tourism) services. However, direct resource exploitation by communities inhabiting the park is limited. Some ecosystem services were identified as ready for PES implementation (for example, water supply), others require further development (including contributions to the peripheral urban microclimate), while many services have no or limited PES potential (such as wood or aggregate extraction, prohibited under park regulations). © 2020, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Research conducted under the programme has focused on how climate change is affecting the pelagic ocean, with a range of impacts detected or predicted for open ocean biology, and provision of ecosystem services such as food. Research has also focused on exploring the socio-economic consequences of oceanic change, and in some cases, evaluating the adaptation options that can reduce the vulnerability to climate change. In this special issue, 18 papers arising from the 4th CLIOTOP symposium, held in Keelung, Taiwan Republic of China in October 2018, report on a wide range of predator responses to historical climate variability, and changes in marine systems associated with climate change and commercial fishing. They describe new frameworks and approaches for understanding the population and spatial dynamics, trophodynamics, and future distributions of a range of species as well as identifying individual drivers of change and future risks to populations. Several contributions further our understanding of the trophic linkages between prey and predators and the pathways through which the environment can influence predators. Research conducted through collaborations facilitated by CLIOTOP align with several of the goals set out under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and a number of the challenges identified as needing to be addressed in order to achieve the societal outcomes of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021–2030.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) faces limitations when it comes to addressing spatial and temporal variability in production, transportation and manufacturing systems. We present a bottom-up approach for quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions embedded in the production and trade of agricultural products with a high spatial resolution, by means of the integration of LCA principles with enhanced physical trade flow analysis. Our approach estimates the carbon footprint (as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per tonne of product) of Brazilian soy exports over the period 2010–2015 based on ~90,000 individual traded flows of beans, oil and protein cake identified from the municipality of origin through international markets. Soy is the most traded agricultural commodity in the world and the main agricultural export crop in Brazil, where it is associated with significant environmental impacts. We detect an extremely large spatial variability in carbon emissions across sourcing areas, countries of import, and sub-stages throughout the supply chain. The largest carbon footprints are associated with municipalities across the MATOPIBA states and Pará, where soy is directly linked to natural vegetation loss. Importing soy from the aforementioned states entailed up to six times greater emissions per unit of product than the Brazilian average (0.69 t t−1). The European Union (EU) had the largest carbon footprint (0.77 t t−1) due to a larger share of emissions from embodied deforestation than for instance in China (0.67 t t−1), the largest soy importer. Total GHG emissions from Brazilian soy exports in 2010–2015 are estimated at 223.46 Mt, of which more than half were imported by China although the EU imported greater emissions from deforestation in absolute terms. Our approach contributes data for enhanced environmental stewardship across supply chains at the local, regional, national and international scales, while informing the debate on global responsibility for the impacts of agricultural production and trade. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon footprint; Deforestation; Greenhouse gas; International trade; Life cycle assessment; Supply chain","agricultural technology; carbon emission; carbon footprint; commodity; ecological footprint; European Union; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; spatial analysis; trade flow; Brazil; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085073676

The inhabitants of the Ethiopian Highlands are highly vulnerable to this potential hazard due to their lack of immunity. Here, we identify hotspots within the Highlands where projected warming towards the end of the 21st century will increase the risk of malaria transmission significantly. Based on projected temperature changes, we conclude that about a third of the region's population and roughly 14% of its land area will become at high risk for malaria transmission within a century under the high-emissions-no-mitigation baseline scenario for future climate change. Our analysis combines dynamically down-scaled regional climate projections, high resolution satellite observations of temperature, and a village-scale malaria transmission model that was developed based on climatic, environmental, entomological, and medical data collected by our group in comprehensive multi-year field surveys of villages in this region. The projected impacts of global warming on malaria transmission in Africa have been controversial. We propose a framework that reconciles seemingly contradictory conclusions, and informs strategies for climate adaptation not only over the Ethiopian Highlands but broadly over Africa, where more than 90% of malaria deaths occur every year. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, the current economic infeasibility of grid-level storage hinders widespread practical application. Alternatively, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) present a potentially adaptable load that can facilitate managing excess wind energy. Our previous research justifies the need for a pricing mechanism that can coordinate wind energy and PEVs charging. In this paper, we employ a data decomposition approach (i.e., the dynamic mode decomposition) to design a dedicated pricing mechanism for PEVs. We use data from a city with relatively high current and projected PEV adoption rates (Austin, Texas) located in a wind-rich electricity grid (ERCOT). Our results indicate that a dedicated seasonal time of use pricing for PEVs can reduce wind energy curtailments, reduce emissions from electricity generation and PEV charging, and potentially avoid wind energy output curtailments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Customer incentive pricing; Dynamic mode decomposition; PEVs; Time of use; Time-varying pricing; Wind power curtailment","Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Data decomposition; Dynamic mode decompositions; Electricity generation; Electricity grids; Potential mechanism; Time-of-use pricing; Wind energy curtailments; Wind energy output; Plug-in electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090919657

This article attempts to apply policy implementation literature in the context of developing countries, when much of the scholarly work on implementation and policy process and empirical research has been in the context of developed countries. Purpose: This article explores the gap between sanitation policy intentions and outcomes in a comparative study in Rwanda and Uganda with “good” and “limited or no” reported progress respectively towards the former Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Approach and methods: From a multi-level governance perspective, the gap between strong political will and insufficient resources, implementation and outcome, is examined by drawing on policy and implementation theories and empirical research. The selection of variables for comparison is based on a range of factors theorized as affecting outcome in contemporary governance. Findings: Whereas the policy climate and prioritization of sanitation has been favourable in much of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), resources and capacity constraints, especially at the local level, negatively affect sector performance in an increasingly decentralized governance landscape. Progress in Rwanda is explained by stronger political leadership and support for sanitation, stringent performance monitoring and oversight, an institutionalized community-based approach, and investment in rural sanitation. Policy implications: This article shows that the management of sanitation depends on a changing governance landscape; leadership is important for overall sector improvement; networks present co-ordination challenges; approaching sanitation as a public concern requires strong government intervention; the move towards markets necessitates government oversight; approaches that foster inclusion and legitimacy at the local level need to be considered. © 2019 The Authors.

Specifically, variations in mid-latitude cyclone tracks attributable to a warming climate have potential socio-economic consequences via the redistribution of precipitation on regional spatial scales. This manuscript assesses the impacts of a warming climate on cyclone tracks in the NARCCAP model suite. Specifically, cyclones are generated from eight 33-year simulations for the twentieth Century (1968–2000) and eight 33-year simulations for the A2 greenhouse scenario (2068–2100). To provide comparison, cyclone tracks are also generated from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and ERA Interim (ERA_INT) reanalysis datasets from 1979 to 2016. The results support that the NARCCAP model suite is capable of producing a reasonable cyclone frequency and intensity climatology when compared with the reanalysis datasets. Comparison of the ensemble twentieth Century cyclone (20C) tracks with the ensemble A2 cyclone tracks demonstrate a zonally-oriented poleward shift in cyclone track frequency in response to a warming climate. Intensity differences were regionally oriented, with cyclones being more intense in the A2 relative to the twentieth Century scenarios west of the Appalachians, suggesting cyclones acquire greater latent heat from warmer western Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico moisture sources in A2. A sector analysis revealed a higher total frequency of cyclones in both reanalysis datasets relative to either NARCCAP scenario. For intense cyclones, the NARCCAP model simulations produced more frequent cyclones in the Great Lakes and East Coast sectors. In contrast, reanalysis produced a higher frequency of weak cyclones for all sectors except Atlantic Canada. In addition, NARCCAP simulations were found to be capable of reproducing the broadness of intensity distributions in the reanalysis datasets, likely due to the fine spatial gridding in the NARCCAP models. Sector analysis for frequency and intensity affirmed the ensemble results, with individual model simulations showed a reduction in frequency for all sectors except the Canadian Maritimes for A2 relative to 20C. For intensity, cyclones were once again overall more intense for the upper Midwest/Great Lakes sector for A2 relative to 20C. The results of this research demonstrates the ability for regional climate models to be used to assess changes in synoptic-scale phenomena in a warming climate. Future work will focus on assessing cyclone structure including changes in moisture transport, precipitation, and the low-level jet. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate modeling; cyclone; data set; latent heat flux; regional climate; storm track; twentieth century; warming; winter; Appalachians; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (West); Gulf of Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084123026

However, available literature on lawn N2O emissions is varied and inconclusive. To our knowledge, an ef-fort to compile and understand urban lawn N2O emis-sions is, as yet, lacking. In the present article, a meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of lawn fertilizer application on N2O emissions relative to no-fertilizer application, along with an examination of the variation of this effect with respect to the type and amount of fertilizer. The results show that lawn N2O emissions from fertilized plots are significant and are 41% (0.29 g N2O-N/m2/year) higher than that of control plots. However, studies with low N-input (&lt;150 kg/ha) show higher percentage (40) of N2O emission than those with high N-input (22). Further, N2O emissions are higher for urea application plots (37%) compared to other-than-urea plots (30%), which consisted mostly of enhanced efficiency fertilizer plots. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis under-score current understandings of the effect of fertilizer on soil N2O emissions, although it indicates that ferti-lizer amount is not the only driver of lawn N2O emis-sions. Also, the sub-group analysis of fertilizer type reinforces the importance of enhanced efficiency ferti-lizers in reducing emissions which has clear policy implications. To improve our understanding of lawn N2O emissions, more long-term studies that are well-documented, and geographically widespread, are rec-ommended to build a database that can reduce uncer-tainties and facilitate long-term evaluations. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.","Fertilizer; Meta-analysis; Nitrous oxide; Turfgrass lawn; Urban",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086101772

Anaerobic digestion (AD) has long been introduced as an environmental-friendly and sustainable waste management technology with bio-methane as final product. Energy production via AD of HW would significantly contribute to low-carbon energy production systems and circular bio-economy. In this study, optimal conditions, inhibiting factors, and microbial community changes in continuously fed biogas reactors during anaerobic digestion of HW at elevated influent feedstock concentration (IFC) were investigated. The highest methane yield (327 ± 21 mL g VS−1) was obtained at IFC of 3% TS. Increased IFC deteriorated the process and affected the microbiome dynamicity. Specifically, methane production was reduced by 50% with a concomitant increment of ammonia, Na+, and K+ concentration. Two archaeal species (Methanosaeta and WSA2) were dominating the microbial community at stable period. Two uncharacterized microbial groups (WWE1 and WSA2) were present and a potential syntrophic interaction between these two members was hypothesized to play a crucial role in achieving a well-performing process. AD process treating HW showed promising results for valorization of HW to clean energy-biomethane both in environmental and economic aspects. Specifically, 1 t of HW VS could obtain a greenhouse gases (GHG) mitigation of −54 to −272 kg CO2,eq via the AD process. The LCA results demonstrated that such a bioenergy system would also bring about environmental savings in ecosystem quality and resource damage categories. Although ammonia inhibition at elevated IFC found as a potential inhibitory factor, it can be easily overcome using co-digestion strategies or nitrogen recovery at upstream. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Environmental footprint; Human waste; Influent feedstock concentration; Methane; Microbial community","Ammonia; Carbon; Economics; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Methane; Microorganisms; Sustainable development; Environmental footprints; Environmental-friendly; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Human waste; Microbial communities; Sustainable management; Sustainable waste management; Syntrophic interactions; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079245844

While several previous studies have examined the climate effect of different radiation modification approaches, only a few have investigated the carbon cycle response. Our study examines the response of plant carbon uptake to four radiation modification approaches that are used to offset the global mean warming caused by a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model, we performed simulations that represent four idealized radiation modification options: solar constant reduction, sulfate aerosol increase (SAI), marine cloud brightening, and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT). Relative to the high CO2 state, all these approaches reduce gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP). In high latitudes, decrease in GPP is mainly due to the reduced plant growing season length, and in low latitudes, decrease in GPP is mainly caused by the enhanced nitrogen limitation due to surface cooling. The simulated GPP for sunlit leaves decreases for all approaches. Decrease in sunlit GPP is the largest for SAI which substantially decreases direct sunlight, and the smallest for CCT, which increases direct sunlight that reaches the land surface. GPP for shaded leaves increases in SAI associated with a substantial increase in surface diffuse sunlight, and decreases in all other cases. The combined effects of CO2 increase and radiation modification result in increases in primary production, indicating the dominant role of the CO2 fertilization effect on plant carbon uptake. ©2020.

Plants in this area are exposed to a prolonged dry season. In this study, we measured the stable isotopes of hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ18O) of the local precipitation, river water, soil water, plant xylem water, and leaf water at four sampling sites during the 2016 growing season. Our results showed that plants relied mostly on wet season precipitation at sites N1, N2, and N3 because this recharged the soil after the long dry season. Leaf phenology had a significant effect on evaporation distance (ED) value, and evergreen plants have adapted to water tapping from deep soil water sources during the dry season. The ED values of trees and shrubs were quite different in the dry season, indicating water competition among different plant species was mitigated due to water resource partitioning. Moreover, plants at site N4 relied on a water source admixed with river water throughout the whole growing season. The mean value of xylem-to-leaf water deuterium enrichment (?l/x) was _0.91±0.36‰ over all plant species, seasons, and sampling sites. Plant species, leaf phenology, and seasons were found to be the primary factors influencing the ?l/x, while growth form and elevation had negligible effects. © 2020 IWA Publishing.

Reducing CO2 emissions in the Yangtze River Economic Zone (YREZ) while considering both inter-regional and inter-sectoral connections has become an essential issue. Based on a multi-regional input-output model and complex network theory, this study constructed a network with inter-regional and inter-sectoral CO2 emission flows in the YREZ simultaneously to reveal sectoral and spatial transfer pattern and identify the key sectors at the provincial level. The results of density, connectedness, hierarchy, and efficiency showed that the CO2 flow network was vulnerable and sensitive. The key provincial sectors were identified through different network indicators, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. According to their characteristics, the 66 sectors were categorized into different communities with the roles of suppliers, receivers, and intermediaries. The findings of this study provided an integral map of CO2 emission flows in the YREZ so that the specific and comprehensive policies could be designed from sectoral and provincial level to avoid the offset of different policies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emission flows; Network theory; Provincial sectors; Yangtze River Economic Zone","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; environmental indicator; environmental issue; Exclusive Economic Zone; input-output analysis; pollution policy; China; Yangtze River; carbon dioxide; China; river; Carbon Dioxide; China; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081574111

Bridging organizations help align stakeholder and local perspectives and mediate communication that shapes adaptation responses. We argue that a first step for adaptation projects is to determine the nature of the climate norms and how climate is changing. This paper explores the degree to which development organizations in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania used analysis of local historical climate information in project aims, planning and design. This included 67 participants, managing 102 community-level climate-related agricultural projects, and three NGO case studies. Most focused on low-regret options. The majority of projects enhanced awareness of climate change and variability, but only 7% had used historical climate information during planning. Instead, projects relied on general knowledge or farmers’ perceptions, which sometimes differ from analyzed historical climate information, potentially leading reinforcement of perceptions. It is vital that bridging organizations and policy makers value analyzed historical climate information when determining climate norms (including variability) and identify what data shows regarding how climate is changing. This is essential for planning with stakeholders the suitability of alternative crops and cultivars and ensuring other relevant environmental factors influencing agricultural production are considered. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Biologically active soils have the ability to suppress pathogenic infections of plants, but little is known how this essential soil function might be affected by abiotic stresses. Using a model system with pea and its fungal pathogen Pythium ultimum we studied how the suppressiveness of different soils from a wide geographic range responds to combined heat and drought stress. We found that different soils strongly differ in their ability to suppress diseases and that a stress event of combined heat (40 °C) and drought (−50% moisture) can strongly reduce this disease suppressiveness. Further, the response of suppressiveness to the stress depended on the provenance of the soil. Soils from a cool-climate site in Scotland were much more negatively affected than soils from warmer sites in Germany and Hungary. After being exposed to stress, one soil was able to regain suppressiveness after several weeks while the others were not, thereby collectively showing different degrees of resilience to the stress. Stress tolerance was negatively related to resilience. Our results suggest that microbial communities responsible for suppressiveness are adapted to prevailing climate, which has potentially severe consequences for the impact of climate change upon plant health. © 2020 The Authors","Legumes; Pythium ultimum; Resilience; Soil-borne diseases; Stress; Suppressiveness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078654604

Moreover, the North Atlantic Ocean is undergoing rapid changes at the physical scale leading to modifications at the biological scale increasing interest to monitor the environment. The phytoplankton is the base of the ocean life and its perturbation can lead to further changes in the food chain. Recording its dynamics implies to observe both its spatial and temporal variations. This study brings forward the use of the Ba/Ca ratio from shells of the long-living bivalve Arctica islandica collected in the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean near Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (SPM) as a recorder of the past and present phytoplankton dynamics. A high inter and intra-reproducibility and synchrony between Ba/Cashell profiles were demonstrated allowing the reconstruction of a 124 years annually-resolved Ba/Cashell master chronology (from 1893 to 2016).

However, current state-of-the-art Earth system models do not represent dynamic human societies and their feedback interactions with the biogeophysical Earth system and macroeconomic integrated assessment models typically do so only with limited scope. This paper (i) proposes design principles for constructing world-Earth models (WEMs) for Earth system analysis of the Anthropocene, i.e., models of social (world)-ecological (Earth) coevolution on up to planetary scales, and (ii) presents the copan:CORE open simulation modeling framework for developing, composing and analyzing such WEMs based on the proposed principles. The framework provides a modular structure to flexibly construct and study WEMs. These can contain biophysical (e.g., carbon cycle dynamics), socio-metabolic or economic (e.g., economic growth or energy system changes), and sociocultural processes (e.g., voting on climate policies or changing social norms) and their feedback interactions, and they are based on elementary entity types, e.g., grid cells and social systems. Thereby, copan:CORE enables the epistemic flexibility needed for contributions towards Earth system analysis of the Anthropocene given the large diversity of competing theories and methodologies used for describing socio-metabolic or economic and sociocultural processes in the Earth system by various fields and schools of thought. To illustrate the capabilities of the framework, we present an exemplary and highly stylized WEM implemented in copan:CORE that illustrates how endogenizing sociocultural processes and feedbacks such as voting on climate policies based on socially learned environmental awareness could fundamentally change macroscopic model outcomes. © Author(s) 2020.",,"Chemical analysis; Climate change; Climate models; Economics; Metabolism; Systems analysis; Chemical and biologicals; Design Principles; Earth system model; Environmental awareness; Feedback interaction; Integrated assessment models; Macroscopic model; Modular structures; Earth (planet); Anthropocene; environmental economics; environmental policy; macroeconomics; modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084591048

Microorganisms are usually involved in the formation and maintenance of the cave system through various metabolic activities, and are indicators of changes environment influenced by human. Zhijin cave is a typical Karst cave and attracts tourists in China. However, the bacterial diversity and composition of the Karst cave are still unclear. The present study aims to reveal the bacterial diversity and composition in the cave and the potential impact of tourism activities, and better understand the roles and co-occurrence pattern of the bacterial community in the extreme cave habitats. Results: The bacterial community consisted of the major Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, with Proteobacteria being the predominant phylum in the rock, soil, and stalactite samples. Compositions and specialized bacterial phyla of the bacterial communities were different among different sample types. The highest diversity index was found in the rock samples with a Shannon index of 4.71. Overall, Zhijin cave has relatively lower diversity than that in natural caves. The prediction of function showed that various enzymes, including ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase, nitrogenase NifH, and Nitrite reductase, involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles were detected in Zhijin cave. Additionally, the modularity indices of all co-occurrence network were greater than 0.40 and the species interactions were complex across different sample types. Co-occurring positive interactions in the bacteria groups in different phyla were also observed. Conclusion: These results uncovered that the oligotrophic Zhijin cave maintains the bacterial communities with the diverse metabolic pathways, interdependent and cooperative co-existence patterns. Moreover, as a hotspot for tourism, the composition and diversity of bacterial community are influenced by tourism activities. These afford new insights for further exploring the adaptation of bacteria to extreme environments and the conservation of cave ecosystem. © 2020 The Author(s).","16S rRNA gene; Bacterial community; Co-occurrence network; Function prediction; Karst; Oligotrophy; Tourism; Zhijin cave","4 hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydratase; carbon; hydrolyase; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; nitrogenase; nitrogenase NifH; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; Actinobacteria; Article; carbon cycle; carbon metabolism; cave; controlled study; environment; Firmicutes; Karst cave; metabolism; microbial community; microbial diversity; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; organismal interaction; prediction; Proteobacteria; rock; species composition; stalactite; tourism; bacterium; biodiversity; China; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; human; human activities; isolation and purification; microbiology; phylogeny; procedures; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Caves; China; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Human Activities; Humans; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085607223

Compared herein is the solvent-dependent fluorescence of a cationic exciplex with extant data for conventional exciplexes. Although linear correlations of conventional exciplex emission maxima with the Lippert-Mataga solvent polarity function are well documented in low to moderate polarity solvents, the correlations are often poor in more polar solvents. A number of such plots in moderate to high polarity solvents show a strong curvature. Intriguingly, for these same cases, plots of emission maxima versus the solvent dielectric constant (ϵ) are remarkably linear. Interestingly, emission maxima for the cationic exciplex of 1+ in nitrile and alcohol solvents also correlate linearly with ϵ. The solvent dependency for cationic exciplex emission maxima on ϵ is ca 1/3 of that for conventional exciplexes, which is ascribed to solvent stabilization of both the excited state and the ground state for cationic exciplexes. Differences in exciplex emissions between nitrile and alcohol solvents for 1+ are attributed to hydrogen bonding, with larger differences in higher hydrogen-bond acidity solvents. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Cyanides; Excited states; Ground state; Hydrogen bonds; Charge generation; Emission maxima; Exciplex emission; Linear correlation; Solvent dependence; Solvent dependencies; Solvent polarity; Solvent stabilization; Solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084525962

This may change under greenhouse warming, but the mechanisms remain uncertain, thus limiting our ability to predict future changes in climate extremes. Using climate model simulations, we uncover the emergence of a mode of climate variability capable of generating unprecedented sea surface temperature and rainfall fluctuations across the IO. This mode, which is inhibited under present-day conditions, becomes active in climate states with a shallow thermocline and vigorous upwelling, consistent with the predictions of continued greenhouse warming. These predictions are supported by modeling and proxy evidence of an active mode during glacial intervals that favored such a state. Because of its impact on hydrological variability, the emergence of such a mode would become a first-order source of climate-related risks for the densely populated IO rim.

The optical performance of GaN/AlN superlattices on nanowires is compared with the emission of planar GaN/AlN superlattices with the same periodicity and thickness grown on bulk GaN substrates along the N-polar and metal-polar crystallographic axes. The nanowire samples are less sensitive to nonradiative recombination than planar layers, attaining internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) in excess of 60% at room temperature even under low injection conditions. The IQE remains stable for higher excitation power densities, up to 50 kW cm-2. We demonstrate that the nanowire superlattice is long enough to collect the electron-hole pairs generated by an electron beam with an acceleration voltage V A = 5 kV. At such V A, the light emitted from the nanowire ensemble does not show any sign of quenching under constant electron beam excitation (tested for an excitation power density around 8 kW cm-2 over the scale of minutes). Varying the dot/barrier thickness ratio and the Al content in the dots, the nanowire peak emission can be tuned in the range from 340 to 258 nm. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","AlN; GaN; nanowire; ultraviolet","Aluminum gallium nitride; Aluminum nitride; Electron beams; Electrons; Gallium nitride; Nanowires; Semiconductor quantum dots; Crystallographic axes; Electron beam excitation; Excitation power density; Internal quantum efficiency; Nanowire superlattices; Non-radiative recombinations; Quantum dot superlattices; ultraviolet; III-V semiconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082174357

It is estimated that over two-hundred million “forest peoples”—including indigenous peoples and local communities—live within and depend upon tropical forests. To successfully mitigate climate change, we must find new forms of collaboration that meet the goals of forest-dependent communities for secure land rights, equitable participation in decision-making, and dignified livelihoods in conjunction with meeting commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, 34 subnational governments and 18 indigenous and local community organizations announced their endorsement of the “Guiding Principles for Collaboration between Subnational Governments, Indigenous Peoples, and Local Communities.” The Guiding Principles of Collaboration (GPC) are a set of 13 universal tenets which lay out a blueprint for collaboration between subnational state actors, indigenous peoples and local communities to recognize rights, support livelihoods, strengthen participation of forest-dependent communities in decision-making, and protect indigenous and community environmental defenders within the context of joint action for climate change mitigation. Their implementation would advance the integration of climate justice in subnational efforts for forest conservation. Taking the GPC as a point of departure, we explore how jurisdictional approaches to sustainability can protect and enhance the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples (IP) and local communities (LC). We develop and apply a suite of indicators to assess existing conditions across 11 tropical forest jurisdictions toward meeting the commitments described in the GPC. Our findings suggest that while the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities are recognized within national legal frameworks, implementation and security of those rights is uneven across subnational jurisdictions. Participation of IP and LC is not yet formalized as part of jurisdictional climate change mitigation initiatives in most cases, limiting their potential to inform policy outcomes and benefit-sharing mechanisms. Monitoring the implementation of the GPC may foster greater accountability for commitments, as well as collective action and learning to support regional transformations to sustainability. © Copyright © 2020 DiGiano, Stickler and David.","benefit-sharing; environmental governance; indigenous rights; monitoring; participation; safeguards",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105932848

Therefore, we systematically inoculated both plant lineages with a diverse array of 162 fungal and bacterial isolates to determine which could (1) differentiate between Phragmites hosts, (2) infect leaves at various stages of development, or (3) obtain plant-based carbon saprophytically. We found that many of the microbes isolated from Phragmites leaves behave as saprophytes.

The study used both augmented mean group estimator and panel bootstrap causality method to consider the cross-sectional dependence and country specific heterogeneity across G-7 countries. Empirical findings indicate that increasing biomass energy consumption was efficient to reduce carbon emission in France, Germany, Japan and the United States; increasing hydroelectricity usage was efficient to reduce carbon emission in Italy and the United Kingdom; wind energy consumption reduced emission in Canada and solar energy usage was efficient on reducing emission in France and Italy for observed period. Moreover, in case of panel, it is found that increasing hydroelectricity, biomass and wind energy consumption reduced carbon emissions while the impact of solar energy consumption is statistically insignificant in G-7 countries. In addition, the hydroelectricity consumption was found the most efficient renewable energy source to reduce environmental pollution for the panel of G-7 countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Hydroelectricity; Renewable energy; Solar; Wind","Biomass; Carbon; Economics; Energy utilization; Hydroelectric power; Pollution; Solar energy; Wind; Wind power; Cross sectional dependence; Environmental effectiveness; Environmental pollutions; Environmental sustainability; Renewable energies; Renewable energy consumption; Renewable energy source; Solar; Sustainable development; biomass power; carbon emission; economic growth; energy planning; energy use; heterogeneity; hydroelectric power; pollution incidence; wind power; wind profile; Canada; France; Germany; Italy; Japan; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076547158

In this paper, we investigate whether or not insights into premodern strategies for coping with climate change—and especially the “deeper histories” of traditional ways-of-knowing—can play a useful role in future planning, management and mitigation efforts. We do this in two ways. First, we assess this special issue's 17 archaeological case studies, in order to determine whether they are conducted within a framework that is consistent with approaches to resilience in studies of modern Arctic communities. Second, we focus on three climate-driven challenges faced by Canadian Arctic Inuit: safe travel, food security and food safety. For each, we identify specific ways in which studies of past social-ecological systems intersect with modern climate adaptation. We conclude that since archaeological insights highlight the operation of decision-making processes within long-term culture-adaptive trajectories, they can offer unique insights into the much shorter-term processes currently underway. While we highlight many potential directions for productive collaboration, much more work is required in local and regional settings to demonstrate the full potential of archaeology for future-oriented planning and mitigation efforts. © 2020","Archaeology; Arctic; Climate change; Food safety; Food security; Human-environment interactions; Indigenous knowledge; Inuit; Long-term; Resilience; Social-ecological systems","adaptive management; arctic environment; climate change; climate variation; coping strategy; environmental planning; future prospect; human settlement; indigenous population; paleoclimate; Arctic; Canada; Canadian Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086517358

The strain was Gram-negative, facultative chemolithotrophic, facultative anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped with a single flagellum. Phy-logenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that it belongs to the genus Ciceribacter and is most closely related to C. lividus MSSRFBL1T (99.4%), followed by C. thiooxidans F43bT (98.8%) and C. azotifigens A.slu09T (98.0%). Fatty acid, polar lipid, respiratory quinone, and DNA G + C content analyses supported its classification in the genus Ciceribacter. Multilocus sequence analysis of concatenated 16S rRNA, atpD, glnII, gyrB, recA, and thrC suggested that the isolate was a novel species. DNA-DNA hybridization and genome sequence comparisons (90.88 and 89.86%, for values of ANIm and ANIb between strains F8825T with MSSRFBL1T, respectively) confirmed that strain F8825T was a novel species, different from C. lividus MSSRFBL1T, C. thiooxidans F43bT, and C. azotifigens A.slu09T. The physiological and biochemical properties of the strain, such as carbon source utilization, nitrate reduction, and ferrous ion oxidation, further supported that this is a novel species. Based on the polyphasic taxonomic results, strain F8825T was identified as a novel species in the genus Ciceribacter, for which the name Ciceribacter ferrooxidans sp. nov. is proposed.

The expansion of the agricultural frontier is more visible in countries with proximity to the Amazon. Otherwise, the increase in urban primacy and real income per capita has led to an increase in the use of non-renewable energy in recent decades. The interest in quantifying greenhouse gas emissions has increased, oriented towards the search for mechanisms that mitigate the irreversible effects of climate change. In this context, the objective of this research is to examine the causal link among non-renewable energy consumption and real GDP per capita in greenhouse gas emissions in ten countries of South America during 1971–2014. In addition, we group the countries according to their productive structure and we incorporate the structural changes of each country in the econometric estimations, allowing to significantly improve the understanding of the sources of greenhouse gases. We use cointegration and causality techniques for time series data, and we found that there is a relationship of short- and long-term equilibrium between the three variables in all countries. The causality test indicates that in Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay, there is causality from the consumption of non-renewable energy to greenhouse gas emissions. Likewise, in Venezuela and the agricultural countries, GDP causes greenhouse gas emissions. An implication of the public policy derived from this research is that most of the countries of South America can promote a change in the energy matrix to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions without limiting economic growth. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Non-renewable energy; Output; South America","cointegration analysis; econometrics; economic growth; Granger causality test; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; mining; time series; Amazonas [Brazil]; Bolivia; Brazil; Peru; Uruguay; Venezuela; carbon dioxide; Bolivia; economic development; greenhouse gas; Peru; renewable energy; South America; Bolivia; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Greenhouse Gases; Peru; Renewable Energy; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078306309

Actions are being taken to replace these solid fuels with cleaner energy carriers. However, the pollutant emission amounts from solid fuels over large areas have rarely been evaluated. In this study, we tested eight common heating stoves consuming bituminous coal chunk, anthracite coal chunk, and anthracite coal briquette; three honeycomb briquette stoves; and three traditional cookstoves consuming corn straw and wood in rural Beijing. Emission factors of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), were measured as 0.08–13.74 g/kg, 10.80–148.5 g/kg, 0.52–8.44 g/kg, and 0–0.85 g/kg, respectively, for coal heating stoves; 0.35–1.11 g/kg, 16.10–109.43 g/kg, 0.51–0.75 g/kg, and 0–1.98 g/kg, respectively, for honeycomb briquette cookstoves; and 5.90–11.79 g/kg, 28.96–50.23 g/kg, 1.52–2.46 g/kg, and 0–0.05 g/kg, respectively, for traditional biomass cookstoves. Combining emission performance and solid fuel consumption, the estimated annual PM2.5, CO, NOx, and SO2 emission amounts were 26.18 Gg, 394.07 Gg, 14.56 Gg, and 1.53 Gg, respectively.

Although climate warming reduces the frequency of frost events, vegetation is exposed more frequently to frost due to the extension of the growing season. Currently, little is known about the effect of frost during the growing season on Vgreenup and Vwithering. This study analyzed spatiotemporal variations in Vgreenup and Vwithering in Northeast China between 1982 to 2015 using Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GIMMS 3g NDVI) data. Frost days and frost intensity were selected as indicators to investigate the influence of frost during the growing season on Vgreenup and Vwithering, respectively. Increased frost days during the growing season slowed Vgreenup and Vwithering. The number of frost days had a greater impact on Vwithering compared to Vgreenup. In addition, Vgreenup and Vwithering of forests were more vulnerable to frost days, while frost days had a lesser effect on grasslands. In contrast to frost days, frost intensity, which generally decreased during the growing season, accelerated Vgreenup and Vwithering for all land cover types. Changes in frost intensity had less of an impact on forests, whereas the leaf structure of grasslands is relatively simple and thus more vulnerable to frost intensity. The effects of frost during the growing season on Vgreenup and Vwithering in Northeast China were highlighted in this study, and the results provide a useful reference for understanding local vegetation responses to global climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

However, proper disposal of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) presents a challenge to its sustainable development. Biochar derived from SMS could be used to improve soil quality while providing a solution for SMS disposal. But SMS biochar pyrolyzed at different temperatures may alter carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions associated with global warming, especially under the context of nitrogen (N) addition and warming. We conducted a factorial incubation study to examine greenhouse gas emissions and N transformations in moso bamboo forest soil amended with SMS-biochar (control vs. pyrolyzed at 300, 450 or 600 °C) in different N-addition (0 or 100 mg N kg-1 soil) and temperature (20, 25 or 30 °C) treatments. Pyrolysis temperature affected pH, C and N of SMS-biochars. N-transformations depended on the interaction of pyrolysis temperature, N-addition, and incubation temperature but were generally lower with 450 °C biochar addition. Soil N2O emissions increased with N-addition and they were more sensitive to incubation temperatures without biochar. Soil CO2 emissions increased with incubation temperature or biochar pyrolyzed at lower temperatures. Pyrolysis temperature might have regulated the effects of SMS-derived biochar on N2O emissions via changes in dissolved C, N, pH and associated changes in soil microbial community compositions. Because of the importance of sustainable development of this understory industry, amending soils with biochar produced at higher temperatures may be the best strategy for both the disposal of SMS and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Nitrous oxide; Pyrolysis temperature; Soil ameliorant; Spent mushroom substrate; Under-forest economy","Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Planning; Pyrolysis; Soils; Sustainable development; Bio chars; Forest economy; Nitrous oxide; Pyrolysis temperature; Spent mushroom substrates; Gas emissions; biochar; carbon dioxide; charcoal; nitrous oxide; unclassified drug; biochar; carbon dioxide; charcoal; nitrous oxide; bamboo; biochar; carbon dioxide; forest soil; greenhouse gas; microbial community; mushroom; nitrous oxide; pyrolysis; soil quality; sustainable development; understory; Article; bamboo; carbon footprint; forest soil; greenhouse effect; Lentinula edodes; pyrolysis; soil; soil microflora; soil quality; temperature; warming; Agaricales; chemistry; forest; greenhouse gas; pyrolysis; soil; Basidiomycota; Phyllostachys pubescens; Agaricales; Carbon Dioxide; Charcoal; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrous Oxide; Pyrolysis; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076691831

However, the effectiveness of methods designed to meet these commitments is poorly understood. In a highly fragmented tropical landscape dominated by oil palm, we tested the capacity for the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach to prioritize forest remnants that sustain mammal diversity. Patches afforded high priority by HCS protocols (100 ha core area) provided important refuges for IUCN-threatened species and megafauna. However, patch-scale HCS area recommendations conserved only 35% of the mammal community. At least 3,000 ha would be required to retain intact mammal assemblages, with nearly 10 times this area needed if hunting pressure was high. While current HCS protocols will safeguard patches capable of sustaining biodiversity, highly fragmented tropical landscapes typical of zero-deforestation pledges will require thinking beyond the patch toward strategically configured forest remnants at the landscape level and enforcing strict controls on hunting. © 2020 The Authors.

Based on facility-level data from a 2014 HAP national emissions inventory, it is estimated that 70% of major sources of HAPs qualify for reclassification as area sources, which could result in a maximum of 35,030 tons per year (tpy) of additional HAP emissions if all sources successfully reclassified. This amount would nearly triple the total volume of HAPs that qualifying major sources emitted in 2014. On average, qualifying sources could emit individually an additional 18.4 tpy. In the 21 states and territories that follow only federal guidelines for controlling HAPs, it is more likely that the estimates presented here could materialize compared to states that have additional guidelines for area sources of HAPs. The quantitative analysis of the potential emission changes resulting from regulatory change is instructive for industry, state and federal decisionmakers, and interested members of the public looking to understand and anticipate how relevant stakeholders will be affected by this policy change. Implications: Withdrawal of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency policy that mandates the use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT) to regulate emissions from major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) could result in higher emissions of toxic chemicals that may be carcinogenic, mutagenic, or cause other adverse health effects.

But lean blowout (LBO) is considered as the main threat in taking the ultra-lean premixed combustion. LBO can also occur in aircraft engines during rapid decrease in speed or power. Although gas turbine flames can be of both premixed and partially premixed in nature, early detection of LBO of partially premixed flames has received relatively less attention compared to premixed flames. In this paper, attention has been focused on the early detection of LBO in combustors with different levels of premixing. Apart from that, a detail investigation on the electromagnetic emission of the flame is performed in order to have the insight of the dominating chemiluminescence. The primary chemiluminescence species, OH*, CH*,and C2*, are considered in this study. The flame dynamics is captured using spectral signal obtained from a spectrometer. Also, the spectrums of different colors, emitted by the flame at different conditions, are studied using both spectrometer and color Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera. At lean condition of the premixed flame, three narrowband emissions in the visible (VIS) range, namely, blue, violet, and indigo colors, are observed. Three primary parameters, α, β, and γ, are introduced based on the color ratios when numerator of the ratio is the intensity of red band. Near LBO, each of these parameters becomes significantly low. The observation range for this analysis is considered from stoichiometric condition to the extreme lean region, where LBO occurs. At the end, the behavior of the red, green, and blue color ratios toward the LBO using both camera and spectrometer is compared. The similarity between the results of camera and spectrometer indicates that flame imaging through commercial color CCD camera can provide a low cost, simple tool for LBO detection. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Chemiluminescence; color ratio; degree of premixing; lean blowout; normalized intensity; partially premixed","Aircraft engines; Blowouts; CCD cameras; Charge coupled devices; Chemiluminescence; Color; Combustors; Costs; Gas turbines; Spectrometers; Color ratios; Lean blow out; normalized intensity; Partially-premixed; Premixing; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064839870

In particular, few models include a comprehensive and energy-constrained parameterization of mixing by internal ocean tides. Here, we present an energy-conserving mixing scheme which accounts for the local breaking of high-mode internal tides and the distant dissipation of low-mode internal tides. The scheme relies on four static two-dimensional maps of internal tide dissipation, constructed using mode-by-mode Lagrangian tracking of energy beams from sources to sinks. Each map is associated with a distinct dissipative process and a corresponding vertical structure. Applied to an observational climatology of stratification, the scheme produces a global three-dimensional map of dissipation which compares well with available microstructure observations and with upper-ocean finestructure mixing estimates. This relative agreement, both in magnitude and spatial structure across ocean basins, suggests that internal tides underpin most of observed dissipation in the ocean interior at the global scale. The proposed parameterization is therefore expected to improve understanding, mapping, and modeling of ocean mixing. ©2020.

Here, we study the catalytic properties of tailored Cu nanocatalysts under commercially relevant current densities in a gas-fed flow cell. We demonstrate that their facet-dependent selectivity is retained in this device configuration with the advantage of further suppressing hydrogen production and increasing the faradaic efficiencies toward the CO2 reduction products compared to a conventional H-cell. The combined catalyst and system effects result in state-of-the art product selectivity at high current densities (in the range 100-300 mA/cm2) and at relatively low applied potential (as low as-0.65 V vs RHE).

The present-day hydrology of the basin is dominated by an annual flood pulse where water from the Mekong River raises the lake level by c. 8 m during the monsoon season. We present new subsurface geophysical data, allied to new and past core studies, which unequivocally show a period of major mid-Holocene erosion across the entire Tonlé Sap basin that is coincident with establishment of the lake's flood pulse. We argue that this widespread erosion, which removed at least 1.2 m of sediment across the lake's extent, was triggered by up to three, likely interacting, processes: (1) base-level lowering due to mid-Holocene sea-level fall, leading to (2) capture of the Tonlé Sap drainage by the Mekong River, and (3) a drying climate that also reduced lake level. Longer-term landscape evolution was thus punctuated by a rapid, river capture- and base-level fall- induced, lake drainage that established the ecosystem that flourishes today. The scale of change induced by this mid-Holocene river capture event demonstrates the susceptibility of the Tonlé Sap lake to ongoing changes in local base-level and hydrology induced by anthropogenic activity, such as damming and sand mining, within the Mekong River Basin. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Holocene; Paleogeography; Paleolimnology; Southeastern Asia; Tonlé sap","Erosion; Floods; Paleolimnology; Rivers; Sea level; Anthropogenic activity; Geophysical data; Holocene sea level; Holocenes; Landscape evolutions; Mekong river basins; Paleogeography; Southeastern Asia; Lakes; drainage basin; flood; Holocene; hydrology; lake level; landscape; landscape evolution; Paleogene; paleolimnology; sediment-water interface; Cambodia; Mekong Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082700372

However, reliable forward-looking assessment of the short-term effects of climate policy remains a major challenge. Using panel data of 30 Chinese provinces during 1997–2015, we first estimate the marginal CO2 abatement costs using a novel data-driven approach, convex quantile regression. Based on the marginal abatement cost estimates and China's plans regarding carbon intensity reduction and economic growth, we present a forward-looking assessment of the abatement costs for Chinese provinces for 2016–2020. Our main finding is that all the Chinese provinces have a negative abatement cost, which means these provinces can benefit from an increase in the absolute level of CO2 emissions despite the constraint on carbon intensity. The magnitudes of economic benefits exhibit a significant regional disparity because some provinces can increase more CO2 emissions than others. However, there is still costly carbon intensity abatement relative to a counterfactual where the provinces meet their economic growth targets but in the absence of the intensity reduction constraints.

NAFLD is a prevalent disease that can progress to organ damage like liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Many animal models have demonstrated that one-carbon metabolism is strongly associated with NAFLD. Phosphatidylcholine is an important phospholipid that affects hepatic lipid homeostasis and de novo synthesis of this phospholipid is associated with NAFLD. However, one-carbon metabolism serves to support all cellular methylation reactions and catabolism of methionine, serine, glycine, choline, betaine, tryptophan, and histidine. Several different pathways within one-carbon metabolism that play important roles in regulating energy metabolism and immune function have received less attention in the study of fatty liver disease and fibrosis.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) requires an understanding of the behavior of carbon in the crust and the development of robust monitoring techniques to constrain the movement, mechanisms, and pathways for any potential CO2 leakage. Here, we examine an aquifer from the Riardo Plain (Campania Region, southern Italy), which serves as a suitable natural analogue for CO2 migration to the critical zone (i.e., shallow crust and aquifers) and as a case study to evaluate the geochemical processes that occur when CO2-saturated fluids mix with freshwater in shallow aquifers. We investigate the behavior of various geochemical constituents (major and trace elements, δ18O–H2O, δ13C-DIC, and Rn content). Water from this area has a high degree of mineralization (EC 2500–3000 μS/cm), high HCO3 - (~2.5 g/L), is saturated with respect to CaCO3, and is enriched in alkali ions (e.g., Na+ + K+). The high degree of mineralization occurs in groundwater that discharges from the basal aquifer of the Roccamonfina volcanic edifice (~6 km NW), with vast CO2 inputs that promote host rock leaching. Superficial volcanic aquifers are recharged by fresh meteoric precipitation when groundwater flows from carbonates at the edge of the plain to aquifers hosted in the southeastern slope of the Roccamonfina volcano. The presence of normal faults in this area permits natural upwelling of CO2-rich groundwater, which locally mixes with shallow freshwater present within the upper volcanic succession. Significant (R &gt; 0.8) linear correlations between conservative elements suggest that groundwater geochemistry is dominated by a mixture of two main endmembers: (i) deep/mineralized waters and (ii) shallow/diluted waters. The intrusion of freshwater to volcanic aquifers induces oxidation, leading to adsorption of select elements (e.g., As and Ba) onto Fe-oxyhydroxide precipitates within these aquifers. Geochemical modeling suggests that CO2 saturation approaches 3 g/L, which agrees with direct measurements of CO2 flux. We conclude that our conceptual geochemical model helps to constrain mixing of CO2 with freshwater and to diagnose the secondary geochemical processes that influence aqueous geochemistry within CO2-influenced groundwater. © 2020","CO2 storage; CO2-saturated groundwater; Mixing geochemical tracers; Riardo mineral waters","Aquifers; Barium compounds; Beverages; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Iron compounds; Mineralogy; Mixing; Structural geology; Trace elements; Volcanoes; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CO2 storage; Geochemical modeling; Geochemical tracer; Isotopic composition; Major and trace elements; Mineral water; Successful management; Groundwater geochemistry; aquifer; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; carbon storage; concentration (composition); geogenic source; heterogeneity; hydrogeochemistry; isotopic composition; mixing ratio; saturation; tracer; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082776598

Linfen, the city with the worst air quality in China, was taken as the research object. First, the spatiotemporal distribution of AQI and several air pollutants (i.e. PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2 and SO3) in the study area was obtained through interpolation by inverse distance weighting (IDW). Next, the overall air quality and monthly variations of the AQI and the selected pollutants in 2017 were analyzed in details. Finally, the authors probed deep into the temporal distribution, spatial distribution, and meteorological conditions during the process of severe air pollution in the study area, in the light of the data on wind speeds, wind directions and precipitation. The results show that: The AQI in Linfen was high in winter and low in summer. Two peaks were observed on the daily variation curves of AQI and main pollutants near 11:00 and 22:00, respectively. The pollutant levels have similar patterns in spatial distribution: high in southwest and low in northeast. The process of severe air pollution is mainly caused by small average wind speed, weak precipitation, high humidity, and other atmospheric conditions that impede pollutant diffusion (e.g. low altitudes of thermal inversion layer and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)), as well as stable atmospheric stratification in winter). The strong northwest airflow and precipitation are the direct reasons for the end of the process of severe air pollution. The research provides new insights into the mitigation and elimination of air pollution in industrial and mining cities. © 2020 WITPress.

In this study, two lab-scale PDN biofilter and Anammox biofilter were built up to treat simulated domestic wastewater. The results showed that stable nitrogen removal performance was kept with averaged effluent nitrogen of 10.2 mg/L. Stable nitrite accumulation performance was achieved with low abundance of nitrite reductase gene, while influent composition influenced nitrogen transformation pathway in PDN biofilter. When treating domestic wastewater, nitrification and partial denitrification led to the higher nitrite accumulation ratio of 75.4%. The percentage contribution of anammox biofilter was 74.6% for nitrogen removal, and Candidatus Brocadia was dominant genus. After long-term operation, limited substrate concentration caused interspecific competition among various anammox bacteria, leading to an increasing proportion of Candidatus Brocadia fulgida.

These oilseed fruits, which are rich in lipids, triglycerides, fatty acids, carotenoids, and other greasy compounds, can be transformed into solid, liquid, and gaseous products by different thermochemical conversion processes (conventional combustion, pyrolysis, oxy-fuel combustion, gasification and transesterification). This review investigates the different oleaginous feedstocks commonly found in the forests and plantations of Brazil – for example, olive stones, palm fruits, babassu coconut, macauba fruits, tucumã seeds and soybeans, and the respective residues generated from biofuel production and manufacturing processes. The main opportunities and challenges associated with the use of biofuels produced from these oilseed fruits lie in the fact that internal combustion engines using fossil fuels do not need to undergo modifications and mechanical adaptations to operate, and there is no corrosion risk and / or deterioration of metallic parts. Biofuels produce less greenhouse gas, or their pollution is considered neutral. Finally, the native forests of Brazil and the world present a vast number of different oleaginous species that still need be studied because they have excellent potential to be used as biofuels, as they are renewable energy sources and are sustainably eco-friendly. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","bio-oils; biorefineries; green fuels; oleaginous; thermal processes","Chemical industry; Combustion; Corrosion; Deterioration; Fatty acids; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Fruits; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Oilseeds; Pollution; Renewable energy resources; Bio oil; Biorefineries; Green fuel; oleaginous; Thermal process; Biofuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084923876

The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of urban environmental exposures (including exposure to air pollution, noise and green space) on cognitive performance and brain structure of cognitively unimpaired individuals at risk for AD. Participants and methods: The ALFA (ALzheimer and FAmilies) study is a prospective cohort of middle-age, cognitively unimpaired subjects, many of them offspring of AD patients. Cognitive performance was measured by the administration of episodic memory and executive function tests (N = 958). Structural brain imaging was performed in a subsample of participants to obtain morphological information of brain areas, specially focused on cortical thickness, known to be affected by AD (N = 228). Land Use Regression models were used to estimate residential exposure to air pollutants. The daily average noise level at the street nearest to each participant's residential address was obtained from noise maps. For each participant residential green exposure indicators, such as surrounding greenness or amount of green, were generated. General linear models were conducted to assess the association between environmental exposures, cognitive performance and brain structure in a cross-sectional analysis. Results: No significant associations were observed between urban environmental exposures and the cognitive composite (p &gt; 0.1). Higher exposure to air pollutants, but not noise, was associated with lower cortical thickness in brain regions known to be affected by AD, especially NO2 (β = −16.4; p = 0.05) and PM10 (β = −5.34; p = 0.05). On the other hand, increasing greenness indicators was associated with greater thickness in these same areas (β = 0.08; p = 0.03). Conclusion: In cognitively unimpaired adults with increased risk for AD, increased exposure to air pollution was suggested to be associated with greater global atrophy and reduced volume and thickness in specific brain areas known to be affected in AD, thus suggesting a potential link between environmental exposures and cerebral vulnerability to AD. Although more research in the field is needed, air pollution reduction is crucial for decreasing the burden of age-related disorders. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; Alzheimer's dementia; Brain structure; Cognitive performance; Green space; Noise; Prevention; Regions of interest; Risk factors; Urban environment","Air pollution; Air quality; Brain mapping; Housing; Land use; Neurodegenerative diseases; Noise pollution; Regression analysis; Alzheimer's dementia; Brain structure; Cognitive performance; Green spaces; Noise; Prevention; Regions of interest; Risk factors; Urban environments; Brain; atmospheric pollution; brain; cognition; greenspace; health risk; mental disorder; noise; noise pollution; pollution exposure; risk factor; urban area; adult; air pollution; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain; brain atrophy; cohort analysis; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); environmental exposure; episodic memory; executive function; female; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; mental performance; middle aged; neuroimaging; noise pollution; priority journal; prospective study; urban area; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; brain; cognition; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; environmental exposure; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082726519

Using the example of Australian reforms to water policy, we evaluate how different elements of policy proved more (less) successful in facilitating efficient adaptation to climate variability and thus expose elements that might be more (less) attractive as candidates for policy transfer. Overall, we find that Australian policy reforms in the water sector provide useful guidance in some instances and not others. Establishing caps on extraction, flexible water markets and individual carry over rights generally facilitated flexible and efficient adaptation, and could be transferred. Related policy concepts, like formulating clear water planning rules and entitlements, are worth considering for implementation elsewhere, even if the groundwork on governance is a prerequisite. We also note the importance of shaping drought responses from government in such a way as not to distort the incentives for individual adaptation, and there is some evidence of this working in the Australian setting. Achieving transferability of these policies, however, may be a challenge. Australian policies around ‘hard infrastructure’ investments have generally proved less desirable and ideally should not be considered as a roadmap. These relate specifically to: (1) extravagant augmentation of urban supply; (2) using infrastructure to supposedly improve irrigation efficiency for environmental water provision; and (3) governments’ infrastructure responses after flooding. None of these approaches is consistent with the aim of fostering adaptation to a more variable climatic future. Key policy insights Australian water policies that have focussed on capping water extractions, development of flexible markets and specifying rights to allow greater flexibility have generally worked well against a changing climate, and could be transferred. The development of clear planning rules and entitlements also proved important, although the conditions to favour transfer are difficult to engender. Policies dealing with hard physical infrastructure have proven problematic and their adoption elsewhere is discouraged, even if transfer is more amenable. Encouraging more individual adaptation to flooding is a particularly significant challenge, even in a country renowned for drought. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; drought policy; flood policy; policy transfer; water policy","adaptive management; drought; governance approach; infrastructural development; policy implementation; policy reform; water planning; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083640675

Agricultural producers are likely to be adversely affected by changes in higher mean temperatures, more frequent extreme climatic events, and an increase in inter-annual weather variability, with implications for established management practices. While probabilities of future change in key climatic variables become more refined, significant uncertainties remain, complicating efforts at adaptation action on the ground. Adaptation pathways planning allows stakeholders to consider a range of possible futures, identify and evaluate adaptation options, and sequence them over time. The aim is to have a robust plan that is flexible enough to deliver desired outcomes regardless of how the future unfolds. We developed and applied a pathways approach to support regional adaptation planning in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, a premier food- and wine-producing region, where changing land use, competition for freshwater, and climate change, are presenting challenges to agricultural producers and rural communities. Working with a range of stakeholders from local government, community and the region's diverse agricultural sectors, comparative case study analysis in two catchments is used to identify values relating to productive landscapes, likely impacts of climate change and potential adaptation options at the local level. Actions for key areas of decision making were evaluated and sequenced over time, providing the basis for a regional adaptation pathway. The results highlight the complex interaction between climatic and non-climatic drivers of change at the local and regional scale, and the need to closely consider trade-offs and synergies in any adaptations. With adaptation rapidly emerging as a priority for policy-making and practice, the results can help inform and empower stakeholders to implement actions towards climate adapted futures, and demonstrate the utility of pathways approaches for local- and regional planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Decision making; Resilience; Uncertainty; Vulnerability","agriculture; aquifer; Article; biotic stress; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; community; decision making; drought; ecosystem resilience; environmental planning; environmental policy; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; evolutionary adaptation; freshwater environment; government; grazing; high temperature; land use; landscape; New Zealand; nonhuman; priority journal; rural population; soil moisture; stakeholder engagement; warming; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079898930

This special issue hosts 10 studies undertaken in 7 countries of 4 continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. The issue provides a wide spectrum of natural and artificial case-studies and covers a broad range of climatic conditions. Most of the studies adopted a modelling (50%) or a field (40%) approach and focused on water-quantity (60%), while the remaining were equally subdivided between water-quality and biogeochemistry. Forty percent of the papers directly face climate change. The diversity of approaches and case studies is the main aspect characterizing this special issue. Despite this high diversification, in relation to water-quantity related issues, we can identify the following messages: high attention to extreme meteorological events, drought in particular, even in regions once considered rich in water (e.g., northern Italy); fragility of agricultural and water supply systems in the face of extreme weather events, in particular in low-income countries (e.g., Madagascar); more attention to climate change compared to land cover/use change but importance of natural land cover to efficiently face the incoming climate change, in particular, in agriculture ecosystems. From a water quality biogeochemistry point of view, we can point out: sensitivity of lakes to climate change with the risk of biodiversity loss; need to reduce nutrient loads to mitigate eutrophication related problems, exacerbated by climate change; in particular, reduction of nitrogen loads from agriculture run-off, to reduce N2O emissions in large-shallow Chinese environments. © 2020 by the authors.","Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; Irrigation; Land surface processes; Microbial contamination; Nitrification-denitrification; Phytoplankton community; Run-off forecast; Water level regulation; Water supply; Water yield",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085910621

We discuss the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental effects of shuttering the tournament and suggest that an understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to bring about an alternative, more sustainable sports tourism economy. The cancellation of March Madness resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in tourism revenue for local economies and deprived traveler-fans of pilgrimages to arenas, important socio-cultural gathering spaces for American basketball fans. However, it also prevented the emission of a sizable quantity of greenhouse gasses based on our carbon footprint calculated from the previous year’s tournament. Ultimately, from the disruptive closing down of sport and event tourism, a post-pandemic sports tourism landscape should emerge that takes more seriously the triple-bottom line notion of balancing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the creation and maintenance of resilient local economies all while both acknowledging the important role sport plays in society and keeping tourism actors healthy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon footprint; coronavirus; COVID-19; local economies; sport; Sustainable tourism","COVID-19; economic impact; epidemic; health status; respiratory disease; sport; sustainability; tourism economics; tourism market; viral disease; United States; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084854971

This is expected because of known diversity effects on ecosystem functions, and impacts of historical events such as past climatic changes on plant diversity. However, empirical evidence for a link between biogeographic history and present-day ecosystem functioning is still limited. Here, we explored the relationships between Late-Quaternary climate instability, species-pool size, local species and functional diversity, and the net primary productivity (NPP) of Northern Hemisphere forests using structural equation modelling. Our study confirms that past climate instability has negative effects on plant functional diversity and through that on NPP, after controlling for present-day climate, soil conditions, stand biomass and age. We conclude that global models of terrestrial plant productivity need to consider the biogeographical context to improve predictions of plant productivity and feedbacks with the climate system. © 2020 The Authors.

To this end, a thorough understanding of the thermal losses associated with HT-ATES is crucial. We provide in this study a numerical investigation of the thermal performance of an HT-ATES system for a heterogeneous aquifer modelled after a well-defined region in the Greater Geneva Basin (Switzerland), where the excess heat produced by a nearby waste-to-energy plant is available for storage. We consider different aquifer properties and flow conditions, with complex injection strategies that respect maximum/minimum well pressures and temperatures, as well as legal regulations. Based on the results, we also draw conclusions on the economical feasibility (e.g., energy recovery factor vs. drilling costs) for the different strategies. Our results indicate that the true behaviour of HT-ATES systems may deviate significantly from theoretical performance derived from idealised cases. This is particularly true when the operational pressure and temperature ranges of the wells are restricted, and for heterogeneous aquifers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Greater Geneva Basin; HT-ATES; Numerical Modelling","Heat storage; Hydrogeology; Laws and legislation; Numerical models; Thermal energy; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Greater Geneva Basin; Heterogeneous aquifers; HT-ATES; Numerical investigations; Pressure and temperature; Theoretical performance; Waste-to-energy plants; Aquifers; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy use; high temperature; numerical model; P-T conditions; performance assessment; thermal structure; Geneva [Switzerland]; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075620526

However, perovskite-based catalysts still have limitations in performances due to their low surface area and electrical conductivity. Herein, double perovskite (NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ, NBSCF) is synthesized and embedded into porous, hollow nanostructured Co3O4, showing excellent activity for OER. Synergistic effect between hollow-net Co3O4 and NBSCF is demonstrated by considerably increased BET surface area (1.2 → 65.1 m2‧g−1) and high ratio of multivalent Co oxidation state (Co3+/Co2+ and Co3+/Co4+), leading to high performance of Co3O4/NBSCF for OER and ORR. Furthermore, hybridization of Co3O4/NBSCF compound in 3D architectures with conductive polyaniline and N-doped carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxides (NCNT/NrGO) further boosts oxygen electrode activity (0.80 V) in alkaline media because of improved electrical conductivity and mass transport of oxygen species. In particular, NCNT/NrGO-Co3O4/NBSCF-PANI (NNCNP) hybrid catalysts show 0.80 V at near half-wave potential (−3 mA‧cm−2) and 1.60 V at 10 mA‧cm−2 for ORR and OER, respectively, indicating excellent intrinsic OER/ORR kinetics of NNCNP. In addition, after 1,000th voltammetric cycle testing for OER and 10,000th cycle testing for ORR, the least performance decay is observed among synthesized catalysts, demonstrating that NNCNP is an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bifunctional electrocatalyst; Co3O4; Double perovskite; Oxygen electrode activity; Oxygen evolution reaction; Oxygen reduction reaction","Barium compounds; Carbon nanotubes; Doping (additives); Electric conductivity; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Graphene; Iron compounds; Oxygen; Oxygen evolution reaction; Oxygen reduction reaction; Perovskite; Polyaniline; Strontium compounds; Bifunctional electrocatalysts; Co3O4; Conductive polyaniline; Double perovskites; Electrical conductivity; Half-wave potential; Oxygen electrode; Voltammetric cycles; Neodymium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077917424

XRD analysis evidenced pure single phases exhibiting characteristic luminescence of Eu3+ or Pr3+ ions when excited under UV or blue radiations. Samples gave rise to intense orange-red emission and quite white emission in the case of respectively Eu3+ or Pr3+ doped samples. Optical properties are discussed in the frame of Judd-Ofelt theory and considering that an energy transfer occurs between active ions. Notably it was found that the quantum-cutting by a two-step energy transfer from Gd3+ to Eu3+ can improve the red emission of Eu3+ ions under near-VUV excitation. Such quantum-cutting mechanism has been also considered in the case of Pr3+ doped β-NaGdF4. However, the efficiency of both processes in comparison with literature suggest that only one part of the energy in the excited states within Gd3+ can be transferred to Eu3+ for its red emission. In the case of Pr3+ ions, the energy is more probably released through the self-trapped exciton emission certainly due to the lack of resonant VUV excitation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fluorides; Judd-Ofelt theory; Luminescence; Nanorods","Coprecipitation; Energy transfer; Excitons; Fluorine compounds; Judd-Ofelt theory; Luminescence; Nanorods; Optical properties; Positive ions; Trapped ions; Blue radiations; Fluorides; Quantum cutting; Rapid co-precipitation; Red emissions; Self trapped excitons; VUV excitation; White emissions; Praseodymium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078757545

The most rapid changes caused by temperature and soil moisture alternations or the by the inflow of fresh organic matter occur during the several hours or days. They are mostly related to the soil microbial activity. Seasonal dynamics are caused by annual variations in temperature and precipitation that affect the microbial community directly or indirectly through the regulation of plant life. The microbial biomass and the taxonomic composition of soil microbial communities vary significantly throughout the year, which should be taken into account when sampling for a comparative analysis of different soils. The long-term dynamics of microbial communities during primary or secondary successions lead to an increase in the total microbial biomass and the fungi/bacteria ratio, as well as to changes in the taxonomic composition of microbial communities. The main factors of the long-term dynamics are the accumulation of soil organic matter, plant successions, and changes in pH. The diversity of microbial communities during long-term dynamics can vary in different ways and does not follow a single trend. The longest dynamics of soil microbial communities are associated with changes in bioclimatic conditions. Information about soil microbial communities of the past can be obtained by studying buried and permafrost soils. The study of future changes in soil microbial communities is possible in experiments with artificial changes in climatic parameters. Plants are a significant factor in the dynamics of soil microbial communities on all timescales; in short-term periods, the major role is played by the activity of plants; in the long-term trends, the changes in the vegetation abundance and diversity are the most important factors. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","biodiversity; biomass; paleosols; seasonal dynamics; soil formation; successions","microbial activity; microbial community; paleosol; permafrost; soil microorganism; soil moisture; soil organic matter; temperature effect; timescale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085580217

Their financial development can reduce energy consumption (through energy-efficient technologies) and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones. Gas turbine engines are widely used in transport and industry. To improve their economic attractiveness and to reduce harmful emissions, including greenhouse gases, alternative fuels and waste heat recovery technologies can be used. A promising direction is the use of alcohol and thermo-chemical recuperation. The purpose of this study is to estimate the economic efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions of an alcohol-fueled regenerative gas turbine engine with thermochemical recuperation. The carbon dioxide emissions have been determined using engine efficiency, fuel properties, as well as life cycle analysis. The engine efficiency was maximized by varying the water/alcohol ratio. To evaluate steam fuel reforming for a certain engine, a conversion performance factor has been suggested. At the optimal water/methanol ratio of 3.075 this technology can increase efficiency by 4% and reduce tank-to-wake emission by 80%. In the last 6 months of 2019, methanol prices were promising for power and cogeneration plants in remote locations. The policy recommendation is that local authorities should pay attention to alcohol fuel and advanced turbines to curb the adverse effects of burning petroleum fuel on economic growth and the environment. © 2020 by the authors.

However, recycled building materials (RBMs) have no required standard of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. This study was mainly about the assessment of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), as well as carbonyls emissions from recycled building materials, including gypsum board (GB), calcium silicate board (CSB), fiber cement board (FCB), class I built wall tile (WT), and waterproof gypsum board (WGB). The highest initial and final levels of BTEX were observed on CSB, followed by GB and FCB, and no detectable BTEX were observed on WT and WGB. Benzene was with the highest level among all identified BTEX. Emissions of carbonyls were observed on all materials. The highest initial and final levels of carbonyls were observed on GB, followed by FCB and CSB, while the lowest ones were detected on WT and WGB. The final (96-h) steady-state emissions of BTEX from GB and CSB were 9 and 37 times those from conventional pairs and 27 and 41 times those from low-VOC pairs. Similarly, the final steady-state emissions of carbonyls from GB and CSB were 4.8 and 1.3 times those from conventional pairs and 16 and 2.5 times those from low-VOC pairs. The requirement of evaluation standard for VOC emissions from RBMs is highly recommended to protect consumers.

Shanxi Province is the only pilot area with provincial trading market for industrial soot and dust emissions. This paper investigates the effect of Shanxi Pilot emission trading scheme on industrial soot and dust emissions by using the synthetic control method. The idea behind the synthetic control approach is to construct a combination of comparison cities to approximate the emission paths that the cities in Shanxi would have experienced in the absence of the pilot emission trading scheme. We demonstrate that, following Shanxi Pilot emission trading scheme, industrial soot and dust emissions fell markedly in Taiyuan, Datong, and Linfen relative to the synthetic counterparts. The finding that emission trading scheme can help achieve emission reduction targets is shown to be robust to the reduction in the number of control units, placebo tests, and difference-in-differences estimation. © The Author(s) 2019.","China; emission reduction; industrial soot and dust emissions; Pilot emission trading scheme; synthetic control method","Commerce; Emission control; Soot; China; Dust emission; Emission reduction; Emission trading scheme; Synthetic control; Dust; design; dust; emission control; emissions trading; industrial emission; policy analysis; soot; targeting; China; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074043149

However, as a nanoparticle, the effects of MCB on plant cell morphology and microbial communities in Cd-contaminated soil are poorly understood. This study, through greenhouse experiments, investigated the effects of MCB as an amendment for 5 mg·kg-1 Cd-contaminated soil on plant growth, plant cellular morphogenesis, and microbial communities. Two types of plants, metal-tolerant plant ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), and hyperaccumulator plant chard (Beta vulgaris L. var. cicla) were selected. The results indicated that adding MCB to Cd-contaminated soil, the dry biomass of shoot ryegrass and chard increased by 1.07 and 1.05 times, respectively, comparing with control group (the treatment without MCB). Meanwhile, the physiological characteristics of plant root denoted that adding MCB reduced the damage caused by Cd to plants. The acid phosphatase activity of soils treated with MBC was higher and the dehydrogenase activity was lower than control group during whole 50 days of incubation, while the urease and catalase activity of soils treated with MBC were higher than control group after 25 days of incubation. When compared with the treatment without MCB, the abundances of nitrogen-functional bacteria (Rhodospirillum and Nitrospira) and phosphorus-functional bacteria (Bradyrhizobium and Flavobacterium) increased but that of nitrogen-functional bacteria, Nitrososphaera, declined. The presence of MCB resulted in increased microbial community abundance by reducing the bioavailability of heavy metals in soil, while increasing the abundance of plants by increasing the amount of available nitrogen in soil. The result of this study suggests that MCB could be applied to the in-situ immobilization of heavy metal in contaminated soils because of its beneficial effects on plants growth, root cellular morphogenesis, and microbial community. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cd-contaminated soil; Chard; Microbial diversity; Nanoscale carbon black; Ryegrass","bioavailability; biomass; cell component; contaminated land; grass; growth; heavy metal; immobilization; microbial activity; microbial community; morphology; nanoparticle; root system; Beta vulgaris; Beta vulgaris cicla; Bradyrhizobium; Flavobacterium; Labrus; Lolium; Lolium multiflorum; Nitrospira; Rhodospirillum; cadmium; biomass; bioremediation; chemistry; microflora; morphogenesis; plant root; soil; soil pollutant; soot; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Cadmium; Microbiota; Morphogenesis; Plant Roots; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082800263

Wind power is greatly affected by climate change, and the increase or decrease of wind speed directly affects wind energy production. Based on the numerical simulation results from a high-resolution (~ 25 km) regional climate model PRECIS, we analyze the changes of future wind speed and wind power potential in the ""Three North"" (TN) region in China. Firstly, we verify whether the PRECIS can capture the current spatiotemporal patterns in simulating the wind speed compared with observation (CN05.1). The results show PRECIS has a good ability in reproducing the spatiotemporal patterns of wind speed in the eastern part of the TN region, but still has great uncertainty in the northwest. In the future, the projected wind power density in the TN region will increase by about 0.7% in the middle of the 21st century, but will drop significantly in the end of the century (about-3.32%). Furthermore, Wind power density will increase significantly in winter. However, the wind speed in spring and summer will generally decrease. It is predicted that most of the Northwest (NW) and North (N) will have strong inter-annual variability in the middle of this century, and will be more stable at the end of this century. It should be noted that the potential of wind energy in Northeast (NE) will grow steadily in this century, which will have certain guiding significance for future wind power planning in this region. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; PRECIS; Region; Three north; Wind energy potential","annual variation; carbon emission; climate modeling; electricity industry; energy planning; regional climate; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; wind power; wind velocity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085663730

The high salinity (~ 45 mS/cm) of the undiluted wastewater completely inhibited the biogas production. An acclimation strategy involving gradient dilution of the molasses wastewater was implemented to gradually increase the salt stress. Consequently, the biogas production was recovered, inhibited only slightly by the high salinity of the undiluted wastewater. The reactor steadily achieved a high total organic carbon (TOC) loading rate of 5 g/L/day, with approximately 60% TOC removal efficiency. Acclimation to the gradually increased salt stress leads to a relative abundance of some halotolerant microbes, such as bacteria from Arcobacter, Tissierella, and Ruminococcaceae, which increased as their hydrolytic and acidogenic abilities adjusted to the incremental increase in salinity. Additionally, hydrogenotrophic methanogens, especially Methanoculleus, showed greater resistance to hypersalinity than aceticlastic methanogens. These results suggest that acclimation of the fermentation microbial community to hypersalinity is an effective strategy to improve methane production from hypersaline molasses wastewater in thermophilic UAF reactors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acclimation; High salinity; Microbial community; Molasses wastewater; Thermophilic methane fermentation; Upflow anaerobic filter","Bacteria; Biogas; Fermentation; Filters (for fluids); Methanogens; Organic carbon; Acclimation; Anaerobic filters; High salinity; Methane fermentation; Microbial communities; Molasses wastewater; Methane; biogas; methane; molasses; RNA 16S; methane; Arcobacter; Article; biofuel production; community structure; dilution; fermentation; high throughput sequencing; hydrolysis; Methanoculleus; methanogenic archaeon; microbial community; nonhuman; population abundance; RNA sequencing; Ruminococcaceae; salinity; salt stress; salt tolerance; temperature acclimatization; thermophilic bacterium; total organic carbon; waste water management; anaerobic growth; bacterium; bioreactor; chemistry; classification; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbial consortium; microbiology; salinity; waste water; Anaerobiosis; Bacteria; Bioreactors; Methane; Microbial Consortia; Molasses; Salinity; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078885279

In this study, a set of parameters were designed for PV AC, including PV capacity, AC parameter, and inverter parameter. Then, the parameters were applied to a 20-m2 office building, and a PV AC system test platform was built. The test lasted for one year; the corresponding data including typical daily data and annual data were collected and analyzed. The results show that the PV AC system quickly decreases or increases the room temperature by ~9.5% and 17% in 1 h of cooling and heating periods, respectively, thus maintaining the room temperature within the set temperature range of ±0.9 °C. The data also show that by proper design of parameters, a PV AC system can satisfy the electricity demand of AC. In the cooling period, heating period, and annual operation conditions, the PV system provided 114%, 73%, and 188% of the energy for the AC system, respectively. Next, economic calculations show that PV AC is suitable for office buildings.

Carbon dot-based fluorescence probes are the most likely candidates to fulfil such an application, as they possess excellent chemical inertness, low cytotoxicity, high resistance to photobleaching, good biocompatibility, and tuneable emission wavelength. Our research program aims to develop tailor-designed red emissive carbon dots (r-CDs) using technology innovations in synthetic strategies. The r-CDs showing responses to pH were prepared through direct calcination of 1,2,4-triaminobenzene as the only carbon source. Measurements of fluorescent emission wavelength and quantum yield were carried out to optimize the carbonized temperature and heating time. The obtained r-CDs can sensitively respond to pH both in colorimetric and fluorometric modes, namely, with the increase of pH from 4.0 to 8.0, the color of the r-CD solution under ambient light changed from red to orange and then to yellow, and the corresponding fluorescence varied from purple to orange then to yellow under UV irradiation, which can be easily observed by the naked eye. Experimental characterization along with density functional theory (DFT) simulation study reveal that the pH response originates from the reversible transformation between azo and quinone structures during the protonation process. This solid-state preparation is not only simple in procedures and ready to scale up production, more significantly the resulting r-CDs exhibit a number of distinct advantages, and have great potential for biological sensing applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2020.",,"Biocompatibility; Calcination; Carbon; Cell death; Citrus fruits; Fluorescence; Irradiation; Metabolism; pH sensors; Photobleaching; Quinone; Emission wavelength; Experimental characterization; Fluorescence probes; Fluorescent emission; Real time monitoring; Reversible transformation; Synthetic strategies; Technology innovation; Density functional theory; 1,2,4 triaminobenzene; aniline; carbon; carbon dots; fluorescent dye; quinone derivative; unclassified drug; Article; biocompatibility; calcination temperature; carbon source; cell metabolism; chemical composition; colorimetry; controlled study; cytotoxicity; density functional theory; fluorescence; fluorometry; heating; human; human cell; pH; priority journal; protonation; quantum yield; solid state; solubility; ultraviolet irradiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084433392

(epigeic) and Pontoscolex corethrurus (endogeic) that reside at and below the soil surface and primarily rely on litter and/or soil organic matter as a food source, in two different subtropical monoculture plantations. We found that Amynthas sp. disappeared and the density and biomass of Pontoscolex corethrurus was significantly reduced under litter removal treatment, whether roots were removed or not. In contrast, root removal had no significant impact on the density and biomass of both earthworm species.

Most related studies have utilized global models to investigate the factors influencing transport sector carbon dioxide emissions from the provincial level to the national level. However, this approach cannot depict the spatial nonstationary characteristics of the influencing factors. Taking the taxi subsector in Eastern China as a case study, we employed exploratory spatial data analysis to examine the spatial heterogeneity of carbon dioxide emissions from taxis (CDET) at the city level and a local model (geographically weighted regression, GWR) to observe the spatial variation in the factors influencing emissions. The results showed that the spatial distribution of CDET was uneven across the study region; the provincial-level cities and metropolises had the highest level of carbon dioxide emissions. The variables gross domestic product (GDP), total population (TP) and urban built-up area (UBA) were among the most significant determinants of emissions. Moreover, using the GWR technique instead of conventional global models, we successfully detected variation in the relationships between emissions and factors at the city level. The GWR results revealed that the positive correlation between CDET and GDP was distributed throughout the study area in 2005 and 2014, but the value of the regression coefficient did not remain the same across the study area. Both positive and negative effects of TP and UBA on CDET were identified and mapped in both study years. Based on the results, we strongly recommend that differentiated mitigation measures be adopted to reduce CDET emissions for different cities according to the spatial variation in emissions and the factors that impact them.

Here, we establish the carbon networks of eight global cities by tracking the carbon exchanges between various natural and economic components. The metabolic properties of these carbon networks are compared by combining flow-based and interpretative network metrics. We further assess the relations of these carbon metabolic properties of cities with their socioeconomic attributes that are deemed important in urban development and planning. We find that, although there is a large difference in city-level carbon balance and flow pattern, a similarity in intercomponent relationships and metabolic characteristicsdoes exist. Cities with lower per capita carbon emissions tend to have healthier metabolic systems with more cooperative resource allocation among various industries, which indicates that there may be synergy between urban decarbonization and carbon-containing resource system optimization. A combination of indicators from flow balance and network models is a promising scheme for linking sector-based carbon inventories to system-based simulations of carbon management efforts. With this done, we may be able to reduce the knowledge gap with respect to how various carbon flows in cities can be concertedly managed considering both the restraint from their climate mitigation goals as well as the impact on urban social and economic development. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Economic and social effects; Economics; Flow patterns; Metabolism; Urban growth; Carbon containing; Carbon inventories; Carbon management; Climate mitigations; Economic components; Metabolic properties; Social and economic development; Technical activities; Carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon balance; carbon budget; economic activity; knowledge; mitigation; optimization; resource allocation; socioeconomic conditions; urban development; urban planning; Article; biogeochemical cycle; biomass production; carbon balance; carbon cycle; carbon footprint; carbon metabolism; controlled study; economic development; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; resource allocation; resource management; socioeconomics; urban area; city; city planning; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Economic Development; Urban Renewal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084271527

To protect the concrete from freezing or excessively long maturation during the hardening process, contractors use curing measures. Different types of curing measures have different effects on construction duration, cost, and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, to maximize their sustainability and financial benefits, contractors need to select the appropriate curing measures against different weather conditions. However, there is still a lack of efficient decision support tools for selecting the optimal curing measures, considering the temperature conditions and effects on construction performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a Modeling-Automation-Decision Support (MADS) framework and tool to help contractors select curing measures to optimize performance in terms of duration, cost, and CO2 emissions under prevailing temperatures. The developed framework combines a concrete maturity analysis (CMA) tool, a discrete event simulation (DES), and a decision support module to select the best curing measures. The CMA tool calculates the duration of concrete curing needed to reach the required strength, based on the chosen curing measures and anticipated weather conditions. The DES simulates all construction activities to provide input for the CMA and uses the CMA results to evaluate construction performance. To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a software prototype was developed and tested on a case study in Sweden. The results show that the developed framework can efficiently propose solutions that significantly reduce curing duration and CO2 emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Cold climate; Concrete maturity analysis; Curing measures; Decision support; Discrete event simulation","carbon emission; climate conditions; concrete; decision support system; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; optimization; performance assessment; software; sustainability; China; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085985324

This paper introduced an integrated approach to determine the major factors influencing irrigation water consumption in China. It combined multiple linear regression and principal component analysis to analyze the relationship between irrigation water consumption and influencing factors and then applied analytic hierarchy process and cluster analysis to analyze the spatial variation in driving factors of irrigation water consumption. Based on statistical data from the 31 provinces of China from 2000 to 2015, the results showed that irrigation water consumption was positively affected by the planting size, the ratio of surface water in water consumption (RSW), the planting structure, the annual ET0 (AE) and the annual average temperature (AAT); in contrast, consumption was generally negatively affected by irrigation technique, economic development, and annual rainfall (AR). The water consumption structure, irrigation technique and planting structure were major influential factors in most provinces of China, and there were significant differences in different regions; thus, regions should be restructured to be studied as subregions. For the total consumption of irrigation water, Central China was mainly affected by the water consumption structure, irrigation technique and climatic conditions, and North and Northwest China were hardly influenced by planting structure. Northeast, Southwest and southeastern coastal China were slightly affected by climatic conditions. For the per unit area irrigation water consumption, Central China was mainly affected by the water consumption structure, irrigation technique, planting size and climatic conditions, Southwest, South, East and Northeast China were mainly affected by the planting structure and planting size, and Northwest and North China were mainly influenced by the irrigation technique, water consumption structure and planting size. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Analytic hierarchy process; Cluster analysis; Driving force analysis; Irrigation water consumption; Regression-PCA model","Analytic hierarchy process; Cluster analysis; Linear regression; Principal component analysis; Surface waters; Water management; Water supply; Driving force analysis; Effective management; Influential factors; Integrated approach; Irrigation waters; Multiple linear regressions; PCA model; Principal component regression analysis; Irrigation; analytical hierarchy process; cluster analysis; factor analysis; integrated approach; irrigation; principal component analysis; regression analysis; spatial variation; water stress; water use; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080985984

This paper documents a 2-month voluntary monitoring campaign with students attending the environmental club of the Spring Valley High School in urban Las Vegas, Nevada. The students wore low-cost sensors to log their exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters &lt; 2.5 μm) at 5-min temporal resolution throughout the school hours. Calibrations of these sensors as well as concurrent outdoor monitors were traceable to the official air monitoring network. On a daily basis, the collective exposure among the students generally tracked the outdoor PM2.5 levels (r2 = 0.55), but the ratio of personal over outdoor exposure (P/O ratio) varied by student, ranging from 1.1 ± 0.6 to 1.9 ± 1.2, consistent with the indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios for naturally-ventilated classrooms with substantial indoor sources. The personal exposure showed impacts of short-term, acute events, which were not observed outdoors and likely resulted from resuspension of particles due to students’ movements, particularly during class breaks. Such indoor sources could have dominated PM2.5 exposure when outdoor air is clean. Improving air filtration and surface cleaning for the classrooms are recommended to lower students’ exposure to particulate air pollution. The personal monitoring protocol established in this study may be expanded to different pollutants and integrated into many schools’ science curricula to generate much-needed exposure data and increase air quality awareness among schoolchildren. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","children’s health; Indoor air quality; Personal cloud; Personal exposure assessment; Personal/outdoor ratio; Wearable sensor","air quality; atmospheric pollution; child health; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; sensor; Las Vegas Valley; Nevada; Spring Valley; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084660489

Some cities have started compiling EIs, often following a global community protocol. However, EIs are often difficult to systematically examine because of the ways they were compiled (data collection and emission calculation) and reported (sector definition and direct vs consumption). In addition, such EI estimates are not readily applicable to objective evaluation using modeling and observations due to the lack of spatial emission extents. City emission estimates used in the science community are often based on downscaled gridded EIs, while the accuracy of the downscaled emissions at city level is not fully assessed. Results: This study attempts to assess the utility of the downscaled emissions at city level. We collected EIs from 14 major global cities and compare them to the estimates from a global high-resolution fossil fuel CO2 emission data product (ODIAC) commonly used in the science research community. We made necessary adjustments to the estimates to make our comparison as reasonable as possible. We found that the two methods produce very close area-wide emission estimates for Shanghai and Delhi (&lt; 10% difference), and reach good consistency in half of the cities examined (&lt; 30% difference). The ODIAC dataset exhibits a much higher emission compared to inventory estimates in Cape Town (+ 148%), Sao Paulo (+ 43%) and Beijing (+ 40%), possibly related to poor correlation between nightlight intensity with human activity, such as the high-emission and low-lighting industrial parks in developing countries. On the other hand, ODIAC shows lower estimates in Manhattan (-62%), New York City (-45%), Washington D.C. (-42%) and Toronto (-33%), all located in North America, which may be attributable to an underestimation of residential emissions from heating in ODIAC's nightlight-based approach, and an overestimation of emission from ground transportation in registered vehicles statistics of inventory estimates. Conclusions: The relatively good agreement suggests that the ODIAC data product could potentially be used as a first source for prior estimate of city-level CO2 emission, which is valuable for atmosphere CO2 inversion modeling and comparing with satellite CO2 observations. Our compilation of in-boundary emission estimates for 14 cities contributes towards establishing an accurate inventory in-boundary global city carbon emission dataset, necessary for accountable local climate mitigation policies in the future. © 2020 The Author(s).","City CO2 emissions; Emission inventory; Fossil fuel CO2 emissions; In-boundary; ODIAC","accuracy assessment; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; correlation; data set; emission inventory; fossil fuel; satellite data; Beijing [China]; Brazil; Canada; Cape Town; China; Delhi; District of Columbia; France; Ile de France; India; Kansas; Manhattan; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Paris; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Shanghai; South Africa; Toronto; United States; Ville de Paris; Washington [District of Columbia]; Western Cape",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085300593

Space heating in northern China involves substantial fossil fuel combustion that produces haze-generating pollutants. In order to improve the atmospheric environment, it is necessary to quantitatively analyze the pollutants generated by such heating. In this study, the emission factors of several common heat sources, such as combined heat and power (CHP), boilers, rural biomass stoves, and scattered coal-heating are analyzed and classified into direct emissions and indirect emissions. Direct emissions refer to all emissions generated locally by the heat source due to fuel combustion, whereas indirect emissions are those generated elsewhere by the heat source due to electricity consumption. The “2 + 26” cities are then divided into six small urban agglomerations by cluster analysis, and the heat supply of various heat sources are investigated. Finally, the pollutant emission intensity due to heating is calculated per unit land area for each small urban agglomeration in 2016.

This study proposes a dual risk aversion optimization method – an energy water nexus system model, which can generate robust optimization solutions for water resource consumption, fossil energy resource allocation, electricity expansion and generation, electricity import, and analyze the effects of different policies and measures on energy and water nexus systems, as well as explore cost-effective plans for energy and water resources conservation and CO2 emissions reduction. The developed model can tackle the uncertain parameters shown as fuzzy sets and stochastic, control the feasibility robustness of the generated solution by capturing the risk of violating the objective and the constraints caused by stochastic and fuzzy uncertain parameters, as well as tackle issues of multi-objective tradeoffs of energy-water nexus systems. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was used to verify the proposed model, and the generated results indicate that: (i) the water resource consumption for electricity power generation is expected to increase by 10.29%–11.41% over the study horizon; (ii) coal-based power will be the major source of CO2 emissions, accounting for 95.55%–90.59%; (iii) promoting carbon tax and optimizing the electric power mix are effective measures for saving water and coal resources and mitigating CO2 emissions, but lead to higher system costs. The obtained results provide useful information for managers to balance the conflict among electricity demand, economic objective, and water resource shortage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Dual risk aversion optimization; Energy-related water use; Energy-water nexus systems; Policies discussion","Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Cost effectiveness; Economic geology; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Optimization; Risk assessment; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Water conservation; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; CO2 emissions; Energy and water systems; Feasibility robustness; Fuzzy uncertain parameters; Policies and measures; Risk aversion; Water use; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079011684

Fresh catalysts contained hard-to-reduce lattice Co2+/[Co-OH]+ ions and showed activity proportional to the concentration of these species. The NO conversion was accompanied by steam-generating methane oxidation. Under the arising hydrothermal conditions, a fraction of Co ions transformed into Co-oxo species especially in catalysts of high Co content (Co/AlF &gt; 0.3), resulting in boosted activity in NO2-forming catalytic NO oxidation. The increased NO2 concentration brought about higher concentration of surface cobalt nitrate species responsible for the rate-determining methane activation, so the overall rate of the NO–SCR reaction was also accelerated. Steam admixed to the feed decreased the conversion of methane more significantly than that of NO. Its observed high hydrothermal stability renders the Co-SSZ-13 catalyst a very promising candidate for the CH4/NO–SCR reaction. © 2020 The Author(s)","Co,H-SSZ-13; NO–SCR by CH4; Operando-DRIFTS; Solid state ion exchange","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Chlorine compounds; Cobalt compounds; Cobalt deposits; Ion exchange; Ions; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Zeolites; Catalytic functions; Conversion of methanes; Hydrothermal conditions; Hydrothermal stabilities; Methane activation; Operando-DRIFTS; Selective catalytic reduction of NO; Solid state ion exchange; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082020435

However, the highly capacitive behavior of carbon-based solid-state capacitors is restricted by the incompatible characteristics of the highly accessible surface area, efficient ion transport paths and superior electrical conductivity in carbonaceous electrodes. Herein, we propose a facile, effective strategy for the preparation of N/O dual-doped microporous carbon nanosheets (NMCNSs) with a 3D microstructure to solve the mutual competitiveness of necessary features for highly capacitive carbons. This strategy is a simple, template-free one-step heat-treatment process of organic salts, which combines the self-activation by thein situformed activating agent to generate developed microporosity and the synergistic effect of gas blowing to hinder the aggregation of carbon sheets. The resulting NMCNSs exhibit an interconnected nonaggregated sheet-like morphology, a high surface area of 1900.5 m2g−1with an exceptionally large microporosity of 93%, and multiscale micropore systems with ultramicropores of 0.45-0.80 nm and supermicropores of 0.85-1.58 nm. The assembled NMCNS-based symmetric aqueous supercapacitors present a remarkable capacitive performance in KOH and Na2SO4electrolytes. Meanwhile, we compare their electrochemical capacitive behaviors in various electrolytes and summarize a valuable reference for the potential application of NMCNS electrodes in different system supercapacitors. The constructed flexible NMCNS-based solid-state capacitors exhibit an excellent capacitive performance including high energy density, superb rate capability and outstanding long-term cycle stability. More importantly, the devices also possess an exceptional mechanical and thermal robustness, which can normally work under consecutive high bending cycles and at various ambient temperatures of 0-50 °C. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Carbon; Chemical activation; Electric power systems; Electrochemical electrodes; Field effect transistors; Flexible electronics; Morphology; Nanosheets; Potassium hydroxide; Sodium compounds; Supercapacitor; Accessible surface areas; Capacitive behavior; Capacitive performance; Electrical conductivity; High energy densities; Micro-porous carbons; One-step heat treatments; Power supply devices; Microporosity; electrical conductivity; electronic equipment; energy efficiency; energy storage; microstructure; nanomaterial; porous medium; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084524399

Background: We sought New Zealand ophthalmologists' opinions on climate change, sustainability and the role of ophthalmologists in responding to these issues, as well as information on the extent that ophthalmology practices are acting on sustainability. Design: Anonymous online survey of New Zealand fellows and trainees (178) of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) was conducted. Participants: Forty-seven respondents (response rate 26%) were included in the study. Methods: Respondents were asked their level of agreement with statements on climate, health and sustainability and invited to comment. Current sustainability activities were collected from clinical leaders and directors of hospital departments and private practices. Main Outcome Measure: Distribution of agreement scores was the main outcome measure. Results: Agreement with mainstream positions on climate change was as expected. A minority of up to 19% expressed the opinion that climate change was not due to human activity, and did not require mitigation. Younger ophthalmologists tended to have greater agreement with the need for broad-based political action on climate mitigation than those aged over 50 years. Most practices had room to improve on reducing waste, travel and carbon footprints. Conclusions and Relevance: The majority of New Zealand ophthalmologists are concerned about anthropogenic climate change. Currently, sustainability is not a performance indicator for New Zealand district health boards, so there is limited incentive to drive improvements.

We interpret global storylines into South Korean contexts: Shared Socio-economic Pathway 1 (SSP1), SSP2, and SSP3 for population, economy, and land use. SSP elements and proxies were identified and elaborated through stakeholder participatory workshops, demand survey on potential users, past trends, and recent national projections of major proxies. Twenty-nine proxies were quantified using sector-specific models and downscaled where possible. Socio-economic and climate scenarios matrixes enable one to quantify the contribution of climate, population, economic development, and land-use change in future climate change impacts. Economic damage between climate scenarios is different in SSPs, and it highlights that SSPs are one of the key components for future climate change impacts. Achieving SDGs generates additional incentives for local and national governments as it can reduce mitigation and adaptation policy burden. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change policy; Economy; Land use; Population; Shared socio-economic development pathways; Sub-national","adaptive management; climate change; economic development; environmental policy; land use; land use change; stakeholder; sustainable development; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085687753

Whether species colonization is driven by changes in abiotic conditions or reduced biotic resistance will affect community functional composition and ecosystem management. We use a grassland experiment to disentangle effects of climate warming and community diversity on plant species colonization. Community diversity had dramatic impacts on the biomass, richness and traits of plant colonists. Three times as many species colonized the monocultures than the high diversity 17 species communities (~30 vs. 10 species), and colonists collectively produced 10 times as much biomass in the monocultures than the high diversity communities (~30 vs. 3 g/m2). Colonists with resource-acquisitive strategies (high specific leaf area, light seeds, short heights) accrued more biomass in low diversity communities, whereas species with conservative strategies accrued most biomass in high diversity communities. Communities with higher biomass of resident C4 grasses were more resistant to colonization by legume, nonlegume forb and C3 grass colonists, but not by C4 grass colonists. Compared with effects of diversity, 6 years of 3°C-above-ambient temperatures had little impact on plant colonization. Warmed subplots had ~3 fewer colonist species than ambient subplots and selected for heavier seeded colonists. They also showed diversity-dependent changes in biomass of C3 grass colonists, which decreased under low diversity and increased under high diversity.

However, the expansion and increased use of bike infrastructure has been accompanied by a glut of bike accidents, a trend jeopardizing the urban bike movement. This paper leverages data from a diverse spectrum of sources to characterise geolocated bike accident severity and, ultimately, study cycling risk and discomfort. Kernel density estimation generates a continuous, empirical, spatial risk estimate which is mapped in a case study of Zürich city. The roles of weather, time, accident type, and severity are illustrated. A predominance of self-caused accidents motivates an open-source software artifact for personalized route recommendations. This software is used to collect open baseline route data that are compared with alternative routes minimizing risk and discomfort. These contributions have the potential to provide invaluable infrastructure improvement insights to urban planners, and may also improve the awareness of risk in the urban environment among experienced and novice cyclists alike. © 2019, The Author(s).","Accident; Bike; Cycling; Kernel density; Recommendation; Risk; Route; Safety; Severity; Smart City; Weather; Zurich","Accident prevention; Accidents; Bicycles; Energy utilization; Open source software; Open systems; Risks; Smart city; Urban growth; Weathering; Bike; Cycling; Kernel density; Recommendation; Route; Severity; Zurich; Risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076750514

Dispersion modelling indicated that exposure to SO2 emissions from these power plants decreased after the energy transitions.

Climate engineering approaches are increasingly proposed as near-term intervention strategies, but deployment of these controversial techniques will require careful engagement with and the support of the public. New quantitative measurements of public perceptions for six climate engineering approaches show that the public of the United Kingdom (UK), United States (US), Australia (AU) and New Zealand (NZ) continue to have little knowledge of climate engineering. All approaches are regarded unfavourably, albeit less so for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) than solar radiation management (SRM). Knowledge and perceptions are remarkably similar between countries although UK and US respondents are more favourable towards SRM and UK respondents are more favourable towards CDR. Stratospheric aerosol injection is the most negatively perceived approach. Support for small-scale trials is also higher for CDR approaches than SRM. Statistical analyses yield mixed relationships between perceptions of climate engineering and age, political affiliation and pro-ecological views. Thus far, attempts to engage the public with climate engineering have seen little change over time and consequently, there is growing urgency to facilitate careful citizen deliberation using objective and instructive information about climate engineering. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate engineering; Cross-country; Framing effects; Geoengineering; Public engagement","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Global warming; Carbon dioxide removal; Intervention strategy; Public perception; Quantitative measurement; Radiation management; Small-scale trial; Stratospheric aerosols; United kingdom; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); aerosol; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; global warming; perception; Australia; New Zealand; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083797235

Focusing on the symbiosis system formed by the iron and steel industry, the thermal power industry, the cement industry, and the social sector in China, this article aims to clarify the contribution of this nationwide industrial symbiosis system to China's total industrial ECER potential and to identify optimal symbiotic technologies that should be emphasized on from 2020 to 2030. By combining traditional bottom-up model and lifecycle material metabolism theory, this article simulates the technology structure of this symbiosis system. By clarifying the ECER mechanisms of different types of symbiotic technologies, this article evaluates the ECER effect of each symbiotic technology as well as the performance of the overall symbiosis system. The results show that: (1) this nationwide industrial symbiosis system can save 35.7 million tons of coal equivalent, and reduce 189 kt of SO2 emissions, 139 kt of NOx emissions, and 64 kt of PM emissions. These ECER effects contribute to 18–43% of China's national industrial ECER targets, which are larger than the potential of promoting energy efficiency technologies and end-of-pipe technologies in each single industry; (2) reutilizing solid wastes from the thermal power industry and the social sector as cementitious materials, as well as recovering iron and zinc from metallurgical dust are key symbiotic fields between 2020 and 2030.

Concerns thus arise about the proper representation of the oceanic influence and the role of air-sea coupling in such experiments. A complex orography and the exposure to different air and ocean masses make the Iberian Peninsula (IP) an ideal test case for exploring the impact of including explicitly the North Atlantic in the regional domain and the added value that coupling brings to regional climate modeling. To this end, the regionally-coupled model ROM and its atmospheric component, the regional atmospheric model REMO are used in a set of coupled and uncoupled experiments forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis and by the global climate model MPI-ESM. The atmospheric domain is the same in all simulations and includes the North Atlantic and the ocean component is global and eddy permitting. Results show that the impact of air-sea coupling on the IP winter biases can be traced back to the features of the simulated North Atlantic Ocean circulation. In summer, it is the air-sea interactions in the Mediterranean that exert the largest influence on the regional biases. Despite improvements introduced by the eddy-permitting ocean, it is suggested that a higher resolution could be needed for a correct simulation of the features of the large-scale atmospheric circulation that impact the climate of the IP. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate of the Iberian Peninsula; Eddy-permitting ocean; North Atlantic; Ocean-atmosphere coupling; Regional climate model","atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric modeling; climate modeling; eddy; regional climate; sea surface temperature; Atlantic Ocean; Iberian Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083780352

Recent studies have revealed the effectiveness of early-warning mechanisms that enable the public reduce their exposure to air pollutants. This highlights the need for accurate air quality forecasts. However, air quality in many developing and highly urbanised countries remains unmonitored. Hence, a novel spatiotemporal interpolation modelling approach based on a deep learning and wavelet pre-processing technique was proposed in this paper. In more detail, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) were utilised to model the spatial variability of hourly NO2 levels at six urban sites in Central London, the United Kingdom. The models were trained using only the NO2 concentration data from the neighbouring sites. Benchmark models such as plain LSTM and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were also developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models. The proposed wavelet-based spatiotemporal models were found to provide superior forecasting results, explaining 77% to 93% of the variability of the actual NO2 concentration levels at most sites. The overall results reveal the very promising potential of the proposed models for the spatiotemporal characterisation of outdoor air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution forecasting; Artificial neural networks; Deep learning; Long short-term memory units; Spatial interpolation; Wavelet decomposition","Air quality; Brain; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Discrete wavelet transforms; Forecasting; Interpolation; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; Urban growth; Wavelet decomposition; Air pollution forecasting; Decomposition technique; Discrete wavelet transformation; Early warning mechanisms; Short term memory; Spatial interpolation; Spatio-temporal interpolations; Wavelet pre-processing; Long short-term memory; air quality; artificial neural network; decomposition; forecasting method; interpolation; learning; nitrogen dioxide; urban area; wavelet analysis; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082680284

The analysis of the effectiveness of the strategic decision-making system for the social-and-economic development of the region was carried out. The principal scheme of the decision-making mechanism for the environmental-and-economic development management was developed, including the strategic environmental assessment, which takes into account the ecological and economic state of the region. The proposed methodological approach to the assessment of the ecological-and-economic situation in the region will allow to reveal some influencing factors, to form the system of assessment indicators, which can be used to control the ecological-and-economic situation and to develop strategical management decisions for the economic development of the region. The scheme of interaction of the strategical managerial decision-making systems as well as the system of regulation of the investment climate in the region can become the basis for the selection of the type of investment policy, corresponding to the ecological-and-economic development of the region.

Location: The western Swiss Alps. Methods: Fitting topo-climatic models for &gt;60 plant species across &gt;250 sites with and without added soil predictor variables (&gt;30). Testing included the following: (a) which soil variables improve plant species distribution models; (b) whether an optimal subset of soil variables can improve models for the majority of species and habitat types and (c) how much variation in plant species distributions soil variables alone explain. Results: Geochemical variables (i.e. CaO, pH and inorganic carbon) and a drainage indicator (i.e. bulk soil water content) improved the predictive abilities of the models across the large majority of alpine plant species. The improvement of the models after the addition of soil information varied strongly between plant species and habitat types, but a trade-off was found between the number of soil variables and the associated gain in model performance. Finally, across all species, one specific combination of soil variables – bulk soil water content + total phosphorus +δ13C – outperformed the commonly used topo-climatic variables.

One approach to observing SST is via remote sensing. Here we use a 37-year gap-filled, daily-mean analysis of satellite SSTs to quantify SST trends, variability and persistence between 1981-2018. The global mean warming trend is 0.09 K per decade globally, with 95% of local trends being between -0.1 K and + 0.35 K. Excluding perennial sea-ice regions, the mean warming trend is 0.11 K per decade. After removing the long-term trend we calculate the SST power spectra over different time periods. The maximum variance in the SST power spectra in the equatorial Pacific is 1.9 K2 on 1-5 year timescales, dominated by ENSO processes. In western boundary currents characterised by an intense mesoscale activity, SST power on sub-annual timescales dominates, with a maximum variance of 4.9 K2. Persistence timescales tend to be shorter in the summer hemisphere due to the shallower mixed layer. The median short-term persistence length is 11-14 days, found over 71-79% of the global ocean area, with seasonal variations. The mean global correlation between monthly SST anomalies with a three-month time-lag is 0.35, with statistically significant correlations over 54.0% of the global oceans, and notably in the northern and equatorial Pacific, and the sub-polar gyre south of Greenland. At six months, the mean global SST anomaly correlation falls to 0.18. The satellite data record enables the detailed characterisation of temporal changes in SST over almost four decades.",,"article; Greenland; quantitative analysis; sea ice; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; summer; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085156438

Climate change is likely to alter estuaries through sea-level rise and changing precipitation patterns, although the ecological responses are uncertain. We were interested in plant responses to physiological stress induced by elevated water salinity and flooding conditions, which may be more prevalent under climate change. . We used a greenhouse experiment and factorial flooding (1, 12, 24, and 48 % time) and salinity (0, 5, 15, 30 PSU) treatments to evaluate the productivity responses of three emergent herbaceous species (Carex lyngbyei, Triglochin maritima, and Argentina pacifica) common to tidal marshes of the Pacific Northwest, USA. We measured weekly changes in plant height and final above and belowground biomass for all species after 10 weeks. Increased salinity reduced final above and belowground biomass significantly in all three species, with A. pacifica responding the most, followed by C. lyngbyei and T. maritima. Increased flooding also reduced total biomass in A. pacifica and T. maritima. There was a significant response in C. lyngbyei aboveground biomass and A. pacifica height to the flooding-salinity interaction. These results indicate emergent plant community composition may change in response to novel climate conditions in estuaries, driven by distinct physiological tolerances to salinity and flooding, and highlight the importance of considering multiple climate drivers when projecting ecosystem change. This may be especially true for estuaries that currently have prolonged freshwater phases like those in the Pacific Northwest. © 2020","Adaptation; Carbon; Climate change; Sea-level rise; Wetland","aboveground biomass; adaptation; belowground biomass; climate conditions; flooding; freshwater ecosystem; plant community; salinity; saltmarsh; sea level change; wetland; Argentina; Pacific Northwest; Carex lyngbyei; Triglochin maritimum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081980992

These methods are relevant when reusing structural elements over multiple service lives. Reuse has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. When reusing elements, cross-section and length availability have a major influence on the structural design. In previous own work, design of truss structures from a stock of elements was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. It was shown that this method produces solutions which are global optima in terms of stock utilization. This work extends previous formulations to stock-constrained optimization of frame structures subject to ultimate and serviceability limit states hence expanding the range of structural typologies that can be designed through reuse. Fundamental to this method is the globally optimal assignment of available stock elements to member positions in the frame structure. Two scenarios are considered: (A) the use of individual stock elements for each member of the frame, and (B) a cutting stock approach, where multiple members of the frame are cut from a single stock element. Numerical case studies are presented to show the applicability of the proposed method to practical designs. To carry out the case studies, a stock of elements was inventoried from shop drawings of deconstructed buildings. Results show that through reusing structural elements a significant reduction of embodied greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved compared to optimized structures made of new elements. © Copyright © 2020 Brütting, Senatore, Schevenels and Fivet.","assignment problem; cutting stock problem; frame structures; greenhouse gas emissions; Life Cycle Assessment; reuse; structural optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086166027

A target approach utilising land-use change indicators is often used to quantify and communicate progress, based upon assumed greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reductions. This paper investigated areal targets for woodland expansion and peatland restoration, both of which can deliver substantial carbon sequestration benefits, with uptake typically supported by grant incentives. A case study used empirical data to investigate realisation of such targets in Scotland referenced against ambitious policy commitments (net-zero emissions by 2045). Analysis of actual locations for recent afforestation and peatland restoration, referenced against biophysical data, showed that new woodland primarily occurred on land that was marginal for agriculture, usually on wetter uncultivated semi-natural land, often on organic soils. This acts to constrain net carbon gains. Both peatland restoration and new woodland show tendency to aggregate in specific zones or locations, regardless of biophysical opportunities, highlighting underlying socioeconomic factors. Differential patterns of uptake are also shown by grant applications across different land use groups. Socioeconomic factors act against more ubiquitous uptake of incentive schemes, especially for new woodland on improved agricultural land, which will constrain long-term decarbonisation objectives unless tackled directly. Investigation therefore shows that use of simple targets (e.g. trees planted) as headline progress indicators can be misleading, potentially contributing to policy failure and misuse of carbon offsets. A more spatially targeted approach is required to maximise GHG reductions relative to local contexts. Recommendations are made for improved measures that recognise spatial and temporal variability, as exemplified by certification schemes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Indicators; Peatland restoration; Scotland","carbon; mineral; afforestation; agricultural land; agriculture; Article; carbon sequestration; climate change; controlled study; environmental management; forest; land use; peatland; priority journal; public policy; socioeconomics; soil property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079589902

Natural gas remains a dominant feature of existing and new-build housing with strong historical, technical, and social barriers to change. Consequently, the residential sector is responsible for significant shares of national emissions and has a strong role to play under ambitious net zero targets. To assess this role, this work combines long-term system-wide optimisation modelling with heat and electricity network models of representative residential locations. The scenario framework investigates key heating alternatives across futures with dwindling carbon budgets but lower restrictions on residential investment options. Comparing frameworks offers insights into “real life” applicability of technology solutions consistent with system-wide decarbonisation pathways to 2050. Residential sector heat plays an increasing role in lowering emissions as targets tighten. Moving away from natural gas becomes unavoidable and long-term trajectories combine end-use electrification, at household or collective levels, with supply-side decarbonisation. This is preferable to alternative gases that continue to carry uncertain emission impacts, but requires significant local network reinforcement. This could be deferred where technically difficult using near-term hybrid approaches. Enabling this transition will rely on policies that support open and varied technology portfolios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy system modelling; Net zero; Network model; Optimisation; Power system; Residential heat","Budget control; Decarbonization; Energy efficiency; Financial markets; Heating; Investments; Natural gas; Energy system modelling; Net zero; Network modeling; Optimisations; Power system; Housing; comparative study; electrification; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; energy resource; future prospect; natural gas; optimization; power generation; residential energy; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081959920

Climate parameters are therefore important input variables for modelling fungal decay in wood. In recent years, different approaches aimed at modelling climate-induced dosage on the material climate (i.e., exposure models) and the effect of the latter on fungal decay (i.e., decay models). Based on maps of Europe, North America or Australia, the decay hazard can be assigned to zones and used for estimating the relative decay potential of an arbitrary location. However, especially in topographically divergent regions, the climate-induced decay hazard can vary strongly within a small area. Within this study, decay hazards were quantified and mapped for a mountainous region where topography-induced differences in local climate and corresponding exposure dosage can be expected. The area under investigation was Switzerland. In addition to the Scheffer Climate Index (SCI), two exposure models were combined with two decay models and used to quantify the relative moisture-and temperature-induced exposure dose at 75 different weather stations in Switzerland and adjacent regions. The exposure was expressed as relative dosage with Uppsala (Sweden) as a reference location. Relative dose values were calculated for locations between weather stations using an 'inverse distance weighted (IDW)' interpolation and displayed in maps for the entire country. A more detailed analysis was undertaken for the Lotschental area, which is the largest valley on the northern side of the Rhone valley in the canton of Valais. The relative dose differed strongly within small areas and altitude was well correlated with the average annual temperature and the resulting relative dose. It became evident that small-scale mapping with high resolution is needed to fully reflect the impact of topography and other local conditions on the moisture-and temperature-induced decay risk in wooden components. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate; Durability; Scheffer climate index (SCI); Service life modelling; Service life planning","Climate models; Fungi; Hazards; Location; Mapping; Moisture; Topography; Weather information services; Wooden buildings; Annual temperatures; Climate parameters; Exogenous factors; Fungal degradation; Inverse distance weighted; Local conditions; Mountainous regions; Temperature-induced; Decay (organic); construction material; moisture content; mountain region; structural analysis; temperature effect; topographic effect; wood; America; Fungi; Hazards; Mapping; Moisture; Topography; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085504068

The available publications on the deaeration do not provide information on the causes of this reduction at a bicarbonate alkalinity of less than 0.2 mg-equiv/dm3. There is a problem of carbonic acid removal from the coolant at thermal power plants where steam condensate is used as feed water. AO Sibtechenergo’s specialists faced this problem during commissioning of atmospheric deaerators operating at a low bicarbonate alkalinity of the deaerated water. During commissioning of the deaerators, the content of carbonic acid in the deaerated water often changed with no apparent causes. On completion of the commissioning, carbonic acid had a lower content in the deaerated water and was even absent under certain operating conditions. An experimental deaerator where distillate with low bicarbonate alkalinity was used as deaerated water was tested. Carbonic acid was not removed from the deaerated water if its content did not exceed 3.0 mg/dm3 and the bicarbonate hardness was below 0.06 mg-equiv/dm3. Adding tap water to the investigated distillate in an amount of 0.22% decreased the content of carbonic acid in the deaerated water. With an increase in the amount of added tap water to 0.44%, carbonic acid was completely removed from the deaerated water. At thermal power plants with a closed steam-water path (circuit), carbonic acid can be removed from the closed circuit by increasing the steam vent from district water heaters and deaerators above the standard value. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","bicarbonate alkalinity; boiler; carbonic acid; condensate; deaerator; heater; oxygen; steam; steam vent; test; tray; water","Carbon dioxide; Deaeration; pH; Steam condensate; Steam condensers; Steam power plants; Thermoelectric power plants; Bicarbonate hardness; Carbonic acids; Closed circuit; Deaerators; Feed water; Operating condition; Standard values; Thermal power plants; Organic acids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083961865

The world-wide CO2 storage capacity in carbonate formations is significant; within deep, saline aquifers and through several CO2-enhanced oil recovery projects, with associated CO2 storage. Carbonates are complex, both in terms of heterogeneity and reactivity, and improved core scale and sub core-scale analysis of CO2 flow phenomena is necessary input to simulators, aiming to establish large-scale behavior. This paper presents a recent advancement in in-situ imaging of CO2 flow, utilizing high-resolution micro-Positron Emission Tomography and radioactive tracer [11C]arbon dioxide to explicitly track CO2 during dynamic flow and subsequent trapping at the core scale. Unsteady state water injection (imbibition) and CO2 injection (drainage) were performed in a low-permeable chalk core at elevated pressure conditions. Short-lived radioisotopes were used to label water and CO2, respectively, and facilitated explicit tracking of each phase separately during single phase injection. Local flow patterns and dynamic spatial fluid saturations were determined from in-situ imaging during each experimental step. Initial miscible displacement revealed displacement heterogeneities in the chalk core, and dynamic image data was used to disclose and quantify local permeability variations. Radial permeability variations influenced subsequent flow patterns, where CO2 predominantly flooded the higher-permeability outer part of the core, leaving a higher water saturation in the inner core volume. Injection of water after CO2 flooding is proposed to be the most rapid and effective way to ensure safe storage, by promoting capillary trapping of CO2. PET imaging showed that presence of CO2 reduced the flow of water in higher-permeability areas, improving sweep efficiency and promoting a nearly ideal core-scale displacement. Alternate injections of water and gas is also expected to improve sweep efficiency and contribute to improved oil recovery and CO2 storage on larger scales.

Here, we screened a library of nitrogen-fixing alfalfa symbionts originating from different ecoregions and containing N2O reductase genes and identified novel rhizobia (Sinorhizobium meliloti INTA1–6) exhibiting exceptionally low N2O emissions. To understand the genetic basis of this novel eco-friendly phenotype, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of these strains, focusing on their denitrification genes, and found mutations only in the nitrate reductase structural gene napC. The evolutionary analysis supported that, in these natural strains, the denitrification genes were inherited by vertical transfer and that their defective nitrate reductase napC alleles emerged by independent spontaneous mutations. In silico analyses showed that mutations in this gene occurred in ssDNA loop structures with high negative free energy (−ΔG) and that the resulting mutated stem-loop structures exhibited increased stability, suggesting the occurrence of transcription-associated mutation events. In vivo assays supported that at least one of these ssDNA sites is a mutational hot spot under denitrification conditions. Similar benefits from nitrogen fixation were observed when plants were inoculated with the commercial inoculant B399 and strains INTA4–6, suggesting that the low-N2O-emitting rhizobia can be an ecological alternative to the current inoculants without resigning economic profitability. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Commercial inoculants; Evolution; Mutants; NapC; Nitrous oxide","bacterial protein; nitrate reductase; nitrous oxide; amino acid sequence; Argentina; chemistry; climate; genetics; metabolism; mutation; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; sequence alignment; Sinorhizobium meliloti; Amino Acid Sequence; Argentina; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Climate; Mutation; Nitrate Reductases; Nitrous Oxide; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment; Sinorhizobium meliloti",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076344937

However, precisely how this could be achieved in a cheap and sustainable way remains a puzzle for scientists since the electrochemical kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major limitation. Increasing interest surrounds the development of low energy consumption electrolyzers capable of oxidizing selectively biomass-based organics instead of water for a dual production of chemicals (paired electrosynthesis). Also, the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst is in the form of nanoparticles either dispersed on carbon supports or in liquids in the presence of stabilizers to prevent the nanoparticles' aggregation, detachment and performance loss. In this report, free-standing surfactant- and binder-free silver-gold nanoporous and nanoalloyed catalysts are successfully synthesized via a simple and effective approach directly on a gas diffusion electrode (GDE@AgAu). Physicochemical and electrocatalytic analyses show that the obtained activity and selectivity of metallic nanocatalysts towards the glycerol electrooxidation reaction in alkaline media depend on their morphology and composition. Specifically, an onset potential of Eonset = 0.3 V vs. RHE and a record peak current density of jpeak = 18 A mgAu-1 (290 mA cm-2) at GDE@AgAu in comparison with those of the tested commercial Au/C catalyst (Eonset = 0.7 V vs. RHE and jpeak = 2.8 A mgAu-1 or 44 mA cm-2) were obtained. Also, an unprecedented selectivity in glycerol electrooxidation towards two products of high interest, formate (66%) and glycolate (32%), has been obtained. GDE@AgAu is thus a potential substitute as an anode material for commercial Au and Pt-based catalysts for efficient alcohol electroreforming with low energy consumption and cogeneration of H2, CO2 or N2 electrolyzers. The present method that combines direct growth, galvanic replacement and nanostructuration provides a smart route for creating new designs for catalyst nanofabrication in order to target high electrocatalytic performance.

In this paper, we focus our analysis on indirect and subtle interconnections. Examining empirical cases in Northern Shan State in Myanmar, we conclude that these interconnections occur in at least three broad ways, in which climate change politics can be: (i) a trigger for land grabbing, (ii) a legitimating process for land grabs, or (iii) a de-legitimating process for people's climate change mitigation and adaptation practices. These interconnections in turn stoke old and provoke new political axes of conflict within and between state and social forces. © 2020 The Author(s)","Asia; Climate change and land; Climate change politics; Land rush; Myanmar","climate change; empirical analysis; land rights; political conflict; Myanmar; Shan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078402562

We use a set of star-forming galaxies as a control sample to compare with the results. We have considered samples of obscured (HR &gt; −0.2) and unobscured (HR &lt; −0.2) sources including AGNs with LX &lt; 1044 erg s−1, as well as QSOs (LX &gt; 1044 erg s−1) with 1.4 ≤ z ≤ 2.5. We also study the typical environment of these samples, by assessing neighbouring galaxy number density and neighbour properties such as colour, stellar mass, and star formation rate. We find that the UV/optical and mid-infrared colour distribution of the different AGN types differ significantly. Also, we obtain most of AGNs and QSOs to be more compact when compared to the sample of SF galaxies. In general we find that the stellar mass distribution of the different AGN sample are similar, obtaining only a difference of ΔlogM = 0.3 dex (M☉) between unobscured and obscured QSOs. Obscured and unobscured AGNs and QSOs reside in different local environment at small (rp &lt; 100 kpc) scales. Our results support previous findings where AGN type correlates with environment. These differences and those found in AGN host properties cast out the simplest unified model in which obscuration is purely an orientation effect. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: structure; Infrared: galaxies",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085377990

Box 47, Wageningen, NL-6700 AA, Netherlands","Lianas, woody climbing plants, are increasing in many tropical forests, with cascading effects such as decreased forest productivity, carbon sequestration, and resilience. Possible causes are increasing forest fragmentation, CO2 fertilization, and drought. Determining the primary changing species and their underlying vital rates help explain the liana trends. We monitored over 17,000 liana stems for 13 yr in 20 ha of old-growth forest in the Congo Basin, and here we report changes and vital rates for the community and for the 87 most abundant species. The total liana abundance declined from 15,007 lianas in 1994 to 11,090 in 2001 to 9,978 in 2007. Over half (52%) of the evaluated species have significantly declining populations, showing that the community response is not the result of changes in a few dominant species only. Species density change (i.e., the change in number of individuals per hectare) decreased with mortality rate, tended to increase with recruitment rate, but was independent of growth rate. Species change was independent of functional characteristics important for plant responses to fragmentation, CO2, and drought, such as lifetime light requirements, climbing and dispersal mechanism, and leaf size. These results indicate that in Congo lianas do not show the reputed global liana increase, but rather a decline, and that elements of the reputed drivers underlying global liana change do not apply to this DR Congo forest. We suggest warfare in the Congo Basin to have decimated the elephant population, leading to less disturbance, forest closure, and declining liana numbers. Our results imply that, in this tropical forest, local causes (i.e., disturbance) override more global causes of liana change resulting in liana decline, which sharply contrasts with the liana increase observed elsewhere. © 2020 The Authors.

However, the link between crime and air pollution has been largely overlooked. In this paper we study whether exposure to ambient air pollution affects crime using daily administrative data for London in 2004–5. For identification, we estimate models with ward fixed effects and implement two instrumental variable strategies, using atmospheric inversions and wind direction as exogenous shocks to local pollution. We find that air pollution has a positive and statistically significant impact on overall crime and on several major crime categories, including those with economic motives. Importantly, the effect also occurs at pollution levels that are well below current regulatory standards and appears to be unevenly distributed across income groups. Our results suggest that reducing air pollution in urban areas may be an effective measure to reduce crime and that air pollution forecasts can be used to improve predictive policing. © 2020 by The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

Since co-processing introduces impurities from wastes, such as air pollution control residue (APCR) from municipal solid waste combustion, into the cement kiln, a better understanding of their environmental impacts and effects on cement manufacturing and quality is needed. Portland cement clinkers containing 5–35% raw or 5–34% washed APCR were prepared, with formation of all typical minerals, but with effects on clinkering reactions, and increased 2CaO·SiO2 and decreased 3CaO·SiO2 and 3CaO·Al2O3. Raw APCR affected the shape of the 2CaO·SiO2 and 3CaO·SiO2 grains, and cement paste from clinker made with 35% APCR exhibited negligible 28d strength. Pastes from the clinkers with lower contents of APCR or washed APCR had strengths that were lower than that of the control at 7d, similar at 28d (∼90 MPa) and higher at 6 m (up to 120 MPa), consistent with their 2CaO·SiO2 and 3CaO·SiO2 contents. Utilization of minerals in APCR thus comes with a trade-off against cement quality. Volatilisation of S, Cl, Pb was reduced by washing, which fully eliminated volatilisation of Zn. Zn was found mainly in the interstitial phases of the clinker, in solid solution in 4CaO·Al2O3·Fe2O3 or 3CaO·Al2O3. Further investigation is required to determine whether Zn and other incorporated elements may be released from the cement paste when these phases react with water. APCR co-processing may reduce CO2 emissions by avoiding CaCO3 decomposition, but this is an uncertain benefit, which may be outweighed by the detrimental effects of APCR alkalis, Cl, S and metals on cement production and quality. Life cycle environmental impacts associated with washing, and dispersal of contaminants in the built environment through construction materials, are additional concerns. © 2020","Element speciation; Fly ash; Incineration; Industrial symbiosis; Waste-to-energy","Air pollution; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Cement manufacture; Economic and social effects; Fly ash; Hematite; Incineration; Kilns; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Portland cement; Quality control; Silica; Washing; Waste incineration; Zinc; Air pollution control residues; Alternative raw material; Cement manufacturing; Element speciations; Industrial symbiosis; Life-cycle environmental impact; Portland cement clinker; Waste to energy; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078207435

It applies Foucault’s theories on power to several key initiatives introduced as part of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). By analysing both the operation and the effects of power relations the paper accounts for how competing actors influence major policy change, and the impact different policies have on governing multiple forest users. Sovereign and disciplinary power underpins government attempts to implement new regulatory, planning and enforcement functions across the forest estate. Policy instruments such as the concession moratorium create securitised territorial zones that enable sustainable forest practices to operate. By contrast, forest management units operate through inclusive strategies that discipline forest users into responsible managers, whilst enforcement excludes those who contravene the law. Productive power and resistance explain efforts by government and non-government actors to progress or limit REDD+. Productive power operates through the multiple activities that generate new knowledge on incentivising carbon, and by engaging new subjects in carbon projects. Community resistance draws on discourses and localised subjectivities focussed on forest dependency and rights, whereas industry networks have been adept at positioning REDD+ as a threat to national development. © 2020, © 2020 Global South Ltd.","forest policy reform; Indonesia; Power; REDD+","forest management; forestry policy; power relations; sustainability; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078587314

Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed whether households that engage in timber harvesting would be willing to forgo property rights to receive payments for carbon sequestration. This study addresses this issue by examining the trade-off between timber production and carbon storage in the context of the Maya Biosphere Reserve forest concessions in Guatemala. We estimate willingness to increase carbon storage at the expense of timber harvesting through a discrete choice experiment administered to 716 households in the Maya Biosphere Reserve. Because many individuals have rights to harvest non-timber forest products and work in the tourism sector, we assess how rights for these activities would influence the willingness to participate in carbon contracts. Contract length and group or individual payment structures are also investigated. The results show that households prefer contracts that focus on carbon storage rather than timber harvesting, but access to forests so individuals can participate in non-timber forest product harvesting and tourism is critically important in this region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Community-managed forest concessions; PES contracts; Willingness to accept","carbon sequestration; carbon storage; forest management; forestry production; nontimber forest product; strategic approach; timber harvesting; trade-off; Guatemala [Central America]; Maya Biosphere Reserve; Peten",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078657787

However, atmospheric nutrient deposition can affect plant-microbe relationships by changing soil bacterial composition and by reducing cooperation between microbial taxa and plants. To examine how long-term nutrient addition shapes rhizosphere community composition, we compared traits associated with bacterial (fast-growing copiotrophs, slow-growing oligotrophs) and plant (C3 forb, C4 grass) communities residing in a nutrient-poor wetland ecosystem. Results revealed that oligotrophic taxa dominated soil bacterial communities and that fertilization increased the presence of oligotrophs in bulk and rhizosphere communities. Additionally, bacterial species diversity was greatest in fertilized soils, particularly in bulk soils. Nutrient enrichment (fertilized versus unfertilized) and plant association (bulk versus rhizosphere) determined bacterial community composition; bacterial community structure associated with plant functional group (grass versus forb) was similar within treatments but differed between fertilization treatments. The core forb microbiome consisted of 602 unique taxa, and the core grass microbiome consisted of 372 unique taxa. Forb rhizospheres were enriched in potentially disease-suppressive bacterial taxa, and grass rhizospheres were enriched in bacterial taxa associated with complex carbon decomposition. Results from this study demonstrate that fertilization serves as a strong environmental filter on the soil microbiome, which leads to distinct rhizosphere communities and can shift plant effects on the rhizosphere microbiome. These taxonomic shifts within plant rhizospheres could have implications for plant health and ecosystem functions associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling. © 2020 Bledsoe et al.","Copiotroph; Fertilization; Oligotroph; Plant-microbe; Rhizosphere","carbon; fossil fuel; nitrogen; phosphorus; Article; biomass; carbon cycling; community structure; ecosystem; grass; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbiome; nitrogen cycling; nonhuman; nutrient; nutrient availability; physical chemistry; rhizosphere; soil fertilization; wetland; bacterium; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; plant; soil; time factor; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Carbon; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plants; Rhizosphere; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Time Factors; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085155079

Using a case study approach, options for utilizing local forest biomass to reduce emissions related to natural gas heating are evaluated. The options considered include heat-only biomass boilers to fuel district heating networks, combined heat and power (CHP) connected to district networks and a microgrid or the provincial grid and production of renewable natural gas (RNG). The systems are evaluated in terms of technology readiness, break-even heat cost and GHG reduction potential. Other factors that could improve competitiveness, such as carbon pricing and low carbon fuel policies, are discussed. The systems that utilize a district heating network were found to be lower cost than RNG-producing systems, despite the need for significant infrastructure investment. While conversion of forest biomass to RNG results in a significantly higher heat cost than biomass district energy scenarios, these prices are competitive with other RNG technologies utilizing other feedstocks.

Here, we develop a spatially resolved method that can quantify the impact of nitrogen emissions to air, soil, freshwater or coastal water on “safe operating space” (SOS) for natural soil, freshwater and coastal water. The method can be used to identify potential “planetary boundary hotspots” in the life cycle of products and to inform appropriate interventions. The method is based on a coupling of existing environmental models and the identification of threshold and reference values in natural soil, freshwater and coastal water. The method is demonstrated for a case study on nitrogen emissions from open-field tomato production in 27 farming areas based on data for 199 farms in the year 2014. Nitrogen emissions were modelled from farm-level data on fertilizer application, fuel consumption and climate- and soil conditions. Two sharing principles, “status quo” and “gross value added”, were tested for the assignment of SOS to 1 t of tomatoes. The coupling of models and identification of threshold and reference values resulted in spatially resolved characterization factors applicable to any nitrogen emission and estimations of SOS for each environmental compartment. In the case study, tomato production was found to range from not transgressing to transgressing its assigned SOS in each of the 27 farming areas, depending on the receiving compartment and sharing principle. A high nitrogen use efficiency scenario had the potential to reverse transgressions of assigned SOS for up to three farming locations. Despite of several sources of uncertainty, the developed method may be used in decision-support by stakeholders, ranging from individual producers to global governance institutions. To avoid sub-optimization, it should be applied with methods covering the other planetary boundaries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Absolute environmental sustainability assessment; Biogeochemical flows; Environmental state indicators; Safe operating space; Sharing principles; Thresholds","Decision support systems; Fruits; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soils; Sustainable development; Systems engineering; Water; Biogeochemical; Environmental state; Environmental sustainability; Safe operating space; Sharing principles; Thresholds; Life cycle; biogeochemical cycle; environmental assessment; life cycle analysis; nitrogen cycle; soil nitrogen; sustainability; threshold; vegetable; agricultural land; air pollution; analytic method; Article; boundary layer; climate change; coastal waters; fertilizer application; food industry; freshwater environment; life cycle assessment; nitrogen cycle; planetary boundary; priority journal; reference value; sea pollution; soil change; soil pollution; soil property; tomato; water pollution; agriculture; nitrogen cycle; tomato; Lycopersicon esculentum; fertilizer; nitrogen; Agriculture; Fertilizers; Lycopersicon esculentum; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078659733

However, cross-border electricity trade with the U.S. is already extensive, and although Canada is currently a net exporter, policy changes could alter these trade dynamics. Since CO2 emissions are currently unregulated in many U.S. states, there is a concern that this incomplete regulatory coverage will lead to emissions leakage, as electric generation and emissions shift toward these unregulated regions. This paper examines potential power sector emissions leakage and distributional implications across provinces from Canadian carbon pricing. Using an integrated model of electric sector investments and operations with detailed spatial and temporal resolutions, the analysis demonstrates how emissions leakage through trade adjustments can be non-trivial fractions of the intended emissions reductions even in the presence of leakage containment measures. Magnitudes of long-run leakage rates from Canadian carbon pricing depend on market and policy assumptions (e.g., natural gas prices, projected load growth, long-run demand elasticities, timing of future U.S. CO2 policy), ranging from 13% (high gas price scenario with border carbon adjustments) to 76% (lower gas price scenario without antileakage measures), which are higher than reported literature values for national policies. When leakage containment measures are implemented, net emissions and leakage rates decrease, but gross emissions in Canada and policy costs increase. Leakage persists in alternate scenarios with constrained transmission expansion, higher natural gas prices, lower load growth, higher price elasticities of demand, and U.S. adoption of carbon pricing, but leakage rates decrease under these conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate policy; Economic geography; Emissions leakage; Energy-economic modeling; Market integration; Trade","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Elasticity; Natural gas; Risk perception; Demand elasticities; Electric generation; Emissions reduction; Integrated modeling; National policies; Natural gas price; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Transmission expansion; Costs; carbon emission; economic growth; electricity industry; emission control; environmental economics; environmental risk; estimation method; trade-environment relations; Canada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084125596

Different scale applications are proposed as alternative energy sources for residential usage and industrial power plants, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions which characterize fossil-fuel-based processes. Their spread is favoured by the development of proper simulation tools that allow system design optimization and control in real-time operations. For this purpose, model building and validation, through comparison with experimental observations, are fundamental steps to guarantee the simulation validity. A single-anode-supported planar SOFC with two possible cathodic current collector designs is tested in common operating conditions, evaluating the performance through EIS analysis and characteristic curves. These provide a preliminary validation for the proposed 2D steady state simulation code. This model, implemented in Fortran, makes it possible to forecast the main SOFC local properties on both the anodic and cathodic sides. The key point of the code is the electrochemical kinetics, based on a semi-empirical approach where requested parameters, derived from fitting of experimental results, are introduced in physically based equations. In this way, the influence of specific cell design on system performance is evaluated. © 2020 by the authors.

However, urban express distribution is increasingly difficult and seriously affecting the traffic, safety, and environmental conditions of cities due to small, scattered end points, unreasonable allocation of resources, and seriously repeated resource waste. Therefore, there is an urgent need to solve the problems associated with the unreasonable resource allocation of express distribution. In the context of green logistics, a new mode of collaborative distribution based on intelligent end service station (IESS) is proposed. Following the measurement models of carbon emissions, before and after collaborative distributions are provided to prove the environmental benefits of the new mode. The influencing factors considered in the models are the average daily distribution volume, number of distribution sections, vehicle ownership of various types, and their capacity, use, fuel, and power consumption. To verify the models’ validity, we conduct an empirical study of five express enterprises in China and make a comparative analysis on the results, which show that the implementation of collaborative distribution can extremely reduce carbon emissions and improve the overall load rate of vehicles.

Most regions are impacted by a mix of such policies. However, the transportation literature has devoted little attention to policy mixes, especially in the light-duty vehicles sector, so here we review and draw insights from the broader, mostly non-transport literature. We identify several rationales for pursuing mixes of policies: (i) the “three legs” approach to transport decarbonization, namely that different policies should address different GHG reduction areas (low-carbon fuels, vehicle efficiency and reduced travel demand), (ii) the “market failure” perspective that a different policy is needed to correct each market failure, (iii) the “political process” perspective that considers the real-world need for a policy mix to be perceived as political acceptability, and (iv) the “systems” perspective that policy needs to send signals to channel technological innovation and break the lock-in of incumbent practices. Based on this review, we develop a simple framework for examining policy interactions across multiple criteria, namely GHG mitigation, cost-effectiveness, political acceptability, and transformative signal. We demonstrate this framework by setting hypotheses for interactions across six light-duty vehicle policies in the case of British Columbia, Canada – including a carbon tax, electric vehicle purchase incentives, infrastructure deployment, and three regulations. We conclude with a summary of important research gaps and implications for policy design, as well as quantitative modeling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Market failure; Policy mix; Policy package; Policy patching; Transitions","Carbon; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Electron transitions; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; British Columbia , Canada; Climate policy; Infrastructure deployments; Market failures; Policy packages; Political acceptability; Quantitative modeling; Technological innovation; Light electric vehicles; conceptual framework; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; emissions trading; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; pollution tax; research; transportation policy; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082576606

G.H.Loos (Poaceae) tussocks, with high biomass but low fodder quality. Mowing limits P. paniculata abundance through the depletion of its water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) reserves, which sustain early spring growth initiation. However, the effectiveness of mowing effects is modulated by grassland functional composition, fertilization and climate change, as WSC compounds, and notably fructans, support plant physiological responses to climate stresses such as drought or frost. To characterize the mechanisms underpinning the control of P. paniculata under global change, we tested the effects of climate manipulation (combined snow removal and drought) and management (cutting and fertilization) alone or in combination on P. paniculata WSC storage in assembled grassland communities of varying functional composition. Management and climate treatments individually decreased seasonal fructan storage, with neither additive nor synergic effects between them, primarily due to the dominance of management over climate effects. Fructan amounts were higher in individuals growing in unmanaged exploitative communities compared to unmanaged conservative communities, regardless of climate treatments, but management overrode these differences. Our findings suggest that reduction by combined snow removal and drought of P. paniculata carbon allocation to WSC storage may similarly limit its dominance to that in current mowing practices. © 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands","Drought; early snow melt; functional composition; grassland management; subalpine grasslands; water-soluble carbohydrates","abundance; carbohydrate; climate change; drought; environmental management; grassland; growth; physiological response; snowpack; spring (season); subalpine environment; Alps; France; Poaceae; carbohydrate; water; chemistry; drought; grassland; metabolism; Poaceae; season; Carbohydrates; Droughts; Grassland; Poaceae; Seasons; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078673287

Using two conjoint experiments on a representative sample of 2,476 Americans, we evaluate the marginal impact of 40 different climate, social, and economic policies on support for climate reforms. Overall, we find climate policy bundles that include social and economic reforms such as affordable housing, a $15 minimum wage, or a job guarantee increase US public support for climate mitigation.

Kraft lignin and cellulose are renewable macromolecules available in high quantities, making them interesting candidates for CF production. Dry-jet wet spun precursor fibers (PFs) from a 70/30 w/w blend of softwood kraft lignin (SKL) and fully bleached softwood kraft pulp (KP) were converted into CFs under fixation. The focus was to investigate the effect of carbonization temperature and time on the CF structure and properties. Reducing the carbonization time from 708 to 24 min had no significant impact on the tensile properties. Increasing the carbonization temperature from 600 to 800 °C resulted in a large increase in the carbon content and tensile properties, suggesting that this is a critical region during carbonization of SKL:KP PFs. The highest Young's modulus (77 GPa) was obtained after carbonization at 1600 °C, explained by the gradual transition from amorphous to nanocrystalline graphite observed by Raman spectroscopy. On the other hand, the highest tensile strength (1050 MPa) was achieved at 1000 °C, a decrease being observed thereafter, which may be explained by an increase in radial heterogeneity. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","carbon fiber; carbonization; cellulose; dry-jet wet spinning; fully bleached softwood kraft pulp; softwood kraft lignin","Carbon fibers; Cellulose; Elastic moduli; Kraft pulp; Lignin; Nanocrystalline materials; Nanocrystals; Softwoods; Spinning (fibers); Tensile strength; Textile blends; Bleached softwood kraft pulp; Carbonization conditions; Carbonization temperatures; Lightweight composites; Nanocrystalline graphite; Radial heterogeneity; Softwood kraft lignins; Structure and properties; Carbonization; Carbon Fibers; Carbonization; Cellulose; Softwoods; Tensile Strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084748026

In this paper, the focus is on countries in which forest cover increased between 1990 and 2015. We analyze whether a level of initial economic development can be identified that might explain this positive trend. By combining qualitative and quantitative techniques (ecological modelling and an expert survey), a Forest Recovery Index is introduced that accounts for the fact that dissimilar forest management regimes have different impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The link between the Forest Recovery Index and the 1990 level of GDP per capita is analyzed with instrumental variable regression. The results of our integrated ecological-economic models support the existence of an N-shaped curve in the context of forest recovery, implying that the quality and quantity of new forests in middle-income countries has increased to the least extent. In other words, although the outcomes suggest optimism in the long term, caution is needed as the first turning point (a decrease in forest recovery), unlike the second, may fairly easy to be reached. In spite of overall increases in the extent of forests, negative trends – rearrangements that favor less valuable types of forest – appear to be persistent. While transitions are important in terms of the need to sequester carbon, governments should (in line with the Aichi Targets) place greater emphasis on forest biodiversity during transition management to ensure the provision of a wider array of ecosystem services. © 2020","Forest Recovery Index; Forest transition; Global model; Interdisciplinary model; IV regression","Biodiversity; Deforestation; Economic analysis; Ecosystems; Recovery; Forest recovery; Forest transition; Global modeling; Interdisciplinary modeling; IV regression; Economic and social effects; deforestation; ecological modeling; economic development; economic growth; ecosystem service; environmental assessment; forest cover; forestry; forestry modeling; global perspective; Gross Domestic Product; index method; interdisciplinary approach; Kuznets curve; recovery plan; regression analysis; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077949916

It has come to the forefront in recent years as a Green service in large cities. However, the majority of existing ride-sharing services rely on a central third party, which makes them subject to a single point of failure and privacy disclosure concerns by both internal and external attackers. Moreover, they are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Sybil attacks due to malicious users. There is also high service fees paid to the ride-sharing service provider. In this paper, we propose to decentralize ride-sharing services based on a public Blockchain. Our scheme enables drivers to propose ride-sharing services without relying on a trusted third party. To preserve location privacy, riders send cloaked ride requests to hide their exact pick-up/drop-off locations, and departure/arrival dates. Then, by using an off-line matching technique, drivers sends their offers encrypted to ensure data confidentiality. Upon receiving the ride-offers, the rider can find a ride match using some heuristics as well as the bid price included in the offer. To preserve anonymity, riders/drivers use pseudonyms that change per trip to ensure unlinkabilty. We envision the application of this technology in Green Internet of Things connected smart cities, where ride sharing services are common. Finally, we implement our scheme and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experimental results show the applicability of our protocol. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; Ethereum; green; Ride sharing services; smart cities; Smart contract","Blockchain; Carbon dioxide; Denial-of-service attack; Network security; Springs (components); Carbon dioxide emissions; Data confidentiality; Distributed denial of service; External attacker; Location privacy; Privacy disclosures; Privacy preserving; Trusted third parties; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085469743

These large-scale problems can be directly decomposed into smaller subproblems, in the absence of time-coupling constraints and variables. However, time-coupling is common in energy systems, e. g. due to (seasonal) energy storage and peak-power prices. To solve time-coupled long-term operational optimization problems, we propose the method DeLoop for the Decomposition-based Long-term operational optimization of energy systems with time-coupling. DeLoop calculates feasible solutions (upper bounds) by decomposing the operational optimization problem into smaller subproblems. The solutions of these subproblems are recombined to obtain a feasible solution for the original long-term problem. To evaluate the quality of the feasible solutions, DeLoop computes lower bounds by linear programming relaxation. DeLoop iteratively decreases the number of subproblems and employs the Branch-and-Cut procedure to tighten the bounds. In a case study of an energy system, DeLoop converges fast, outperforming a commercial state-of-the-art solver by a factor of 32. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Complicating constraints; Emission targets; Large-scale MILP; Network connection fees; Seasonal storage; Solution method; Time-coupling","Iterative methods; Linear programming; Complicating constraints; Emission targets; Large-scale MILP; Network connection; Seasonal storage; Solution methods; Integer programming; decomposition analysis; energy storage; linear programing; numerical method; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081380593

One pathway towards zero emissions is the use of electric aircraft. While current battery technology will not allow for medium and long-haul flights at full capacity, on short-haul routes First Generation Electric Aircraft (FGEA) could play a significant role in the near future. Current FGEA under development could carry 9–19 passengers on distances of 400–1046 km by 2025. This study focuses on the emissions reduction potentials of FGEA in Finland. It compares the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions and real travel times (RTT) from door-to-door of FGEA on 47 routes with existing aircraft, train and car transport modes, as well as with proposed high-speed rail (HSR) and electric vehicle implementation. The study found that replacing all existing aircraft with FGEA can clearly be recommended as it would result in a reduction of CO2-eq emissions and RTT. Existing cars should only be replaced by FGEA on routes beyond 170 km. The replacement of existing trains by FGEA under the current energy mix is not recommended. However, once electricity could be provided from renewable energy sources exclusively, it would become feasible to replace existing trains on distances beyond 170 km and HSR beyond 400 km with FGEA. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Electric aviation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Modal shift; Travel time","electric vehicle; emission control; future prospect; greenhouse gas; transportation development; transportation planning; travel time; urban transport; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083832545

Although the role of these small and affordable sensors is rather supplementary, determination of the measurement uncertainty is one of the main questions of their applicability because there is no certificate for quality assurance of these non-reference technologies. This paper presents the results of almost one-year field testing measurements, when the data from different low-cost sensors (for SO2, NO2, O3, and CO: Cairclip, Envea, FR; for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10: PMS7003, Plantower, CHN, and OPC-N2, Alphasense, UK) were compared with co-located reference monitors used within the Czech national ambient air quality monitoring network. The results showed that in addition to the given reduced measurement accuracy of the sensors, the data quality depends on the early detection of defective units and changes caused by the effect of meteorological conditions (effect of air temperature and humidity on gas sensors and effect of air humidity with condensation conditions on particle counters), or by the interference of different pollutants (especially in gas sensors). Comparative measurement is necessary prior to each sensor's field applications. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Gas analyzers; Microsensors; Particle counter; Relative humidity","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Gas detectors; Pollution detection; Quality assurance; Radiation counters; Ultrasonic effects; Uncertainty analysis; Ambient air quality; Comparative measurements; Field application; Measurement accuracy; Measurement uncertainty; Meteorological condition; Monitoring network; Reference monitors; Costs; air quality; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; concentration (composition); metropolitan area; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; urban atmosphere; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085660109

Then, the existed Co3O4 core could be totally reduced by the carbon shell, thus in CoxOy core (composed by Co and Co3O4). Of particular note, the ratios of Co and Co3O4 can be linearly tuned, suggesting the controlled interfaces, which greatly influences the interface loss behavior and electromagnetic absorption performance. The results revealed that the minimum reflection loss value (RLmin) of −39.4 dB could be achieved for the optimal CoxOy@C sample under a thin thickness of 1.4 mm. More importantly, the frequency region with RL &lt; −10 dB was estimated to be 4.3 GHz, ranging from 13.7 to 18.0 GHz. The superior wideband microwave absorption performance was primarily attributed to the multiple interfacial polarization and matched impedance matching ability. © 2020 by the authors.

However, from a human-centered design perspective, there is a lack of clear understanding of what current users need and want from solar PV systems and from the experience of installing solar. In this study, we interviewed 18 solar stakeholders and conducted surveys of 1,773 homeowners including both solar adopters and non-adopters in California and Massachusetts. We analyzed the data using discrete choice theory and showed that cost savings, solar system reliability, installer warranty, and reviewer ratings of the installer were the most important factors when these homeowners considered purchasing a solar system. Preference differences were discovered between adopters and non-adopters, and with state, age, and income. Via surveys of current solar adopters’ experiences of installing residential solar panels, we found that solar owners ranked installer reliability as even more important than price. The findings are intended to inform designers, engineers, and manufacturers as they create more compelling residential solar PV systems and to inform installers in designing better installation services.

This issue has been mainly attributed to land-use and land-cover changes, in particular related to agricultural expansion and intensification. In this study, we used the DPSIR framework (D: driving forces, P: pressures, S: states, I: impacts, and R: responses) to systematically describe the ecosystem service dynamics related to anthropogenic activities and climatic parameters in the region. We reviewed the literature and used remote sensing, agricultural, climatic and hydrological data together with expert knowledge to assess the main driving forces and pressures, resulting land-use transitions and their spatiotemporal impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity using a matrix-based assessment approach. We identified population growth, economic incentives and climate change as the most important driving forces, leading to altered agricultural activities, numerous dam constructions and droughts. Since 1987 cropland areas doubled at the expense of bare soils and natural vegetation, the lake hast lost more than half of its surface area, urban and freshwater areas increased threefold and by 50%, respectively. This favored crop and freshwater provision, while all other ecosystem services remained nearly constant or decreased, though spatial patterns were heterogeneous. For example, regulating and cultural services, and biodiversity mainly decreased at the shorelines of the lake, while provisioning services increased along the major rivers and close to cities. To address the land-use transitions with the most profound impact on ecosystem service provision, we recommend the following measures: increase the water supply to the lake, reduce cropland expansion, manage existing croplands more sustainably and protect natural vegetation. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the regional ecosystem service dynamics and a valuable baseline for future research and environmental management in the basin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Cropland expansion; DPSIR framework; Environmental management; Lake shrinkage; Land-use transitions; Salinization","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate change; Dynamics; Environmental management; Expansion; Lakes; Land use; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Water levels; Water supply; Agricultural activities; Agricultural expansion; Anthropogenic activity; Dpsir frameworks; Land use and land cover change; Salinization; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Systematic assessment; Ecosystems; drinking water; rain; climate change; ecosystem service; environmental management; human activity; lacustrine environment; land use; salinization; service provision; spatiotemporal analysis; agricultural expansion; agricultural intensification; agriculture; Article; biodiversity; climate change; climate regulation; cropland; dam (barrier); drought; dynamics; economic incentive; ecosystem restoration; ecosystem service dynamics; ecosystem service provision; environmental degradation; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental protection; evaporation; human; human wellbeing; Iran; irrigation (agriculture); lake basin; lake ecosystem; lake shrinkage; land use; land use transition; livestock; migration; nonhuman; population growth; priority journal; recreation; remote sensing; socioeconomics; spatiotemporal analysis; surface area; sustainable agriculture; systematic assessment; tourism; types of study; urbanization; vegetation; water quality; water regulation; water supply; wellbeing; Iran; Lake Urmia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079164898

In some cases, operational S2S climate predictions are translated into inputs for follow-on analyses or models, whereas the S2S predictions on their own may provide for qualitative situational awareness. At the spatial scales of water management, however, S2S climate forecasts often suffer from systematic biases, and low skill and reliability. This study assesses the potential to improve S2S forecast skill and salience for watershed applications through the use of postprocessing to harness skills in large-scale fields from the global climate model forecast outputs. To this end, the components-based technique—partial least squares regression (PLSR)—is used to improve the skill of biweekly temperature and precipitation forecasts from the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2). The PLSR method forms predictor components based on a cross-validated analysis of hindcasts from CFSv2 climate and land surface fields, and the results are benchmarked against raw CFSv2 forecasts, remapped to intermediate-scale watershed areas. We find that postprocessing affords marginal to moderate gains in skill in many watersheds, raising climate forecast skill above a usability threshold over the four seasons analyzed. In other locations, however, postprocessing fails to improve skill, particularly for extreme events, and can lead to unreliably narrow forecast ranges. This work presents evidence that the statistical postprocessing of climate forecast system outputs has potential to improve forecast skill, but that more thorough study of alternative approaches and predictors may be needed to achieve comprehensively positive outcomes. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"climate prediction; data processing; hydrological modeling; seasonal variation; statistical analysis; water management; watershed; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085758063

A connection between the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) cell in the Atlantic basin and the Pacific Deep Water (PDW) cell in the Pacific basin occurs with a direct flow of NADW into the channel’s lower cell, while PDW upwelled in the Pacific basin can flow directly into the upper wind-driven cell in the channel. The intersection of these cells along with direct zonal flows between the basins completes the interbasin circulation. The present-day Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in the model is upwelled both by wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean and by diffusion in the Pacific and Atlantic. In a cooler climate with enhanced sea ice, the NADW cell shoals, which can then no longer flow directly into the channel’s lower cell, reducing the Pacific pathway of NADW. This leads to a substantial weakening of the AMOC, suggesting buoyancy forcing changes can play a substantial role in the transition of the AMOC to a glacial state. In contrast, in a warmer equilibrium climate state with reduced AABW formation, the NADW cell strengthens and deepens. NADW is increasingly directed along the Pacific pathway, while the direct upwelling in the channel’s wind-driven upper cell plays a smaller role. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Buoyancy; Cells; Cooling systems; Cytology; Glacial geology; Sea ice; Atlantic meridional overturning circulations; Circumpolar channels; General circulation model; Meridional overturning circulations; North Atlantic Deep Water; Overturning circulation; Possible futures; Wind driven upwelling; Oceanography; buoyancy; meridional circulation; oceanic circulation; overturn; upwelling; wave modeling; Atlantic Ocean; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088231414

The empirical analysis is performed in a panel data context by means of propensity score matching with multiple treatments, since our framework is characterized by the presence of two treatments, corresponding to the two different energy policies analyzed, i.e. energy efficiency policy and renewable policy. These two policies can be applied by each province as mutually exclusive strategies or as joint strategies. Our results show that renewable policies are the most effective in terms of climate goals especially when implemented on a local scale, while energy efficiency policies alone are ineffective. Moreover, the success of these policies depends on the type of pollutant to be reduced.

Although direct demographic responses of plant species to climatic factors have been widely acknowledged, they are also regulated by interspecific interactions (i.e., the effects of shrubs on herbaceous plants). The magnitude and direction of regulation of such interspecific interactions remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, a full factorial field experiment simulating three levels of N enrichment (ambient, 10 kg N ha−1 yr−1, and 60 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and three levels of precipitation (ambient, 20% increase, and 40% increase) were conducted in the Mu Us Desert, northern China. N enrichment and increased precipitation significantly increased herbaceous productivity by improving the soil water content and nutrient availability (e.g., soil DIN:SAP) when shrubs were not present. Taller species responded to N enrichment, whereas those with a greater specific leaf area responded to increased precipitation. When shrubs were present, they acted as a ‘buffer islands’ that moderated the responses of herbaceous species to N enrichment and increased precipitation by weakening the effect of the improved soil water status. The magnitude of the effect of shrubs on herbaceous biomass and richness was comparable to that of N enrichment and increased precipitation.

In order to explore whether and why abnormal correlation exits in its five sub-basins, the temporal changes between AED and AE were compared, and then the impacts of climate change and human activities on abnormal correlations were assessed using the sensitivity method of Penman equation and the decomposition method of Budyko equation. The results indicated: (1) Pan evaporation and potential evaporation (indicators of AED) decreased at rates of up to -0.04 and -0.06 mm d−1 decade−1, respectively. In contrast, the water budget-derived evaporation (an indicator of AE) increased at the rate of 0.09 mm d−1 decade−1 in the Fuhe River basin and remained stable in other basins. Abnormal correlations (nonpositive correlations) were observed. (2) Decreasing net radiation and wind speed were major climate factors resulting in simultaneous temporal decreases in AED and AE. In contrast, afforestation was a major human factor leading to an increase in annual AE of 78 mm, but had no effect on AED. Afforestation was the primary driving force of the abnormal correlation.

However, they are rarely fully identified from seismic or well data and have been poorly described. The present study investigates the geological and structural controls that regional anticlines may exert on solution-enlarged fracture corridors and epigenic karst concentrations in folded-fractured carbonate units. We performed regional mapping based on 106 2D seismic lines, 51 well logs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery of four major outcrop sites (I, II, III and IV) and field investigations to parameterize fracture and karstic features (density, spacing, length, and aperture). The study area is Potiguar Basin, Brazil, where we identified the gentle NE-trending Apodi fold, ~10 km wide and ~20 km long. The fold formed along an inverted extensional fault during the latest Miocene-Quaternary stress field, and the envelope of the meandering trend of the Apodi River coincides with the NE-trending fold axis. The fracture pattern in the fold hinge zone consists of two orthogonal, syn-folding fracture sets: a NE-SW-striking hinge-parallel set and an orthogonal NW-SE-striking set. These fractures and superposed karstification are mostly concentrated in the hinge zone along fracture corridors in an area 1.5 km wide and 20 km long. We conclude that fracture corridors in anticline hinges are likely sites to have high fracture densities and wide apertures. These corridors provide reservoir spaces that are favorable for the formation of karst cavities, with significant increases in permeability and porosity along the fracture sets. These features act as important fluid pathways and storage areas where matrix porosity is low. The findings can be used for first-order prediction in karstified carbonate reservoirs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anticline; Carbonate reservoir; Fold; Fracture corridors; Karst; Permeability; Super-k","Antennas; Carbonation; Digital storage; Faulting; Landforms; Mechanical permeability; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Porosity; Seismology; Structural dynamics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Well logging; Anticline; Carbonate reservoir; Fold; Fracture corridors; Karst; Fracture; anticline; carbonate; concentration (composition); dissolution; fold; fracture; geological mapping; hydrocarbon reservoir; karst; outcrop; permeability; unmanned vehicle; well logging; Brazil; Potiguar Basin; Rio Grande do Norte; Apodi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078663172

Thus, this study was conducted to assess and compare the performance of four machine-learning methods in modeling and forecasting brucellosis time series data based on climatic parameters. Methods In this cohort study, human brucellosis cases and climatic parameters were analyzed on a monthly basis for the Qazvin province–located in northwestern Iran- over a period of 9 years (2010–2018). The data were classified into two subsets of education (80%) and testing (20%). Artificial neural network methods (radial basis function and multilayer perceptron), support vector machine and random forest were fitted to each set. Performance analysis of the models were done using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Root Error (MARE), and R2 criteria. Results The incidence rate of the brucellosis in Qazvin province was 27.43 per 100,000 during 2010–2019. Based on our results, the values of the RMSE (0.22), MAE (0.175), MARE (0.007) criteria were smaller for the multilayer perceptron neural network than their values in the other three models. Moreover, the R2 (0.99) value was bigger in this model. Therefore, the multilayer perceptron neural network exhibited better performance in forecasting the studied data. The average wind speed and mean temperature were the most effective climatic parameters in the incidence of this disease. Conclusions The multilayer perceptron neural network can be used as an effective method in detecting the behavioral trend of brucellosis over time. Nevertheless, further studies focusing on the application and comparison of these methods are needed to detect the most appropriate forecast method for this disease. © 2020 Bagheri et al.

The evaluation of the status of air quality is based mainly on ambient air measurements. Although the emissions of principal air pollutants are highly regulated, there is a lack of information about the real extent of emissions generated by the traffic and made difficult the quantification of the effects of policies and measures to reduce air pollution. To tackle these challenges, local air pollution measurements near main streets, based on small IoT devices became necessary. The aim of the paper is to present the way in which low-cost sensors in combination with Artificial Intelligence algorithms could be used for prediction of PM10 and PM-2.5 concentration. The data were collected using IoT devices based on Optical Particle Counter technologies, statistically analyzed and corrected (using a specific algorithm) to reduce the influence of the air humidity. Comparison with measurement from reference station were presented. For PM10 and PM-2.5 concentration forecasting was developed an ARIMA algorithm which was tested for time series registered in Bucharest. The results show that in 89% of cases the predicted values are within the accepted uncertainty limit, while the Pearson correlation coefficients have significant values. © 2020 IEEE.","Air Pollution; ARIMA; Forecast Algorithm","Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Autoregressive moving average model; Correlation methods; Forecasting; Springs (components); Artificial intelligence algorithms; Comparison with measurements; Local air pollutions; Optical particle counters; Pearson correlation coefficients; Policies and measures; Reference stations; Uncertainty limits; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088288208

The aim of this study was the comparison of a three-dimensional relationship between green taxation, environmental performance and economic growth for the time period between 1995 and 2017 in Romania and Sweden. The novelty consists of simultaneously using the double dividend theory and environmental Kuznets curve theory for Romania. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method was used for testing the cointegration relationship. The Granger causality estimation based on the ARDL-error correction model was applied to identify the causality relationship between the variables and the pairwise Granger causality test to detect the direction of causality. The implementation of the tests led to the conclusion that environmental taxes will have a significant influence on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the long run in both Romania and Sweden, while in the short run, no such influence will be noticed. Also, in Romania, in the long term, there was a bidirectional causality relationship between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions, while in Sweden, the causality relationship was from economic growth to greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Double dividend theory; Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory; Environmental tax; Greenhouse gas emissions","climate change; comparative study; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; environmental tax; Granger causality test; greenhouse gas; Kuznets curve; sustainable development; tax system; Romania; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085347572

However, a limited number of studies have been published so far focusing on the development of standard procedures which could be applied by urban planners to effectively evaluate urban conditions with respect to air quality. To fill this gap, a new approach for the determination of urban Air Quality Management Zones (AQMZs) was proposed and presented based on two case studies: Antwerp, Belgium and Gdańsk, Poland. The main objectives of the study were to 1) formulate a theoretical framework for the management of urban ventilation potential and human exposure to air pollution and to 2) develop methods for its implementation by means of a geographic information system (GIS). As a result of the analysis, the typologies that may be associated with decreased ventilation potential and the areas that require close monitoring due to potential human exposure to air pollution were identified for both cities. It is advocated that delimiting these typologies – combined with investigating local climate, wind and topography conditions and air pollution characteristics – could constitute a preliminary step in the urban planning process aimed at air quality improvement. These methods can be further applied to other urban areas in order to indicate where detailed studies are required and to facilitate the development of planning guidelines. Moreover, the directions for further research and urban planning strategies were discussed. © 2020 The Authors","Air quality management; GIS-Based analysis; Urban morphology; Urban planning; Urban ventilation","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Geographic information systems; Information management; Quality control; Quality management; Topography; Ventilation; Air quality improvement; Gis-based; Pollution dispersion; Standard procedures; Theoretical framework; Urban morphology; Urban Planning Strategies; Urban ventilation; Urban planning; air quality; atmospheric pollution; GIS; pollution exposure; theoretical study; urban atmosphere; urban morphology; urban planning; ventilation; Antwerp [Antwerp (PRV)]; Antwerp [Belgium]; Belgium; Gdansk [Pomorskie]; Poland [Central Europe]; Pomorskie",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081054792

While there has been substantial growth in the uptake of PV in countries around the world, often coupled with financial incentives, climate change mitigation demands accelerated transition pathways. To drive purposeful policies, the underlying dynamics of PV adoption and diffusion need to be better understood. Specifically, place-specific social and cultural differences across countries and regions can impact policy effectiveness. This paper contributes to debates on PV adoption and energy policy in Berne, Switzerland, one of the top European countries of per capita PV growth. With a qualitative investigation of the household electricity cultures of PV adopters and non-adopters we examine the way in which ‘cultural’ attributes influence the uptake of PV. The research points to the complex dynamics of (non-)adoption. First, the findings illustrate that while cultures allow for change, their dynamics have self-sustaining tendencies. Secondly, more broadly shared cultural trends form part of a regionally-specific ‘contextual soup’ shaping the electricity cultures of households. Acknowledging place-specific, multi-scalar cultural dynamics we discuss the need to rethink policy preferences for economic factors in a one-size-fits-all perspective and promote targeted, context-specific PV policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Context-specific policy; Cultural change; Energy cultures; Multi-scale policy; Photovoltaics; PV adoption dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076471582

Simulation models are useful tools to evaluate the effect of future scenarios of climate change on soil CO2 emission in the long term; this study aimed to: (1) evaluate the performance of RothC model using SOC data measured from five different vegetation covers in a semiarid region (southern Iran); (2) assess the impacts of present climate and climate change scenarios on cumulative CO2 emissions from soil; and (3) assess the net effect of climate change on soil CO2 emissions by comparing the two scenarios. The following vegetation covers were studied: rangeland, cypress trees, almond trees, cypress understory and almond understory. Model validation indicated that RothC accurately simulated SOC measured data (R2 = 0.97; Pearson correlation = 0.98; performance efficiency = 0.96). Results showed that climate change effect on soil cumulative CO2 emissions increased by 2050 under all vegetation covers, although not significantly in each vegetation cover in comparison with the present climate scenario. The extent of soil cumulative CO2 emissions may be related to the different decomposability of plant materials and soil carbon input (plant material quantity) in tree covers and rangeland/understory covers, respectively. However, vegetation covers with the highest and lowest soil cumulative CO2 emissions did not correspond with the highest and the lowest values of soil CO2 emissions under the net effect of climate change. In addition, trends of the soil CO2 emissions were decreasing in all vegetation covers during the 2014–2050 period. We argue that under the net effect of climate change SOC will be resistant against further decomposition over time. In fact, easily decomposable materials are fully or partially depleted, and microbial population and decomposition rate of litter materials will decline. This also implies a chemical change of organic matter and the formation of humus complex compounds showing a high resistance to decomposition. Therefore, the study of organo-mineral complex and humus complex compounds in the soils of this region is recommended for future researches. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Climate change; Net effect of climate change; Quality and quantity of plant material; RothC model; Soil cumulative CO2 emission","Arid regions; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Correlation methods; Forestry; Organic carbon; Population statistics; Soil pollution; Soils; Vegetation; Climate change scenarios; CO2 emissions; Microbial populations; Net effect; Performance efficiency; Plant material; RothC models; Soil organic carbon; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; decomposition; humus; microbial activity; semiarid region; soil organic matter; vegetation cover; Iran; Cupressus; Prunus dulcis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075197563

To reduce disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep in humans, most smartphones and computers now have software that reduces blue light emissions at night. Little is known about whether reducing blue light emissions from city lights could also benefit urban wildlife. We investigated the effects of blue-rich (white) and blue-reduced (amber) LED streetlights on accelerometry-defined rest, electrophysiologically-identified sleep, and plasma melatonin in a diurnal bird, the black swan (Cygnus atratus). Urban swans were exposed to 20 full nights of each lighting type in an outdoor, naturalistic environment. Contrary to our predictions, we found that night-time rest was similar during exposure to amber and white lights but decreased under amber lights compared with dark conditions. By recording brain activity in a subset of swans, we also demonstrated that resting birds were almost always asleep, so amber light also reduced sleep at night. We found no effect of light treatment on total (24 h) daily rest or plasma melatonin. Our study provides the first electrophysiologically-verified evidence for effects of streetlights on sleep in an urban animal, and furthermore suggests that reducing blue wavelengths of light might not mitigate these effects. © Copyright © 2020 Aulsebrook, Lesku, Mulder, Goymann, Vyssotski and Jones.","accelerometry; artificial light at night; blue light; EEG; elecrophysiology; light pollution; light spectra",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085985876

Here, WCOME was produced from raw waste cooking oil by transesterification process with the help of ultrasonicator to reduce the production time. The flame was stabilized using a swirl burner characterized by the formation of central recirculation zone with Swirl Number (SN) equal 0.55; commonly called High Swirl Burner (HSB). The incoming air was preheated to a constant temperature of 250 °C and mixed with air at equivalence ratio φ of 0.75 for all tested fuel blends. Comparing to neat Jet A-1 fuel flame, flames of WCOME/Jet A-1 fuel blend revealed great effect of adding biodiesel to Jet A-1 on local and global emission characteristics of LPP combustion with comparable temperature distributions. Results showed a significant reduction in CO and NOx emissions indices for B20 at combustor exit by 41% and 30%, respectively, compared to those for pure Jet A-1 fuel.

As a case study, the influences of the presence of imidazolium ionic liquids in the methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) absorbent solutions on process separation efficiency were evaluated on the example of separation of two binary methane-based gases mixtures containing impurities of carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide. It was shown, that the addition of small amount (5 vol%) of ionic liquids provides the significant increase on the process separation efficiency in a comparison with pure MDEA performance, which was taken as a reference. Also, the proposed technique was compared with a conventional single-stage membrane gas separation method and it was shown, that membrane-assisted gas absorption provides much higher separation efficiency in a whole observed range of processes productivity. The achieved purity of target component (methane) using absorbent solutions containing imidazolium ionic liquids exceeds the pure MDEA results more when 6 vol% and equals to 90.2 vol% in case of CH4/CO2 separation. In case of hydrogen sulfide removal (the initial content in the mixture is 5 vol%) using a sorbent containing an ionic liquid, the methane purity is 99.87 vol%, which exceeds the purity of methane achieved by using pure MDEA by 1.8 vol%. Moreover, as an important part of process study the dynamics of establishing the steady state under a closed-mode operation was studied and the most efficient operational time regions and ultimate separation performance of a process was observed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Hydrogen sulfide; Ionic liquid; Membrane-assisted gas absorption; Natural gas","Adsorbents; Binary mixtures; Carbon dioxide; Desulfurization; Efficiency; Gas absorption; Gases; Hydrogen sulfide; Ionic liquids; Liquefied natural gas; Liquid methane; Methane; Natural gas; Separation; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Gas separations; Hybrid techniques; Imidazolium ionic liquids; Methyldiethanolamine; Removal process; Separation efficiency; Separation performance; Target component; Gas permeable membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078240661

In spite of its high valorization potential in cement production, the large quantity of bagasse ash generated from Indian sugar plants (44,220 tonnes/day) is entirely unutilized and disposed as waste. Lack of comprehensive SCBA availability and accessibility studies are the major deterrents for the effective utilization of SCBA in industrial scale applications. This study investigated the availability of bagasse ash, fly ash, and slag in India, and their accessibility to existing cement plants. A comparative network analysis using ArcGIS was adopted, to assess the benefits of using bagasse ash in cement plants. Bagasse ash was found to be a potentially viable supplementary cementitious material in three out of the five major sugar-producing states of India. It is shown that switching over to bagasse ash results in significant reduction of carbon emissions associated with logistics (5.41 million tonnes/year). Strategic locations for new cement plants were identified based on availability of bagasse ash, using location-allocation analysis.

Cargo bikes, in combination with urban transshipment points, are gaining momentum as a green last mile alternative. Although a wide body of research proves their viability in dense urban areas, knowledge about planning urban transshipment points is very limited. This also entails the siting of such facilities and the assessment of effects on emissions. This study therefore presents a first quantitative scenario-based model that assesses the impacts on a district. It examines different strategies for siting urban transshipment points in a single district and its effect on traffic, the carbon footprint, and air quality to give strategic insights where to create candidate locations for such facilities. Our result contributes to knowledge of planning urban transshipment facilities and assessing the impact of different configurations. The findings demonstrated that the use of cargo bikes to make courier, express, and parcel (CEP) deliveries in urban districts could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG), particulate matter (PM10), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions significantly. However, the choice of vehicles completing inbound and outbound processes and the strategies for siting urban transshipment points display widely differing and even conflicting potential to reduce emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Cargo bike; City logistics; Urban freight; Urban logistics; Urban planning; Urban transshipment point","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon footprint; environmental impact assessment; scenario analysis; shipping; traffic emission; transportation planning; urban area; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086147175

The installation of a greening system can provide engineered solutions for stormwater management and climate change mitigation at both the urban and building level. This facilitates improving indoor comfort conditions and reducing energy needs. In order to improve the features of products and to facilitate the implementation of a proper technical standard, this paper proposes a critical bibliographic analysis of more recent scientific works. Moreover, by means of a numerical model of an existing single-family apartment, placed in the Mediterranean climate zone, a building envelope refurbishment with a living wall is carried out. A parametric analysis provides evidence for the application of different plants' types and insulation materials. The results are analyzed considering the energy needs, the thermo-hygrometric comfort, and the outdoor surface temperature variation of the building envelope, emphasizing that a multi-criteria design approach is needed for green vertical systems. The paper provides data and an approach useful for designers and researchers in the evaluation and optimization of the performance of greening systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Building performance; Dynamic simulations; Energy saving; Green system; Living wall; Mediterranean climate; Thermo-hygrometric comfort; Urban heat island","climate change; design; energy efficiency; energy planning; installation; insulation; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; optimization; refurbishment; runoff; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; water management; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085495819

At the building scale, these energy efficiency measures are suitable for improving indoor comfort conditions and for reducing energy needs. Several guidelines are available about vertical greening systems, but these propose design parameters and performance evaluation criteria, often incomparable. In order to facilitate the implementation of proper technical standards, this paper proposes a critical review of more recent scientific investigations. All parameters for the design optimization are discussed as well as the achievable social and private benefits by taking into consideration the type of study (numerical or experimental), the climate conditions, the analysis period, all technical requirements of the green layer as well as of the back wall. The review underlines that a multi-criteria design approach is needed for green vertical systems. Thus, the paper is concluded with a SWOT analysis, evidencing ""strengths"", ""weaknesses"", ""opportunities"" and ""threats"". The analysis shows that the highlighted benefits will acquire greater relevance considering the increase in global temperatures and the growing need to redevelop densely built urban centers, while some negative aspects may be filled in the future with a deeper preparation of designers and careful choice of materials. The review paper shows, therefore, drivers and barriers occurring designing and implementing green walls. ©' 2020 by the authors.","Building performance; Building simulation; Energy retrofit; Green walls; Sustainability; Thermal behavior; Urban quality","Climate change; Walls (structural partitions); Climate change mitigation; Global temperatures; Multi-criteria designs; Performance evaluation criteria; Scientific investigation; Storm-water managements; Technical requirement; Technical standards; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084399452

We use data obtained from a survey conducted with 1572 households in Kenya across the target areas of a TV edutainment programme, Shamba-Shape-Up (SSU). A conceptual framework is developed to account for the interaction between farmers watching SSU and internal factors including farmer's and household's characteristics, farmer's views on farming, their trust of sources of influence and their decisions to change their agricultural practices. Structural equations and probit models are used to understand how watching the edutainment TV programme Shamba Shape-Up (SSU) along with farmers and household's characteristics affect maize and dairy farmer's probability to make changes to agricultural practices shown in SSU. We find that SSU has an influence on maize and dairy farmers' decisions to implement changes of agricultural practices. Farmers who watch SSU have a higher probability to implement a greater number of agricultural practices. However, SSU influence varies depending on the agricultural practice recommended as well as on the reasons that farmers have for watching the programme. The probability of implementing agricultural practices shown on SSU was not dependent on the associated difficulty of making such changes. Edutainment TV can be a viable approach to nudge farmers to implement practices that contribute to addressing local and global challenges including adapting to and mitigating against climate change, reducing poverty, and increasing productivity and income of smallholders in developing countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural practices; Edutainment; Shamba shape-up","agricultural practice; conceptual framework; farmers attitude; implementation process; productivity; smallholder; television; Kenya; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081677886

The study explores what actions are taken by lower-income residents to cope and adapt using their individual and collective assets in response to current and future hazards–especially in contexts where social capital is strong from a history of collective slum upgrading. It shows that such asset-based approaches can be an entry point for cooperation between these communities and other stakeholders, including local government, local NGOs and others, and there is scope to further strengthen asset-based adaptation approaches through legal and institutional measures. © 2019 The Author(s).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the formation of cubic phase with the peak in the (111) plane. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis used to estimate the films thickness, columns magnitude and its shape. The unpolarized light absorption spectrum of the zig-zag Al thin film was obtained by spectroscopy analysis in 330–850 nm. Besides, the scattering and absorption spectra of these nanostructures were simulated by the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and the results compared to the empirical data. The Al zig-zag thin film was simulated by an array of electric dipoles and optical spectra were obtained as function of azimuthal angles and arm lengths. The simulation results show that, at the zero degree incident angles for different azimuthal angles the peaks intensity increases by decreasing azimuthal angle. Besides, by increasing the arm lengths, the peak of shorter wavelength shifts toward the longer wavelengths and the peak of longer wavelength become sharper. From a general viewpoint, the observations had a good agreement to empirical data, nevertheless, the differences needs special attention.

Using findings from local studies, we explore the mitigation potentials of technologies and management practices currently proposed to mitigate enteric methane emissions from cattle production systems in the higher emitting countries of Latin America. We then discuss barriers for adopting innovations that significantly reduce cattle-based enteric methane emissions and the major shifts in policy and practice that are needed to raise national ambitions in the high emitting countries.

Our aim was to use an integrative approach to elucidate mechanistic relationships of carbon storage with biotic and abiotic factors in the natural forests of temperate Australia, a region that has been overlooked in global analyses of carbon-biodiversity relations. Location: South-eastern Australia. Time period: 2010–2015. Major taxa studied: Forest trees in 732 plots. Methods: We used the most comprehensive forest inventory database available for south-eastern Australia and structural equation models to assess carbon-storage relationships with biotic factors (species or functional diversity, community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values, structural diversity) and abiotic factors (climate, soil, fire history). To assess the consistency of relationships at different environmental scales, our analyses involved three levels of data aggregation: six forest types, two forest groups (representing different growth environments), and all forests combined. Results: Structural diversity was consistently the strongest independent predictor of carbon storage at all levels of data aggregation, whereas relationships with species- and functional-diversity indices were comparatively weak. CWMs of maximum height and wood density were also significant independent predictors of carbon storage in most cases. In comparison, climate, soil, and fire history had only minor and mainly indirect effects via biotic factors on carbon storage. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that carbon storage in our temperate forests was underpinned by tree structural diversity (representing efficient utilisation of space) and by CWM trait values (representing selection effects) more so than by tree species richness or functional diversity. Abiotic effects were comparatively weak and mostly indirect via biotic factors irrespective of the environmental range. Our study highlights the importance of managing forests for functionally important species and to maintain and enhance their structural complexity in order to support carbon storage. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","fire; forest carbon; functional diversity; functional identity; mass-ratio; niche-complementarity; structural diversity; structural equation model; temperate forests","biotic factor; carbon storage; complexity; forest fire; functional change; global change; numerical model; temperate forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079451408

Results: The findings revealed that RP supplementation did not negatively affect (p>0.05) DMI of Napier grass, while RP intake and total DMI were the greatest in the RP supplementation at 4% and 6% DMI. Nevertheless, the nutrients (dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber) digestibilities were not changed in the RP supplementation groups. Rumen fermentation parameters especially those of total volatile fatty acids, acetate and butyrate were not significantly changed. However, the propionate concentration was remarkably increased (p<0.05) in the RP supplementation. Notably, the ratio of acetate to propionate, the number of protozoa, as well as the methane estimation were significantly reduced in the RP supplemented groups (4% and 6% of DMI), while the counts of bacteria was not altered. Conclusion: Supplementation of RP (4% of DMI) improved rumen propionate production, reduced protozoal population and methane estimation (p<0.05) without a negative effect on feed consumption and nutrients total tract digestibilities in beef cattle. Using dietary rambutan fruit peel powder has potential promise as a rumen regulator.

Stability analysis is important for forest breeding programs aimed at obtaining high yield genotypes with greater adaptability for a wide range of environments. However, its application in woody species is scarce in comparison to the usual approach for annual crops. Our objective was to study the productivity and stability of poplar clones across different environmental conditions, and to compare two different methods to characterize yield stability. We used data obtained from trials across sites with different environmental conditions in Paraná River Delta, South America. The studied clones were the most used in the region, Populus deltoides W. Bartram ex Marshall ‘Australiano 129/60’, ‘Carabelas INTA’, ‘Stoneville 67’ and Popupus x canadensis Moench ‘Ragonese 22 INTA. We analyze their growth response in long-term trials under field conditions in a context of high environmental heterogeneity such as the leveed systems of the studied region. Yield stability (volume/ha) of poplar clones was evaluated at eight years old from parameters of Joint Linear Regression Analysis (regression coefficient bi and squared deviations from the mean δij), and with a simplified Relative Distance Plasticity Index (RDPIs) assuming that lower RDPIs implies greater genotype yield stability. This comparison highlighted the usefulness of RDPIs to estimate yield stability regardless of the set and number of involved genotypes. The amplitude of yield between sites demonstrated a great environmental heterogeneity and the significance of genotype x environment interactions. These genotypes were selected clones but had great differences in stability and yield. Thus they were classified as stable genotypes of high yield (‘Australiano 129/60’) and low yield (‘Stoneville 67’) and unstable genotypes of high yield (‘Carabelas INTA’) and low yield (‘Ragonese 22 INTA’). The description of ‘Australiano 129/60’ as stable genotype of high yield is consistent with the empirical perception of forest farmers and explains the prevalence of this clone in the poplar plantations at the Paraná River Delta. However, ‘Carabelas INTA’ an unstable genotype was the best alternative for the most productive conditions. Thus, evaluating yield stability was relevant for both strategies, the selection of high yield stable genotypes and to identify the best genotype for a specific environment. Moreover, the combination of them according to site conditions and resource availability could improve the yield at a stand or regional level. Yield stability analysis should be considered as selection criteria of new clones in Populus breeding programs considering the range of site conditions and the potential impact of climate change on forest plantations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic improvement program; Genotype x environment interactions; Relative distance plasticity index","Climate change; Cloning; Cotton; Cultivation; Regression analysis; Site selection; Stability criteria; Environmental conditions; Environmental gradient; Environmental heterogeneity; Genetic improvements; Genotype x environment interaction; Plasticity indices; Regression coefficient; Vegetative propagation; Forestry; amplitude; climate change; clonal organism; genotype; growth response; heterogeneity; phenotypic plasticity; resource availability; selective breeding; stability analysis; vegetative propagation; yield response; Clones; Cotton; Cultivation; Forestry; Genotypes; Regression Analysis; Stability; Yield; Argentina; Parana Delta; Populus; Populus deltoides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081118075

Urban construction projects interrupt the regular on-road vehicle traffic flow that affects air pollution concentration in the adjacent areas. The project schedule, however, is a possible contributor to the air pollution which has been neglected to date. This research proposes a new framework to account for the impact of different urban project schedule alternatives on air pollution emission near the construction zones. The proposed framework uses the capabilities of vehicle traffic simulation to evaluate air pollution emission of different construction schedule alternatives and reduce the resulting emission in urban construction projects. The capability of the proposed framework is verified in a real grade separation case. Pollution concentration shows a potential reduction of up to 41% in sensitive locations. The achieved resulting values represent potential emission reduction of 7.8% for CO2, 8.2% for NOx, and 3.8% for PM10. The achieved results in the case study confirm the impact of the construction schedule on the air pollution emission throughout the project's construction. It justifies the application of the framework in the congested urban areas.

This study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors. Methods: The study used aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases that reported to the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on Google reports on the Riyadh Region (24.7136 °N, 46.6753 °E). The Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each climate factor. Results: A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2 ± 9.9 years), and more than half (404) (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from April to August. The highest peak timing positioned in August 2015, followed by April 2014, June 2017, March 2015, and June 2016. High temperatures (IRR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.043–1.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR = 1.401, 95% CI: 1.331–1.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of MERS-CoV cases. However, low relative humidity (IRR = 0.956, 95% CI: 0.948–0.964) and low wind speed (IRR = 0.945, 95% CI: 0.912–0.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of MERS-CoV cases. Conclusion: The novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between April and August. High temperature, high ultraviolet index, low wind speed, and low relative humidity are contributors to increased MERS-CoV cases. The climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings and integrated into guidelines to serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection. © 2019 The Authors","MERS-CoV; Meteorological factors; Weather conditions","adult; Article; climate; cloud; cohort analysis; high temperature; human; humidity; incidence; major clinical study; middle aged; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; priority journal; retrospective study; Saudi Arabia; ultraviolet radiation; wind speed; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; incidence; season; temperature; time factor; wind; Adult; Climate; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; Middle Aged; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Retrospective Studies; Saudi Arabia; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Ultraviolet Rays; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076246987

Al-Wehda dam located in Harta city in the northern of Jordan was used to validate the approach. The two-diode (TD), single-diode (SD), and ideal single-diode (ISD) solar models were evaluated in terms of the solar array size, reliability, and ecological effects. The impoundment of Al-Wehda dam was taken as the upper reservoir of the pumped hydro facility of the proposed renewable energy system. It was found that the PV power is more accurately modelled by considering the recombination loss in the TD solar model. This leads to a more realistic sizing and precise system evaluation. Results were obtained using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for validation purposes. For instance, the PSO results showed that the realistic TD model is reliable, with an index of reliability of 98.558%. Further, it is the most ecological solution with an annual emissions reduction of 21.5198 Gg. The optimized values are 44,840 solar panels and 65.052 M. m3 of the lower reservoir volume for the TD model.

We explore six scenarios, including two illustrative simulations of the potential impact of Brexit on local content. We find that future offshore wind development does indeed generate a policy “double dividend” in the form of simultaneous and substantial reductions in cumulative emissions, which in each case exceed a year of the UK's total emissions, and improvements in economic activity (of nearly £30 billion cumulative increase in value-added when the 60% target for local content is achieved). It is also the case that, as anticipated, the scale of the economic stimulus arising from offshore wind development is directly and strongly related to the extent of local content. Future work could extend the modelling to relax the supply side assumptions of input-output modelling, disaggregate the analysis by regions and households to allow assessment of the impacts on the distribution of both economic activity across regions and income among household quintiles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brexit; Economic impact; Industrial strategy; Input-output analysis; Low carbon economy; Offshore wind; Supply chain","Binary alloys; Economics; Environmental impact; Offshore oil well production; Cumulative emissions; Double dividend; Economic activities; Input output model; Local contents; Potential impacts; Substantial reduction; Total emissions; Economic and social effects; economic activity; economic impact; emission control; environmental impact; input-output analysis; offshore application; pollution policy; simulation; wind power; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082779369

Opportunities exist to increase agricultural production and improve the policy environment. However, policymakers lack local empirical evidence to provide local solutions to agricultural development in many developing countries, including Togo. This paper assesses farmers’ willingness to pay for weather index-based insurance (WII) as a market option for sharing climatic risks. A choice modeling approach is used based on data collected from 704 randomly selected households in northern Togo, West Africa. Statistical analysis of the data shows that dry spells are the major concern of farmers and maize is perceived as the most affected food crop. Results also indicate that respondents are willing to participate in a WII market and would prefer insuring crops, such as maize over sorghum and rice against drought by paying on average about $14.5 per hectare. The results show that WII should not be offered standalone, but interlinked with other factors such as providing drought tolerant and high yielding varieties; loans to organized farmers’ groups; and weather information through TV, radio and mobile phones in local languages, while encouraging education to enable the diffusion of more advisory services. These factors are likely to influence positively farmers’ preferences in participating in a WII market. Key policy insights Very often, insurance is seen as a magic bullet in agricultural risk management policy discussions. A standalone WII could suffer from low adoption, a problem that calls for other policy options. As a climate change adaptation policy, WII could be bundled with other risk-reducing options for a better uptake and to improve farmers’ welfare. WII can be an effective channel for farm credit facilities and advisory services, as well as other agricultural risk management interventions. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation policy; Agriculture; climate change; weather index-based insurance","agricultural policy; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; insurance system; willingness to pay; Togo; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083577402

Access to improved water closer to their homes benefits the community in many ways. It improves their health status, saves their time and energy, and improves their productivity in jobs and education they are engaged in. However, due to natural and human activities, improved water sources do not always deliver good quality of water. It can be contaminated by different pathogenic microorganisms and chemicals. The result indicated that 44.7% and 50.9% of the samples were contaminated with Escherichia coli and enterococci respectively, and from the sanitary condition survey, 57.6% of the water sources exhibited from intermediate- to very high-risk level. And the risk priority matrix identifies 95 (27.9%) samples with high risk and 54 (15.9%) of the samples with very high risk. The main risks identified at those unsafe water sources were that the drainage canals were blocked with mud, grass, leaves, and stones; animals drinking the overflow water and grazing in the proximity of water sources and feces such as cow dung were observed; inadequate protection of water sources such as absence of fences and diversion ditches; and stagnant water near the source. The study conducted in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region has clearly indicated that people may be at risk of being exposed to pathogens in half of the improved water sources when used for drinking based on the microbial indicator data or the sanitary inspection risk score. Though no correlation resulted from water quality and sanitary condition of sources, the risk priority matrix did enable prioritization of 54 very high-risk-level water sources for urgent targeted interventions from a total of 340 improved drinking water sources. From this, targeted interventions, improving water management practices, identifying and implementing effective water treatment options, providing sustainable energy sources for the supply of continuous water, and implementing climate resilience water safety planning, are recommended. © 2020, The Author(s).","E. coli; Enterococci; Risk priority matrix","Canals; Escherichia coli; Water quality; Water treatment; Condition surveys; Drinking water sources; Management practices; Microbial indicators; Microbiological quality; Pathogenic microorganisms; Sanitary inspection; Sustainable energy sources; Potable water; drinking water; rain; coliform bacterium; drinking water; microbiology; pathogen; sanitation; water management; water quality; water resource; water supply; water treatment; Article; climate resilience; controlled study; energy resource; Enterococcus; Escherichia coli; Ethiopia; grass; human activities; intervention study; mud; nonhuman; plant leaf; population research; risk factor; rock; sanitation; soil; water management; water quality; water sampling; water supply; animal; bovine; environmental monitoring; female; human; microbiology; water quality; Ethiopia; Animalia; Escherichia coli; Animals; Cattle; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084078147

A gap still exists between academics and practitioners in the field. One of the apparent reasons why this rift exists is that academic tools often are not easy to handle and maintain by actual users. In this work, the problem of municipal waste collection is modeled using a simple but efficient and especially easy to maintain solution. Real data have been used, and it has been solved using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Computations have been done in two different ways: using a complete random initial population, and including a seed in this initial population. In order to guarantee that the solution is efficient, the performance of the genetic algorithm has been compared with another well-performing algorithm, the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). Three problems of different sizes have been solved and, in all cases, a significant improvement has been obtained. A total reduction of 40% of itineraries is attained with the subsequent reduction of emissions and costs. © 2020 by the authors.","Genetic algorithms; Traveling salesman problem; Waste collection route planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085544083

Many Southeast Asian countries face this reality and hence they are concerned about setting and achieving an effective emission reduction strategy. As such, this study analyzes and compares emission reduction targets on selected Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, by using a long-run Regional Dynamic Integrated Model of the Climate and Economy (RdICME). This study considers the comparative outcomes of BAU (Business as Usual: base case) and INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) scenarios for the 40-year period from 2010 to 2050. According to BAU scenario, carbon emissions are projected to gradually increase in all countries; however, if Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand apply their INDC targets as agreed upon in the 2015 Paris Agreement, all three countries will experience significant emissions reductions after 2030. Specifically, by 2050, total emissions will be reduced by 33.88%, 42.50% and 41.68% in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, respectively, if the countries implement their INDCs. According to the INDC targets, all three countries will experience a net reduction of per capita emission intensity by 2030 and onwards; however, Malaysia is projected to face lower marginal damage costs whereas Indonesia and Thailand will face higher marginal damage costs for 2010-2050. This study also finds that the amount of planned investment for INDC emissions reduction is currently insufficient to achieve planned targets. The findings from this study would help country-specific policymakers to oversee the likely gaps to be fulfilled within 2030-2050. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Emission reduction; INDC; Indonesia and Thailand; Malaysia; policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090263527

This phenomenon, when combined with the non-stationary operation of huge capacity of renewable energy systems, results in no stability of voltage and frequency. To assure continuous network stability and to avoid energy losses from renewable energy systems that are subject to such control system, a hybrid system with energy-power storage in the form of pumped-hydro storage is considered the most suitable technically. This paper presents the design, modeling, analysis, and feasibility study of a hybrid wind and water-pumping storage system. The system was designed and analyzed for King Talal Dam (KTD), which is in Northern Jordan. The importance of this study is that it is directed mainly to Jordan and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in general. The Jordanian renewable energy market is a promising arena that encourages developers, investors, engineers, and companies to develop and install pure renewable energy systems and renewable energy hybrid projects for the generation of electricity. The analysis of wind data is carried out using the ""windfarm"" software with 5.16 m/s as average wind speed. It is followed by the design of the hybrid system, which is simulated for a daily operation of 2-3 h as peak load hours. Based on the technical outcomes, cost study and feasibility analyses are carried out with Jordanian market prices. The total estimated annual energy production is 26,663,933 kWh from 10 MW wind farm and 5.2 MW pumping storage system. The aforementioned studies showed that a similar hybrid system is not always fully commercially feasible. However, a pure pumped-storage system proved to be technically feasible and assisting the grid. The whole project analysis determines that such a system boosts the operational stability of the grid, increases the penetration of renewable energy systems and reduces the energy import. In addition, 15,100,000 tons of CO2-equivalent is estimated as annual emissions reduction in this study. © 2020 by the authors.","Energy storage; Feasibility study; Hybrid; Hydroelectric; Water pumping; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085104897

Since ponds proliferate or recede due to natural or anthropogenic factors, a variation of pond numbers implies a variation of their climatic effect. Accordingly, this study investigates the impact of ponds on the local climate of the French Claise watershed. The latter was chosen because it contains a pond dense zone and a pondless zone. This repartition makes the Claise an adequate context to reveal the climatic impact of ponds even in the same landscape. To study the pond-climate effect, the parallel evolution of pond numbers variation and subsequent climatic impact must be tracked. Therefore, the remote sensing-derived Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was extracted from LANDSAT images with different acquisition dates to track changes in pond numbers with time. When compared with a pond map established from aerial photography interpretation, the LANDSAT NDWI map revealed an accuracy of 85.74% for pond count and 75% for pond spatial allocation. This validation showed that NDWI is suitable for mapping the proliferation of ponds through time. In order to study the parallel evolution of the climatic effect, the land surface temperature (LST) index was extracted for each LANDSAT map. LST maps revealed that as a result of pond number variation, surface temperatures varied accordingly. A comparison of air temperatures between the ponded zone and pondless zones also revealed that pond zones had lower air temperatures than their direct surroundings. Accordingly, ponds were shown to buffer local microclimates even within the same landscape. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Brenne; Landscape limnology; LST; NDWI; Ponds; Remote sensing","Aerial photography; Antennas; Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Land surface temperature; Ponds; Remote sensing; Surface properties; Watersheds; Anthropogenic factors; Aquaculture ponds; Climatic effects; Climatic impact; Landscape feature; Normalized difference water index; Spatial allocation; Surface temperatures; Lakes; air temperature; aquaculture production; aquaculture system; Landsat; model validation; pond; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; surface temperature; air temperature; aquaculture; Article; climate change; environmental factor; environmental temperature; France; land surface temperature; landscape; microclimate; pond; remote sensing; surface area; watershed; climate; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; France; Aquaculture; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; France; Ponds; Remote Sensing Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083661668

We claim that the challenge is no longer just only individual interfaces for individual cars or mobility providers, but rather an overhaul of overall mobility systems and approaches, and of integrated interfaces to these new complex systems, with a focus on sustainability and emission reduction. There are a number of open questions around this. The exact approach to deal with them is not yet clear, except that we will have to meet this mobility-related, and also societal change. We provide background and example to present our open questions and challenges. © 2020 Owner/Author.","Complex Systems; eMaaS; Emission Reduction; Future Mobility; Green Energy Transition; Integrated Mobility; Modal Change; Smart Cities; Sustainability","Climate change; Emission control; Emission reduction; Exact approach; Integrated interface; Mobility systems; Position papers; Societal changes; Urban mobility; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102116793

Under steady-state conditions, the tests were performed at constant engine speed (2000 rpm), and four different engine loads (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 Nm). The results showed that CO and NOx emissions significantly reduced down to 52% and 20%, respectively with an increasing percentage of the fusel oil in the fusel oil-diesel blends. However, HC gradually increased up to 40% with the addition of fusel oil. With respect to the performance of the engine, the lowest BSFC and the highest BTE were seen in F0 test fuel owing to the higher heating value of F0. On the other hand, duration in ignition delay (ID) of fusel oil-diesel blends was longer than that of F0 due to the lower cetane number of the fusel oil. The maximum in-cylinder pressure (CPmax) and maximum heat release rates (HRRmax) of fusel oil containing fuels is higher in comparison with diesel fuel owing to the longer ID and oxygen atoms of excessive fusel oil. The combustion characteristics of fusel oil-diesel blends closely followed those of neat diesel fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohols; Alternative fuels; Combustion; Emission; Fusel oil; Isoamyl alcohol","Alcohol fuels; Alcohols; Alternative fuels; Calorific value; Combustion; Diesel fuels; Neutron emission; Combustion characteristics; Experimental investigations; Fusel oil; Isoamyl alcohol; Maximum heat release rate; Performance characteristics; Single-cylinder diesel engine; Steady-state condition; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079267274

At each site, surface seawater sampling and physical-chemical measurements were combined to study diel cycles (over 25 h) of dissolved Pt concentrations in seawater (PtD) and master variables reflecting primary production activity (chlorophyll-a, phaeopigments, and particulate organic carbon, POC concentrations). Plankton nets were used in all sites, providing for the first time plankton Pt concentrations (PtPK) over a whole diel cycle (Gironde Estuary mouth) and spot sampling (Arcachon Bay and Genoa Harbor) in the coastal zone. Bivalves (wild oysters or mussels), reflecting organisms at higher trophic levels, were also collected at all sites. The POC/Chl-a ratios in the collected particulate material suggested high contribution of phytoplankton to the particulate matter in the productive Gironde Estuary mouth. At this site, phytoplankton activity partly controlled Pt cycling and particle/dissolved Pt partitioning during daytime. During the night, zooplankton grazing may release Pt into the dissolved phase. These processes are partly masked by external factors such as tide or local Pt sources, especially in more confined and/or urbanized coastal water bodies such as the Arcachon Bay and the Genoa Harbor. Platinum levels in plankton and bivalves from these contrasting sites along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts tended to reflect the general Pt levels in seawater. These results clearly suggest that (i) Pt contamination of coastal waters and marine organisms has become a common feature in urbanized sites and (ii) Pt transfer to the marine food chain starts at the basic level of primary producers. By concentrating Pt (Bioconcentration Factor: BCF ~ 104), phytoplankton may serve as a biomonitor to assess Pt contamination in coastal environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bioconcentration; Phytoplankton; Seawater; Technology critical element","concentration (composition); grazing; particulate matter; phytoplankton; platinum; primary production; seawater; semienclosed sea; zooplankton; Arcachon Bay; Atlantic Coast [Europe]; Atlantic Coast [France]; France; Gironde; Gironde Estuary; Gulf of Genoa; Italy; Ligurian Sea; Mediterranean Coast [France]; Mediterranean Sea; Nouvelle-Aquitaine; Bivalvia; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082537916

Among these, global warming has ominous repercussions on every segment of society, thus tracing its underlying causes is imperative. This research attempts to investigate the impact of urbanization and energy consumption on carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) for a panel of 8 Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) over the period 1982 to 2017. The analyses are executed using panel co-integration and Granger causality techniques. The main findings of panel co-integration reveal a long-run relationship between urbanization, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the results indicate a positive and significant impact of urbanization and energy consumption on CO2 emissions, indicating that urban development and high energy consumptions are barriers to improve environmental quality in the long run. The results also highlight bi-directional causality between energy consumption and urbanization, while unidirectional causality exists between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Based on the obtained results, this study offers useful policy implications for plummeting carbon emissions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asian countries; Energy consumption; Panel co-integration; Urbanization and CO2 emissions","carbon dioxide; cointegration analysis; developing world; environmental quality; global warming; panel data; urban development; urbanization; Asia; carbon dioxide; Bangladesh; China; data analysis; economic development; India; Indonesia; Malaysia; Nepal; Pakistan; Sri Lanka; urbanization; Bangladesh; Carbon Dioxide; China; Data Analysis; Economic Development; India; Indonesia; Malaysia; Nepal; Pakistan; Sri Lanka; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082139102
