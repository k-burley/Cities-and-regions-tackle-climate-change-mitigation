Gulf Coast states have experienced coastal land loss due to the alteration of natural hydrology and other human activities, as well as from events such as tropical storms and hurricanes. The building of levees on the Mississippi River and its tributaries since the 18th century has contributed to depriving once-thriving wetlands and barrier islands of the freshwater, sediments and nutrients they need to survive.[7] Sediment is essential to the Gulf ecosystem, where coastal Louisiana was formed over the course of 7,000 years by deltaic processes, including intermittent flooding of the Mississippi River, which delivered sediment to different coastal regions. In the Gulf, communities, commerce and ports have long relied on the extensive network of human-made flood damage risk reduction and navigation structures for their existence. Accordingly, river management priorities historically have centered on navigation and flood risk reduction. While clearly successful in meeting those two goals, those priorities created unintended consequences to the surrounding environment by accelerating wetland and barrier island erosion and restricting the flow of vital sediments that had sustained the Gulf ecosystem over time. Oil and gas industry canals, pipelines and other infrastructure crisscross the landscape to accommodate exploration, development and commercial activity related to these enterprises; they also contribute to wetland loss. Furthermore, studies indicate that geologic land subsidence exacerbates sea-level rise impacts.[8] Over the last seven decades, approximately 1,883 square miles of wetlands in Louisiana alone have been lost.a land mass roughly the size of Delaware.[9] The Gulf of Mexico watershed covers 56 percent of the continental United States (see ""Gulf of Mexico Watershed Extent in the United States"").[10] The Mississippi River Basin alone drains an estimated 40 percent of the continental United States.[11] Excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and pollutants flowing into the Gulf from upstream basins degrade water quality in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, the Gulf's estuaries have become increas-ingly degraded for both human use and aquatic life. Recognizing the importance of the Gulf of Mexico and its ecosystems, and in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the recommendations proposed by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus in America's Gulf Coast: A Long Term Recovery Plan After the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (September 2010), President Barack Obama established the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force on October 5, 2010.[12] The purpose of the task force is to coordinate the long-term conservation and restoration of America's Gulf Coast. The task force consists of senior officials from seven federal cabinet agencies, the Executive Office of the President, and representatives from the five Gulf Coast states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. As part of its mandate, the task force is charged with developing a Gulf of Mexico Regional Ecosystem Restoration Strategy to drive action and guide the long-term collaboration that will be necessary to effectively address and reverse widespread environmental degradation and to ensure a healthy environment and economic future for the Gulf. This Strategy considers the important observations and recommendations proposed in the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and offshore drilling report to the President: Deep Water, The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling, published January 2011 (also called the Oil Spill Commission Report).[13] The Strategy: Overarching Goals and Framework for Restoration Many of the Gulf's challenges are complex and long-standing, and addressing the problems will require sustained and consistent effort over time. The task force's Strategy was developed through a review of existing plans and efforts and significant public outreach during the last year. The Strategy builds on ongoing work and priorities of each of the Gulf Coast states, local communities, federal partners, academics and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The restoration framework consists of four overarching goals to guide the collective actions at the local, state and federal levels that are necessary to reverse the ongoing decline and restore the Gulf Coast's ecosystem. The task force's goals for the Gulf Coast restoration effort are the following: • Restore and conserve habitat • Restore water quality • Replenish and protect living coastal and marine resources • Enhance community resilience The Strategy includes enhanced community resilience as a goal in order to highlight the connectedness of ecosystem restoration with the well-being and sustainability of coastal communities. This goal also emphasizes the planning and technical assistance needs of vulnerable coastal communities as they assess risks, plan for and rebound from natural disasters, and implement sustainable development approaches. As progress is made to improve water quality and protect and enhance the Gulf of Mexico's habitats and resources, communities benefit from improved ecosystem services, such as better storm protection and healthier fisheries. A key function of the task force is to help advance state, federal and tribal activities that will achieve the overarching restoration goals. The task force intends to help member agencies address process and other barriers, facilitate program implementation and alignment, and better leverage scientific expertise and fiscal resources in support of Gulf Coast restoration. In addition to encouraging better collaboration among state and federal agencies and tribal entities, partnerships play an integral role in restoring ecosystem functions throughout the Gulf region. The task force believes it is critically important to foster an inclusive dialogue and expand on public-private partnerships in order to achieve ecosystem restoration in the Gulf of Mexico. Major Actions Within each of the four goals, the task force has identified specific actions that require the most immediate attention, and that will build the initial foundation for an effective regional partnership framework. These are articulated in the following table: Major Actions Goal: Restore and Conserve Habitat • Prioritize ecosystem restoration in the Gulf of Mexico by ensuring that social, environmental and economic outcomes are fully considered in all river management decisions, and by placing it on equal footing with other priorities such as navigation and flood damage risk reduction. • Improve current sediment management practices to maximize to the extent practicable and ecologically acceptable the quantity and effective use of sediments by taking a ""strategic use"" approach to sediment management. • Restore and preserve more natural river processes of sediment and freshwater distribution. • Expand the network of state, federal and private conservation areas to ensure healthy landscapes that support the environment and culture of the region and the diverse services provided by the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. • Restore and conserve coastal and near-shore habitats, with a focus on marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, barrier islands, natural beaches and dunes, and coastal forests and prairies. Goal: Restore Water Quality • Decrease and manage excess nutrient levels in the Gulf through the development and implementation of state nutrient reduction frameworks. • Focus restoration actions in priority watersheds to address excess nutrients in coastal waters and reduce hypoxic conditions. • Reduce pollutants and pathogens from stormwater flows and other sources. • Improve the quality and quantity of freshwater flow into priority estuaries to protect their health and resiliency. • Coordinate and expand existing water quality monitoring efforts supporting adaptive management of programs and projects designed to improve water quality. • Collaborate with Mexico to assess and reduce emissions from oceangoing vessels in the Gulf that degrade water quality. Goal: Replenish and Protect Living Coastal and Marine Resources • Restore depleted populations of living coastal and marine resources. • Conserve and protect offshore environments. • Restore and protect oyster and coral reefs, and other coastal environments. • Coordinate and expand existing Gulf monitoring efforts to track sentinel species and sites. • Minimize, and eliminate where possible, invasive species that impact the Gulf of Mexico. Goal: Enhance Community Resilience • Develop and implement comprehensive, scientifically based, and stakeholder-informed coastal improvement programs. • Provide analytical support tools to enhance community planning, risk assessment and smart growth implementation. • Enhance environmental education and outreach. The task force recognizes the value of intergovernmental collaboration, the need for dedicated funding for large landscape-level restoration efforts, and the importance of a strong scientific foundation for restoration. Accordingly, the task force reiterates recommendations made by Secretary Mabus that call for Congress to: • Formalize the long-term intergovernmental partnership among the Gulf Coast states and the federal government by establishing a successor coordinating body to the task force. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Throughout the centuries, the human society has evolved by increasingly using energy to the point where the consumption of energy is necessary for the functioning of the contemporary society, the prosperity of the nations and the survival of our civilization. Energy is produced and is being used in different forms: airplanes and automobiles use liquid hydrocarbon fuels; electric power plants convert primarily the energy in coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydroelectric into electricity; and a contemporary household uses electricity and natural gas for domestic comfort, entertainment and the preparation of meals. Because most functions of our society are based on the use of energy, elaborate networks of energy supply have been developed in the last three centuries: electricity is fed into communities by the transmission lines of the electric grid at high voltage; natural gas by a complex system of pipelines, which transcend national boundaries; and tanker ships crisscross the oceans daily to supply crude oil to refineries. The economic impact of the energy supply and the energy trade is of paramount importance to all nations. The geopolitical activities of most modern nations are significantly influenced by their need for a constant and secure energy supply. Most of modern wars (those after 1950) have been fought for the control and security of energy supplies and many treaties and international agreements have been cemented with energy resources as the primary issue. This is a general chapter on energy, not just alternative energy, which explains in a quantitative way what is the quantity we call ""energy,"" whence it comes and where it goes. The forms that energy is produced and consumed are, first, explained. The several units that are commonly used for different energy forms and quantities are listed and their equivalencies are explained. Secondly, the importance of energy in the economic activities of the contemporary society is described qualitatively and the primary energy resources are identified. The current energy trade between groups of nations is also described briefly and the main flow of primary energy resources is identified. Thirdly, historical data on energy production and consumption in several groups of nations are offered as well as some acceptable predictions for the future demand and supply of energy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,"Aircraft; Coal industry; Commerce; Electric lines; Energy security; Fossil fuel power plants; Hydroelectric power plants; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Oils and fats; Personal computers; Vehicle-to-grid; Alternative energy; Consumption of energy; Economic activities; Energy productions; Human civilization; Liquid hydrocarbon fuel; Primary energy resources; Wireless internet; Hydroelectric and nuclear combined power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884251938

After all nuclear power plants and nuclear energy have been the pariahs in every environmentalist's mind for decades. The accidents at the Three-Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima Dai-ichi power plants have contributed to the horrific images of large-scale environmental disasters. The answer to this question is very simple: Global warming, caused by the anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide is a very serious threat for our planet. Nuclear power plants have the capability to produce a significant part of our electric power at relatively low cost and without any carbon dioxide emissions. A case in point: If in 2008 the United States would have produced 50%, of its electric power from nuclear energy, instead of approximately 25% it actually produced, the country would have exceeded by 150% its quota from the Kyoto Protocol without any other changes in the rest of its energy mix. Other OECD countries, such as France and Japan produce more than 70% of their electricity from nuclear power plants. The fundamental concepts of atomic physics with emphasis on the nuclear fission reactions are given in this chapter. At first, the structure of the atom is explained, basic definitions of the atom and the subatomic particles are given succinctly and useful numbers pertaining to the atoms and the nuclear reactions are calculated. Secondly, the nuclear reactions are introduced and the physical principles governing these reactions are explained. Examples of nuclear reactions include radioactive decay and carbon dating. Thirdly, the several ways of interaction of neutrons with nuclei are explained and fission is introduced. The subjects of nuclear fission, chain reactions, nuclear fuels and thermal neutrons are explained in detail. The role of the cross-sections of the naturally occurring nuclear fuels is explained in the fission process as well as in the sustenance of the chain reaction in conventional reactors. The neutron cycle in a nuclear reactor and the striving for the production and conservation of the thermal neutrons are elucidated. Fourthly, the basic concepts of fuel conversion and breeding are given as an introduction to breeder reactors. Finally, a few useful numbers are computed on the utilization of natural uranium as a fuel in the conventional nuclear reactors. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,"Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Electric power plants; Fission reactions; Global warming; Neutron logging; Neutrons; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear reactions; Nuclear reactor accidents; Nuclear reactors; Anthropogenic emissions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Conventional reactors; Environmental disasters; Fundamental concepts; Naturally occurring; Physical principles; Subatomic particles; Nuclear power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884218967

In such transition, conflicts are emerging among the national and local governments, energy producers, environmental conservationists, energy producers, and energy consumers. Negotiations among these parties take place. In the area of energy and climate change, negotiation on capital investment, energy prices, electricity tariffs, rates of pollutant emission charges, carbon emission reduction quotas, and certified emission reductions become indicators. Involving many negotiators and multiple indicators, negotiation issues in energy-environmental systems in countries with economy in transition become complicated and time-consuming. Advanced planning methodologies and skilled resource persons in negotiation are badly needed for the negotiators to prepare good negotiation proposals. This research aims at simulating negotiation process in energy-environmental systems with computer models. A methodological framework termed Negotiation-coordination in Energy-Environmental Planning (NEEP) is established to analyze the complex relationships among the multiple actors, quantify the intricate trade-offs of the various indicators, and facilitate the process of negotiations.

The reduction of carbon emission was estimated on the assumption that MSW separate collection was carried out well in Liuzhou, of which the result was 3.32×10 8kg CO 2-eq. for the whole year, showing the multiple benefits of separate collection in the social, economic and environmental aspects.","Carbon emission reduction; Liuzhou; Municipal solid waste(MSW); Separate collection","Carbon emissions; Environmental aspects; Estimation process; Liuzhou; Low-carbon; Positive effects; Sanitary landfill; Treatment process; Waste composition; Biotechnology; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Land fill; Separation; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Municipal solid waste",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84455206508

Recent achievements in the development of advanced ND applications present new demands to ND quality: purity, homogeneity of primary particle dimensions and surface area chemistry. ND produced by state-of-the-art technology of detonation synthesis doesn't meet requirements for biomedical and optical applications. Therefore, alternative methods of ND synthesis from pure carbon raw materials enabling to control the process are of especial importance. The novel technology for ND laser synthesis has been developed by Ray Techniques Ltd. The method is based on high-intensive laser radiation treatment of the specially prepared target containing non-diamond carbon soot and hydrocarbons, placed in a liquid media. As a result, carbon atoms collect to form a cubic diamond crystalline lattice. To reach that, the appropriate parameters of the laser radiation, special composition of the target and the liquid media, as well as the treatment procedures were determined. The ""winning"" combination of these factors enables to obtain pure nanodiamonds (RayND). In contrast to the existing technology, the RT method is highly controllable, environment-friendly and efficient. RayND obtained under different conditions were studied and compared with detonation ND currently available at the market. It is proved that the higher level of purity and homogeneity of RayND constitutes significant advantages for most ND applications. Using RayND opens new frontiers in biomedicine (drug- and gene-delivery and bio-imaging agents), electronic industry (abrasives for wafer polishing, heat-conductive electrical-insulating compounds, CVD coatings, emitters, etc) and optics (displays, protective transparent films, laser lenses, optical windows and filters). © 2012 Materials Research Society.",,"Alternative methods; Crystalline lattice; Detonation synthesis; Electronic industries; Environment friendly; Optical applications; Radiation treatments; State-of-the-art technology; Carbon; Intelligent agents; Laser radiation; Laser windows; Lenses; Liquids; Neodymium lasers; Technology; Nanodiamonds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879255249

Only stomatal pits and cuticular details are preserved. Comparison of these preservation states, based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, and flash pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS), demonstrate sufficient differences in chemistry to be able to link the two preservation states with differing pathways of organic matter transformation (diagenesis). The aliphatic-hydrocarbon chains of the cuticles are comparatively shorter and more branched than the longer chains of the compressions. Py-GC/MS results support the presence of hydrocarbon markers of plant cuticles. The high abundances of C1 and -C2 alkylphenols and C1 and -C2 alkylbenzenes in pyrolysates are likely derived from maturing lignin or lignin-like biomacromolecules.

However, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is getting more and more important as future legislation and increasing customer demands ask for lower fuel consumption. One possible technology for CO2 reduction which is widely used in automotive applications is downsizing by reducing the engine capacity and increasing the specific power by charging strategies. Focusing on power sport applications, like motor-cycles, the automotive downsizing technologies cannot be transferred without major modifications. The essential difference to automotive applications is the extraordinary response behavior of today's motor-cycles, as well as the large engine speed spread. Additionally, packaging and cost reasons exclude the direct transfer of highly complex automotive technology, like two-stage charging, cam-phasing, etc. to motorcycle applications. This publication treats the conceptual design and layout of a charged 800cm3 two-cylinder motorcycle engine with the demand of excellent drivability, power and response. In detail, the paper deals with the layout of an exhaust turbo charging system for an inline two cylinder engine where the achievement of an appropriate response behavior is of particular importance. As reference for the transient behavior a turbo charged automotive engine has been chosen. The benchmarks for the transient behavior have been a state of the art naturally aspirated motorcycle on one hand and an automotive TC engine on the other hand. Based on these targets, a previously presented simulation strategy [1] for the selection of the different hardware components has been applied. Stationary and transient 1D-CFD simulations as well as 3D-CFD and coupled simulations have been performed and various modifications on the engine and the periphery have been carried out for prototyping.

Over the last decade significant improvements have been made in numerical modelling of the complex, coupled processes involved. Among the many remaining issues where progress is still called for, is the consistent simulation of impacts of gas mixtures. In particular the presence of 'impurities' or 'co-contaminants' in the injected CO2 stream that are retained from the original flue-gases, such as H2S and SO2, have the potential, upon dissolution in the pore water, to alter aqueous and water-mineral reactions. Moreover, presence of these and other injected or in situ gases (e.g. CH4) affect CO2 solubility and thermodynamic properties of the fluid and gas phases, which, in turn, impact transport processes. As an important step towards evaluation of the impact of gas mixtures on these processes, a new Equation of State (EOS) has been developed which allows accurate and efficient modelling of thermodynamic equilibrium of gas mixtures and brines over a large range of pressure, temperature and salinity conditions. Presently the new EOS includes CO2, SO2, H2S, CH4 and N2. This model is based on equating the chemical potentials in the system, using the Peng-Robinson EOS to calculate the fugacity of the gas phase. The model performs favourably with respect to existing EOS's and experimental data for single gas systems and accurately reproduces available data sets for gas mixtures. Preliminary analysis shows, amongst others, that CO2 solubility is most sensitive to CH4 admixture and least sensitive to the presence of SO2 in the injected gas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Activity coefficient; Brine; Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS); Equation of State (EOS); Solubility; Thermodynamic model","Carbon capture and storage; Coupled process; Data sets; Depleted gas reservoir; Effects of impurities; Equation of state; Gas phasis; Gas systems; Gasphase; Peng-Robinson EOS; Pore waters; Preliminary analysis; Reactive process; Saline aquifers; Thermodynamic equilibria; Thermodynamic model; Transport process; Activity coefficients; Aquifers; Brines; Carbon capture; Digital storage; Gas mixtures; Gases; Hydrogeology; Impurities; Mixtures; Solubility; Sulfur dioxide; Thermodynamic properties; Carbon dioxide; activity coefficient; aquifer; brine; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; computer simulation; equation of state; gas phase reaction; hydrogen sulfide; methane; numerical model; solubility; sulfur dioxide; thermodynamic property; transport process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869208406

Stem CO2 efflux was investigated with an open gas exchange system while stand microclimate and stem temperature were continuously monitored in aSchima superbaplantation in South China for several days in August and December 2010. The temperature response of respiration in the different seasons, the vertical variation in stem CO2 efflux along the stem, and the stand-level stem CO2 efflux were examined. Stem volume was identified as the better correlate for stem CO2 efflux and was used as the scalar for the stand-level estimates of stem CO2 efflux in thisS. superbaplantation. Volume-based stem CO2 efflux was higher at 2 m than at 1.3 m. Mean stem CO2 efflux was 268.9 and 104.6 μmol m-3 s-1 in August and December, respectively, indicating a dramatic seasonal variation of stem CO2 efflux. The temperature response of stem CO2 efflux remained constant during our study period with Q 10 values of 1.9 and 1.8. In this subtropical S. superba plantation, stem CO2 efflux per unit ground area averaged 3.36 and 1.26 μmol m-2 s-1 based on the measurement data at 1.3-m height of the stem in August and December, respectively. Our results suggest that stem CO2 efflux has a constant temperature response, and the seasonal variation in stem CO2 efflux is mainly controlled by stem temperature, and the vertical variation in stem CO2 efflux needs to be considered in the stand-level estimation. © 2012 Author(s).",,"carbon dioxide; carbon flux; evergreen forest; forest ecosystem; gas exchange; microclimate; net ecosystem exchange; plantation forestry; respiration; stem; subtropical region; temperature effect; temperature profile; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867439279

In order for government agencies and design engineers to incorporate these trends and future changes into assessment and design processes, tools for planning and design should be capable of considering nonstationary climate conditions. In this work, potential changes are investigated in intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, which are often used for assessment of extreme rainfall events, using historic data and future climate projections. An approach is proposed for calculating IDF curves that incorporates projected changes in rainfall intensity at a range of locations in the United States. The results elucidate strong regional patterns in projected changes in rainfall intensity, which are influenced by the rainfall characteristics of the region. Therefore, impacts of climate change on extreme hydrologic events will be highly regional and thus such assessments should be performed for specific project locations.© IWA Publishing 2012.","Areal reduction factor; Climate change; Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships; North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867000638

China has become the biggest CO2 emitter in the world since 2006. As a major CO 2 emission source in China, power industry is facing greater pressure for carbon emission abatement. By applying various low-carbon power technologies and mechanisms, the potential for CO2 emission reduction in power systems is considerable. In this paper, the major low-carbon factors in power systems are identified to reveal the possible low-carbon benefits from different sectors. The tested factors include DSM, smart grid technologies, low-carbon generation technologies, utilization of low-carbon energy and low-carbon power dispatch. Corresponding evaluation methods are then proposed to analyze the low-carbon benefits from different sources quantitatively. On this basis, a general, comprehensive assessment model is developed, which reasonably integrates different kinds of low-carbon benefits in power systems while eliminating overlapped effects. Finally, a numerical case based on data of the Yunnan provincial power system is studied to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2012 IEEE.","assessment model; carbon emission analysis; evaluation method; Low-carbon benefit; power systems","Assessment models; Carbon emissions; Case based; Comprehensive assessment model; Emission reduction; Emission sources; Environmental issues; evaluation method; Evaluation methods; Generation technologies; Low-carbon; Power dispatch; Power industry; Power technologies; Smart grid; Emission control; Power generation; Standby power systems; Technology; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873302429

Oxidation of an organic carbon and reduction of an oxidant such as oxygen, sulfate and nitrate in the cytoplasm of a microbe. This respiration process provides energy for various cellular activities and maintenance as well as building blocks for organic syntheses. Because the cellular respiration efficiency is around 40, 60% of the energy is released in the form of unrecoverable low-grade heat. No electricity is produced from the redox reaction because the electrons released by the oxidation reaction are taken up locally by the reduction reaction in the cytoplasm. The purpose of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) is to harvest the electrons from organic carbon oxidation by employing electrogenic microbes to donate the electrons to an anode in the absence of an utilizable oxidant around the anode. The electrons flow through an external circuit to drive a load before returning to a cathode where they are used for reduction of an oxidant. MFCs can digest low-grade organic carbon sources while yielding high Coulombic efficiencies. They present a potentially attractive alternative for the sustainable production of bioenergy and bioproducts from renewable organic feed streams through biocatalysis by microorganisms. In recent years, heightened concerns over depleting fossil fuel supplies, most noticeably petroleum, and global warming due to increased carbon emission, many efforts have been devoted to MFC research to debottleneck various factors that hamper practical applications of MFCs. Although no large-scale applications have been reported, the improvements in MFC designs and operations have made MFCs closer to eventual practical applications in the production of bioenergy and bioproducts from feed streams that are typically wastes such as wastewater. This chapter reviews various advances in the understanding of MFC mechanisms, reactor designs and operations for improved production of renewable bioenergy and bioproducts such as hydrogen, methane, hydrogen peroxide and ethanol. The limitations, areas for improvement and perspectives for future outlooks of MFCs are also discussed. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012.",,"Anodes; Bacteria; Biochemistry; Bioproducts; Electrons; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Organic carbon; Oxidants; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Sulfur compounds; Cellular activities; Cellular respiration; Coulombic efficiency; Large-scale applications; Organic synthesis; Oxidation reactions; Reduction reaction; Sustainable production; Microbial fuel cells",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883159361

We have analysed CO2 concentration in a soil profile and soil CO2 efflux in three typical forests in subtropical China: monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (BF, 400 years old), pine and broad-leaved mixed forest (MF, 80 years old), and pine forest (PF, 70 years old). A portable soil CO2 sampler of simple sample operation was designed and used. The seasonal patterns of soil surface CO2 efflux and soil CO2 concentration were observed, and were positively correlated with rainfall, soil temperature, and moisture. The mean values of soil CO2 concentrations at the 15, 30, 45, and 60cm soil depth were higher in BF (3368-9243 μLL-1) than in MF (1495-7662 μLL-1) and PF (1566-5730 μLL-1), while the mean values of soil surface CO2 efflux (Rsurface) were 0.55±0.11gm-2h-1 in BF, 0.52±0.10gm -2h-1 in MF, and 0.45±0.07gm-2h -1 in PF. Soil CO2 concentration and Rsurface increased gradually with the age of the forests, but the incremental increase in soil CO2 concentration will be greater than that of Rsurface in MF and PF compared with BF.

Plant specific data were gathered to analyze emissions from both direct and indirect sources. In 2010, ABWWTF emitted an estimated 17,396 tons of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent), which includes 64% (11,126 tons) from electricity use, 13% (2,303 tons) from lime use, 11% (1,860 tons) from nitrogen removal, 6% (990 tons) from sludge handling, and 4% (744 tons) from BOD removal. The handling of solid wastes and related fuel use (gasoline, diesel, and natural gas) accounted for 2% (373 tons) of total emissions in 2010. ABWWTF could lower its carbon footprint primarily by minimizing electrical consumption through high efficiency motors utilized in its largest pumps and blowers. This case study illustrates how to carbon footprint a full-scale wastewater treatment facility. This work can be expanded to include other emissions such as the fuel use from transporting chemicals to the plant, so carbon footprinting the plant can become more comprehensive and complete. © 2012 Water Environment Federation.","Carbon footprint; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Wastewater treatment plant","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lime; Natural gasoline plants; Nitrogen removal; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Carbon footprinting; Electrical consumption; Electricity use; Greenhouse gas (GHG); High efficiency motors; Total emissions; Wastewater treatment facilities; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070439885

In the furnace, the vacuum degree should be controlled at 500Pa, while the temperature needs to be heated to 700°C and keep the temperature for 60min in order to dewater the crystal water; And then continue to rise the temperature to 1500°C and keep the temperature for 60min which can deoxidize the element Fe and Ni in the serpentine breeze to metallic iron and metallic nickel, while metallic magnesium become vapor magnesium and then crystal to metallic magnesium at the condenser. Metallic iron and nickel in the furnace slag can be recovered through magnetic concentration and the furnace slag after magnetic concentration can be inverted to silicon carbide through carbothermic method. Serpentine breeze(Mg6[Si 4O10](OH)8) is a kind of natural silicate mineral with magnesium, and it is the metamorphic rock of olivine, whose structure level is double layer consists of single-glassed silica tetrahedron and single-glassed bruited octahedron. And its theoretical composition has 43.0% of MgO, 44.1% of SiO2 and 12.9% of H2O. In China, its storage capacity is much more than 5 billion tons. Its distribution is extensive and grade is high and it is very abundant in China. At present, except for metallurgical accessories, it can be also used for producing powdered materials [1-3] such as magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, porous silicon and white carbon black, etc. There are two primary methods for smelting the metallic magnesium: electrolytic process and thermal recovery process. More than 98 percents of metallic magnesium is produced by thermal recovery process in nowadays China, and only in Minhe magnesium factory in Qinghai province the magnesium is produced using electrolytic process; The application foreground of thermal recovery process is much more extensive because [4-6] carbon reducer can be easily gotten for its cheap price and carbon can be used for fuel and it is also excellent conductor of electricity and thermal for achieving the desired temperature. At present, the primary rough material of producing magnesium is magnesium oxide, and there are no reports of producing magnesium with direct reductive reduction to serpentine.

The objective is to quantify the spray's cycle-to-cycle variation such that further insight of the operating principles in the fuel injection system could be developed to enhance the combustion efficiency and reduce emissions of SIDI engines. The experiments were carried out using a multi-hole SIDI fuel injector under an extended range of test conditions in a spray chamber. Using a strobe light as an illumination source, images of the spray structure were taken by a CCD camera. The analysis approach of the cycle-to-cycle variation was based on constructing two types of images, namely, 1) Ensemble Image, and 2) Probability Presence Image (PPI). The analysis of the ensemble image and PPI reveals that both approaches can be used to extract the variations of the spray structure. While an ensemble image is useful for determining the quantitative variation of the spray characteristics, such as the penetration and spray angle, in terms of average, maximum and minimum limits, a PPI provides a new way to examine the spray variation in terms of a probability defined for the presence of the liquid region. Not only a PPI is able to illustrate the magnitude of cycle-to-cycle variation in penetration and spray angle values quantitatively, it also displays the variations qualitatively in a two-dimensional manner in terms of the liquid presence probability. © ICLASS 2012 - 12th Inte.

The result shows that: (1) The competitiveness of low-carbon economy is various in province level, it shows one trend of low in west, high in south, and local hopping; (2) There is an obviously intimate relationship among between low-carbon economy competitiveness and regional economy development and mineral resources;(3) China regional low-carbon economy coordinated ability is poor, the area that development level and low-carbon level stay coordinated is not much. Therefore, in the future, China government should strengthen the management, control and guidance of carbon emissions gradually, and choose the key region, not only to support region to reduce carbon emission, but also to support its economic development to get a high level. © 2012 TSI Press.","competitiveness; low-Carbon economy; principal component analysis","Carbon emissions; competitiveness; Economic competitiveness; Economic development; Evaluation index; GHG emission; Low carbon economy; Low-carbon; Principal component analysis method; Regional economy; Competition; Developing countries; Greenhouse gases; Mineral resources; Principal component analysis; Regional planning; Environmental management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870804377

A high-resolution NH3 emission inventory was developed based on state-of-the-science techniques, up-to-date information, and advanced expert knowledge for the Pearl River Delta region, China. To provide model-ready emissions input, this NH 3 emissions inventory was spatially allocated to 3 km × 3 km grid cells using source-based spatial surrogates with geographical information system (GIS) technology. For NH3 emissions, 9 source categories and 45 subcategories were identified in this region, and detailed spatial and temporal characteristics were investigated. Results show that livestock is by far the most important NH3 emission source by contributing about 61.7% of the total NH3 emissions in this region, followed by nitrogen fertilizer applications (∼23.7%) and non-agricultural sources (∼14.6%). Uncertainty analysis reveals that the uncertainties associated with different sources vary from source to source and the magnitude of the uncertainty associated with a specific source mainly depends on the degree of accuracy of the emission factors and activity data as well as the technique used to perform the estimate. Further studies should give priority to the hog, broiler, goose subsectors of the livestock source and N fertilizer application source in order to reduce uncertainties of ammonia emission estimates in this region. The validity of the NH3 emissions inventory is justified by the trend analysis of local precipitation compositions, such as pH values, the Ca 2++NH4+/SO4-2+ NO- 3 ratios, and NH4+ concentrations which are directly or indirectly related to NH3 emissions. © 2012 Author(s).",,"agricultural emission; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; pollutant source; precipitation (chemistry); spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Anser",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876802130

An EAS has three primary subsystems, Aftertreatment hardware, controls and fluid delivery. Fluid delivery is the subsystem which supplies urea into exhaust stream to allow SCR catalytic reaction and/or periodic DOC diesel dosing to elevate exhaust temperatures for diesel particulate filter (DPF) soot regeneration. The purpose of this paper is to discuss various aspects of fluid delivery system development from flow and pressure perspective. It starts by giving an overview of the system requirements and outlining theoretical background; then discusses overall design considerations, injector and pump selection criteria, and three main injector layouts. Steady state system performance was studied for manifold layout. The transient pressure fluctuations from injector activations and deactivations were measured by using both pressure gauges and high frequency sampling devices. It is observed that a low pressure common rail demonstrates high level of pressure fluctuations; therefore countermeasures such as hardware changes and control software options were implemented. Along with measurements, CFD models and flow network models were developed and compared to test data. The discrepancy between tests and modeling were analyzed and reviewed. Multiple designs of experiments by tests and modeling were carried out to study specific system performance and design parameters. Recommendations were provided with respect to reducing pressure fluctuations and maintaining stable steady state pressure.

As atmospheric CO2 is the most important source of soluble CO2 in water due to the deliberate CO2 sequestration, global CO2 elevation would significantly alter carbonate chemical environments of aquatic ecosystems. When atmospheric CO2 concentration doubles at the end of century, it is predicted that pH value of surface oceans would drop approximately 0.3 units, the concentration of bicarbonate ion would increase by 6%, and carbonate ion concentration would decrease by 50%. Considering the smaller buffering capacity of freshwater ecosystems than that of oceans, carbonate chemical environments of freshwater lakes and rivers may change more notably after the increase of CO2 level. The shift of carbonate chemistry would in turn have dramatic effects on aquatic ecosystems. Phytoplankton has been used widely as an indicator of changes of aquatic ecosystems because this relatively short-lived organism responds rapidly to subtle changes. Meanwhile, it contributes approximately 50% of the total global primary productivity, which plays a vital role in global carbon cycling. Therefore, the physiological and ecological responses of phytoplankton to global CO2 elevation would have great significance on water ecosystems and biogeochemical cycle. Elevated carbon resource could enhance the photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton, particularly small phytoplankton or non-CCM (non-carbon concentration mechanism) phytoplankton. When CO2 level increases, the cell size of phytoplankton would potentially decrease, and the elemental ratio of carbon to nitrogen in phytoplankton cell would increase up to more than 10%. Then, those changes in the individual phytoplankton cell would cause certain variations in the ecological level. Primary productivity would rise significantly as a result of enhanced photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton. The shift in assemblage composition of phytoplankton, and the variation of elemental ratio could affect the edibility of phytoplankton, which would alter the abundances and the community structure of zooplankton. Furthermore, the accumulating concentration of organic carbon in water would promote the growth and reproduction of heterotrophic bacterioplankton, which would strengthen the competition between bacterioplankton and phytoplankton for nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. More importantly, elevated CO2 effects differ between oligotrophic and eutrophic water body. It is expected that effects on algal productivity in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems could be potentially larger, since in eutrophic water the input of nitrogen and phosphorus to the global biochemical cycle exceeds that of the carbon input by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we summarized the development of the methodology for studying the effect of enhanced CO2 level on water ecosystems. Long-term in situ simulating experiment would be the best approach for studying the effect of enhanced CO2 on natural phytoplankton community. In future research, picophytoplankton will attract more attention, since they are sensitive to the change of CO2 level compared with large ones because of their high surface-area-to-volume ratio. In addition, more efforts should be exerted for freshwater ecosystems with respect to elevated CO2 effects, as they are far less investigated than marine ecosystems even though they are closely linked to the survival of human being.","Community structure; Elemental stoichiometry; Elevated CO2; Phytoplankton; Primary productivity","air-water interaction; bacterioplankton; bicarbonate; biogeochemical cycle; buffering; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; community structure; eutrophic environment; freshwater ecosystem; marine ecosystem; net primary production; pH; physiological response; phytoplankton; stoichiometry; survival; zooplankton; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869477379

In England, the Demonstration Test Catchments (DTCs) have been established to provide a basis for testing on-farm mitigation measures using collaborative multi-partner research and some of this work is targeting the Hampshire Avon (∼1700km2) catchment. To help provide integrated farm advice across England and Wales, a new Excel-based tool, FARM Scale Optimisation of Pollutant Emission Reductions (FARMSCOPER), has recently been developed for characterising diffuse agricultural pollutant emissions from representative farm types and quantifying the expected impacts of control options on those losses to the environment. Against this background, this paper describes the application of FARMSCOPER in the Hampshire Avon DTC in order to assess its utility at catchment scale and the potential benefits of relevant and practical mitigation options. Spatial datasets and the Agricultural Census returns for 2009 specific to the River Avon catchment were integrated to produce a collection of representative farm types which capture the characteristics of the local physical environment, land use patterns and farm management practices. FARMSCOPER was used to estimate the annual emissions of nitrate, phosphorus, sediment, nitrous oxide, methane and ammonia for each representative farm type. The scenarios investigated comprised baseline losses with no mitigation measures implemented, current emissions using information on the present implementation of options under existing schemes and initiatives and, the maximum potential reduction possible on the basis of implementing all available and relevant options. Model outputs suggested that reductions in pollutant loads in response to the existing uptake of mitigation methods are small (e.g. 10% for phosphorus, 7% for sediment, 4% for nitrate and 5% for nitrous oxide).

This study reports volatile organic compounds measured in the PRD during November-December in both 2007 before the FC and 2008 after the FC. While total mixing ratios of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) on average were only about 7% lower from 40.2 ppbv in 2007 to 37.5 ppbv in 2008, their ozone formation potentials (OFPs) dropped about 30%, resulting from about 55% plummet of aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) against a greater than 20% increase of total alkanes/alkenes. The elevated alkanes and alkenes in 2008 could be explained by greater emissions from vehicle exhausts and LPG combustion due to rapid increase of vehicle numbers and LPG consumption; the drop of AHs could be explained by reduced emissions from industries using AH-containing solvents due to the influence of the FC, as indicated by much lower ratios of toluene to benzene and of xylenes/ trichloroethylene/tetrachloroethylene to carbon monoxide (CO) in 2008. Source apportionment by positive matrix factorization (PMF) also revealed much less contribution of industry solvents to total anthropogenic NMHCs and particularly to toluene and xylenes in 2008 than in 2007. Based on PMF reconstructed source contributions, calculated OFPs by industrial emissions were responsible for 40.8% in 2007 in contrast to 18.4% in 2008. Further investigation into local industry output statistics suggested that the plummet of AHs in 2008 should be attributed to small enterprises, which contributed largely to ambient AHs due to their huge numbers and non-existent emission treatment, but were much more influenced by the FC. © 2012.

Drawing upon field work undertaken in the author's native Shenyang, China, this research reports upon the natural process of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere into urban ecosystems. The risks associated within carbon sequestration in urban ecosystems are investigated and utilised the analysis of ecological carbon cycle status and integrated climate policy with reference to the sustainable development of urban planning. The primary method of this paper is the ecologically-based life assessment of urban ecosystems relevant to tackling barriers for developing carbon sequestration. A geographical information system (GIS) tool is used in the analysis of risk appraisal from the field of ecological distribution in urban areas. The collected data from a series of calculations related to urban ecological footprint and industrial metabolism analysis prove that the risks to develop carbon sequestration are caused by human activities and urban carbon cycle imbalance. Consequently, the current urban terrestrial ecosystems are inadequate for reducing air pollution and achieving environmental sustainability in the urban area of Shenyang, China. Climate policy and reforestation plans are proposed for ultimately reducing carbon emissions to city planners.

It is not clear why the estimated impact is stronger or weaker in certain urban areas and how effective a proposed land use change/policy will be in changing certain travel behavior. This knowledge gap has made it difficult for decision makers to evaluate land use plans and policies according to their impact on vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and consequently, their impact on congestion mitigation, energy conservation, and pollution and greenhouse gas emission reduction. This research has several objectives: (1) re-examine the effects of built-environment factors on travel behavior, in particular, VMT in five US metropolitan areas grouped into four case study areas; (2) develop consistent models in all case study areas with the same model specification and datasets to enable direct comparisons; (3) identify factors such as existing land use characteristics and land use policy decision-making processes that may explain the different impacts of built environment on VMT in different urban areas; and (4) provide a prototype tool for government agencies and decision makers to estimate the impact of proposed land use changes on VMT. The four case study areas include Seattle, WA; Richmond-Petersburg and Norfolk-Virginia Beach, VA; Baltimore, MD; and Washington, DC. Our empirical analysis employs Bayesian multilevel modeling method with various person-level socioeconomic and demographic variables, and five built-environment factors including residential density, employment density, entropy (measuring level of mixed-use development), average block size (measuring transit/walking friendliness), and distance to city center (measuring decentralization and level of infill development). Our findings show that promoting compact, mixed-use, small-block, and infill developments can be effective in reducing VMT per person in all four case study areas. However, the effectiveness of land use plans and policies encouraging these types of land development is different both across case study areas and within the same case study area. We have identified several factors that potentially influence the connection between built environment shifts and VMT changes including urban area size, existing built environment characteristics, transit service coverage and quality, and land use decision-making processes. © 2012 Lei Zhang, Arefeh Nasri, Jin Hyun Hong, and Qing Shen.","Built environment; Land use change; Multilevel Bayesian model; Travel behavior; US urban transportation planning policy; Vehicle miles traveled (VMT)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872016575

Before the implementation of acid gas co-sequestration, the potential of acid gas leakage along existing and abandoned wellbores at target sequestration regions needs to be evaluated. Reactive transport modeling is a powerful tool to mimic the interactions between wellbore cement and CO2 + H2S, so as to evaluate the potential of acid gas leakage along existing and abandoned wellbores. In this study, the interactions between pozzolan-amended wellbore cement and acid gas were simulated using the reactive transport modeling program CrunchFlow. Key simulation outputs include, for example, calcite weight percentage, pH, porosity, pyrite weight percentage and ettringite weight percentage from the exterior to the interior of the pozzolan-amended wellbore cement. To validate model simulation outputs, SEM-BSE and SEM-EDS analyses on real pozzolan-amended cement samples exposed to CO2 and H 2S were conducted. Simulation results are consistent with SEM-BSE and SEM-EDS analyses results from real samples.

In the recently completed Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, a sharp increase in the global mean precipitation around 1998 has been noted. A similar abrupt change also appears in several other reanalyses that have been recently completed. This sharp increase coincides with the introduction of the Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) data into the assimilation system. Based on model simulations to complement the CFSR, this study analyzes the reason behind the sudden jump in precipitation. The outputs from both the CFSR and a simulation with the CFSR's atmospheric component model forced with the observed sea surface temperature and carbon dioxide concentration are used to understand the precipitation abrupt change in the CFSR. The analysis indicates that the change results from (1) the tendency of the forecast (during the assimilation cycle) to drift toward its mean state that is cooler and drier, (2) the tendency of the assimilation to correct the first guess forecast to a wetter analysis, (3) an analysis that the period after 1998 is in an even wetter mean state due to the ingestion of the ATOVS data, and (4) the combination of previous three factors resulting in a abrupt change in precipitation during the assimilation around 1998. The results presented here may also provide the developers of the reanalysis systems further insights about the possible causes for the change in precipitation around 1998.

Major changes have been brought into the model, including new parameterizations for aerosol nucleation and water uptake, an explicit treatment of secondary organic aerosols, modified emission calculations for sea salt and mineral dust, the coupling of aerosol microphysics to a two-moment stratiform cloud microphysics scheme, and alternative wet scavenging parameterizations. These revisions extend the model's capability to represent details of the aerosol lifecycle and its interaction with climate. Nudged simulations of the year 2000 are carried out to compare the aerosol properties and global distribution in HAM1 and HAM2, and to evaluate them against various observations. Sensitivity experiments are performed to help identify the impact of each individual update in model formulation. Results indicate that from HAM1 to HAM 2 there is a marked weakening of aerosol water uptake in the lower troposphere, reducing the total aerosol water burden from 75 Tg to 51 Tg. The main reason is the newly introduced κ-Köhler-theory-based water uptake scheme uses a lower value for the maximum relative humidity cutoff. Particulate organic matter loading in HAM2 is considerably higher in the upper troposphere, because the explicit treatment of secondary organic aerosols allows highly volatile oxidation products of the precursors to be vertically transported to regions of very low temperature and to form aerosols there. Sulfate, black carbon, particulate organic matter and mineral dust in HAM2 have longer lifetimes than in HAM1 because of weaker in-cloud scavenging, which is in turn related to lower autoconversion efficiency in the newly introduced two-moment cloud microphysics scheme. Modification in the sea salt emission scheme causes a significant increase in the ratio (from 1.6 to 7.7) between accumulation mode and coarse mode emission fluxes of aerosol number concentration. This leads to a general increase in the number concentration of smaller particles over the oceans in HAM2, as reflected by the higher Ångström parameters. Evaluation against observation reveals that in terms of model performance, main improvements in HAM2 include a marked decrease of the systematic negative bias in the absorption aerosol optical depth, as well as smaller biases over the oceans in Ångström parameter and in the accumulation mode number concentration. The simulated geographical distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is better correlated with the MODIS data, while the surface aerosol mass concentrations are very similar to those in the old version. The total aerosol water content in HAM2 is considerably closer to the multi-model average from Phase I of the AeroCom intercomparison project. Model deficiencies that require further efforts in the future include (i) positive biases in AOD over the ocean, (ii) negative biases in AOD and aerosol mass concentration in high-latitude regions, and (iii) negative biases in particle number concentration, especially that of the Aitken mode, in the lower troposphere in heavily polluted regions. © 2012 Author(s).",,"aerosol composition; aerosol property; climate modeling; concentration (composition); MODIS; nucleation; oxidation; parameterization; particulate organic matter; relative humidity; satellite data; sea salt; sensitivity analysis; stratiform cloud; water uptake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868686716

The prediction of surface ozone levels plays an important role in the control and the reduction of air pollutants. As model-driven statistical prediction models, hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are rich in mathematical structure and work well in many important applications. Due to the complex structure of HMM, long observation sequences would increase computational load by geometric ratio. In order to reduce training time, wavelet decomposition is used to compress the original observations into shorter ones. During compression step, observation sequences compressed by different wavelet basis functions keep different information content. This may have impact on prediction results. In this paper, ozone prediction performance of HMM based on different wavelet basis functions are discussed. Shannon entropy is employed to measure how much information content is kept in the new sequence compared to the original one. Data from Houston Metropolitan Area, TX are used in this paper.

The primary purpose of this study is to provide an understanding of the effects of late DI on the in-cylinder fuel-air mixture distribution under low-load conditions. It is well known that combustion efficiency is rather low and the associated carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (uHC) emissions are quite high for HCCI engines operated at low-load. DI has the potential to improve the combustion efficiency and reduce emissions by introducing charge stratification to increase local combustion temperatures. To understand and optimize performance, detailed transient information about in-cylinder flow motions, fuel-air mixing, and mixture distributions is required. In this study, the model is validated by comparing the fuel distributions between calculations and measurements made using planar laser induced fluorescence at three different injection timings. Then, it is used to investigate the effects of swirl ratio, injection pressure and included angle of the spray on the fuel distributions after the compression stroke. It is found that the predicted fuel distributions are in a good agreement of with measurements, and that the model is able to reproduce the phenomena observed in the experiments. © ICLASS 2012 - 12th Inte.

Much previous research for forest carbon estimation is based on remote sensing techniques or ecosystem models. Use of pure sample plots for mapping forest carbon distribution has not been paid much attention because of the difficulty in collecting a large number of sample plots and the lack of suitable techniques and methods to accurately interpolate the results from sample plots to all areas without sample plots. Geostatistics has been regarded as a powerful tool for spatial data analysis. Its prerequisite is to have grid-based samples with sufficiently high density. The continuous forest inventory (CFI) system conducted in China can meet the need of Geostatistical analysis. The CFI system takes a province as a population, which the systematic sampling technique is used to allocate permanent sample plots on the ground with sufficient number and density. The sample plots are re-inventoried at every 5-year interval in the past 30 years, providing a sound foundation for analyzing forest carbon dynamic change. However, the CFI sample plots have not been effectively used to estimate forest carbon stocks in previous research. Therefore, this paper employed CFI dataset collected in 2009 and the forest distribution maps to simulate spatial distribution of forest carbon in Zhejiang province with the Geostatistical techniques. There are 4252 permanent sample plots in Zhejiang province. According to the definition of forest, 2528 plots belong to forest and these sample plots are used to calculate forest cover percentage. The rest plots belong to non-forest sample plots, including agriculture, water bodies, infrastructure, non-forest lands, and others. The plot size is 800 m2 with interval distances of 6 km in east-west direction and 4 km in south-north direction between nearby sample plots. In a forest sample plot, trees, bamboo, shrub, and grass are used to calculate carbon stock. In a non-forest sample plot, only tree and bamboo around the fields or residential areas are used to calculate carbon stock. The vegetation carbon stock includes aboveground and underground carbon. The analysis of spatial autocorrelation of forest carbon density in Zhejiang (Global Moran's Ig =0. 2342) indicates that the spatial variation of carbon density appears medium autocorrelation with partially patchy distribution. The results indicate that the Geostatistical technique can be effectively used to examine the spatial variability of forest carbon in Zhejiang province based on CFI data. This research implies the significance for applying CFI data with the Geostatistical methods to examining forest carbon distribution in subtropical regions, especially in the southern collective forest regions of China with fragmented forest stands. The average carbon density in Zhejiang province is 22. 07Mg/ hm2, slightly lower than the carbon density in Sichuan, Fujian, and Hainan. The overall trend of carbon density is high in western part, and gradually decreases in eastern part, similar as the topographic change. The highest carbon density mainly distributes in the southwestern mountainous regions, followed by northwestern and western mountainous regions; and the lowest carbon density distributes in central hills and basins, coastal regions in eastern and southeastern parts, and the plains in northeastern regions. This situation implies the impacts of human-induced factors on forest carbon sequestration. In mountainous regions with relatively high elevation, forest lands have higher carbon density due to high forest cover rates and volumes, while in lower elevation regions, human activities significantly result in forest disturbance. The young plantations often have relatively low carbon density. Therefore, it is important to improve the forest management, especially in the regions with high human activities, in order to increase carbon density and keep forest sustainability.","Forest carbon density; Geostatistics; Spatial distribution","carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; forest cover; forest inventory; geostatistics; global change; human activity; mountain region; residential location; sampling; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; China; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866500720

Implementing these climate change actions requires new partnerships between tourism agencies, business programmes, carbon consultants, and offset providers. This paper assesses collaborative governance of climate change in Australian tourism, with a focus on low-carbon initiatives promoted to tourism operators by state and territory government tourism agencies. The paper compares the climate change initiatives of these tourism agencies based on six key dimensions of governance including: accountability, transparency, involvement, structure, effectiveness, and power [Ruhanen, L., Scott, N., Ritchie, B., & Tkaczynski, A.

While most state and territory tourism agencies provided resources on climate change initiatives for tourism operators there was little accountability for emissions reduction within the agency. Collaborative governance of climate change was also more developed in states with climate change policies, destinations vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (e.g. Great Barrier Reef, Queensland), or dependent on long-haul travellers.

The requirements to meet new and existing emissions limits for HCl, particulate, and mercury all depend on the mode of sulfur at various points throughout a plant. Whenever a change is made, unknown other effects may go unnoticed until the damage is done or the plant cannot meet new stringent regulations. These effects include such important variables such as control device efficiency, mercury train sorbent recovery and emissions, particulate removal efficiency, emissions limits requirements, and bias associated with other reference methodologies such as EPA M5/202 or the Controlled Condensate Method (CCS) for determination of SO 2/SO3 and condensable particulates. It is also imperative to protect downstream equipment from the corrosive effects of H 2SO4 formation and associated emissions. The FTIR allows for continuous monitoring and verification with performance specifications which can be used for chain of custody proof of content. Presently, with new upcoming emissions limitations, coal fired plants are scrambling to determine what is the best strategy to take to meet these challenges. With more testing, it may be made clearer what plant changes will mean for emissions reductions and associated equipment needs.

Together, these developments demonstrate that climate change abatement is not the sole remit of the legislature. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2013.","Carbon reduction; Climate change; Comparison; Legislative/non-legislative schemes",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939787440

The US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program's Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiative Effects Study (CARES) carried out in June 2010 in Central Valley, California, was a comprehensive effort designed to improve this understanding. The primary objective of the field study was to investigate the evolution of secondary organic and black carbon aerosols and their climate-related properties in the Sacramento urban plume as it was routinely transported into the forested Sierra Nevada foothills area. Urban aerosols and trace gases experienced significant physical and chemical transformations as they mixed with the reactive biogenic hydrocarbons emitted from the forest. Two heavily-instrumented ground sites-one within the Sacramento urban area and another about 40 km to the northeast in the foothills area-were set up to characterize the evolution of meteorological variables, trace gases, aerosol precursors, aerosol size, composition, and climate-related properties in freshly polluted and ""aged"" urban air. On selected days, the DOE G-1 aircraft was deployed to make similar measurements upwind and across the evolving Sacramento plume in the morning and again in the afternoon. The NASA B-200 aircraft, carrying remote sensing instruments, was also deployed to characterize the vertical and horizontal distribution of aerosols and aerosol optical properties within and around the plume. This overview provides: (a) the scientific background and motivation for the study, (b) the operational and logistical information pertinent to the execution of the study, (c) an overview of key observations and initial findings from the aircraft and ground-based sampling platforms, and (d) a roadmap of planned data analyses and focused modeling efforts that will facilitate the integration of new knowledge into improved representations of key aerosol processes and properties in climate models. © 2012 Author(s).",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; black carbon; climate change; climate modeling; hydrocarbon; optical property; organic carbon; radiative transfer; transformation; uncertainty analysis; California; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859843930

However, there are concerns regarding RF interference between PLC networks and other radio operators. It is imperative that the interference dynamics of PLC systems be fully understood in advance of any large-scale roll-out. In this work, we experiment with two interference scenarios: notch-infilling due to non-linear mixing and mitigation of radiated emissions using RF chokes. In our controlled test bed environment, we measure RF emissions from the power line devices in the 1 MHz to 30 MHz range. Through the results and simulation, we demonstrate that the effect of non-linear devices may be less of a concern than initially thought, and that simple methods can be employed to control local RF interference. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Controlled tests; Home networking technologies; Non-linear devices; PLC networks; PLC system; Power line communication networks; Power line communications (PLC); Power lines; Radiated emissions; Radiated interference; RF interference; SIMPLE method; Tipping point; Experiments; Interference suppression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872005229

Recent development plans in the upstream provinces include several dams that are either under construction or at the study stage. Implementation of these plans will negatively impact the downstream provinces, which historically have had access to the river. The situation can be exacerbated by the expected climate change impacts on the basin. This study evaluates the possible impacts of upstream development plans and climate change on the natural flow of the Qezelozan-Sefidrood River and designs a reasonable mechanism for fair allocation of streamflow to the riparian parties. First, a watershed model is developed using the Water Evaluation And Planning System (WEAP) software. This model is run for current water allocation and various development and climate change scenarios. The results indicate that the downstream provinces have a high vulnerability to the expected climate and development changes in the basin. To reduce the potential tension, the study treats the problem as a ""bankruptcy problem"" and applies the Adjusted Proportional rule to fairly allocate the available resource (water) to the creditors (conflict parties). © 2012 IEEE.","bankruptcy; climate change; conflict resolution; Qezelozan-Sefidrood Watershed; water allocation","bankruptcy; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Conflict Resolution; Development plans; Fair allocation; Natural flow; Planning systems; Proportional rule; Trans-boundary; Water allocations; Watershed models; Climate change; Cybernetics; Landforms; Watersheds; Rivers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872424562

The wood was most likely brought to the cave as fuel for domestic hearths and also for other purposes, such as animal fodder, construction, or crafts. The subproducts of these activities could also end up in the fire. Unlike pollen, charcoal in an archaeological site is a direct product of human activities, but it also reflects, at least partially, the woody vegetation of the vicinity of the site. The aims of the charcoal analysis at El Miron are (1) to help reconstruct the past vegetation near the site during the Holocene, (2) to assess environmental change through time, (3) to study the diversity of exploited woods, and (4) in combination with other archaeobotanical remains, to develop the ethnoecological modeling of plant resources exploited by humans. El Miron is a large cave located on Monte Pando, at about 250 m above sea level in one of the coastward ranges of the Cantabrian Cordillera, at the eastern edge of the province of Cantabria. It is immediately surrounded by peaks that reach 600-900 m. It is about 100 m above the bed of the Calera river (a tributary of the Ason) and 20 km away from the coast of the Bay of Biscay as the crow flies. Present climatic conditions are oceanic, with mild temperatures and very high rainfall (1,707 mm in Ramales, 80 m above sea level). Good syntheses of the present vegetation of the areas of the Ason basin and adjacent western Vizcaya can be found in Herrera (1995) and Onaindia (1986) respectively. The modern theoretical climax vegetation of the area is assumed to be dominated by forests, which have been decimated by human action. Two important climatic vegetation series that currently grow on well-drained soils are Polysticho setiferi-Fraxineto excelsioris S. and Hyperico pulchri-Querceto roboris S., both with Quercus robus as the main arboreal component of mature phases together with other trees, such as Corylus avellana and Fraxinus excelsior. In siliceous hilly areas with poor, dry soils Melampyro-Querceto pyrenaicae S. is also present, with Quercus pyrenaica as the main arboreal component. In rocky calcareous areas with dry soils Lauro nobilis-Querceto ilicis S. grows. There can be an evergreen forest where Quercus ilex dominates, along other trees such as Phillyrea latifolia, Rhamnus alaternus, and Arbutus unedo. The series of Hyperico androsaemi-Alneto glutinosae S. spreads along the rivers in areas with permanent water. Here Alnus glutinosa is the main component, although Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, and Betula celtiberica are also present (Herrera 1995). The excavation of El Miron Cave has been concentrated since 1996 mainly in two areas of the large vestibule (10 m wide × 30 m deep × 13 m high), the Cabin and the Corral. Each excavation block is at most about 10 m2 in size, and they have been connected by a continuous stratigraphic trench. The cultural sequence includes contexts pertaining to the Mousterian, Early Upper Paleolithic, Solutrean, Magdalenian, Azilian, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Bronze Age periods, with traces of medieval occupations (e.g., Gonzalez Morales and Straus 2000a, b; Straus and Gonzalez Morales 2000, 2003; Straus et al., 2001, 2002). In this work we will only deal with the Holocene wood charcoal record from the outer vestibule (Cabin) area (Levels 10.1-10.2) and the Mid-Vestibule Trench (Levels 303.1-303). © 2012 by the University of New Mexico Press.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881571626

We collected 43 regional climate simulations covering the target area, including experiments produced in the context of the PRUDENCE and ENSEMBLES projects, and additional experiments produced by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The ability of the models to simulate the present climate in terms of mean and interannual variability is discussed and the insufficient reproduction of some features, such as the intensity of summer precipitation, are shown. The contribution to the variance associated with the intermodel spread is computed. The changes of mean and interannual variability are analyzed for the period 2071-2100 in the PRUDENCE runs (A2 scenario) and the periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 (A1B scenario) for the other runs. Ensemble results show a major warming at the end of the 21st century. Warming will be larger in the A2 scenario (about 5.5. K in summer and 4. K in winter) than in the A1B. Precipitation is projected to increase in winter and decrease in summer by 20% (+0.5. mm/day and -1. mm/day over the Alps, respectively). The climate change signal for scenario A1B in the period 2021-2050 is significant for temperature, but not yet for precipitation. In summer, interannual variability is projected to increase for temperature and for precipitation. Winter interannual variability change is different among scenarios.

This project generates carbon credits that are later sold to governments and organisations under the Kyoto Protocol. In order to evaluate this investment, we conducted an analysis centred in its net present value, and we take into consideration a set of external variables and the financial and economic situation of EcoSecurities.

The City has a large collection system that includes over 5500 km of sewer pipes, along with other components such as catch basins, manholes, lift stations, storm water ponds etc. Understandably, comprehensive preventive maintenance is required to ensure smooth operation of the system. To do so, the Drainage Operations section of the City of Edmonton's Drainage Services Branch (DSO) employs maintenance crews and vehicles to perform preventive maintenance (PM) activities (e.g., flushing and cleaning of sewer pipes), at various locations across the city. DSO utilizes state-of-the-art equipment including GPS fleet management system, which allows real-time tracking and monitoring of these maintenance vehicles. Preliminary analysis of GPS data indicates that the weekly distance traveled by the PM vehicles ranges from 5000 to 7000 km, which constitutes significant travel time and therefore affects the effective cleaning and flushing time. This study proposes a route optimization algorithm that aims at maximizing effective cleaning time within the daily work-shift, while reducing travel time. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm can reduce the PM vehicles' weekly travel distance by a significant margin. This study also provides useful insight into the effect of site scheduling and work-shift length on maximizing daily effective work time. The outcome of this research can reduce fuel consumption and emissions caused by vehicular travel, and thus support sustainable practices in infrastructure operation and management.",,"Fleet management system; Infrastructure managements; Operation and management; Preliminary analysis; Preventive maintenance (pm); State-of-the-art equipments; Sustainable practices; Wastewater collection systems; Algorithms; Civil engineering; Cleaning; Fleet operations; Sustainable development; Travel time; Vehicles; Preventive maintenance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875548282

These strategies include land-use policies as well as improvements to public transit services. This empirical work aims at studying the potential impact of land use (LU), public transit supply (PT), and parking pricing strategies on the mode choice of commuters living in the commuter rail line catchments in the Montreal (Canada) region. It makes use of an econometric modeling approach with both transportation mode choice and neighborhood type choice as simultaneous decisions, in order to take into account the endogeneity of these choices. The neighborhood choices are represented by neighborhood typologies derived from a cluster analysis using land use and transit supply indicators (population density, land use mix, and bus transit supply). As part of the outcomes of this study, the elasticities of mode choice with respect to commuter-transit fees, travel time reductions, and hourly parking costs are estimated. From the results, it is observed that a reduction of 10 percent in the transit fee or relative travel time would increase mode split by 10 percent and 3 percent respectively. The effect of age on both mode choice and neighborhood choice is also estimated. The individual and household structure factors associated with mode choice and/or residential neighborhood choice are also identified. Commuter age affects both outcomes. Income and gender affect mode choice while car ownership and the presence of children are linked to neighborhood choice. © 2012 Seyed Amir H Zahabi, Luis. F.

Malaysia has no significant high grade iron ore deposit while domestic low grade ore could not be utilized for direct reduction process. Beneficiation of the low grade ore containing crystalline water from Malaysian iron ore deposits is an attractive alternative resource for domestic iron-making. However, the use of low grade iron ore in iron making requires extra energy consumption and contributes to greenhouse gases. We proposed a series of processes for beneficiation of local iron ore utilizing renewable and environmental friendly agricultural residues from domestic palm oil industry as an energy source and processing materials. Briquette composites of iron ore and ash by product of palm oil Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) pyrolysis were produced with minute amount of water added as binder. Reduction tests were carried out between 600°C to 900°C under argon atmosphere in a glass tube furnace. The extent of sample reduction was estimated by oxygen removal and considering the weight loss. The chemical and structural changes of iron ore before and after reduction were characterized using XRD, TG/DTA and SEM. The results showed that increase in reduction temperature and EFB ash content in the briquette will increase the extent of reduction. XRD results suggest that the original iron oxide hydrate in the ore has been converted into hematite after heating at desired temperature due to dehydration process. Hematite was partially reduced to magnetite and wustite after reduction and the extent of reduction increased with increasing ash content. The results also indicate that ash from EFB could be a promising energy source for upgrading low grade iron ore by producing reducing gas that will replace part of coal in iron making leading to reduction in CO2 emission.","Ash; Briquette; Low grade iron ore; Reduction; Waste biomass","Dehydration process; Domestic consumption; Environmental-friendly; Low grade; Mini blast furnaces; Palm oil empty fruit bunch; Reduction temperatures; Waste biomass; Agricultural wastes; Ashes; Beneficiation; Blast furnaces; Briquets; Briquetting; Carbon dioxide; Concentration (process); Dehydration; Direct reduction process; Economic geology; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Hematite; Iron; Iron ores; Ore deposits; Palm oil; Reduction; Iron ore reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879853461

This area consists of the Taihang Mountain area, the piedmont plain, the low plain and the coastal plain from the west to the east. It was found that in the Taihang Mountain area, the ESV per unit area in the western part of the region was higher than in the eastern part of the region; forest and grassland were dominant contributors to the total ESV in the region. In the piedmont plain and the low plain areas, the ESV per unit area was very low and had a homogeneous distribution pattern; the highest total ESV contribution in these two regions came from farmland. In the coastal plain, wetlands, water bodies, and farmlands contributed the majority of the total ESV in the region; the ESV per unit area in the eastern part of this region was significantly higher than that found in the center and western ends of the region; the spatial difference here was more significant compared to the other three ecological zones. The total ESV of the whole study area had a lower growth rate (0.92%) from 1990 to 2000 compared to the rate (6.57%) from 2000 to 2008. The ESV of gas regulation, climate regulation, recreation and culture, water regulation, and biodiversity protection increased from 1990 to 2008 while the ESV of food production showed a decreasing trend due to the reduction of farmland areas.

Carbon dioxide accounts for about 50% of the current global warming potential. Soil microorganisms that assimilate CO 2 are widely distributed, and have a great ability to adapt to environmental extremes, such as within volcanic sediments, lake wetlands and the submarine realm. Microbial CO 2 assimilation is of great significance to climate change mitigation and sustainable development for human beings. It has now been well established that atmospheric concentration of CO 2 can be reduced significantly by adopting management practices to enhance CO 2 sequestration (storage) in cropland soils. Among the approaches for increasing CO 2 sequestration of croplands are soil fertilization management practices, such as returning crop residues to the soil, planting temporarily retired land with grass for stabilization, and integrating nutrient management strategies to diversified cropping systems. Paddy soils are distributed widely throughout the world, and generally are known for their production of greenhouse gasses (N 2 O and CH 4). Numerous studies have used molecular techniques to investigate these microbial driving mechanisms. However, few studies have addressed the importance of microbial CO 2 fixation processes in paddy soils. Investigation of the impacts of long-term fertilization on the structure and abundance of CO 2 assimilating bacteria in paddy soils can provide a theoretical basis for the application of information on fertilization of paddy-rice fields. This type of research also may benefit the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration. Although carbon fixating microorganisms exhibit a wide range of physiological and ecological traits, most photo- and chemoautotrophic bacteria use ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), which catalyzes the first rate- limiting step in the Calvin cycle to incorporate atmospheric CO 2. The cbbL gene, which encodes the large subunit of the form I RubisCO is especially useful as a functional marker for significant phylogenetic analyses of CO 2 fixating microorganisms in different ecological systems. In this study, soil samples were collected from a long-term fertilization experiment, which included a station that received no fertilization (CK), one treated with chemical fertilization (NPK), and one with NPK plus crop residue return (NPKS). The abundance, diversity, and composition of soil-CO 2 fixating bacteria were determined using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), cloning and sequencing, and real-time quantitative PCR of the cbbL gene to explore the effects of long- term fertilization on the structure and abundance of the CO 2 fixation bacterial community. Based on sequence libraries of cbbL genes, our results clearly demonstrate that there was a significant response difference in community composition with respect to long-term fertilization regimes. A total of 165 cbbL genotypes from three different treatment soils were divided into 14 bacterial cbbL gene phylotypes, mainly including Bradyrhizobium, Ralstonia, and Thiobacillus. Facultative autotrophic bacteria, such as Bradyrhizobium and Ralstonia, dominated both in NPK and NPKS treatment soils, while growth of the obligate autotrophic bacteria, such as Thiobacillus and Nitrosospira, were suppressed. LUBSHUFF statistical analyses also demonstrated that cbbL gene libraries of CK, NPK and NPKS treatments were significantly different from one another. The Rarefaction curve indicated that fertilizer addition increases cbbL gene diversity. Thus, the NPK treatment had the highest curve. The abundance of the bacterial cbbL gene ranged from 3. 35×10 8 -5. 61×10 8 copies g -1 soil. Crop residue return NPKS had the highest abundance of bacterial cbbL gene, which was about one half the value of CK. Finally, application of chemicals and organic fertilizers in paddy ecosystems significantly influenced the CO 2 fixating bacterial community structure, and increased bacterial abundance and diversity. These results provide a strong basis for further investigation of fertilization on soil carbon sequestration potential and its related microbial mechanisms.","Cbbl gene; Diversity; Fertilization; Paddy soil; Real-time PCR","abundance; agricultural land; autotrophy; bacterium; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; catalysis; community composition; concentration (composition); emission control; enzyme activity; fertilizer application; gene expression; global warming; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; methane; microbial community; molecular analysis; nitrous oxide; paddy field; phylogenetics; polymerase chain reaction; primary production; soil carbon; soil microorganism; stabilization; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bradyrhizobium; Nitrosospira; Ralstonia; Thiobacillus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863064253

This paper aims to evaluate the dynamics of potential natural vegetation arising from 21st century climate change and its possible impact on the water budget of the Hanjiang River basin in China. Based on predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC-SRES) A1 scenario from the PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) regional climate model, changes in plant functional types (PFTs) and leaf area index (LAI) were simulated via the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model. Subsequently, predicted PFTs and LAIs were employed in the Xinanjiang vegetation-hydrology model for rainfall-runoff simulations. Results reveal that future long-term changes in precipitation, air temperature and atmospheric CO 2 concentration would remarkably affect the spatiotemporal distribution of PFTs and LAIs. These climate-driven vegetation changes would further influence regional water balance. With the decrease in forest cover in the 21st century, plant transpiration and evaporative loss of intercepted canopy water will tend to fall while soil evaporation may rise considerably. As a result, total evapotranspiration may increase moderately with a slight increase in annual runoff depth. This indicates that, for long-term hydrological prediction, climate-induced changes in terrestrial vegetation cannot be neglected as the terrestrial biosphere plays an important role in land-surface hydrological responses. © 2012 IWA Publishing.","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; LPJ-DGVM; Runoff; Vegetation; Xinanjiang hydrologic model","Air temperature; Annual runoff; Atmospheric CO; Evaporative loss; Forest cover; Hydrologic models; Hydrological impacts; Hydrological prediction; Hydrological response; Impact study; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Leaf Area Index; Long-term changes; LPJ-DGVM; Natural vegetation; Plant functional type; Plant transpiration; Rainfall-runoff simulations; Regional climate; Regional climate models; Regional water balance; River basins; Soil evaporations; Spatiotemporal distributions; Special report on emissions scenarios; Terrestrial biosphere; Terrestrial vegetation; Vegetation change; Vegetation model; Water budget; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Computer simulation; Dynamics; Evapotranspiration; Runoff; Transpiration; Water supply; Watersheds; Vegetation; air temperature; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; climate prediction; evapotranspiration; forest cover; functional group; hydrological change; hydrological response; interception; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; leaf area index; rainfall-runoff modeling; regional climate; river basin; runoff; twenty first century; vegetation dynamics; water budget; China; Guangdong; Han Basin [Guangdong]; Agave americana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863244745

However, the big challenge of the utilization of the syngas in SOFC is the carbon formation activity in the Ni/YSZ anode. In this work, according to the fully three-dimensional models of chemical/electrochemical, heat/mass transfer and overpotential, the effects of fuel components on the performance and carbon formation of SOFC were analyzed. From the results, the increment of water steam and carbon dioxide may inhibit the carbon deposition. However, massive water steam and carbon dioxide reduces the output voltage of SOFC as well. The proper molar fraction of hydrogen in syngas also reduces the carbon formation activity. The addition of carbon monoxide may narrow down the region of carbon formation but enhance the carbon formation activity near the fuel inlet of SOFC. Moreover, the existence of methane results in the sharply carbon formation; thus, the methane should be removed as clear as possibly in syngas. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","carbon formation; fuel components; solid oxide fuel cell; syngas","Carbon deposition; Carbon Formation; Energy source; fuel components; Molar fractions; Output voltages; Overpotential; Solid oxide; Syn-gas; Three-dimensional model; Water steam; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Fuels; Hydrogen; Methane; Numerical analysis; Synthesis gas; Three dimensional; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859079517

Recent studies reveal the importance of ion-mediated nucleation (IMN) in generating new particles and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. Here we implement the IMN scheme into the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5). Our simulations show that, compared to globally averaged results based on H2SO4-H2O binary homogeneous nucleation (BHN), the presence of ionization (i.e., IMN) halves H2SO4 column burden, but increases the column integrated nucleation rate by around one order of magnitude, total particle number burden by a factor of ∼3, CCN burden by ∼10% (at 0.2% supersaturation) to 65% (at 1.0% supersaturation), and cloud droplet number burden by ∼18%. Compared to BHN, IMN increases cloud liquid water path by 7.5%, decreases precipitation by 1.1%, and increases total cloud cover by 1.9%. This leads to an increase of total shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCF) by 3.67 W m-2 (more negative) and longwave cloud forcing by 1.78 W m-2 (more positive), with large spatial variations. The effect of ionization on SWCF derived from this study (3.67 W m-2) is a factor of ∼3 higher that of a previous study (1.15 W m-2) based on a different ion nucleation scheme and climate model. Based on the present CAM5 simulation, the 5-yr mean impacts of solar cycle induced changes in ionization rates on CCN and cloud forcing are small (∼-0.02 W m-2) but have larger inter-annual (from -0.18 to 0.17 W m-2) and spatial variations. © Author(s) 2012.

More attention to strict EGR control is becoming required. Accurate and fast transient EGR ratio operation is becoming very critical in the field of the emission control. The EGR ratio is typically monitored by CO2 trace method, in which CO2 emitted from engine, is utilized as a tracer gas. The EGR ratio can be obtained from CO2 concentration measured at engine intake and engine out at the same time. In this study, authors have developed a new EGR analyzer consisting of two CO2 detectors, to achieve required performance for transient measurement, i.e. short delay time and quick response, negligible difference between two CO2 detectors, and capability of wet measurement. For this new analyzer, heated NDIR detectors which can measure CO2 in engine emission under wet condition were adopted. The sample lines for each CO2 detector were configured to have small volume and also almost same design each other, to avoid transient errors caused by the difference in response time. We have evaluated the performance of the transient EGR analyzer through some comparison tests with a conventional exhaust gas analyzers system. In consequence, the faster response has been observed from the transient EGR analyzer without significant transient error under several test cycles. Furthermore it has proved that effects on response time from the sample inlet pressure change are significantly small. Finally the EGR ratio measured by the transient EGR analyzer followed up the EGR valve operation well. These results show the advantages of the transient EGR analyzer for measuring EGR ratio under transient state.

BTP exhibits oxygen-sensitive phosphorescence that can be utilized to monitor oxygen levels in living cells and to visualize hypoxic tissues. To improve the tissue penetrance of BTP, we designed and synthesized near-IR emitting iridium complexes by two different approaches: extension of the π- conjugated system of benzothienyl-pyridinato ligand in BTP and introduction of substituents into suitable positions of ligands. The former approach was successful, and near-IR emitting iridium complexes were obtained without reduction in the emission quantum yield. Cellular uptake of BTP was greatly improved by introducing a hydrophilic group into the acetylacetonato ligand. Using these improved probes, in-vivo lifetime measurements were made to substantiate the hypoxia of tumor tissues in SCC-7 tumor-bearing mice. The second-harmonic (532 nm) of Nd 3+:YAG laser was used to excite iridium complexes in tissues, and the phosphorescence lifetime was measured using the time-correlated single photon counting technique. The phosphorescence emitted from the tumor region actually gave longer lifetimes compared to those emitted from the normal tissues, demonstrating the hypoxic nature of tumor tissues. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","hypoxia; iridium complex; oxygen sensor; phosphorescence","Acetylacetonato ligand; Cellular oxygen; Cellular uptake; Conjugated systems; Emission quantum yield; Hydrophilic groups; hypoxia; Hypoxic tissues; In-vivo; iridium complex; Lifetime measurements; Living cell; Near-IR; Normal tissue; Oxygen levels; Phosphorescence lifetime; Second-harmonic; Time-correlated single photon counting techniques; Tumor imaging; Tumor tissues; Histology; Iridium; Ligands; Light emission; Mammals; Medical applications; Molecular oxygen; Nanoparticles; Oxygen sensors; Phosphorescence; Probes; Quantum yield; Synthesis (chemical); Tumors; Iridium compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859570050

Based on observational data, this connection appears to have changed significantly since 1999. This study examines the characteristics of this connection during two sub-periods (1980-1998 and 1999-2010) using cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function (CSEOF) analysis. We found that the atmospheric anomalies induced by the ENSO alter the SST over the North Pacific through surface heat flux change during the earlier period of 1980-1998. During the later period, in contrast, ENSO-related atmospheric anomalies feature the North Pacific oscillation (NPO) pattern during winter, which is characterized by a southward shift of the atmospheric center of action from its climatological position. The NPO-related atmospheric anomalies extend to the subtropical Pacific; this extension potentially links midlatitude and tropical Pacific variability through air-sea interactions. The physical change appears to alter the El Nio characteristics into that of the Central Pacific El Nio through the wind-SST coupling mechanism. This process may be related to the recent change in which the Central Pacific El Nio occurs more frequently than the conventional Eastern Pacific El Nio. Detailed descriptions of the physical changes between the tropical Pacific and the North Pacific are presented in this study along with the possible implications of this change. © 2012.

Ethanol is considered a renewable fuel additive to gasoline which helps the US efforts in minimizing the dependency on foreign oil. As a result, it is becoming very hard to find pure gasoline which does not contain some ethanol content at the pump in the US. The fuel currently available at the pump contains close to 10% ethanol. The fuel and evaporative systems components and materials on newer flexible fuel vehicles are being designed to be tolerant of the 10% ethanol content. There is a strong desire from ethanol producers to increase the ethanol content up to a 20% level. This is still being debated by the Environmental Protection Agency and a final decision has not been made yet but will be announced by the upcoming Tier 3 Notice of Public Rule Making (NPRM) in December of 2011. Early signs from EPA are indicating that E15 would be the official certification fuel with the upcoming Tier 3 NPRM. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) proposed in the LEV III NPRM to use E10 as the official fuel for all required certification testing. Many studies are being done investigating the impact of the 20% ethanol fuel blend on the different components in the vehicle especially on the evaporative systems. This study focuses on the effect of ethanol content on tailpipe emissions including carbonyls. The effect of ethanol addition to gasoline fuels on regulated tailpipe emissions is investigated under different ethanol content and different ambient temperatures. In addition to THC, CO, NOX, CH4 and CO2 tailpipe emissions, the analysis includes carbonyl measurement with formaldehydes, acetaldehydes, and the other 11 carbonyl species. Testing was conducted on a 3.3 L Chrysler Town &amp; Country vehicle at different ambient temperatures (20°F or -7°C, 50°F or 10°C and 75°F or 24°C) with indolene certification fuels containing 0, 10%, 20% and 85% ethanol.

It can provide both good fuel economy and very low emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates. Therefore, it is considered to be one of the most promising internal combustion engine concepts for the future. However, there are some obstacles that must be overcome before the potential benefits of HCCI combustion can be fully realized in commercialization, including combustion phasing control, operation range extending (high levels of noise, UHC and CO emissions), cold start, and homogeneous mixture preparation. All these HCCI characteristics have been summarized in Section 1. To overcome these obstacles, many effective technologies have been carried out and these technologies will be reviewed in Section 2 according to different fuel properties. HCCI can be applied to a variety of fuel types and the choice of fuel will have a significant impact on both engine design and control strategies. Some chemical components have the ability to inhibit or promote the heat release process associated with autoignition. Typical generalized diesel-fuelled HCCI combustion modes include: early direct injection HCCI, late direct injection HCCI, premixed/direct-injected HCCI combustion and low temperature combustion. Mixture control (mixture preparation), including charge components and temperature control in the whole combustion history and high pre-ignition mixing rate, is the key issue to achieve diesel HCCI combustion. The high octane numbers of gasoline fuels mean that such fuels need high ignition temperatures, which highlights the difficulty of autoignition. The main challenge for gasoline HCCI operation is focus on the obtaining sufficient thermal energy to trigger autoignition of mixtures late in the compression stroke, extending the operational range, and the transient control. In addition, alternative fuel can save the fossil fuel and reduce the CO2 emission, therefore it has been got more attention in recent years. And to understand fundamental theory of HCCI combustion process, the primary reference fuel is the best choice due to the better understood chemical kinetics. All these fuels will be also introduced in the Section 2. Advanced control strategies of fuel/air mixture are more important than simple ""homogeneous charge'' for the HCCI combustion control. Further, it is impossible to get an absolutely homogeneous mixture in the operation of practical HCCI engines. Modest inhomogeneity in fuel concentration or temperature appearing in mixing can affect the autoignition and combustion process. And stratification strategy also has the potential to extend the HCCI operation range to higher loads. The thermal stratification can be caused by wall heat transfer and turbulent mixing during the compression stroke for a low-residual engine. This thermal stratification causes the combustion to occur as a sequential autoignition of progressively cooler regions, slowing the rate of pressure rise. For engines with high levels of retained residuals, incomplete mixing between the fresh charge and hot residuals could also contribute to the thermal stratification. Apart from the thermal stratification, more researches are about the charge or compositional stratification. The charge stratification is focus on the different injection strategies, while the compositional stratification means that all the EGR, internal or external, changes the composition of the charge therefore forming the different compositional stratification. These stratification combustion characteristics have been reviewed in Section 3. Finally, a summary for the progress of HCCI combustion and future research direction has been shown in Section 4. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

Multilevel influences, such as communities and families surrounding patients or health-care policies and organizations surrounding provider teams, may determine whether effective interventions are successfully implemented. Greater recognition of the importance of these influences in advancing (or hindering) the impact of single-level interventions has motivated the design and testing of multilevel interventions designed to address them. However, implementing research evidence from single- or multilevel interventions into sustainable routine practice and policy presents substantive challenges. Furthermore, relatively few multilevel interventions have been conducted along the cancer care continuum, and fewer still have been implemented, disseminated, or sustained in practice. The purpose of this chapter is, therefore, to illustrate and examine the concepts underlying the implementation and spread of multilevel interventions into routine practice and policy. We accomplish this goal by using a series of cancer and noncancer examples that have been successfully implemented and, in some cases, spread widely. Key concepts across these examples include the importance of phased implementation, recognizing the need for pilot testing, explicit engagement of key stakeholders within and between each intervention level; visible and consistent leadership and organizational support, including financial and human resources; better understanding of the policy context, fiscal climate, and incentives underlying implementation; explication of handoffs from researchers to accountable individuals within and across levels; ample integration of multilevel theories guiding implementation and evaluation; and strategies for long-term monitoring and sustainability.",,"article; cancer care; cancer screening; clinical practice; colorectal cancer; concept analysis; depression; evidence based medicine; health care; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care policy; health care quality; health education; health insurance; human; mutilevel intervention; pilot study; priority journal; reimbursement; smoking cessation program; tobacco; veterans health; clinical practice; colorectal tumor; cost benefit analysis; early diagnosis; economics; health care quality; information dissemination; integrated health care system; interdisciplinary communication; neoplasm; organization and management; patient care; standard; United States; Colorectal Neoplasms; Continuity of Patient Care; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Early Detection of Cancer; Health Education; Health Policy; Humans; Information Dissemination; Interdisciplinary Communication; Neoplasms; Patient Care Team; Physician's Practice Patterns; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Quality of Health Care; Reimbursement, Incentive; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861804087

Base on the CCME method, some materials originated from non-petroleum sources can also be extracted, therefore two optional clean up methods (in situ silica gel and silica gel column cleanup) were recommended to remove naturally occurring polar organics. However, the cleanup method may be neglected in many labs due to their time-consumption; or some labs only employed the in situ cleanup method for simplifying this procedure. The measured TPH values without cleanup may include both PHC and biogenic organic compounds (BOC). The measured TPH obtained from the in-situ silica gel cleanup method may also be contributed partly from BOC fraction due to the overloading of the total solvent extractable materials (TSEM) to the silica gel. In the present study, over 60 samples, including background soil and plant samples, and oil contaminated soil samples, were sampled from 2008 to 2010. The TPH without cleanup (TPH), TPH with column cleanup (TPH-F&lt;inf&gt;3&lt;/inf&gt;) were compared to evaluate the effects of without and with column cleanup methods on the TPH measurement values. For several representative samples, the TPH-F&lt;inf&gt;3&lt;/inf&gt; (with column cleanup) and TPH-F values (with in-situ cleanup) were measured and compared to evaluate cleanup efficiencies of these two optional cleanup methods. In addition, to evaluate the influence of the TSEM loading on the measurement of TPH-F values, different TSEM loading amounts were applied for in- situ silica gel cleanup method and compared with that by the column cleanup method.",,"Canadian council of ministers of the environments; Clean up; Cleanup methods; Contaminated soils; In-situ; Loading amount; Measurement methods; Measurement uncertainty; Naturally occurring; Oil contaminated soil; Organics; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Plant samples; Representative sample; Soil sample; Total hydrocarbons; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Contamination; Hydrocarbons; Loading; Petroleum chemistry; Silica gel; Soil surveys; Soils; Technical presentations; Uncertainty analysis; Soil pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865998527

Under the equity principle, the two most developed groups are assigned the highest reduction targets (55% and 65%, respectively). However, their reduction potential is limited. Under the efficiency principle, the two groups with the highest reduction potential take the highest targets (48% and 61%, respectively), but their economy is relatively backward. When equity and efficiency are equally weighted, the 5th group with a prominent reduction potential takes the highest target (54%), and the 2nd and the 3rd groups with large industry scales take the second highest target (49%). However, under all the three allocation schemes, the targets are not greater than 40% for the 4th and the 6th groups, which have a relatively low economic ability, emissions, and reduction potential. Due to inconsistency between economic and reduction potential, corresponding market mechanisms and policy instruments should be established to ensure equity and efficiency of regional target allocation.","Cluster analysis; Intensity reduction targets allocation; Regional difference",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900004929

The modulation of the emission current showed an exponential relationship with the MOSFET gate voltage.

It is the best choice to develop the EIP for the development of circular economy and energy conservation. Since the 1970s, the EIP has become a highlight in the field of development of the world's industrial park. Some developed countries, such as Denmark, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and so on, started to plan the construction of ecological industrial demonstration zone in the early 1970s, while developing countries actively constructed the EIPs in the late 1970s, the number of which increased rapidly. For an EIP, the key to effectively reduce waste emissions and energy conservation in the circular economy is the structure of the enterprises network in the park. This article employed the social network analysis (Social Network Analysis, SNA) to analyze the structure of the enterprises network. SNA was derived as a set of mathematical analysis from the mathematics of graph theory by sociologists Harison White, and his successor Boorman, Director, Brieger and Freeman in the 1960s. It is an important method, which can not only depict the network morphology, properties and network structure and but also effectively evaluate the network structure. SNA is a structural analysis method. It involved in the data analysis, the network structure determining and the experience summarizing, whose object can be individuals, businesses, independent organizations or groups. The linkage or contact of the relationship of the objects is the flow channel to send resources (material or non material), and to build the relations link is seen as a "" structure"" of the network. So it is effective to analyze the organizational structure and network structure of the eco-industrial park. Based on social network analysis, this article examines the organizational structure and network structure of typical EIPs taking cases of Kalunbdorg and Guigang EIPs. An index system including clustering coefficient, average shortest distance, transitivity and core-periphery structure is established to measure their stability and analyzes the different structural features. The results show that Kalunbdorg EIP's clustering coefficient (0. 715) and heterogeneity of all nodes (0. 057) are both higher than those of Guigang EIP (0. 246 and 0. 005, respectively), implying a better agglomeration and a more balanced centricity in Kalunbdorg EIP. Whereas little difference exists between Guigang EIP (2. 236) and Kalunbdorg EIP (2. 210) in term of shortest distance, and the complexity of them is weak. Furthermore, the transitivity is less than 25% in both EIPs, which indicates a weak link between nodes. From the core-periphery structure, the heterogeneity between the nodes of the Kalundborg (0. 057) is higher than Guigang (0. 005). The centricity of Guigang participates in the main body is more balanced, while Kalundborg'difference is large. It can be observed from the results that the two EIPs are both industrial symbiosis modes with one industry or enterprise group as the network core, resulting in a weak connection among other nodes in the network. In addition, a deficiency exists in the shortage of long chain links and network complexity in both EIPs. This article studies the social network and the organizational structure of the EIP from the perspective of the industrial chain, and analyzes the relationship and their status of the various nodes in the network organization. Furthermore, the structural features of the overall network are summed up, and the main problems in the development of the EIP are analyzed. By these analysis, we can provide a technical reference for the construction and development of EIP in China, in order to avoid China's current eco-industrial park construction blindly and repeatedly, which is of great significance for the different parts of the EIP construction as well as regional economic development.","Eco-industrial park; Industrial ecology; Industrial symbiosis; Social network analysis","developing world; economic analysis; economic development; emission; energy conservation; geomorphology; industrial ecology; mathematical analysis; research work; social network; Australia; Denmark; Far East; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866626329

It is more important for developing country or region. This paper analyzed the annual C balance of Quzhou County during 2000-2009 by counting of C sources and C sinks. C sources and C sinks were calculated by means of a coefficient approach based on the data of energy consumption, land use status, economic situation and others during 2000- 2009. Analysis showed that C sources and net C sources were increasing. However, C sources and net C sources per unit GDP decreased during the 2000-2009 years. C sources and C sinks during 2010-2015 were predicted by Gray model, with the predicted results being verified by subsequent residual test. Result showed that GM (1,1) established using prediction was the sufficiently accurate model to achieve a feasible and applicable measure. Through this model, the predicted C sources, C sinks, net C sources, C sources and net C sources per unit GDP in 2015 in Quzhou County will be 1,139.42, 462.76 and 676.66 Gg C-eq, 0.9 and 0.54 Mg C-eq/10 000 RMBs, respectively. The result predicted showed that there would be an increase during the 2000-2009 years and C emissions reduction would face a lot of pressure in the future in Quzhou County.

Considering the upcoming carbon tax policy in China, a two-level urban logistics distribution network is addressed under carbon tax. A new convex MIP model, balancing logistics operation cost and carbon emission cost, is then established. The popular optimization kit, GLPK, is proposed to solve the model exactly. Subsequently, a real case is studied and results show in detail the effectiveness of the model. When carbon tax ranges from 0.01 to 0.10 RMB yuan per kg CO2eq, only by fine tuning logistics distribution network configurations without further huge capital investments, the logistics operator can achieve cost saving up to 19.4%, while carbon emission could be decreased tremendously, by around 47.8% at its most. Our contributions are three-fold. First, the model proposed reflects both economic and environmental benefits of urban logistics networks.

In light emitting diodes and room temperature laser devices, NRTs lower the emission efficiency. In order to prohibit these processes, better understanding is practically needed. But nowadays knowledge of NRTs comes from the analyses of the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra, which are indirect evidences because of their radiative nature. Here we report a direct detection of nonradiative processes of ZnO nanocrystallines by combination of photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) with field-induced photovoltaic spectroscopy (FISPS) methods. In photoacoustic spectrum of ZnO nanocrystals, a main feature centered at 374 nm and a shoulder feature at 441 nm have been recorded. The surface photovoltage spectrum (SPS) displays a main peak at about 364 nm, which is assigned to band-gap transition. And the FISPS spectrum shows a main feature at 380 nm and a pronounced shoulder at 450 nm. The relative energy of the PAS main feature locates at about 0.1 eV lower than that of band-gap, and the relative energy of the PAS main and shoulder features locates at 60 meV higher than that of FISPS main and shoulder features. These energy spaces are in good consistent with the exciton binding energy reported for ZnO nanostructures. Thus we tentatively ascribe the NRTs to the trapping of the photogenerated excitons to the surface states of ZnO nanocrystallines. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Nonradiative transition; Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS); Surface photovoltage spectrum (SPS); ZnO nanocrystallines","Band gaps; Bandgap transition; Direct detection; Direct measurement; Emission efficiencies; Energy spaces; Exciton-binding energy; Laser device; Nanocrystallines; Non-radiative transitions; Nonradiative process; Photoacoustic spectra; Photogenerated excitons; Radiative process; Relative energies; Room temperature; Surface photovoltage spectroscopy; Surface photovoltage spectrum; Surface photovoltage spectrum (SPS); Surface state; Time-resolved photoluminescence spectrum; ZnO; ZnO nanocrystal; ZnO nanostructures; Binding energy; Excitons; Heterojunctions; Light emitting diodes; Photoacoustic effect; Photoluminescence; Planning; Semiconductor quantum wells; Surface properties; Sustainable development; Zinc oxide; Photoacoustic spectroscopy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80555134733

Naturally occurring biogenic organic compounds (BOCs) are produced by organisms or generated from the decay of organisms, which are usually nontoxic and less hazardous than those generated from petrogenic and pyrogenic sources. Petrogenic hydrocarbons (PHCs) are one of the most widespread soil pollutants around the world, and clean-up of PHC-contaminated sites is usually very costly. Under the current protocols, natural biogenic organic matter is often mistakenly identified and regulated as petroleum hydrocarbons. In some cases, biogenic interferences can exceed regulatory levels, resulting in remediation of petroleum impacts that are not actually present. Consequently, reliance on these methods can trigger unnecessary and costly remediation, while at the same time wasting valuable landfill space. Therefore, it is crucial and critically important to characterize and differentiate PHCs and BOCs in contaminated sediments in TPH analysis. The Oil Research Lab of Environment Canada has conducted a project funded by the Alberta Upstream Petroleum Research Fund (AUPRF) to address these issues, in collaboration with several federal, provincial and commercial analytical laboratories on the method development and method validation. This proposed method describes a procedure for determining hydrocarbon constituents in soil or sediment samples by solvent extraction, silica-gel column cleanup and fractionation, and then followed by quantitation by gas chromatography. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) are quantitatively determined using gas chromatograph-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Furthermore, a series of targeted hydrocarbons including nalkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), bicyclic sesquiterpanes and petroleum biomarkers are investigated to identify and differentiate the presence of petrogenic and biogenic compounds in soil and sediment samples.",,"Alberta; Analytical laboratories; Biogenic compounds; Contaminated sediment; Ionization detection; Method development; Method validations; n-Alkanes; Naturally occurring; Organic contamination; Petrogenic; Petroleum biomarkers; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs); Regulatory level; Sediment samples; Sesquiterpanes; Soil and sediment; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Contamination; Gas chromatography; Hydrocarbons; Laboratories; Petroleum chemistry; Petroleum research; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Sedimentology; Sediments; Silica; Soils; Solvent extraction; Technical presentations; Soil pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866247216

Injection was into coarse grained fluvial deposits of the Cretaceous lower Tuscaloosa formation forming a gentle anticline at depths of 3300 m. CO 2 injection started in July 2008, growing to ∼23 wells with total injection rates greater than one million tons/year. Focused monitoring programs of deep subsurface and near-surface have been implemented at different study areas. Here we present results of the near-surface monitoring program over a 3-year period including shallow groundwater monitoring and soil-gas monitoring. A general methodology for detecting CO 2 leakage into shallow groundwater chemistry is proposed. A set of geochemical indicator parameters can be identified based on characterization of groundwater geochemistry over the monitoring area and then further tested and validated with numerical modeling approaches, lab experiments and field experiments. For the soil-gas monitoring, a site (P-site) where there are a plugged &amp; abandoned well, a nearby open pit, and an engineered pad, representing a typical near-surface environment for soil monitoring, was selected for detail study. The site was heavily instrumented with different sensors for measuring soil-gas concentrations at different depths, soil water content, matric potential, and weather information. Three monitoring technologies were assessed: soil CO 2 concentration measurements alone, CO 2 flux measurements on the land surface, and soil-gas component measurements. The results indicate that soil-gas component measurements provide more reliable information for gas leakage detection. The methodologies of near-surface monitoring developed in this study can be used to improve monitoring CO 2 leakage at other carbon dioxide sequestration projects.

With Black men and women having the highest prevalence of hypertension, Black females having higher rates of coronary heart disease, stroke and breast cancer than White females, and Blacks, at all ages, having a greater risk for stroke mortality than Whites, researchers and health care providers must understand the clinical appropriateness of treatment for different states of disease among distinct populations. Further, to eliminate health disparities, the health care systems and legal regulatory climate must facilitate access to care while biases, prejudices and stereotyping by health care providers and all those in the health care system must be eliminated. Importantly, research continues to illustrate that many are dying prematurely or have advanced stages of disease because of disparate care. This article explores four strategies to address inequitable care and to work toward eliminating poorer health outcomes among minorities. First, those who deliver health care must adopt a quality-focused approach that improves the care of all patients while facilitating the reduction and elimination of health disparities. Second, cultural awareness and cultural competency must be improved. Third, we must remove barriers to access and promote public policies that lead to greater health awareness and healthier environments. Lastly, but most importantly, we need a prevention focus as the reduction in the onset of disease is the first step towards improving health outcomes.","Cardiovascular disease; Cultural competency; Health disparities; Prevention; Stroke","African American; breast cancer; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; conference paper; cultural competence; European American; health care access; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care policy; health care system; health disparity; Hispanic; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; medical research; minority group; mortality; outcome assessment; prevalence; public health; African Americans; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cultural Competency; Female; Health Priorities; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Research; Stroke; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869214697

The Biosolids Emissions Assessment Model (BEAM) is a tool that quantifies GHG emissions in biosolids management. The objective of this study was to determine the validity of the BEAM, by estimating and assessing GHG emissions for selected biosolids management practices. An Alberta, Canada-based facility that currently treats biosolids was selected as a case study. Six different end-use strategies within the Alberta region were assessed and compared: lagoon storage, land application, composting, biosolids cake storage, thermal energy, and landfill disposal. Based on the model results, the order of emissions (from least to highest) is: land application < lagoon storage < biosolids cake storage < composting < thermal energy < landfill disposal. These results may not be entirely accurate, as estimates were used for input parameters instead of site-specific data and certain parameters in the BEAM, such as soil sequestration factor for compost, may not reflect real conditions. In addition, a conservative approach was taken for the lagoon storage emissions calculations. The BEAM may provide a good means for municipalities to determine GHG emissions, but in order to obtain more accurate emissions estimates for various biosolids management practices, on-site measurements and further model assessments are required.",,"Assessment models; Biosolids management; Conservative approaches; Land applications; Landfill disposal; Management process; Model assessment; On-site measurement; Biological materials; Biosolids; Civil engineering; Composting; Digital storage; Estimation; Gas emissions; Lakes; Land fill; Waste management; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875542649

As a result, we were able to accomplish 100% (volume-based) utilisation of LNG cold in Terminal 1. This means that we no longer have to use seawater to produce city gas in Terminal 1.

In this study, in order to achieve this aim, the mathematical simulation model which calculates the energy demand and supply per hour in the SMART factory has been developed. Based on the mathematical simulation model, a system which is able to reduce consumption of liquid fossil fuels and electric power has been designed. As a result, it has been proved that it is possible to reduce 25% or more CO2 emissions using the system that combines photovoltaic power generation with electric forklift trucks.",,"Electric power; Energy demands; Fork lift trucks; Mathematical simulation model; Okayama; Photovoltaic power generation; Regional characteristics; Renewable energies; Utilization systems; Wood chip; Automobiles; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Liquids; Materials handling equipment; Solar energy; Trucks; Wood products; Automobiles; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; China; Energy; Fossil Fuels; Materials Handling; Simulation; Trucks; Utilization; Wood Products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871773596

The reductions in pH and aragonite saturation state in the Arctic Ocean have been caused by the melting of sea ice as well as by an increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Therefore, future projections of pH and aragonite saturation in the Arctic Ocean will be affected by how rapidly the reduction in sea ice occurs. The observed recent Arctic sea-ice loss has been more rapid than projected by many of the climate models that contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. In this study, the impact of sea-ice reduction rate on projected pH and aragonite saturation state in the Arctic surface waters was investigated. Reductions in pH and aragonite saturation were calculated from the outputs of two versions of an Earth system model with different sea-ice reduction rates under similar CO2 emission scenarios. The newer model version projects that Arctic summer ice-free condition will be achieved by the year 2040, and the older version predicts ice-free condition by 2090. The Arctic surface water was projected to be undersaturated with respect to aragonite in the annual mean when atmospheric CO2 concentration reaches 513 (606) ppm in year 2046 (2056) in new (old) version. At an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 520 ppm, the maximum differences in pH and aragonite saturation state between the two versions were 0.1 and 0.21 respectively. The analysis showed that the decreases in pH and aragonite saturation state due to rapid sea-ice reduction were caused by increases in both CO2 uptake and freshwater input. Thus, the reductions in pH and aragonite saturation state in the Arctic surface waters are significantly affected by the difference in future projections for sea-ice reduction rate. Our results suggest that the future reductions in pH and aragonite saturation state could be significantly faster than previously projected if the sea-ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean keeps its present pace. © 2012 Author(s).

In Sect. 7.1, international policies and measures are discussed. First, a theoretical comparison of cap and trade and carbon tax under uncertainty is described. Then reflecting the global paradigm shift from a top-down to a bottom-up approach since 2009 (COP15), the focus is mainly on policies under the pledge and review regime such as a sectoral approach. Other policies that have indirect effects for mitigation such as trade liberalization of climate friendly goods and services, green growth including removal of environmentally harmful subsidies, and financial assistance are also discussed. In Sect. 7.2, the discussion focuses on domestic policies. Firstly, the author compares economic incentive and direct regulations, then analyzes specific policies that have been actually introduced into several countries or regions. They are the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), cap and trade and voluntary measures in Japan, and policies to promote renewable energy (Feed-in Tariff). © Springer-Verlag London 2012.",,"Bottom up approach; Economic incentive; EU Emissions Trading Scheme; Financial assistance; International policies; Policies and measures; Renewable energies; Trade liberalizations; Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883004239

One promising approach to achieve FSC is to combine appropriate land use (location of photovoltaic panels (PVs)), transportation (large scale use of electric vehicles (EVs)) and energy system (smart grid systems), because these urban elements interact with each other. However, there are few models which simulate these elements in an integrated manner. This paper presents two research results which achieve this integration. The first uses a long-term perspective to simulate the effects of urban form on electricity demand using a newly developed land use model. The model simulates electricity demand under possible future compact/dispersion city scenarios in 2050 for the Tokyo metropolitan area. The second, real time model, simulates the effects of large-scale introduction of EVs and PVs on hourly regional electric demand/supply for Yokohama city, Japan, using an agent based transport simulator called MATSim. The results suggest that the hourly electricity surplus from PVs can be fully stored without waste if 22% of the EVs are used as battery storage when all of the current cars are replaced by EVs. Regional electricity demand structure will change if EVs are diffused on a large scale, but it depends on the timing of EV-charging.","EV; Integrated model; PV; Smart city; Urban scenarios","Carbon dioxide; Electricity; Electronic commerce; Land use; Photovoltaic cells; Traffic control; EV; Integrated modeling; PV; Smart cities; Urban scenarios; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897017010

The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program is one such incentive program at the Department of Energy (DOE). In 2007, when the Detroit 3 automakers-General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler-faced financial difficulties and U.S. fuel economy standards were raised, Congress established the ATVM program within DOE. It provides direct interest-bearing loans to automakers and parts suppliers to construct new U.S. factories or retrofit existing factories to produce vehicles that achieve at least 25% higher fuel economy than model year 2005 vehicles of similar size and performance. The ATVM program is authorized to award up to $25 billion in loans; there is no deadline for completing such loan commitments. The program was not funded by Congress until 2009, when it appropriated $7.5 billion to cover the subsidy cost for the $25 billion in loans, as well as $10 million for program implementation. Since the start of the program, DOE has awarded $8.4 billion in loans to five companies (Fisker, Ford, Nissan, Tesla, and The Vehicle Production Group). As of mid-October 2011, ATVM has $16.6 billion in remaining loan authority. Of the final loan agreements, DOE estimates that the projects funded will create or save 38,700 jobs at facilities in nine states. DOE estimates that annually the projects will displace 282 million gallons of gasoline (roughly 18,000 barrels per day, or about 0.2% of U.S. consumption) and will avoid about 2.4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions (about 0.04% of total U.S. emissions). Appropriations for the program do not cover the entire value of the loans but instead cover the ""subsidy cost"" (i.e., the risk of default). For the original appropriation, Congress assumed a subsidy rate of 30%, meaning that $7.5 billion would be sufficient to fund $25 billion in total loan value. However, as noted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the actual subsidy rate of approved loans has been higher (around 39% on average). Unless the subsidy rate for future loans is significantly lower (around 25%), the original appropriation will not be sufficient to fund the full $25 billion authorized. GAO estimates that a total of $3.3 billion in subsidy costs has been paid to date, with approximately $4.2 billion unobligated. Recently, the unobligated funds remaining for the program were a point of contention in the debate over continuing appropriations for FY2012. The House-passed version of H.R. 2608 would have taken $1.5 billion away from ATVM's balance sheet ($1 billion would be used for disaster relief and $500 million would be rescinded). The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2608 and the final bill signed by the president did not contain this language. In the end, no changes were made to the ATVM program. Several concerns have been raised about the program. GAO has recommended that, in evaluating automaker progress, DOE should use experienced engineers and apply new financial and technology assessments. In addition, questions have been raised about whether ATVM effectively subsidizes automakers' compliance with higher corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards and whether the range of advanced technologies being supported is too narrow. This report discusses the history of the program, outlines the projects receiving loans, discusses some of the key issues, and reviews the U.S. motor vehicle industry's involvement. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The GCM produces the lateral boundary condition (LBC) for the Eta model. Two initial SUBT conditions (one cold and another warm) on May 1st were assigned for the GCM runs and the corresponding Eta runs. The results suggest that antecedent May 1st warm initial SUBT in the western U.S. contributes positive June precipitation over the southern U.S. and less precipitation to the north, consistent with the observed anomalies between a year with a warm spring and a year with a cold spring in the western U.S. The anomalous cyclone induced by the surface heating due to SUBT anomaly propagated eastward through Rossby waves in westerly mean flow. In addition, the steering flow also contributed to the dissipation of perturbation in the northeastern U.S. and its enhancement in southeastern U.S. However, these results were obtained only when the Eta model run was driven by the corresponding GCM run. When the same reanalysis data were applied for both (cold and warm initial SUBT) Eta runs' LBCs, the precipitation anomalies could not be properly produced, indicating the intimate dependence of the regional climate sensitivity downscaling on the imposed global climate forcing, especially when the impact was through wave propagation in the large-scale atmospheric flow.

It was found that addition of appropriate amounts of Mg (0.3% and 0.5%, mass fraction) promoted the dispersion of metallic particles and decreased carbon deposition. In these cases, the presence of Mg in the PtMgNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst could inhibit reduction of Sn species, thus more Sn could exist in oxidized states, which is advantageous to the reaction. However, when the content of Mg was excessive, the metallic particles were not well distributed and the particles agglomerated more easily. Moreover, the reduction of Sn species at high temperatures is relatively easy, which is disadvantageous to the reaction. In our experiments, the addition of 0.5% Mg to the PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst gave the best catalytic performance.

Geological Survey, Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science, SD, United States","Plant phenology refers to the emergence of an annual cycle of natural phenomena in plants affected by climate and other environmental factors. Information of crop phenology can directly reflect the effect of temperature and precipitation on the crop, which is essential for evaluating crop growth, productivity and crop management. Remote sensing technique is an important method to detect vegetation phenology with high spatial-temporal scales. Vegetation index generated by infrared and near-infrared band based on satellite remotely sensed data can reflect the status of vegetation growth and coverage more accurately. The Northeast China includes Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, which rice area accounts for about 10% of total rice area and its rice yield accounts for 11% of total rice yield in China. Rice planting in Northeast China plays an important role in China's food safety. In this study, we developed a method for detecting phenological stages of rice in Northeast China based on the EOS-MODIS multi-temporal remote sensing data, including MOD09A1 and MCD12Q1 in 2008. The rice crop phenological stages were detected by using EOS-MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data, and compared with the observed rice phenological stages in 24 selected agro-meteorological sites in Northeast China. The method consists of four procedures: (1) calculating the EVI value and extracting time profile from the location where 24 selected sites through MODIS-EVI data; (2) filtering the noise in EVI time profile by wavelet transform with twenty six types of wavelets; (3) identifying the rice planting date, heading date and ripening date by the variation characteristics in the smoothed EVI time profile; (4) comparing the result calculated by this method with the observed data from the 24 agro-meteorological sites in study area in 2008 and calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), then choosing the best type of wavelets. Due to the temporal resolution of the MODIS/Terra is 8 days, there will be missing data in the EVI time profile. The cubic spline interpolated (CSI) method (more smoother and stabler) was applied to repair the missing data, which can reflect the missing data more authentic. The twenty six types of wavelet: Daubechies(7-20), Coiflet(3-5) and Symlet(7-15) were used when filtering EVI time profile. The results showed that, the case using Symlet11 shows a remarkably good result in determining phenological stages, which is compared with the observed data. Most of the RMSE in planting date were less than 16 days. Most of the RMSE in heading date and ripening date were less than 8 days.

The ecological assets are simulated by using remote sensing quantitative retrieval and economic evaluation methods. The remote sensing data sets include NOAA/AVHRR-NDVI at a spatial resolution of 1km in 1995 (February 1995-January 1996), MODIS\NDVI in 2000 (February 2000-January 2001) and 2007 at a resolution of 250m, land use interpreted by using Landsat TM images in 1995, 2000 and 2007 at the scale of 1: 100000, and land cover in 1980S and 2005 at the scale of 1: 250000. The ecological adjustment coefficient is estimated on the basis of the net primary productivity and vegetation coverage in the region, which are simulated by a modified Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) terrestrial carbon model and the Pixel Binary Model, respectively. The results show that the overall amount of ecological assets in the Yangtze River Delta declined by 5. 1%, changing from 89. 1 billion yuan in 1995 to 84. 6 billion yuan in 2007. The ecological assets in the region consist of forest, rivers/lakes and cropland, accounting for 48.0%, 26.7% and 20.5%, respectively. The total amount of ecological assets for each major city in the region presents a decreasing trend, and there is a spatial heterogeneity. The reduction of ecological assets in the cities of Shanghai, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo was substantial, at 798, 486, 441, 427 and 403 million yuan, respectively. However the decreased amount and rate of the ecological assets in other cities such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou and Taizhou were small, at 57, 47, 122 and 155 million yuan, respectively. The spatial distribution of ecological assets in the Yangtze River Delta exhibits a declining pattern from the south to the north, increasing slightly in the south and north but decreasing severely in the central area from 1995 to 2007. Such a pattern of change in ecological assets implies that it may reduce the ecological safety in some affected areas, but this will not be an ecological constraint for sustainable development in the Yangtze River Deltaic region as a whole. Land-use change is found to be the dominant factor resulting in the reduction of ecological assets and their dissimilarities in spatial distribution. Change in ecological assets is also mediated by urban expansion, land reformation and reclamation. However the national ecological restoration projects, such as 'Grain to Green', 'Soil and Water Conservation' and 'Wetland and Barren Hills Rehabilitation', have played an offsetting role in reversing the downward trend of ecological assets in the Yangtze River Delta. There are some uncertainties for evaluating ecological assets based on remote sensing quantitative retrieval and economic evaluation methods. The uncertainties are mainly influenced by three factors: the evaluation factors for ecological assets and the criteria for evaluation; the spatial resolution of remote sensing data and the precision of applied ecological models; climate fluctuations and meteorological data with inherent interpolation errors.","Ecological assets; Spatial and temporal change; Yangtze river delta","assessment method; AVHRR; data set; ecological modeling; economic analysis; heterogeneity; land use change; meteorology; NOAA satellite; primary production; remote sensing; restoration ecology; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; vegetation cover; wetland; wetland management; China; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872257906

Our simulated results show a significant declining rate of 18.7 Gg Ca-1 (1Gg = 109g) (with a 95% confidence boundary of 17.6 ∼ 19.8 Gg C a-1) at national scale, but substantially varying from the maximum annual CH4 emission of 2.4 Tg C a -1 (1Tg = 1012g) (with a 95% confident boundary of 1.8 ∼ 3.4 Tg C a-1) in 1952 to the minimum annual CH4 emission of 1.3 Tg C a-1 (with a 95% confident boundary of 1.0 ∼ 1.9 Tg C a-1) in 2003. The marshland loss made the largest contribution to the CH4 emission reduction with an cumulative effect of 37.9 Tg C (with a 95% confident boundary of 28.0 ∼ 54.1 Tg C) for the past 60years. Ozone pollution reduced CH4 emission, while elevated atmospheric CO2, nitrogen deposition, climate change, and multiple-factor interaction, cumulatively stimulated CH4 emission. Climate variability predominately controlled the inter-annual variations in CH4 emissions. A substantial spatial variation in CH4 emission was observed across China's marshland. At regional scale, the Northeast, followed by Northwest and Southeast, made the greatest contribution, while North and Southwest made minor contributions to the national CH 4 emission. This study suggests that it is necessary to consider multiple global change factors when estimating regional CH4 fluxes in natural wetlands.

In many cases, the significant increases in carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned carbon levels can be attributed to local poor combustion conditions as a result of poorly controlled fuel- A ir distribution within the furnace. The ZonalTM combustion monitoring and tuning system developed by GE is available to detect and correct the furnace air-fuel distribution imbalance. The system monitors the boiler excess oxygen (O2) and combustible gases, primarily carbon monoxide (CO), by using spatially distributed multipoint sensors located in the boiler's high temperature upper convective backpass region. At these locations, the furnace flow is still significantly stratified allowing tracing of poor combustion zones to specific burners and OFA ports. Using a model-based tuning system, operators can rapidly respond to poor combustion conditions by redistributing airflows to select burners and OFA ports. By improving combustion at every point within the furnace, the boiler can operate at reduced excess O2 and reduced furnace exit gas temperature (FEGT) while also reducing localized hot spots, corrosive gas conditions, slag formation, and carbon-in- A sh. Benefits include improving efficiency, reducing NOX emissions, increasing output and maximizing availability.

In this paper, by taking Henan Province as an example, the simulation results showed that the implementation of policies and technologies to promote the degree of intensity of energy demand and utilization had a great impact on the energy consumption structure, and the greatest difference in energy demand in three different scenarios reached 9.8Mtce, and the CO 2 emission produced by direct energy consumption from end users in three different scenarios had a downward trend. Rapid consumption of residential energy increases the deficiency of energy supply, and brings serious environmental problems, especially climate change caused by CO 2 emission that has become the focus of public attention. In the field of residential energy in China, there are some residential energy analysis and their environmental impact assessments without clear and quantifiable targets, especially provincial residential energy analysis and their environmental impact assessments. Due to lack of support of detailed data, technical and economic analysis, the operability of analysis is poor and the results of the analysis are not ideal. Lack of analytical methods has a serious influence on proper formulation and implementation of energy development policies. LEAP(Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system) can construct the characteristics of data structure according to the availability of data [1] and the analytical purpose and type, because of its operating flexibility and ease to use in the analysis and computation, as well as flexible data structure. Therefore, it is widely used in the fields of energy demand forecasting [2]-[4], impact of energy on the environment [5]- [6], industrial development planning [7], climate change [8], traffic [9]- [11]and so on. In this paper, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system software was applied to build residential energy and environment model, compare and analyze environmental impact and energy demand of residents in Henan in different scenarios from 2005 to 2030, on the condition that an increased residential energy demand was ensured.

The analysis is based on the annual-mean data constructed from long-term ""free running"" simulations and short-range hindcasts. The hindcasts are initialized every day with the ECMWF analysis for the Year(s) of Tropical Convection. It has been found that most systematic errors, particularly those associated with moist processes, are apparent in day 2 hindcasts. These errors steadily grow with the hindcast lead time and typically saturate after five days with amplitudes comparable to the climate errors. Examples include the excessive precipitation inmuch of the tropics and the overestimate of net shortwave absorbed radiation in the stratocumulus cloud decks over the eastern subtropical oceans and the Southern Ocean at about 608S. This suggests that these errors are likely the result of model parameterization errors as the large-scale flow remains close to observed in the first few days of the hindcasts. In contrast, other climate errors are present in the hindcasts, but with amplitudes that are significantly smaller than and do not approach their climate errors during the 6-day hindcasts.

Currently, most of discrimination processes are manually operated, which are time-consuming and inevitably limited by the subjective evaluation. In this paper, an automatic growing area discrimination method is presented based on tobacco near-infrared (NIR) spectrum using support vector machine (SVM). The Savitzky-Golay smoothing method and principle component analysis are used for tobacco NIR spectra preprocessing. A SVM model is established to investigate the characteristics of growing areas. The developed SVM classifier produces the best prediction accuracy of 80.3% in testing subset with 14 principle components as the inputs. It is 6% and 2% higher than that of artificial neuron network and Mahalanobia distance model respectively, which were developed for comparison. It demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of SVM for growing area discrimination. The prediction ability for each growing region is further analyzed by the measurements derived from confusion matrix, such as true positive rate, true negative rate, positive predictive value and F1 score.

The purpose of this project is to provide the Greater Moncton Area with a flood risk assessment based on impacts of climate change, to identify vulnerable infrastructure, and to recommend adaptation measures. The primary flooding risk for the project area results from extreme high water levels in the estuary, which is a combined result of six components: (1) global sea level rise due to climate change; (2) land subsidence; (3) tide; (4) storm surge; and (5) freshwater flow. To determine the total flooding risk, a unique methodology specific to the region was developed which addressed how the parameters are affected by climate change, their dependence on each other, and the timing and coincidence of the underlying processes.

Pierre et Marie Curie, France","Photochemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in marine biogeochemical cycles, including the regeneration of inorganic nutrients. DOM photochemistry affects nitrogen cycling by converting bio-refractory dissolved organic nitrogen to labile inorganic nitrogen, mainly ammonium (NH4+). During the August 2009 Mackenzie Light and Carbon (MALINA) Program, the absorbed photon-based efficiency spectra of NH44 photoproduction (i.e. photoammonification) were determined using water samples from the SE Beaufort Sea, including the Mackenzie River estuary, shelf, and Canada Basin. The photoammonification efficiency decreased with increasing wavelength across the ultraviolet and visible regimes and was higher in offshore waters than in shelf and estuarine waters. The efficiency was positively correlated with the molar nitrogen:carbon ratio of DOM and negatively correlated with the absorption coefficient of chromophoric DOM (CDOM). Combined with collateral measurements of CO2 and CO photoproduction, this study revealed a stoichiometry of DOM photochemistry with a CO2: CO: NH4+ molar ratio of 165: 11: 1 in the estuary, 60: 3: 1 on the shelf, and 18: 2: 1 in the Canada Basin. The NH4+ efficiency spectra, along with solar photon fluxes, CDOM absorption coefficients and sea ice concentrations, were used to model the monthly surface and depth-integrated photoammonification rates in 2009. The summertime (June&amp;ndash;August) rates at the surface reached 6.6 nmol l-1 d-1 on the Mackenzie Shelf and 3.7 nmol l-1 d-1 further offshore; the depth-integrated rates were correspondingly 8.8 μmol m-2 d-1 and 11.3 μmol m-2 d-1. The offshore depth-integrated rate in August (8.0 μmol m-2 d -1) was comparable to the missing dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) source required to support the observed primary production in the upper 10-m layer of that area. The yearly NH4+ photoproduction in the entire study area was estimated to be 1.4 × 108 moles, with 85% of it being generated in summer when riverine DIN input is low. Photoammonification could mineralize 4% of the annual dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) exported from the Mackenzie River and provide a DIN source corresponding to 7% of the riverine DIN discharge and 1400 times the riverine NH44 flux. Under a climate warming-induced ice-free scenario, these quantities could increase correspondingly to 6%, 11%, and 2100 times. Photoammonification is thus a significant nitrogen cycling term and may fuel previously unrecognized autotrophic and heterotrophic production pathways in the surface SE Beaufort Sea. © 2012 Author(s).",,"ammonia; biogeochemical cycle; dissolved matter; estuarine environment; global warming; mineralization; nitrogen compound; primary production; sea ice; wavelength; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Mackenzie Estuary; Northwest Territories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879110707

SAS is fundamentally based on the analytic solution to a set of equations that describe carbon transfers within ecosystems over time. SAS is implemented by three steps: (1) having an initial spin-up with prior pool-size values until net primary productivity (NPP) reaches stabilization, (2) calculating quasi-steady-state pool sizes by letting fluxes of the equations equal zero, and (3) having a final spin-up to meet the criterion of steady state. Step 2 is enabled by averaged time-varying variables over one period of repeated driving forcings. SAS was applied to both site-level and global scale spin-up of the Australian Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model. For the carbon-cycle-only simulations, SAS saved 95.7% and 92.4% of computational time for site-level and global spin-up, respectively, in comparison with the traditional method (a long-term iterative simulation to achieve the steady states of variables). For the carbon-nitrogen coupled simulations, SAS reduced computational cost by 84.5% and 86.6% for site-level and global spin-up, respectively. The estimated steady-state pool sizes represent the ecosystem carbon storage capacity, which was 12.1 kg C mg -2 with the coupled carbon-nitrogen global model, 14.6% lower than that with the carbon-only model. The nitrogen down-regulation in modeled carbon storage is partly due to the 4.6% decrease in carbon influx (i.e., net primary productivity) and partly due to the 10.5% reduction in residence times. This steady-state analysis accelerated by the SAS method can facilitate comparative studies of structural differences in determining the ecosystem carbon storage capacity among biogeochemical models. Overall, the computational efficiency of SAS potentially permits many global analyses that are impossible with the traditional spin-up methods, such as ensemble analysis of land models against parameter variations. © 2012 Author(s).",,"acceleration; analytical framework; carbon sequestration; comparative study; ecosystem modeling; net primary production; nitrogen; numerical model; residence time; stabilization; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867825991

Afforestation is the primary measure of the Project. Because of low land quality, ecological species planted and short-term growing, mid-coarse satellite data is serious limited to check planting effect in many areas. With the development of remote sensing, finer images provide better choice to exactly detect the distribution of afforestation parcels and forested area of the Project. In this study, an exact automatic recognition algorithm for the Project parcels is developed. It is based on finer RS data (less than 5m spatial resolution), and integrates object-oriented, BP artificial neural network, multi-segmentation and expert knowledge, considering the differential features between trees and other land vegetation in terms of image hue, grey value, textural features, RGB and NDVI. Kangping county is taken as an example to test the algorithm at the support of 5-times SPOT5 images since 2003.

Restoration of drained peatlands by drain blocking and flooding is a common measure to conserve and augment the carbon stock of peatland soils. Here, we report to what extent flooding affected the contribution of heterotrophic and rhizosphere respiration to soil CO2 efflux in a grass-dominated mountain fen in Germany. Soil CO2 efflux was measured in three un-manipulated control plots and three flooded plots in two consecutive years. Flooding was achieved by permanent irrigation during the growing seasons. Radiocarbon signatures of CO2 from different sources including soil CO2 efflux, incubated peat cores and live grass roots were repeatedly analyzed for partitioning of soil CO2 efflux. Additionally, heterotrophic respiration and its radiocarbon signature were determined by eliminating rhizosphere respiration in trenched subplots (only control). In the control plots, rhizosphere respiration determined by 14C signatures contributed between 47 and 61% during the growing season, but was small (4 ± 8%) immediately before budding. Trenching revealed a smaller rhizosphere contribution of 33 ± 8% (2009) and 22 ± 9% (2010) during growing seasons. Flooding reduced annual soil CO2 efflux of the fen by 42% in 2009 and by 30% in 2010. The reduction was smaller in 2010 mainly through naturally elevated water level in the control plots. A one-week interruption of irrigation caused a strong short-lived increase in soil CO2 efflux, demonstrating the sensitivity of the fen to water table drawdown near the peat surface. The reduction in soil CO2 efflux in the flooded plots diminished the relative proportion of rhizosphere respiration from 56 to 46%, suggesting that rhizosphere respiration was slightly more sensitive to flooding than heterotrophic respiration. © 2012 Author(s).",,"biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; fen; flood; flooding; grass; growing season; heterotrophy; irrigation; mountain region; organic carbon; peatland; precipitation (climatology); restoration ecology; rhizosphere; soil respiration; water level; water table; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865759585

This study describes and proposes a lean-burn system for reducing pollutant emissions and improving motorcycle engine performance. The lean-burn system, called semi-direct injection (SDI), is comprised of high-swirl charge, injection during intake-valve opening, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) injection. A conventional motorcycle engine with port fuel injection (PFI) and spark ignition (SI) was retrofitted by designing a new intake port with a controllable plate to enhance the swirl of intake flow. The swirl ratio was increased to 3.4, enhancing the turbulence of air flow inside the combustion chamber, and the lean limit was extended to 1.7 of relative air/fuel ratio (lambda). The engine was tested at a low-load region which includes most operating points of the ECE-40 driving cycle. A complete engine performance map was produced and a comparison was undertaken between the new design and regular gasoline engines. The results show that brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) decreased by 19.2%. Brake-specific exhaust emissions of CO2, NOx and CO were decreased by 27%, 47% and 94%, respectively.

The Tier 4 standards for nonroad diesel engines, being phased in from 2008 through 2015, also require similar level of reduction in PM. Most conventional diesel engines could meet these low PM standards, once equipped with a diesel particulate filter (DPF). However, accurate, repeatable measurements of this PM may pose significant challenges. Gravimetric PM measurement involves diluting exhaust, then collecting the resultant aerosol sample on approved filter media. Few data exist to characterize the evolution of particulate matter (PM) in dilution tunnels, particularly at very low PM mass levels. Data are lacking as well, for PM evolution in portable dilution instruments and in exhaust plumes downstream of the tailpipe. Size distributions of ultra-fine particles in the diesel exhaust from a naturally aspirated ISUZU C240 diesel engine, equipped with a DPF, were studied. Particle size distribution data, during steady-state engine operations, were collected using a Cambustion DMS500 Fast Particulate Spectrometer. The effects of dilution ratios, dilution rates, and residence times on the diesel particulate matter (DPM) size distributions were analyzed and discussed. Measurements were made for three dilution methods: dilution in standard primary and secondary-dilution tunnels with a full scale Constant Volume Sampler (CVS) system, instrument dilution with a Portable Particulate Measurement Device (PPMD), and ambient dilution at the post-tailpipe exhaust plume centerline. Gaseous emissions measurements were utilized as surrogate confirmation of adequate mixing at the various measurement locations, as well as an indicator of dilution ratios. Tunnel sample results indicated varying size distributions at tunnel cross sections where the flow was still developing. Evolution of particle-size distributions was observed even for fully mixed primary flow conditions. Size distributions at the end of the secondary dilution tunnel were observed to vary with different secondary-dilution ratios. Particle-size distributions of post-tailpipe and PPMD test results were analyzed and compared with those results collected from the full-flow tunnel. Results from post-tailpipe sampling indicate that nucleation was the dominant process when the exhaust plume was diluted along the post-tailpipe centerline. Results from PPMD dilution measurements indicate that change of particle-size- distribution curves, including number count and mass concentration levels, were not as strongly correlated to dilution ratios as were the results from the other two sampling methods. This study shows that particle-size distributions measured inside full-flow dilution tunnel can adequately mimic freshly emitted exhaust sampled immediately post-tailpipe.

With rapid urbanization, residents in cities are playing increasingly important roles in the alteration of environment. Meanwhile, consumption is one of the remarkable drivers of environmental pollution in city areas. With the perception that unsustainable consumption patterns are the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment, environmental concerns move to household sectors and related lifecycle activities. Food is the most important consumable of daily household life. The carbon footprint of food shows the carbon emission of the food provisions for the whole city and the contributions to the climate change. Based on the theory and model of carbon footprint, and using the life cycle analysis (LCA), we calculate and analyze the carbon footprint of food consumption according to the reality of Beijing city and the food supply plan. The result shows that the total carbon footprint of food consumption is 4. 768×106 t, about 6% of the total carbon footprint of Beijing, corresponding to 310. 0kg/ cap, and accounting for 23. 3% of the total emission of household consumption, which is only 5. 96% of the total carbon dioxide emission in Beijing. This reflects the limited impact of food consumption on the environment, carbon emission, and climate change. If Beijing wants to achieve a goal of carbon reduction of more than 6%, it is not sufficient to take measures in the field of food consumption alone. The most important part of food consumption carbon footprint is from grain, and the second part is from fruits and vegetables. These two parts account for more than 65% of carbon footprint of food consumption. The most important process of food consumption carbon emission is from reprocessing and cooking of foods, which consume most of household energy, and result in almost 60% of the total carbon emission. One important reason for this phenomenon is that this process directly refers to energy using which serves as the most important action leading to carbon emission. The second important process is usage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which shares 23. 23% of total food carbon footprint. Production and transportation are also important processes, which account for 8. 35% and 6. 98% of the total food consumption carbon footprint, respectively. Reduction of carbon emission in food reprocessing and cooking is the available process to reduce carbon emission from food consumption. And if we don′t use chemical fertilizers and pesticides and promote ecological agriculture (or organic agriculture) in our food production or improve the used-rate, we can reduce 1. 351×10 6t CO 2 every year in Beijing, that is 87. 84 kg CO 2 per capita per year. It is quite an efficient way to reduce carbon emission of Beijing city.

The results also show that other parts of Beijing residents′ consumption such as transportation, daily commodities and energy use have great contributions to carbon footprint.

Six hundred seventy-three clumps were detected with 12CO and 13CO emission, and 68% of the sample has C18O emission. Additional velocity components were also identified. A close consistency of the three line peak velocities was revealed for the first time. Kinematic distances are given for all the velocity components, and half of the clumps are located within 0.5 and 1.5kpc. Excitation temperatures range from 4 to 27K, slightly larger than those of Td . Line width analysis shows that the majority of ECC clumps are low-mass clumps. Column densities span from 1020 to 4.5 × 1022cm-2 with an average value of (4.4 ± 3.6) × 1021cm-2. cumulative fraction distribution deviates from the lognormal distribution, which is attributed to optical depth. The average abundance ratio of the 13CO to C18O in these clumps is 7.0 ± 3.8, higher than the terrestrial value. Dust and gas are well coupled in 95% of the clumps. Blue profile asymmetry, red profile asymmetry, and total line asymmetry were found in less than 10% of the clumps, generally indicating that star formation is not yet developed. Ten clumps were mapped. Twelve velocity components and 22 cores were obtained. Their morphologies include extended diffuse, dense, isolated, cometary, and filament, of which the last is the majority. Twenty cores are starless, and only seven cores seem to be in a gravitationally bound state. Planck cold clumps are the most quiescent among the samples of weak red IRAS, infrared dark clouds, UC H II candidates, extended green objects, and methanol maser sources, suggesting that Planck cold clumps have expanded the horizon of cold astronomy. © © 2012.

Individuals, governments, and industries need to be more energy efficient and contribute to the mitigation of global warming by reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In previous research, GHG emission reduction has been identified as one important criterion in improving the sustainability of urban infrastructure and urban water systems.Within the water industry, opportunities exist for reducing GHG emissions by improving pumping efficiency via the use of variable-speed pumps (VSPs). Previously, VSPs have been used in the optimization of the operation of existing water distribution systems (WDSs). However, in WDS design optimization problems, fixed-speed pumps (FSPs) are commonly used. In this study, a pump power estimation method, developed using a false position method based optimization approach, is proposed to incorporate VSPs in the conceptual design or planning of water transmission systems (WTSs), using optimization. This pump power estimation method is implemented within the solution evaluation process via a multiobjective genetic algorithm approach. A case study is used to demonstrate the application of the pump power estimation method in estimating pump power and associated energy consumption of VSPs and FSPs in WTS optimization. In addition, comparisons are made between variable-speed pumping and fixed-speed pumping in multiobjective WTS optimization accounting for total cost and GHG emissions. The results show that the use of variable-speed pumping leads to significant savings in both total cost and GHG emissions from WTSs for the case study considere. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Greenhouse gases; Multiobjective optimization; Variable speed pump; Water transmission system","Conceptual design; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Estimation; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Pumps; Research; Speed; Water pipelines; Design optimization problem; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Optimization approach; Pumping efficiency; Urban infrastructure; Variable-speed pumps; Water distribution system (WDSs); Water transmission system; Multiobjective optimization; carbon emission; design; distribution system; emission control; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; optimization; pumping; water industry; water planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899065818

We also analyzed the relationship between carbon density and age for these forest species, using logistic equations, and described the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest biomass and carbon storage between 1985 and 2003 in the study area. In this study, we used three methods of biomass expansion factor, biomass organ distribution and parameter fitting, to estimate carbon density. Qianyanzhou Experimental Station was chosen to compare these three corresponding results. The result obtained from parameter fitting was found to be the best way of calculating forest biomass and carbon storage on a regional scale. Increasing sample size would increase reliability of results. The following conclusions were obtained from this study. In 2003, total stand area of the three forest species was 31.04×10 4 hm 2; total biomass was 22. 20 Tg; vegetation carbon storage was 13. 07 Tg C; and average carbon density was 42.36 t C/hm 2. Carbon storage by different forest types in descending order was: Pinus massoniana, Pinus elliottii and Cunninghamia lanceolata. Carbon storage by age group in descending order was middle stand forests, young stand forests, near-mature stand forests, mature stand forests. Storage of carbon by plantation forests was 1. 89 times higher than by natural forests. Pinus massoniana and Cunninghamia lanceolata forests were the main natural forest carbon sinks, while Pinus elliottii forests were the main plantation carbon sinks. Carbon density of the three species increased each year and increased 8. 58 tC/hm 2 during the study period; this was 1. 66 times higher than in 1985. Forest carbon storage was 4. 91, 11.41, and 13. 07 Tg C in 1985, 1994, and 2003, respectively. Average amount of carbon fixation was 0. 45 Tg C/a per year. Stand area enlarged from 15. 54 × 10 4 hm 2 in 1985 to 30.30×10 4 hm 2 in 1994. The carbon density of the three species was higher in the east and west of Taihe County and lower in the middle. It was higher in the east and north of Xingguo County than in the middle. Average carbon density was highest at 700 to 900 m altitude and 25 to 35° slope. Overall, carbon density of forest vegetation increased with increasing altitude and slope. Afforestation projects contributed significantly to the increase in carbon storage in the red soil hilly region of Jiangxi Province.

The country's electricity tariff structure is under the enhanced single buyer policy: The Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT) occupies the electricity generation business and purchases up to 52 % of its own generation capacity from IPPs and SPPs; MEA and PEA (Provincial Electricity Authority - the other distribution electric utility in Thailand) purchase electricity from EGAT and then sell to end use customers. Thai government has set up a policy to promote the use of green energy from its end users, in order to stimulate the efficient use of multiple sources in power generation, to release the government's burden in its long term power development plan, and most importantly, to protect environment by reducing the use of fossil and emission of CO2. The policy creates a group of small scale power producers who are so called Very Small Power Producer or VSPP. They generate electric power from renewable energy sources, i.e. photo voltaic, biogas, biomass, small hydro, wind and rubbish. VSPPs' generating capacity is limited to not more than 10 Mw, they enjoy the right in generating electric power for their own usages and selling excessive power back to MEA's or PEA's power grids through the same meters they receive their electric power from the utilities. The principle of net metering is preferably applied, however, due to the sale tax is to be covered in every business transactions, the utilities have to separate taxable sale and purchase amount of energy using single or separate meter. The utilities follow below critera in power purchasing settlement with VSPPs: For generating power ≤ 6 MW, twofold price is given: For the amount that is not greater than the VSPP's monthly consumption, the price is an average retail price for all energy VSPPs purchase from the utility plus retail Ft. Or else; the price is an average whole sale price for all energy at all voltage levels the utility purchases from EGAT plus whole sale Ft For generating power &gt; 6 MW: The price is an average whole sale price for all energy at all voltage levels the utility purchases from EGAT plus whole sale Ft The above mentioned tariffs associate with the whole sale and retail Ft, which they are the electricity price adjustment factors that mainly cover the variation of electricity cost caused by the fluctuation of fuel, currency exchange rate and inflation. EGAT releases its burden through whole sale Ft which escalates the original price of every single energy MEA or PEA's purchases from EGAT, while the retail Ft, accordingly, cascades the burden to all of the retail customers. The introduction of VSPPs has caused some burden to electricity end users owing to the price adders which is a kind of incentive used to promote the green energy, e.g. the adder for photo voltaic is 8 Baht/kWh, on the other hand, these adders impact the retail price as they worsen the whole sale Ft, retail Ft and then upturn the retail price charged to all end use customers. The rocketed sky-high retail Ft situation in Thailand once slow down the promotion of the use of green energy as it deems unfair to other end users. This paper proposes an alternative to deal with the problem by tracking the root causes of Ft contributed by various groups of consumers. A large portion of the price adders would be used to stimulate the change of behavior to those who contaminate while smaller portion or none would be distributed among those who preserve. The paper will fully exhaust the class peak responsibility method to render it an efficient tool to promote the green policy, encouraging more green generators, and more importanty, to bring the causes of high Ft down.","Adder; Class peak responsibility (CPR); Feed in tariff; Ft","Business transaction; Change of behavior; Class peak responsibility (CPR); Currency exchange rates; Electric power; Electricity costs; Electricity generation; Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand; Electricity prices; Electricity tariff; End users; End-uses; Feed-in tariff; Ft; Generating capacity; Generation capacity; Green energy; Long-term power development plans; Multiple source; Net metering; Photovoltaics; Power grids; Power producer; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Retail customers; Retail price; Root cause; Small hydro; Small scale; Thailand; Voltage levels; Whole sale prices; Adders; Alternative fuels; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy policy; Renewable energy resources; Separation; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872106264

Data and techniques have recently become available which can permit new improved estimates of isoprene emissions over Hong Kong. The techniques are based on Guenther et al.'s (1993, 1999) model. The spatially detailed mapping of isoprene emissions over Hong Kong at a resolution of 100 m and a database has been constructed for retrieval of the isoprene maps from February 2007 to January 2008. This approach assigns emission rates directly to ecosystem types not to individual species, since unlike in temperate regions where one or two single species may dominate over large regions, Hong Kong's vegetation is extremely diverse with up to 300 different species in 1 ha. Field measurements of emissions by canister sampling obtained a range of ambient emissions according to different climatic conditions for Hong Kong's main ecosystem types in both urban and rural areas, and these were used for model validation. Results show the model-derived isoprene flux to have high to moderate correlations with field observations (i.e. r2 = 0.77, r2 = 0.63, r2 = 0.37 for all 24 field measurements, subset for summer, and winter data, respectively) which indicate the robustness of the approach when applied to tropical forests at detailed level, as well as the promising role of remote sensing in isoprene mapping. The GIS model and raster database provide a simple and low cost estimation of the BVOC isoprene in Hong Kong at detailed level. City planners and environmental authorities may use the derived models for estimating isoprene transportation, and its interaction with anthropogenic pollutants in urban areas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Foliar density; Leaf area index; Photosynthetically active radiation; Satellite image","biogenic emission; climate conditions; database; emission inventory; GIS; image resolution; isoprene; leaf area index; model test; model validation; photosynthetically active radiation; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; spatial data; tropical forest; vegetation cover; volatile organic compound; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872793438

Climate change is a global phenomenon, and so carbon markets can be geographically all-inclusive - a ton of carbon dioxide emitted in Beijing has the same effect as a ton of carbon dioxide emitted in New York. Other environmental markets are more nuanced. Markets for water quality, biodiversity, endangered species, fisheries, air quality, and aquatic resources, to name a few, must recognize that the commodities they trade exist at particular geographic scales, and set appropriate spatial limits on the redistribution of environmental quality. The size of geographic trading areas has significant implications for the economic viability of markets and the ecological quality of their offsets. U.S. wetland and stream mitigation markets, which emerged in the 1980s, provide perhaps the most established empirical example of how environmental markets function. This Article presents the first systematic assessment of the federal and state laws, regulations, guidance, and operating practices that shape the geographic size of U.S. wetland and stream markets. This Article first addresses the history of these geographic restrictions under the Clean Water Act, the importance of spatial context for ecosystem functions and services, and the economic-ecological tradeoffs implicated by geographic trading limits. Then, based on the results of the assessment, this Article argues that regulators should increase their transparency and consistency in setting geographic trading limits. It also presents a framework for using more specific geographic limits for different types of wetland and stream offsets to enhance a market's ecological and economic stability. Lessons from setting geographic limits for wetland and stream markets can be applied to other, nascent environmental markets.",,"carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem service; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental legislation; pollution tax; regulatory approach; trade-environment relations; wetland management; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861764971

This capability reduces fuel consumption and emissions during periods where the engine is not being utilized to provide propulsion or to power accessories. IS sytems are a low-cost and fast-growing technology in the industry-wide pursuit of increased vehicle efficiency, possibly becoming standard features in European vehicles in the near future. In contrast, there are currently only three non-hybrid vehicle models for sale in North America with IS systems, and these are distinctly low-volume models. As part of the United States Department of Energy's Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity (AVTA), ECOtality North America has tested the real-world effect of IS systems on fuel consumption in three vehicle models imported from Europe. These vehicles were chosen to represent three types of systems: (1) spark ignition (SI) with 12 V Belt Alternator Starter (BAS); (2) compression ignition (CI) with 12 V BAS; and (3) direct-injection SI (DISI) with 12 V BAS/combustion restart The vehicles have undergone both dynamometer and on-road testing, and the test results show somewhat conflicting data. The laboratory data and the portion of the on-road data in which the driving is conducted on a prescribed route with trained drivers produced significant fuel economy improvement. However, the fleet data do not corroborate the improvement even though the data show significant engine-off time. It is possible that the effects of the verying driving styles and routes in the fleet testing overshadowed the fuel economy improvements. More testing with the same driver over routes that are similar for the IS system enabled and disabled modes is recommended. There is anecdotal evidence that current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel economy test procedures do not capture the fuel economy gains that IS systems produce in real-world driving. The program test results provide information on the veracity of these claims and can help guide automotive manufacturers debating whether to include this system in future models.

This effort has engaged hundreds of people within the California state government and generated thousands of pages of detailed rules and studies. The upstream oil and gas production industry in California will be directly impacted by multiple initiatives that have arisen due to AB32 including: (1) Cap-and-Trade; (2) mandatory GHG reporting; and indirectly through (3) additional environmental factors to be considered in the context of CEQA permitting of new projects. Note that the greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations and programs in California are still very much in flux and thus, statements in this paper could become inaccurate. Court cases have been filed in 2010 and 2011 which challenge specific programs associated with AB32. One such example was a recent court decision related to the implementation of the low carbon fuel standard. Finally, this paper is not meant to be a comprehensive treatise on the specific rules of AB32. Instead it is intended to be a short introduction to the various California-sponsored GHG initiatives that impact the oil and gas sector. CARB has generated hundreds of pages of documentation for individual components of the AB32 program such as Cap-and-Trade or reporting. Thus, this paper is intended as a summary of the programs and the regulations for technical personnel in the upstream sector.

Both regulated and non-regulated emissions were measured, along with an analysis of the NO/NO2 split. A VBOX GPS system was used to log coordinates and road speed for driving parameters and emission analysis. Thermal couples were installed along the exhaust system to measure the temperatures of exhaust gases during cold start. The real time fuel consumption was measured. The study also looks at the influence of velocity on emissions of hydrocarbons (HCs) and NOx. The cold start period of an SI engine powered vehicle, was typically around 200 seconds in urban driving conditions. The results of this research show that the cold start period for the diesel engine is shorter than that for the SI engine. Emissions of CO, NO, NO 2, formaldehyde and total hydrocarbons (THCs) were higher during the cold start period than the warmed up period. The magnitude of increase during the cold start was smaller than SI engines. NOx emissions under real world driving conditions were well above the legislated values. The study of velocity and emissions also found a correlation between emissions of HCs and NO with vehicle velocity, showing a trend of higher speed alongside higher emissions.

The use of insulation materials made from renewable resources helps to reach environmental protection targets by reducing waste and CO2 emissions. The project Renew Building aims to accumulate knowledge about retrofit materials and techniques from renewable resources and transfer it further to a multilayer group of disciplines involved in the building process: planners, builders, craftsmen and building owners. The knowledge will be accessible in a database with free and unlimited access after revision according to practical requirements of the target groups. To successfully reach the goal of developing a cross disciplinary exchange and encouraging the use and acceptance of regional, renewable resources in the field of sustainable retrofitting, knowledge is spread via multiple pedagogical formats: on-site and e-learning training sessions for planners and craftsmen, lectures at Vienna University of Technology, via virtual platform, brochures, and by advising experts during the construction process of demonstration buildings. © 2012 IEEE.","Building Materials; Building Techniques; Education; Green Skills; Insulation Materials; Recycling; Renewable Resources; Retrofit; Training","Building techniques; Green Skills; Insulation materials; Renewable resource; Retrofit; Building materials; Carbon dioxide; E-learning; Education; Energy management; Insulating materials; Intelligent buildings; Knowledge management; Multilayers; Personnel training; Planning; Recycling; Retrofitting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875947903

This enhanced coalbed methane recovery/carbon sequestration test was conducted in the thick coals of the Fruitland Formation in the high rate production fairway of the San Juan Basin. The pilot test was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and managed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory. The SWP in collaboration with ConocoPhilips injected approximately16,700 metric tons of CO2 into the Fruitland coals from July 23rd of 2008 through August 14th of 2009. 3D seismic data from the site revealed that the seismic response of the Fruitland Formation is recognizable as a well defined seismic sequence and that individual coal zones in the formation are generally detectable. 3D seismic data also revealed that structures in the Fruitland Formation and overlying Kirtland Shale are more complex than anticipated. Analysis of well log data revealed that the Fruitland Formation coal zones throughout the area surrounding the site consist of two coal beds, each separated by a shale parting. This observation indicates that the coal reservoirs consist of six separate coal beds rather than three. Perfluorocarbon tracer monitoring revealed early arrival of tracer in a direction roughly orthogonal to that anticipated prior to CO2 injection. Tiltmeter derived ground surface displacements revealed subsidence across the area rather than uplift. The additional information obtained from the studies conducted at the site during its multiyear duration provide the opportunity to revise our models of the reservoir and sealing strata and to obtain new insights into observed reservoir responses to CO2 injection. A model discrete fracture network (DFN) is developed for the Fruitland coals that incorporates results from this multiyear study. Fracture sets incorporated in the model are derived from FMI log observations. Attributes derived from the 3D seismic data over the site are analyzed to obtain insights into larger scale reservoir architecture that may control flow in the vicinity of the CO2 injection well. These attributes are combined with ground displacements observed during CO2 injection to guide the distribution of fracture intensity through the reservoir. Properties of the DFN including porosity, permeability and fracture storage volume are upscaled into a gridded model of the reservoir. The aerial distribution of reservoir parameters derived in this study will improve our understanding of Fruitland coal reservoirs; help develop more effective strategies to enhance coalbed methane recovery combined with CO2 storage; and, help guide future flow simulations of Fruitland coal CO2 floods in this region of the high rate production fairway.","3D seismic attributes; Carbon sequestration; Discrete fracture networks; Enhanced coalbed methane recovery; Reservoir model","3D seismic; Carbon sequestration; Discrete fracture network; Enhanced coalbed methane recoveries; Reservoir models; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal storage; Complex networks; Fracture; Injection (oil wells); Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); Seismic response; Seismic waves; Shale; Three dimensional computer graphics; Water injection; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877617811

This study quantifies observed and modelled European ozone annual and seasonal linear trends from 158 harmonised rural background monitoring stations over a constant time period of a decade (1996-2005). Mean ozone concentrations are investigated, in addition to the ozone 5th percentiles as a measure of the baseline or background conditions, and the 95th percentiles that are representative of the peak concentration levels. This study aims to characterise and quantify surface European ozone concentrations and trends and assess the impact of the changing anthropogenic emission tracers on the observed and modelled trends. Significant (p&lt;0.1) positive annual trends in ozone mean, 5th and 95th percentiles are observed at 54%, 52% and 45% of sites respectively (85 sites, 82 sites and 71 sites). Spatially, sites in central and north-western Europe tend to display positive annual ozone trends in mean, 5th and 95th percentiles. Significant negative annual trends in ozone mean 5th and 95th percentiles are observed at 11%, 12% and 12% of sites respectively (18 sites, 19 sites and 19 sites) which tend to be located in the eastern and south-western extremities of Europe. European-averaged annual trends have been calculated from the 158 sites in this study. Overall there is a net positive annual trend in observed ozone mean (0.16±0.02 ppbv yr -1 (2σ error)), 5th (0.13±0.02 ppbv yr -1) and 95th (0.16±0.03 ppbv yr -1) percentiles, representative of positive trends in mean, baseline and peak ozone. Assessing the sensitivity of the derived overall trends to the constituent years shows that the European heatwave year of 2003 has significant positive influence and 1998 the converse effect; demonstrating the masking effect of inter-annual variability on decadal based ozone trends. The European scale 3-D CTM CHIMERE was used to simulate hourly O3 concentrations for the period 1996-2005. Comparisons between the 158 observed ozone trends to those equivalent sites extracted from regional simulations by CHIMERE better match the observed increasing annual ozone (predominantly in central and north-western Europe) for 5th percentiles, than for mean or 95th ozone percentiles. The European-averaged annual ozone trend in CHIMERE 5th percentiles (0.13±0.01 ppbv yr -1) matches the corresponding observed trend extremely well, but displays a negative trend for the 95th percentile (-0.03±0.02 ppbv yr -1) where a positive ozone trend is observed. Inspection of the EU-averaged monthly means of ozone shows that the CHIMERE model is overestimating the summer month O3 levels. In comparison to trends in EMEP emissions inventories, with the exception of Austria-Hungary, we do not find that anthropogenic NO x and VOC reductions have a substantial effect on observed annual mean O 3 trends in the rest of Europe. On a ten year time-scale presented in this study, O 3 trends related to anthropogenic NO x and VOC reductions are being masked as a result of a number of factors including meteorological variability, changes in background ozone and shifts in source patterns. © 2012 Author(s).",,"annual variation; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; emissions trading; nitrogen oxides; ozone; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; quantitative analysis; rural atmosphere; trend analysis; volatile organic compound; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863393588

The role of paid employment is particularly crucial in this process because paid employment is the means by which most people in advanced economies acquire income to satisfy human needs and wants. We offer a case study of planned TOD development in Adelaide, South Australia in relation to the location of transit routes and centres of paid employment. Our case study suggests that the planned construction of TOD along transit routes in Adelaide is unlikely to fit well with the priorities of employees of firms not located near train and tram lines. Unless the location of paid employment in relation to transit routes is considered in planning for a sustainable city there must be a question mark over how effective investment in transit oriented development will be.","Housing Choice; Paid Employment; Transit Routes; Urban Planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856819201

However, under severe stress conditions they may not complete annual wood production all the way down to the root collar resulting in continuously missing outer rings at lower stem sections (CMORs). Here we test whether CMORs occur at different distributional margins of woody plant species, where stress levels are expected to be high. We tested 13 species (202 individuals) of trees and shrubs growing at elevational and latitudinal shrub- and tree-lines, under conditions that are normally associated with a reduction of radial growth such as drought, cold or nutrient deficiency. Samples were collected from Alaska, north western Russia, Central Europe, Scandinavia and south eastern Spain. Annual radial growth was measured along several disks or cores of each individual applying the serial sectioning technique. Individuals of nine species showed CMORs. The proportion of individuals with CMORs within a sampled species and site ranged from 0% to 80%. The number of CMORs within an individual increased with decreasing sampling height on the stem. Significant correlations existed between the amount of CMORs and (i) cambial age, (ii) stem length, (iii) stem proportion/length below peat surface, and (iv) herbivore-caused defoliation intensity depending on the species and sampling location. Our results suggest that CMORs can be associated with a cambium that may be inactive, yet functional, for up to 18 years. We conclude that CMORs can occur in a wide variety of species, growth forms and biomes, suggesting a general strategy of woody plant growth. To avoid miss-dating in dendrochronological studies, we further recommend the use of the serial sectioning technique for woody plants growing in unfavorable environments, above all, when sample size is limited and when no established chronology for cross-dating is available. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.","Dating; Growth stress; Missing rings; Prostate woody plants; Serial sectioning; Shrubs","biome; dating method; defoliation; dendrochronology; drought; elevation; growth form; herbivore; nutrient limitation; shrub; tree ring; Alaska; Russian Federation; Scandinavia; Spain; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862310374

Methods. A mixed methods predominantly qualitative study, using a grounded theory approach, set in Scottish general practice. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with professional key informants, 6 Practitioner Services staff who administer the GP registration system and 6 GPs with managerial or clinical experience of working with ""revolving door"" patients. Descriptive statistical analysis and qualitative analysis of patient removal episodes linked with routine hospital admissions, outpatient appointments, drug misuse treatment episodes and deaths were carried out with cohorts of ""revolving door"" patients identified from 1999 to 2005 in Scotland. Results: A ""revolving door"" patient is removed 4 or more times from GP lists in 7 years. Patients had complex health issues including substance misuse, psychiatric and physical health problems and were at high risk of dying. There was a dramatic reduction in the number of ""revolving door"" patients during the course of the study. Conclusions: ""Revolving door"" patients in general practice had significant health problems. Their numbers have reduced dramatically since 2004 and this probably resulted from improved drug treatment services, pressure from professional bodies to reduce patient removals and the positive ethical regulatory and financial climate of the 2004 GMS GP contract.

This knowledge has guided them through many difficult episodes in the past when the Earth has brought forth natural catastrophes. The pulse of life that has sustained tribal cultures has ebbed and flowed. Indigenous peoples developed extensive networks of alliances and trade that helped them to survive environmental changes and upheavals. Many tribes moved with the changes of the waters and lands. The great encounter of Native peoples and settlers in the Pacific Northwest brought great changes to all sides, and to the environment. Much of the law relating to water and the environment was brought to this continent through European settlers, who saw these lands primarily through the lens of English common law and sensibilities. One hallmark of this worldview was that the world was seen primarily as static and unchanging; that while change might come and go, it cycled around a relatively fixed state. When the new United States signed treaties with the Indian tribes, the common phrase ""as long as the rivers run"" was used to describe the permanent relationship between the new society and the first inhabitants. By this, it was understood by all that the resources and the land base could forever be assumed to exist in a relatively fixed state and provide abundant and sufficient resources for all. Standing at the beginning of a new millennium, we now see that this worldview was overly optimistic. In 1992, over fifteen hundred world scientists, including a large number of Nobel Laureates, issued the ""World Scientists' Warning to Humanity,"" which began: Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course. Human activities inflict harsh and often irreversible damage on the environment and on critical resources. If not checked, many of our current practices put at serious risk the future that we wish for human society and the plant and animal kingdoms, and may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know. Fundamental changes are urgent if we are to avoid the collision our present course will bring about. One of the gravest threats that faces humanity as a whole, and Indigenous nations as culturally distinct peoples, is global climate change. Climate change presents significant challenges to Indigenous peoples, and is expected to put Native peoples' communities and cultural survival at risk. Some of the threats come from direct exposure to the impacts of climate change, such as extreme temperatures, floods, fires, droughts, and storms. Other threats are more indirect, including the effects of climate change on spreading diseases, significant cultural resources, and the transmission of traditional knowledge. The involvement of Indigenous peoples in climate change issues can be divided into three rough categories- Indigenous peoples as observers of climate change; Indigenous peoples as victims of both climate change and the actions taken to stop it (mitigation) and to respond to change that cannot be avoided (adaptation); and Indigenous peoples as mitigators of and adapters to climate change. Some of the earliest reporting on the relationship of Indigenous peoples to climate change emphasized their role as ""canaries in the mineshaft,"" referring to an old practice of coal miners to use canaries to detect the buildup of dangerous gases, such as carbon monoxide and methane. Indigenous peoples, because they live closely related to the land and its cycles and patterns, can provide an early warning system for climate change. Social and environmental justice and human rights issues are involved with both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Most concerns have addressed mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the use of fossil fuels through fuel efficiency, alternative energy sources, and clean technologies. Mitigation also includes measures to sequester (store) greenhouse gases by conserving existing natural forests or planting new ones. One of these mitigation measures is the use of biofuels to replace fossil fuels, resulting in the expansion of agricultural areas. Biofuel crops, such as soybeans and corn, can cause the expansion of large-scale agriculture into or adjacent to Indigenous territories and cause the loss of natural areas, the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and an increase in the runoff of agricultural pollutants into the environment. The introduction of biofuel crops can also compete for water that could be used for traditional crops and increase the price of foods, particularly subsistence staples such as corn. There is also evidence that, in some cases, biofuel crops do not actually achieve their goal of reducing fossil fuel emissions. Techniques known as life cycle or footprint assessments not only account for the relative carbon emissions from the use of fossil fuels and biofuels themselves, but also analyze the fossil fuels used in biofuels' production, transportation, use, and disposal in the environment. In some circumstances, these analyses demonstrate that some kinds of biofuel production may result in carbon emissions that are as high as or higher than some kinds of fossil fuels (Fargione et al. 2008). Other major mitigation measures for climate change focus on sequestration of carbon to decrease or prevent the release of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, either through the planting of trees (carbon plantations) or by preventing deforestation. One major initiative, United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+), seeks to increase carbon sequestration and to conserve forest ecosystems in developing tropical countries. There are some significant issues involved in this program related to the land rights and territorial integrity of Indigenous communities. This chapter will concentrate on the effects of climate change on tribal natural resources in the Pacific Northwest and on adaptation to those effects, after focusing on the effects of climate change on tribal natural resources in the Pacific Northwest. Indigenous peoples are not just victims of climate change, but are now empowering themselves to take the necessary steps to sustain their cultures in a dynamically changing world. © 2012 Zoltán Grossman and Alan Parker.

The model was calibrated using experimental data from an optical engine allowing measurements of the cylinder wall temperature to be made. To further validate the model, it was calibrated against a conventional engine and linearizations of the model were used to design model predictive controllers for control of the ignition timing using the inlet valve closing and the intake temperature as control signals.

Three isocaloric, amino acid balanced diets containing 10% corn DDGS with or without the probiotic Provalen™ were compared to a corn-soybean based control diet. Hens were 20-65 wk of age with each diet provided to two of six rows of stacked manure-belt cages (six decks high) in one house. Feed intake, water consumption, hen body weight, egg production, egg case weight, mortality, feed cost, and egg income were provided weekly by the cooperating egg company. Replicated monthly data, including hen body weight, hen-day egg production, egg weight, albumen height, Haugh units, yolk color, shell strength, and shell thickness, were determined from collected eggs. Ammonia gas measurements utilized a non-steady state flux chamber method coupled with photoacoustic infrared gas analyzer. Results indicated that including 10% DDGS with or without Provalen probiotic had economical benefits on a commercial scale. The 10% DDGS diet improved egg production, albumen height and yolk color.

This implies not only greener mobility, but also state-of-the-art commuting solutions. While ""electric"" is the buzzword for mobility in the current decade, soon it will be as common as any other mode of transport. Moreover, conventional cars have increased their electronic content both for human-machine interface (HMI) and also within each of the traditional systems such as engine management, steering, suspension, braking and safety systems. As technological paradigm shifts keep changing the way cars are defined, they will redefine the mobility concept in itself at a panoramic level. Recent emergence of carsharing, (as opposed to earlier concepts of carpooling), increased consumer demand to stay connected to the internet and multimedia during transport, a more sophisticated way of controlling vehicular applications, and ensuring a safe commuting experience are all key trends growing in mobility today.

The adverse health impacts of urban air pollution are well established, but less is known about effective intervention strategies. In this demonstration study we set out to establish methods to assess whether wearing an R95 activated carbon respirator could reduce intake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in street workers in Hanoi, Vietnam. Methods. In this demonstration study we performed a cross-over study in which non-smoking participants that worked at least 4 hours per day on the street in Hanoi were randomly allocated to specific respirator wearing sequences for a duration of 2 weeks. Urines were collected after each period, i.e. twice per week, at the end of the working day to measure hydroxy PAHs (OH-PAH) using gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was the urinary concentration of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP). Results: Forty-four participants (54.5% male, median age 40 years) were enrolled with the majority being motorbike taxi drivers (38.6%) or street vendors (34.1%). The baseline creatinine corrected urinary level for 1-OHP was much higher than other international comparisons: 1020 ng/g creatinine (IQR: 604-1551). Wearing a R95 mask had no significant effect on 1-OHP levels: estimated multiplicative effect 1.0 (95% CI: 0.92-1.09) or other OH-PAHs, except 1-hydroxynaphthalene (1-OHN): 0.86 (95% CI: 0.11-0.96). Conclusions: High levels of urine OH-PAHs were found in Hanoi street workers. No effect was seen on urine OH-PAH levels by wearing R95 particulate respirators in an area of high urban air pollution, except for 1-OHN.

Soil and sediment concentrations of metals and hydrocarbons exceeded regulatory benchmarks in and around a man-made embayment that supported ship building and steel fabrication. As well, the shoreline was highly disturbed with debris, erosion, and non-native vegetation, and consequently limited in its ability to support intertidal species typically expected in coastal waters of Western Canada. The Official Development Plan prepared by the City of Vancouver for SEFC incorporated shoreline improvements to public access, fish habitat, and safety and health objectives in response to community values expressed during an extensive public consultation process. Remediation and reconfiguration of the SEFC shoreline was thus a significant component of redevelopment which included removal of contaminated sediment and soil; filling of a portion of the embayment; stabilization, re-dressing, and planting of the remainder of the existing shoreline; and construction of an island in compensation for the partial filling of the embayment. Three annual surveys of a five-year post-construction monitoring program have been undertaken to date to evaluate the function of the constructed habitat and reconfigured shoreline. Both continue to be colonized by macroalgae and sessile invertebrates, and coverage and community structure is becoming more similar to reference areas. As well, several species of culturally, recreationally, and commercially important fish are using the habitat. © 2012 WIT Press.","Aftercare monitoring; Brownfield development; Habitat compensation; Habitat offsets; Post-construction monitoring; Remediation","benchmarking; biodiversity; brownfield site; coastal zone management; community response; community structure; environmental monitoring; environmental restoration; regulatory framework; remediation; shoreline; waterfront development; British Columbia; Canada; False Creek; Vancouver; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867264854

Nitrogen (N) limitation is thought to be the primary reason why these forests are a 'missing C sink' as atmospheric N deposition is shown to significantly promote plant growth and increase C sequestration in forests of these regions. Boreal forests are the second largest biome on earth and are limited by N availability. Soil CO2 emission is an important process of C cycling in boreal forests and it has shown promotion, no change and inhibition responses to N addition. Therefore studies on the CO2 flux from boreal forest soils and its control factors under increased atmospheric N deposition are essential. In this study, a manipulative N addition experiment was created in a cold-temperate coniferous forest in the Daxing' anling region to investigate this. NH4 NO3 fertilizer was added at four rates, each with three replicates: control (0 kg N hm-2 a-1), low N (10 kg N hm-2 a-1, the current N deposition level), medium N (20 kg N hm-2 a-1) and high N (40 kg N hm-2 a-1). Each plot had an area of 200 m2(10 m × 20 m) and a 10 m isolation band set between them. During the growing season (May to September), soil CO2 fluxes were measured by the static chamber-gas chromatography method and soil temperature, soil moisture, soil inorganic N and dissolved carbon content (DOC) were simultaneously measured to explore the main factors affecting CO2 emission. Results showed that N addition did not significantly change soil moisture content but significantly reduced soil dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the organic layer and increased soil DOC in the organic and mineral soil layers. Short-term N addition did not increase soil NH4+ -N content, but significantly increased soil NO3- -N content. In control plots, soil CO2 flux ranged from 195. 24 to 544. 91 mg CO2 m-2 h-1, with an average of (357. 33 ±18. 72) mg CO2 m-2 h-1. Exogenous N input tended to increase CO2 emission from the coniferous forest soil by 8. 3% to 18. 2%. Soil CO2 flux was primarily driven by soil temperature, followed by soil moisture and DIC content. The decrease in soil DIC caused by soil acidification was an important factor promoting soil CO2 emission. The overall pattern of soil CO2 flux was dominated by soil temperature but soil moisture appeared to control variation during peak growth periods. These results show that when investigating effects of N addition on soil CO2 flux, the roles of available N and C dynamics should be considered as well as soil temperature and moisture. It is therefore hypothesized that chronic atmospheric N deposition will stimulate CO2 emission from cold-temperate coniferous forest soils in the Daxing' anling region in the short term, which will partially offset C sequestration by plants.","Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Cold-temperate coniferous forest; Soil CO2 flux; Soil dissolved carbon; Soil inorganic nitrogen","ammonium; atmospheric deposition; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; coniferous forest; fertilizer application; forest soil; growing season; nitrate; nitrogen; nutrient availability; soil carbon; soil emission; soil moisture; soil nitrogen; soil temperature; temperate environment; Beijing [China]; China; Daxing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864199042

In particular, anthropogenic CO2 pipeline transportation from the energy plant to the remote sequestration area(both onshore and offshore) is a fundamental issue regarding the feasibility of applying the CCS technology. CO2 pipelines have been in operation in USA, Europe and North Africa for almost three decades. However, the technical challenges for pipelines transporting CO2 due to the relevant effects of different impurities coming from flue gases, are still needed to get people to take up, especially for China which is focusing on the roll-out of CCS. This paper will address a FE-based method which can assess residual life of a supercritical CO2 transmission pipeline containing an inner defect induced crack. Specifically, a portion of welded round steel pipeline is selected as the object of our analysis and an ANSYS finite element procedure is generated to simulate the stress state of an element volume along the radial direction and hence to calculate the effective stress due to the effects of crack closure. Afterwards, combining the effective stress we get in the above numeric analysis, the Paris equation is modified to build an integral analysis method for the residual life evaluation of CO2 pipeline. Lastly, in order to verify the validity of the proposed method, a pipeline example in a published paper is used as the benchmark model, the full-scale test results of which are compared with those from our method. Based on this, a section of CO2 pipeline, with an initial defect (assumed as a crack source), is analyzed and its residual life is evaluated by using the presented method. The analysis of numerical results indicates that the method presented in this paper can give us a valuable reference to life-evaluation for CO 2 pipeline in CCS. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.","CO2 transportation pipeline; Effective stress intensity factor; Residual fatigue life; Surface crack","Benchmark models; Carbon capture and storage; Crack sources; Effective stress; Effective stress intensity factor; Element volume; Energy plant; Fatigue life evaluation; Finite Element; Finite element procedure; Full scale tests; Induced crack; Industrial sources; Initial defects; Inner defects; Integral analysis; North Africa; Numerical results; Paris equations; Pipeline transportation; Power station; Radial direction; Residual life; Residual life evaluation; Steel pipeline; Stress state; Supercritical CO; Surface cracks; Technical challenges; Transmission pipelines; Transportation pipelines; Building materials; Carbon capture; Civil engineering; Cracks; Finite element method; Flue gases; Natural gas transportation; Numerical methods; Pipelines; Surface defects; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861722890

It is important to study how endogenous network structure and exogenous actor behaviour influence network formation and evolution over time. Current efforts in modelling longitudinal social networks are consistent with this view. The use of stochastic actor-based simulation models for the co-evolution of networks and behaviour allows the joint representation of endogenous and exogenous mechanisms, specifically the structural, componential, functional, and behavioural mechanisms of network formation. In this paper we study the emergence of collaborative networks in the Knowledge for Climate (KvK) research program. Endogenous mechanisms (transitivity and centrality) play a key role in the evolution of the KvK network. The results also reveal the influence of exogenous mechanisms: actors tend to collaborate with other actors from the same type of organizations (componential) and patterns of collaboration are affected by the nature and differences in roles (functional). Our analysis reveals a gap between actors from different sectors and a gap between actors working on global problems and those working on local problems. This is particularly visible in the fact that organizations active in hotspots projects, which focus on developing practical solutions for local and regional problems, are significantly more likely to form new ties than those active in theme projects.",,"Collaborative network; Formation and evolutions; Global problems; Influence networks; Network formation; Network structures; Practical solutions; Research programs; Computer simulation; Multi agent systems; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893164575

Newer technologies such as Solvent Extraction may also require the injected medium to be heated to maximise oil recovery from the reservoir. Thermal projects often generate the heat and power required in separate facilities, with the electricity often being supplied from remote central generation facilities. In many cases it may be possible to integrate a cogeneration plant into the process. Using a single, suitably sized on-site Cogeneration facility, a locally available fuel can reliably provide both the power and heat required for the project, achieving overall energy efficiency to levels in excess of 75%, while helping to reduce the global CO2 footprint of the Oil &amp; Gas industry and reducing reliance on imported electrical power. The design of Cogeneration plant can also help ensure maximum availability and uptime of production facilities. In most cases the heat produced by a Cogeneration plant is a by-product of electricity production, but it is also possible to utilise waste heat from some processes to produce useful energy. Waste gases from processes are also potential fuels for a Cogeneration plant, helping to reduce or eliminate gas flaring, and improve environmental performance across the whole oil production chain. There are numerous different ways to configure a Cogeneration plant depending on the type of fuel available and the ratio between power and heat required by the project. This paper will examine some of the different Cogeneration plant configurations and fuel options using Gas or Steam Turbines, or a combination of both, that could be applied to a thermal recovery project to maximise energy efficiency and plant availability.

However, the challenge lies in quantifying and assessing the carbon footprint as a basis for the advanced planning and traffic control strategies. The worst case scenario may be identified by analyzing insightful interactions between travel demand due to adaptive changes in land use and social economy and the impact of transportation activities on road emission and air quality. This paper presents a framework to fill in the gap of tools and methodology through developing a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based Roadway Air Impact Analysis (RAIA) system, housed in the Scenario-Based Planning Support System (SB-PSS) system. The RAIA system is established through integrating travel forecasting, vehicle emission and vehicle powered energy consumption models with friendly-heuristic framework and data flows via input/output (I/O) interfaces. The air quality measures, such as Air Quality Index (AQI) and NAAQS (National and State of Ambient Air Quality Standards), are embedded into the RAIA system. Travel demand forecasting models estimate the trips based on land use adaptation and social economic fabric; microscopic traffic simulation model is used to assess the measures of effectiveness of traffic operation and control strategies; vehicle emission model estimates the emission factors due to transportation activities; and vehicle powered energy consumption model is used to estimate energy consumption. Within this ambiance, traffic-related emission and energy consumption demand will be projected based on various land-use and traffic management scenarios. Such an integration effort is expected to be beneficial to identifying strategic solutions to design and operate transportation systems in a way that meets transportation needs while protecting the environment and the health of all people, and provide supportive information for measuring and assessing sustainability and ""greenness"" of transportation and other urban infrastructure systems. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineering.",,"Ambient air quality; Control strategies; Data flow; Emission factors; Energy consumption model; Geographical information systems; Highway congestion; Impact analysis; Input/output interface; Measures of effectiveness; Microscopic traffic simulation models; On-road emissions; Planning support systems; Quality indices; Quality measures; Social economy; Strategic solutions; Sustainability analysis; Traffic management; Traffic operation; Traffic-related; Transportation needs; Transportation system; Travel demand; Travel demand forecasting model; Travel forecasting; Urban development; Urban infrastructure system; Vehicle emission; Worst case scenario; Air quality; Carbon footprint; Cost effectiveness; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Estimation; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Highway traffic control; Land use; Mobile devices; Motor transportation; Multimodal transportation; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Vehicles; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873837478

Both the USN and the USAF adopted modified versions of EPA Method 5 for measurements of PM emissions from their hush houses. The USAF performed modified EPA Method 5 measurements in a slipstream behind the engine while the USN performed modified EPA Method 5 measurements traversed across the exit plane of the hush house exhaust stack. To provide the commercial aviation community an ability to estimate particle emissions levels for current and legacy aircraft, the International Civil Aviation Organization Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection and the Federal Aviation Administration sponsored the development of the First Order Approximation Version 32 (FOA3) approach to estimate PM emissions from aircraft turbine engines. Independently, the DOD Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program sponsored development of an interim PM test method for quantifying non-volatile PM (nvPM) from high-performance military aircraft engines. The Arnold Engineering Development Center led two test campaigns for nvPM measurements on engines at Tinker Air Force Base.

Previous efforts have focused on modeling and analyzing the advanced PLSS architecture, as well as developing key enabling technologies. Like the current International Space Station Extravehicular Mobility Unit PLSS, the advanced PLSS comprises three subsystems required to sustain the crew during EVA, including the Thermal, Ventilation, and Oxygen Subsystems. This effort has culminated in the construction and operation of PLSS 1.0, a test bed that simulates full functionality of the advanced PLSS design. PLSS 1.0 integrates commercial off-the-shelf hardware with prototype technology development components, including the primary and secondary oxygen regulators, Ventilation Subsystem fan, Rapid Cycle Amine swingbed carbon dioxide and water vapor removal device, and Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator heat rejection device. The overall PLSS 1.0 test objective was to demonstrate the capability of the Advanced PLSS to provide key life support functions including suit pressure regulation, carbon dioxide and water vapor removal, thermal control, and contingency purge operations. Supplying oxygen was not one of the specific life support functions because the PLSS 1.0 test was not oxygen rated. Nitrogen was used for the working gas. Additional test objectives were to confirm PLSS technology development components performance within an integrated test bed, indentify unexpected system-level interactions, and map the PLSS 1.0 performance with respect to key variables such as crewmember metabolic rate and suit pressure. Successful PLSS 1.0 testing completed 168 test points over 44 days of testing and produced a large database of test results that characterize system-level and component performance. With the exception of several minor anomalies, the PLSS 1.0 test rig performed as expected; furthermore, many system responses trended in accordance with pre-test predictions.",,"Carbon dioxide; Equipment testing; Manned space flight; NASA; Space platforms; Space stations; Water vapor; Commercial off-the-shelf hardwares; Development and testing; Extravehicular activity; Extravehicular mobility units; International Space stations; Operational flexibility; System-level interactions; Technology development; Life support systems (spacecraft)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099525721

Projections of future change point to dramatic shifts in the states of many ecosystems. Accommodating these shifts to effectively conserve biodiversity in the context of uncertain climate regimes represents one of the most difficult challenges faced by conservation planners. A number of adaptation strategies have been proposed for managing species and ecosystems in a changing climate. However, there has been little guidance available on integrating climate change adaptation strategies into contemporary conservation planning frameworks. The paper reviews the different approaches being used to integrate climate change adaptation into conservation planning, broadly categorizing strategies as continuing and extending on ""best practice"" principles and those that integrate species vulnerability assessments into conservation planning. We describe the characteristics of a good adaptation strategy emphasizing the importance of incorporating clear principles of flexibility and efficiency, accounting for uncertainty, integrating human response to climate change and understanding trade-offs.","Climate change adaptation; Conservation planning; Species conservation; Vulnerability analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892583902

Responses of UV-B dose to anthropogenic changes in ozone and aerosols are separately evaluated using a series of historical simulations including/excluding these changes. Increases in these air pollutants cause reductions in UV-B transmittance, which occur gradually/rapidly before/after 1950 in and downwind of industrial and deforestation regions. Furthermore, changes in ozone transport in the lower stratosphere, which is induced by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, increase ozone concentration in the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. These transient changes work to decrease the amount of UV-B reaching the Earth's surface, counteracting the well-known effect increasing UV-B due to stratospheric ozone depletion, which developed rapidly after ca. 1980. As a consequence, the surface UV-B radiation change between 1850 and 2000 is negative in the tropics and NH extratropics and positive in the SH extratropics. Comparing the contributions of ozone and aerosol changes to the UV-B change, the transient change in ozone absorption of UV-B mainly determines the total change in the surface UV-B radiation at most locations. On the other hand, the aerosol direct and indirect effects on UV-B play an equally important role to that of ozone in the NH mid-latitudes and tropics. A typical example is East Asia (25° N-60° N and 120° E-150° E), where the effect of aerosols (ca. 70%) dominates the total UV-B change. © 2012 Author(s).",,"aerosol; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; greenhouse gas; ozone; solar radiation; stratosphere; troposphere; ultraviolet B radiation; Far East",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862540842

The interference of human activities on the Biosphere is so significant that it has doubled the amount of reactive nitrogen due to industrial fertiliser production (Haber-Bosch), fossil fuel burning and land-use change over the last century. In this context, the Brazilian La Plata Basin contributes to the alteration of the nitrogen cycle in South America because of its huge agricultural and grazing area that meets the demands of its large urban centres - Sao Paulo, for instance - and also external markets abroad. In this paper, we estimate the current inputs and outputs of anthropogenic nitrogen (in kg N.km-2.yr-1) in the basin. In the results, we observe that soybean plays a very important role in the Brazilian La Plata, since it contributes with an annual entrance of about 1.8 TgN due to biological nitrogen fixation. Moreover, our estimate indicates that the export of soybean products accounts for roughly 1.0 TgN which is greater than the annual nitrogen riverine exports from Brazilian Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers together. Complimentarily, we built future scenarios representing changes in the nitrogen cycle profile considering two scenarios of climate change for 2070-2100 (based on IPCC's A2 and B2) that will affect land-use, nitrogen inputs, and loss of such nutrients in the basin. Finally, we discuss how both scenarios will affect human well-being since there is a connection between nitrogen cycle and ecosystem services that affect local and global populations, such as food and fibre production and climate regulation.","Climate change; Ecosystem services; La Plata Basin; Nitrogen; Nitrogen cycle","agriculture; article; Brazil; climate change; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; human activities; methodology; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen fixation; river; Agriculture; Brazil; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Human Activities; Humans; Nitrogen Cycle; Nitrogen Fixation; Rivers; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867036746

Up to now different strategies were presented in the literature and also applied on real systems. Starting from simple single-input-single-output structures in combination with feedforward parts leading to advanced multi-input-multi-output approaches. Nevertheless, independent of the used control approach for each of them suitable references are necessary. Although it seems adequate to directly use the emission target quantities in a closed loop air system control, a fast and accurate measurement is seldom available. An alternative is to use intermediate quantities as references, like fresh air mass flow or oxygen concentrations, which represent the state of the air system. However, for control purposes each of these quantities has to be determined, i.e. measured or calculated. Moreover, it has to be considered that each sensor has different dynamics and accuracy in dependency of the given range and furthermore also system dynamics can influence the sensor readouts. In this work a method for controlling the exhaust gas recirculation valve of a Diesel engine is proposed, where in contrary to standard approaches not only one but a combination of different reference quantities is used, with the aim to maintain predefined tailpipe nitric oxides emissions. The idea is to use allocation techniques and to combine different measurements with respect to their accuracy and dynamic properties, thus ensuring that in each operating point and time instant the most accurate quantity with respect to NOx is used. The determination of the static accuracy of each quantity was carried out by a NOx sensitivity analysis and the use of Gaussian error propagation. Considering the dynamic properties, response and rise times of the different sensors and physical quantities were taken into account. Finally, the control strategy was implemented and tested on simulation models and on an EU5 passenger car Diesel engine on an engine testbed, showing satisfactory results.

To this end different approaches from SISO control in combination with feedforward structures up to advanced MIMO strategies are proposed in the literature. However, for each control strategy a reference quantity is necessary. Although it seems sensible to directly use the exhaust emission concentrations in a closed loop control, unfortunately a fast and accurate online measurement is seldom available. A typical approach to circumvent this issue is to use auxiliary quantities like fresh air mass flow, whereas the according reference values for these quantities are obtained during engine development. This paper presents a different approach where not only one but a combination of different candidates is used to define an optimal reference for the EGR valve control. The target for the overall control is to maintain a constant nitric oxides (NOx) level during steady state operation without explicit NOx measurement. Furthermore, a scheduling method is proposed to take into account the expected errors on the sensor signals depending on the current operating region.

Understanding of these uncertainties will help the selection of appropriate adaptation policies. Methods: We made an inventory of conceivable health impacts of climate change, explored the type and level of uncertainty for each impact, and discussed its implications for adaptation policy. A questionnaire-based expert elicitation was performed using an ordinal scoring scale. Experts were asked to indicate the level of precision with which health risks can be estimated, given the present state of knowledge. We assessed the individual scores, the expertise-weighted descriptive statistics, and the argumentation given for each score. Suggestions were made for how dealing with uncertainties could be taken into account in climate change adaptation policy strategies. Results: The results showed that the direction of change could be indicated for most anticipated health effects. For several potential effects, too little knowledge exists to indicate whether any impact will occur, or whether the impact will be positive or negative. For several effects, rough 'order-of-magnitude' estimates were considered possible. Factors limiting health impact quantification include: lack of data, multi-causality, unknown impacts considering a high-quality health system, complex cause-effect relations leading to multi-directional impacts, possible changes of present-day response-relations, and difficulties in predicting local climate impacts. Participants considered heat-related mortality and non-endemic vector-borne diseases particularly relevant for climate change adaptation. Conclusions: For possible climate related health impacts characterised by ignorance, adaptation policies that focus on enhancing the health system's and society's capability of dealing with possible future changes, uncertainties and surprises (e.g. through resilience, flexibility, and adaptive capacity) are most appropriate. For climate related health effects for which rough risk estimates are available, 'robust decision-making' is recommended. For health effects with limited societal and policy relevance, we recommend focusing on no-regret measures. For highly relevant health effects, precautionary measures can be considered. This study indicated that analysing and characterising uncertainty by means of a typology can be a very useful approach for selection and prioritization of preferred adaptation policies to reduce future climate related health risks. © 2012 Wardekker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Climate adaptation policy; Climate change and health; Expert elicitation; Knowledge quality assessment; Uncertainty","adaptive management; climate change; disease incidence; expert system; health impact; health risk; mortality; precision; prioritization; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; typology; uncertainty analysis; accuracy; adaptation; adaptation policy; air quality; article; climate change; flooding; health care quality; health hazard; heat; human; mortality; policy; priority journal; risk assessment; scoring system; ultraviolet radiation; uncertainty; Air Pollution; Animals; Climate Change; Disease Vectors; Expert Testimony; Floods; Foodborne Diseases; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Netherlands; Questionnaires; Risk Assessment; Temperature; Ultraviolet Rays; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870232194

However, due to the prevalent use of wood stoves and the frequency of temperature inversions that occur throughout the winter months, many rural northern Rocky Mountain and central Alaska valley communities also have ambient PM2.5 concentrations comparable to those found in more urban areas. The results of research programs conducted in five western Montana valley communities (2006/2007 and 2007/2008) and four sites within Fairbanks (2008/2009, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011) revealed that wood smoke (likely residential wood combustion) was the major source of PM2.5 throughout the winter months, contributing between 56% and ∼80% of the measured PM2.5. In many rural areas of the continental US and Alaska, there are limited alternatives to burning wood for home heating due to the lack of existing natural gas pipelines and the elevated costs of heating oil and other fossil fuels. Wood burning also has cultural and traditional relevance in many Native and rural areas. From a regulatory standpoint, it will be difficult to lower the emissions from the residential wood stoves. For many, these old polluting wood stoves are the sole source of heat for the individual residences throughout the long winters. Wood stove changeouts (removing old, polluting wood stoves and replacing with EPA-certified, low emission stoves) such as the one conducted in Libby, Montana (where 1,200 stoves were changed out) have shown that large intervention efforts can be effective in reducing ambient levels of wood smoke-related PM2.5.22 However, without significant financial support, these changeouts can be burdensome for the residents. Perhaps a different strategy could be to focus on trying to further understand the health effects resulting from acute and chronic residential wood smoke exposures. If the resultant health effects of these wood smoke particles are not as harmful as more urban exposures (i.e. diesel and industrial PM2.5 emissions), one strategy could be to have revised or relaxed standards in these predominantly biomass smoke-impacted communities. Regardless, the findings from these studies suggest that residential wood stoves are a major source of PM2.5 within these rural valley communities in the Northern Rocky Mountains and inland Alaska throughout the cold winter months.","Ambient PM2.5; Biomass burning; Chemical mass balance modeling","Ambient PM2.5; Biomass-burning; Chemical mass balance; Northern Rocky Mountains; Residential wood combustions; Source apportionment; Southern California; Temperature inversions; Aerosols; Air pollution; Atmospheric optics; Housing; Industrial emissions; Landforms; Rural areas; Smoke; Visibility; Wood; Stoves; Aerosols; Air Pollution; Biomass; Combustion; Smoke; Wood",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879776690

Naturally ventilated and mixed mode buildings, controlled for adaptive thermal comfort and integrated with renewable energy generation, provide a pathway towards net zero-energy buildings. This vision is not without complexity - requiring occupant comfort, building dynamics and weather and usage patterns to be integrated into an appropriate control strategy. In this article we outline approaches and factors that challenge the controls design of such buildings, including some of our experiences with commercial buildings in Australia. We suggest that substantial emissions reductions can only be achieved through closely coupling controls to local climate and adaptive occupant comfort - not just responding to conditions alone, but implementing adaptive, predictive and 'occupant aware' controls towards achieving a low-energy future. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Energy efficiency; Intelligent HVAC control; Mixed mode; Occupant comfort","Adaptive thermal comfort; Airconditioning systems; Australia; Building design; Building dynamics; Commercial building; Control strategies; Coupling controls; Electricity use; Emissions reduction; HVAC control; Local climate; Low energies; Mixed mode; Occupant comfort; Renewable energy generation; Usage patterns; Climate control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Office buildings; Structural dynamics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862022052

During decomposition, to a great extent, the carbon mineralization is controlled by soil microorganisms. However, the quality of mixtures with various compositions is different due to difference in chemical compositions and physical structure from single component. Moreover, frequent addition of residues is reported to be able to keep the easily available compounds in soils in a high level. All the factors mentioned above were considered to have important effects on soil microbial activity. However, the effects of residue composition and addition frequencies on carbon mineralization, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen have been seldom reported in the soil of agroforestry system. Poplars are the major tree component of traditional agroforestry systems throughout the south temperate central area of China. In this paper, an experiment was designed to study the influnce of different residue compositions and addition frequencies on carbon mineralization, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen in the soil of poplar-wheat agroforestry system. The clay loam and silty loam in the experiment were collected from Sihong and Dafeng County of northern Jiangsu Province. The six treatments in the experiment were W: 16 g/ kg (soil) wheat straw residue; P1: 16 g/ kg (soil) poplar leaf litter; P1-W: 16 g/ kg (soil) mixture of poplar leaf and wheat straw residue with 1: 1; P2: adding 4 g/ kg (soil) poplar leaf litter every 8 days;P2-W: adding 2 g/ kg (soil) poplar leaf litter every 8 days and 8 g/ kg (soil) wheat straw residue at the first day, and CK: the control (without any addition). The soils with different treatments were incubated under the temperature of 25°C at daytime and 15°C at night for 31 days. The results showed that, for all the residue addition treatments, the carbon mineralization rates were higher in the daytime with the temperature of 25°Cthan those in the night with 15°C (P < 0. 05). For the soils, the silty loam showed higher carbon mineralization rates than clay loam(P < 0. 05). After 8 days of incubation, the treatment P2 and P2-W showed higher carbon mineralization rates than the other treatments (p<0. 05), and the peak values occurred at 9, 17, 25 days. Mixed residues of poplar leaf and wheat straw could promote the cumulated carbon mineralization at the end of incubation, and the cumulated carbon mineralization was significantly higher in the treatment of adding poplar leaf litter serially (P2) than that of adding all at the first day (P1) (P<0. 05). Compared to the treatments of poplar leaf litter (P1) and wheat straw residues (W), mixed residues of poplar leaf and wheat straw significantly increased microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen in soil (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, the microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen were significantly higher in the treatment of adding poplar leaf litter serially (P2) than that of adding all at the first day (P1). However, compared to the CK, the content of soil inorganic nitrogen decreased significantly for all the residue addition treatments, especially in the mixed residues treatments (P1-W and P2-W). The results from this study suggested that residue composition and addition frequencies could enhance the decomposition process, and regulate carbon dynamic and nitrogen supply. Such study would provide an important information for a deeper understanding of the carbon and nitrogen cycle in agroforestry systems.","Addition frequencies; Carbon mineralization; Mixture; Residue; Soil microbial biomass carbon; Soil microbial biomass nitrogen","agroforestry; biomass; deciduous tree; microbial activity; mineralization; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; wheat; China; Populus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869400859

Methane metabolic microbial community in soil affect the production and oxidation of methane. Land use type significantly influence methane release from soil and methane metabolic microorganisms. China has the biggest plantation area in the world. In central and Southern China, Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) and slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations account for 59% of the forested areas. What effect of plantation, especially the introduced slash pine plantation, on methane metabolic microbial community deserves much concern. While little has been researched about effects of forest type on methane metabolism community in soil. Molecular technique is a good way to reveal the community of methane metabolic microorganisms. Functional gene microarray is quantitative and it can link structure to function of soil microbial community. Thus it is a good way to reveal the soil microbial community involved in methane metabolism. Using the third generation functional gene microarray (GeoChip 3. 0), this research studied structure of methane metabolic soil microbial community in Masson pine and slash pine plantations in red soil. For each type of forest plantation, we randomly selected 5 plots on independent stands in Yanshan District and Lingui County located in Guilin city in Guangxi Province, Southern China. In each plot, three subsamples within the area of 10 m × 10 m were randomly chosen. For each subsample, five 0 to 10 cm depth soil cores were extracted using a 3. 5 cm diameter auger and were composite into one subsample. The results showed that, (1) there was no significant difference among forest types in the normalized signal intensity or diversity of either the whole methane metabolic microbial community, methanogenus or methanotrophs. (2) there was significant difference in methane metabolized microbial community (P = 0. 007). Forest type explained 34. 9% variation of soil methane metabolic microbial community. (3) there was significant difference in methanogenus (microorganisms include pmoA genes) community (P = 0. 015), forest type explained 45. 5% variation of methanogenus community in soil. The dominant species of methanogenus differed between forest types. The dominant species of methanogenus in the slash pine plantations was Methanocorpusculum labreanum Z. While the dominant species in the Masson pine plantations also included uncultured methanogenic archaeon and Methanosarcina mazei Gol in addition to Methanocorpusculum labreanum Z. There was also a strong trend that Masson pine plantation and slash pine plantation differed in methanotrophs (microorganisms include pmoA genes) (P = 0. 068). Among methanotrophs, 4 genes from uncultured bacteria were only found in the slash pine plantation, which could not be found in the Masson pine plantation. (5) The signal intensity or gene number of mcrA genes family was positively correlated with soil bulk density, and negatively correlated with soil clay content. The signal intensity or Shannon-Wiener diversity of pmoA genes family was positively correlated with content of total carbon, total phosphorus and available nitrogen content in soil.Thus, compared with the native Masson plantations, the introduced slash pine plantations had significantly changed the original methane metabolism community structure.","Functional gene array (GeoChip 3. 0); Masson pine plantation; mcrA genes; pmoA genes; Slash pine plantation","clay; community structure; coniferous forest; diversity index; gene expression; greenhouse gas; metabolism; methane; methanogenesis; methanotrophy; microbial activity; microbial community; molecular analysis; oxidation; plantation forestry; red soil; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Guilin; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methanocorpusculum; Methanocorpusculum labreanum; Methanosarcina mazei; Pinus elliottii; Pinus massoniana; uncultured bacterium; uncultured methanogenic archaeon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865628979

In China, most wetlands are distributed in the northwest part. Research on wetlands in semi arid region is very important and meaningful. Defining the location and width of interlaced zone is the basement to have quantitative study of its ecological process. In consideration of there is little research on identifying the interlaced zone boundary of semi arid area and small-scale wetland-dry grassland, this paper is based on the theory that changes of ecotone boundary can indicate the transformation of ambience in advance. Si'er Tan wetland, which is located in Yanchi county, Ningxia province, was studied by line transect methods. Four transect lines, centered on the wetland, ran into four directions: N, E, S and W respectively. These lines went through three main ecological areas including wet zone, interlaced zone and typical dry zone. Field investigations have been done every July to September during the year 2006 and 2010. In this paper, we first discussed the feasibility of using Moving Split-Window Technique in determining the interlaced zone boundary between wetland and dry grassland in semi arid area. Secondly, take Si'er Tan wetland for instance, Moving Split-Window Technique was used to identify the width and boundary of wetland and dry grassland from the year 2006 to 2010. Health condition of the whole wetland ecosystem can be known through analyzing the changes of width, boundary and vegetation of the interlaced zone during these five years. The results show that: Moving Split-Window Technique can be used to define the interlaced zone boundary. According to the dimension of investigatory scale and the visibility of ecotone transitivity, appropriate window width can be chosen especially in the selection of appropriate smallest window width. What's more, precipitation is the primary determinant factor of defining the location and width of interlaced zone but does not have substantial influence on vegetation variation. The distance between interlaced zone and the core area of the wetland can determine species richness index. By analyzing the data and making comparisons, wetland health condition shows significant differences. Owing to the built of the reserve, interlaced zone width got larger in the year 2006 and 2007, as a result, Si'er Tan wetland health condition had turned better. While from the year 2008 to 2010, the shrink of interlaced zone indicated the degradation of wetland, which as a result of railway construction disturbance. Results above prove that wetland-dry steppe alternated zone, which is always very sensible, can predict the transformation of the whole wetland ecosystem. In future development and degradation research of semi arid region wetland, we can focus on the study of interlaced zone evolvement. This method is feasible and much easier to make health evaluation for the whole wetland ecosystem. It can also provide new solutions and ideas to find and solve protection and improvement problems of wetlands in semi arid region.","Boundary definition; Diversity; Interlaced zone; Moving split window technique; Wetland","biodiversity; flood control; grassland; habitat management; semiarid region; soil erosion; species diversity; species richness; transformation; wetland management; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866514742

TN of soil showed a significant positive correlation with alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen (R 2 = 0. 48*, 0. 65**, 0. 70** respectively) during bamboo high-speed growth indicating that the soil nitrogen was absorbed in different forms by bamboo which caused soil total nitrogen reduction. Soil total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolve organic carbon (DOC) including extraction at 20°C (20°C DOC) and at 80°C (80°C DOC) were significantly decreased during bamboo growth. The results showed that TOC reduced by 26%, 20% and 24% respectively in three testing spots. The content of the 20°C DOC reduced by 51%,22% and 23% in three testing spot respectively, which was considerably greater (P&lt;0. 05) than the reduction of 80°C DOC in the testing spots. The relationship between soil total nitrogen (TN) and total organic carbon (TOC) analysis showed that TN and TOC were strongly inter-correlated (R2 =0. 89**) indicating that the change of soil carbon was closely related with the content of soil nitrogen during bamboo high-speed growth. Soil microorganisms are important in the cycling of almost all the major plant nutrients including the turnover of organic matter. Environmental conditions and perturbation are likely to affect microbial population structures and their functions in soils which may result in a change of overall soil properties. During high-speed growth, bamboo consumed soil carbon and soil nitrogen which lead to soil nutrient deficiency, effected soil microbial biomass and excessive carbon reduction, it also changed the soil microbial community. The content of soil microbial biomass carbon decreased from 800 mg/ kg at the first sampling day to 589 mg/ kg at the last sampling day. Soil under different sampling date contained a variety of PLFAs composed of saturated, unsaturated, methyl-branched and cyclopropane fatty acids. Thirty-four PLFAs with chain lengths from C12 to C20 were identified. The PLFA concentration data were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA). The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) accounted for 62. 95% and 17. 20% of the variation respectively, which showed soil microbial community was changed significantly during bamboo growth. Specific identified PLFAs including saturated fatty acids (14:0,16:0,18:0,20:0,i15:0,i16:0,i17:0,i18:0,a15:0,a17:0) which represented bacteria were found to be distributed on the right of the load diagram, while unsaturated fatty acids (18:2w6,9c/18:0ANTE) which represented fungi were found to be distributed on the left of the load diagram. Thus, these bacteria indicator PLFAs were more abundant in the later soil sampling, while the fungi indicator PLFAs were more abundant in the early soil sampling, indicating that with the soil nutrient consumption during bamboo high-speed growth, total PLFA and the PLFAs that represent bacteria decreased, While the PLFAs that represent fungi increased. Thus, the change of soil carbon and soil nitrogen can significantly affect soil microbial community structure in the bamboo forest soil.","Bamboo; Microbial biomass; Soil carbon; Soil nitrogen; Total PLFA","bacterium; bamboo; concentration (composition); correlation; environmental conditions; fatty acid; growth rate; hydrolysis; microbiology; nitrogen compound; nutrient cycling; principal component analysis; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Phyllostachys; Phyllostachys pubescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859298333

CO2 and CH4 are the principal gases. Wetland is one of the important ecosystems for carbon cycle, especially for the CO2 and CH4 exchange. Wetland ecosystem emits CO2 and CH4 through aerobic and anaerobic respiration and fixes carbon (CO2) through photosynthesis. So the ratio of CO2 to CH4 is important to reveal the greenhouse gas emissions of carbon sources and to mediate their emissions. An amount of approximately 18,000 km of coastline in China is covered by an estimated 12,000 km2 of tidal estuary wetlands. These tidal wetlands are generally rich in animal and plant diversity and appear to have important biogeochemical roles within the entire estuary ecosystem. One of these important tidal wetland ecosystems is found within the Minjiang River estuary in southeast China, which is located at the transition of mid-and southern subtropical climate zones in China. Vegetation and tide are two important factors influencing the biochemistry process of estuarine wetland and thereby controlling CO2 and CH4 emissions. Most of the previous studies have been showed that plants act as a key control on the spatial variability of CO2 and CH4 emissions due to their influence on the formation and transportation. Tidal systems are likely to be affected by tidal processes including time of inundation and salinity. Flooding is known to reduce CO2 and CH4 emissions, probably by blocking the pathway of CO2 and CH4 release. However, the effects of vegetation and tide on CO2: CH4 values are not clear. This study was conducted in the Shanyutan wetland (119°34'12""-119°40'40""E, 26°00'36""-26°03'426""N), which is the largest tidal wetland (nearly 3120 hm2) in the Minjiang River estuary. The climate is warm and wet, with a mean annual temperature of 19. 6°Cand a mean annual precipitation of 1346 mm. The Shanyutan wetland is belt-shaped. The sediment surface at the study site is submerged for 3-3. 5 hours during each tidal inundation. The vegetation mainly occupies two zones: a 150-200 m wide Scirpus lacustris zone close to the sea, and a 150 m wide Phragmites australis and Cyperus malaccensis var. brevifolius zone which extends from the intertidal zone to near the bank. Here we examined the stoichiometry characteristics of carbon-source greenhouse gas emissions in Minjiang River estuarine tidal wetland. The results showed that the emission fluxes of CO2 in both Phragmites australis wetland and Cyperus malaccensis var. brevifolius wetland were positively correlated with the emission fluxes of CH4. The monthly average CO2: CH4 values in P. australis wetland and C. malaccensis wetland were 55. 4 and 185. 0, 96. 3 and 305. 5, and 68. 7 and 648. 6 in the stages of before high tide, during tidal fluctuation, and after ebb, respectively. But the monthly average CO2: CH4 values were not significantly different in the three different stages for both P. australis wetland and C. malaccensis wetland (P &gt;0. 05). The lowest CO2: CH4 values were found before high tide in both wetlands but with different responses to tide. The monthly average CO2: CH4 values in the three stages for P. australis wetland were lower than those for C. malaccensis wetland (P&lt;0. 05). Our results indicated that the spatial variation of CO2: CH4 values was greater than the temporal one in estuarine tidal wetland, and tide, vegetation type and temperature were the key factors controlling the variation of CO2: CH4.","Carbon dioxide; Methane; Minjiang River estuary; Stoichiometry; Tidal wetland","biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; coastal wetland; coastal zone; estuarine ecosystem; estuarine sediment; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; methane; photosynthesis; precipitation (climatology); reedbed; salinity; sedge; spatial variation; species diversity; stoichiometry; subtropical region; China; Fujian; Minjiang Estuary; Animalia; Cyperus; Cyperus malaccensis; Phragmites australis; Scirpus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866511606

We first developed a unit-based power plant NO x emission inventory for 2005-2007 to support this investigation. The total capacities of coal-fired power generation have increased by 48.8% in 2005-2007, with 92.2% of the total capacity additions coming from generator units with size &amp;ge;300 MW. The annual NO x emissions from coal-fired power plants were estimated to be 8.11 Tg NO 2 for 2005 and 9.58 Tg NO 2 for 2007, respectively. The modeled summer average tropospheric NO 2 columns were highly correlated (R 2 Combining double low line 0.79-0.82) with OMI measurements over grids dominated by power plant emissions, with only 7-14% low bias, lending support to the high accuracy of the unit-based power plant NO x emission inventory. The ratios of OMI-derived annual and summer average tropospheric NO 2 columns between 2007 and 2005 indicated that most of the grids with significant NO 2 increases were related to power plant construction activities. OMI had the capability to trace the changes of NO x emissions from individual large power plants in cases where there is less interference from other NO x sources. Scenario runs from GEOS-Chem model suggested that the new power plants contributed 18.5% and 10% to the annual average NO 2 columns in 2007 in Inner Mongolia and North China, respectively. The massive new power plant NO x emissions significantly changed the local NO 2 profiles, especially in less polluted areas. A sensitivity study found that changes of NO 2 shape factors due to including new power plant emissions increased the summer average OMI tropospheric NO 2 columns by 3.8-17.2% for six selected locations, indicating that the updated emission information could help to improve the satellite retrievals. © 2012 Author(s).",,"bottom-up approach; coal-fired power plant; emission inventory; nitrogen dioxide; satellite imagery; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861490307

WTW petroleum consumption of ICEV was 50-150 times greater than EV. CO2 emissions of EV could decrease by 2-30% in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, 10-35% in the Yangtze River Delta, and 35-60% in the Pearl River Delta, respectively, compared to ICEV.

HEV is intended to achieve either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle, or better performance. HEVs have been gaining popularity given that they are an effective solution to reducing fuel consumption and emissions. However, its potential in fuel economy is hardly fully explored by existing control strategies based on engineering intuition. Dynamic programming (DP) technique is an effective tool to find the globally optimal use of multiple energy sources over a pre-defined drive cycle. As a global optimizing algorithm, DP ensures to converge to the global optimum. Even though DP is an off-line algorithm, the results can serve as a benchmark to evaluate and improve an existing online algorithm. In this paper, the procedures for implementing DP to three typical HEV powertrains are explained in detail. Also, the cost function of DP is discussed. In the case study of Toyota hybrid system, a simplified vehicle model is given and validated. Then DP is applied to this model and the effect of cost function on fuel economy and battery state of health (SOH) is discussed. Comparing to the simulation results over UDDS cycle obtained from the Prius model in Advisor, the DP results over the same drive cycle shows a 30% potential improvement in overall cost, which converts the electricity cost into fuel cost. In addition, based on the DP results, a lookup table based real-time control strategy is developed. This control strategy results in an improvement of 27% of overall cost, which is very close to the ideal case. © 2012 IEEE.","control strategy; drive cycle prediction; dynamic programming; hybrid electric vehicle","Control strategies; Drive cycles; Dynamic programming techniques; Effective solution; Effective tool; Electric propulsion systems; Electricity costs; Energy source; Fuel cost; Global optimum; Off-line algorithm; On-line algorithms; Optimizing algorithm; Overall costs; Propulsion system; Real-time control strategy; State of health; Vehicle model; Algorithms; Cost functions; Costs; Dynamic programming; Electric propulsion; Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Internal combustion engines; Optimization; Real time control; Secondary batteries; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860827991

BC in soils and sediments has complex environmental behaviors and effects. Because of its ability to resist decomposition, BC captures and sequesters carbon from the bio-atmospheric cycle, which, in the long term, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and thus mitigates the greenhouse effect. Meanwhile, resistant BC adds organic matter to soils, thus enhancing soil fertility. Because of its high adsorption capacity, BC adsorbs organic pollutants, heavy metals, and nutrients thus decreasing pollution risks and further enhancing soil fertility. Based on analysis of the concept of BC, it is concluded that BC should be studied in the context of its environmental effects. Variation in the formation of BC leads to its varied properties and classification. Several frequently used methods for identifying sources of BC are summarized. Δ 14 C and stratigraphic analysis can be used to identify BC sources (biomass, fossil fuel or rock); δ 13 C analysis can distinguish between C3 and C4 plant sources, and fresh water and ocean organisms; particle size analysis can identify local and exotic sources; while analysis of the ratio of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) isomers, the ratio of BC to total organic carbon, the ratio of benzene polycarboxylic acids, and morphological properties can identify biomass and fossil fuel sources. Transfers of BC between soils/sediments and other pools as well as those within soil and sediment pools are discussed. Global BC reserves in pools and the fluxes between pools are estimated, and it is noted that dissolved BC eroded from soils and transferred by rivers is an important part of the BC global cycle. Decomposition and stability of BC in soils and sediments are discussed in relation to fluxes of greenhouse gases between the land surface and atmosphere, the stable carbon pool in soils, and carbon cycle models in soil. Especially, coupled mineralization between BC and native or added labile organic carbon in soil is introduced, and adsorption and related mechanisms of organic matter, heavy metal and nutrient retention by BC in soils and sediments are also summarized. Three adsorption mechanisms of PAHs by BC are described: adsorption on surfaces, capture in micropores, and occlusion inside the BC structure. Correlations between BC and PAH concentrations should not be simply explained as a result of adsorption, since environmental adsorption of PAHs by BC is affected by complex factors. Finally, some future directions in BC research are recommended. More fundamental surveys of BC concentrations and its distribution in different kinds of soils/ sediments in different areas are needed. More studies should concentrate on key processes related to the stability of BC in soils/ sediments such as coupled mineralization between BC and labile organic carbon, losses of particulate and dissolved soil BC, and transformations between BC and other forms of stable carbon in soil.

Air pollutants emitted from exhaust gases of rice husk incineration lead to very important environmental damage, not only because of the influence on global environment and climate, when released into the atmosphere, but also on human health due to local air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively utilize waste rice husk and to reduce air pollutants. In recent years, there is an increasing demand on the utilization of unused biomass instead of fossil oil fuel in combustors for farminggreenhouses heating during the winter season. This increase in the demand will increase the running costs. In general, since these combustors are small in size, there is lack of regulations or laws (e.g. the air pollution control act and the waste disposal and public cleaning law) in operation for their air pollution control. So far, small size combustors are characterized by their simplicity of structure and the low costs; therefore, they emit visible black carbon (elemental carbon) due to their poor combustion performance. In this study, we investigated if fossil fuel can be substituted by waste rice husk in laboratory model combustion experiments. We evaluated the emission behavior of harmful air pollutants emitted from rice husk combustion by measuring carbonaceous and ionic composition of suspended particulate matter in the exhaust gases. From the analytical results we found that particulate mass concentrations can be reduced substantially at high temperature combustion. Fine particle size distribution is different with combustion conditions (e.g. smoldering combustion, flaming combustion). Ionic composition is mainly constituted by Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3- and SO4 2- which are easily vaporized, followed by homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous condensation of these inorganic vapors. As the results of our study, it can be suggested that we have to ensure stable combustion performance under suitable conditions in order to control less air pollutants emitted from biomass fuel although small size combustors are still not regulated. © 2012 WIT Press.","Carbonaceous and ionic composition; Combustion conditions; Fine particle size distribution; Rice husk; Small size combustors","atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; black carbon; combustion; concentration (composition); emission inventory; laboratory method; particle size; regulatory framework; size distribution; suspended particulate matter; waste disposal; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865735286

This area has a warm-temperate continental monsoon climate with abundant plant resources and high biodiversity. Appropriate conditions for the growth of Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl. are limited within the Wulu Mountains which include only a part of the overall range of P. bungeana. Therefore, building nature reserves in which P. bungeana can be studied systematically is important both ecologically and academically, with the goal of studying this species in its warm temperate north China climate so it can be preserved in natural forests indefinitely. Interspecific relationships are an important factor affecting community composition, structure, function and dynamics. Interspecific segregation refers to the relative distributions of two or more related species. It reflects the degree of mixing of two species based on their interrelationships. For example, the less two species mix, the higher the degree of interspecific segregation exists. The segregation relationship between different species pairs can be helpful in revealing the phenomena of species interactions, community structure and dynamics. This relationship can be used to explore the impacts of environmental differences on species distribution. Practically, such study is the scientific foundation of species conservation, restoration and the reconstruction of degraded ecosystems. We established 55 quadrats within natural P. bungeana communities to study the intraspecific and interspecific competition relationships of nine tree species and patterns of interspecific segregation of all species in the tree and shrub layers of P. bungeana communities. Using ArcView GIS software and the nearest neighbor method, interspecific segregation was studied with an N ×N nearest-neighbor contingency table, a 2 ×2 nearest-neighbor contingency sub-table, and Hegyi's competition index model for the individual tree species. The results indicate: (1) most of the species pairs are randomly segregated (80%), some species pairs are positively segregated (16. 19%), and only a few species pairs are negatively segregated (3. 81%). (2) There are some differences among different species in the interspecific segregation of all species. The larger individuals representing dominant species in the communities tended to be positively segregated with the other large trees and shrubs, probably because of their stronger competitive vigor. For example, P. bungeana, which is the most common and dominant species of this community, was positively segregated from Platycladus orientalis, Quercus wutaishanica, Ulmus pumila, Syringa pubescens, Cotoneaster multiflorus, Sophora davidii, Viburnum mongolicum, the dominant species of this community. Negative segregation appeared between dominant species and companion species in the communities, such as P. bungeana and Populus davidiana, P. orientalis and F. vulgaris, S. microphylla and Salix wallichiana. This appeared to be caused by the fact the companion species had fewer individuals, lower coverage and similar habitat requirements to the dominant species. Intensive interspecific competition resulted in a mosaic distribution and full competitive exploitation of resources among species, apparently causing them to be more likely to become negatively segregated. The 15 species from the forest plots were divided into three ecological species groups (ESG), based on their niches and relationships between the species, other plants and the environment. (3) The status of interspecific segregation of species has a close relationship to their intraspecific and interspecific competitive relationships and spatial distribution patterns. The larger individuals representing dominant species with more severe intraspecific competition than interspecific competition and appearing to have an aggregating distribution in the communities tended to be positively aggregated with the other large trees and shrubs. Negative aggregation (segregation) appeared between dominant species and companion species which have more severe interspecific competition than intraspecific competition in the communities. The interspecific competition of species within the same ESGs was more intense than in species in different ESGs. (4) The interspecific segregation is related to the heterogeneity in the communities, in that aggregation often occurs between two species which have different habitat requirements; while the segregation often appears between two species which have same or similar environmentally requirements. (5) The results show the 15 species we studied overlapped in distribution and were characterized by overall non-segregation. (6) The intraspecific and interspecific relationships were caused by ecological niches to which the different species are adapted and their biological requirements, and these differences may be the mechanisms which allow these species to stably coexist in the P. bungeana community of the Wulu Mountain Nature Reserve.","Competition index; Ecological species groups; Interspecific competition; Interspecific segregation; Intraspecific competition; Pinus bungeana Zucc. community; Wulu Mountain","community structure; coniferous tree; GIS; interspecific interaction; nearest neighbor analysis; plant community; shrub; software; China; Shanxi; Cotoneaster; Pinus bungeana; Platycladus orientalis; Populus; Populus davidiana; Quercus wutaishanica; Salix; Salix microphylla; Sophora; Sophora davidii; Sophora microphylla; Syringa; Syringa microphylla; Syringa pubescens; Ulmus; Ulmus pumila; Viburnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867171605

The new model treatments implemented in CMAQ v4.7 in this work include two online dust emission schemes (i.e., the Zender and Westphal schemes), nine dust-related heterogeneous reactions, an updated aerosol inorganic thermodynamic module ISORROPIA II with an explicit treatment of crustal species, and the interface between ISORROPIA II and the new dust treatments. The resulting improved CMAQ (referred to as CMAQ-Dust), offline-coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF), is applied to the April 2001 dust storm episode over the trans-Pacific domain to examine the impact of new model treatments and understand associated uncertainties. WRF/CMAQ-Dust produces reasonable spatial distribution of dust emissions and captures the dust outbreak events, with the total dust emissions of ∼111 and 223 Tg when using the Zender scheme with an erodible fraction of 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. The model system can reproduce well observed meteorological and chemical concentrations, with significant improvements for suspended particulate matter (PM), PM with aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm, and aerosol optical depth than the default CMAQ v4.7. The sensitivity studies show that the inclusion of crustal species reduces the concentration of PM with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm (PM 2.5) over polluted areas. The heterogeneous chemistry occurring on dust particles acts as a sink for some species (e.g., as a lower limit estimate, reducing O3 by up to 3.8 ppb (∼9%) and SO 2 by up to 0.3 ppb (∼27%)) and as a source for some others (e.g., increasing fine-mode SO 4 2- by up to 1.1 μg mg -3 (∼12%) and PM 2.5 by up to 1.4 μg m -3 (∼3%)) over the domain.

However, their efforts have been hampered by the lack of specific and comparable carbon emission inventories. Comprehensive carbon emission inventories for twelve Chinese cities, which present both a relatively current snapshot and also show how emissions have changed over the past several years, were developed using a bottom-up approach. Carbon emissions in most Chinese cities rose along with economic growth from 2004 to 2008. Yet per capita carbon emissions varied between the highest and lowest emitting cities by a factor of nearly 7. Average contributions of sectors to per capita emissions for all Chinese cities were 65.1% for industrial energy consumption, 10.1% for industrial processes, 10.4% for transportation, 7.7% for household energy consumption, 4.2% for commercial energy consumption and 2.5% for waste processing. However, these shares are characterized by considerable variability due to city-specific factors. The levels of per capita carbon emissions in China's cities were higher than we anticipated before comparing them with the average of ten cities in other parts of the world. This is mainly due to the major contribution of the industry sector in Chinese cities. © 2012 Author(s).",,"bottom-up approach; carbon emission; economic growth; emission inventory; energy use; urban area; urban pollution; waste treatment; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864259538

Energy consumption of each family, which is the basic unit of our society, is one of the most important sources of anthropic carbon emissions. Studying family consumption characteristic as well as the resulting carbon emissions pattern is of great significance for the fulfillment of the low-carbon strategy in China. By conducting a systematic family survey and panel data collection, a detailed inventory on energy - caused carbon emissions from rural and urban households in Lijiang city was exhibited. The divergences among different households, and related socioeconomic drivers were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The main type of energy consumed by urban families was electricity, with liquid gas and coal as subsidiary, while the main type of energy consumed by rural families was firewood, supplemented by methane and electricity. In rural areas, the annual average carbon emission from firewood consumption was 4051kg per family, which accounted for 83. 66% of total carbon emissions. In urban areas, the annual average carbon emission from electricity consumption was 1280kg per family, occupying 83. 4% of the total. (2)The amount of family carbon emissions in rural areas was much higher than that in urban areas due to different energy consumption types, while the carbon emissions factor of firewood (1. 87 kg CO2/kg) is much higher than the marginal carbon emissions coefficient of electricity(0.7134kg CO2·kw-1·h-1). (3) Household carbon emission in rural areas was significantly affected by family size, family income and education level. The enlargement of family size increased the household carbon emission by raising firewood consumption. Improvement of family income and education level promoted the use of low-carbon energy instead of firewood, which led to a decrease in carbon emission. (4) Household carbon emission in urban areas was significantly affected by age structure, education level, family size and housing area. The increase of the factors would lead to the increase of electricity consumption and the resulting carbon emission. (5) Necessary policies and regulations could be implemented to reduce family carbon emissions and included enlarging the covering area of ""Home Appliances to the Countryside"" policy, especially for remote rural areas, increasing family income by implement supporting policies, and raising environmental awareness of farmers by more education.","Carbon emissions; Residential energy consumption; Social questionnaire; Stepwise regression","age structure; carbon emission; data set; education; electricity generation; energy conservation; human activity; policy making; questionnaire survey; regression analysis; rural area; socioeconomic status; urban area; China; Lijiang; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872232992

Here we use the time-constrained high-resolution local radiocarbon reservoir age offset derived from an absolutely dated annually resolved shell chronology spanning the past 1,350 years, to reconstruct changes in surface ocean circulation and climate. The water mass tracer data presented here from the North Icelandic shelf, combined with previously published data from the Arctic and subtropical Atlantic, show that surface Atlantic meridional overturning circulation dynamics likely amplified the relatively warm conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the relatively cool conditions during the Little Ice Age within the North Atlantic sector. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The team established goals for the design of a plug-in, range-extended hybrid electric vehicle that meets or exceeds the competition requirements for EcoCAR. The challenge involved designing a crossover SUV powertrain to reduce fuel consumption, petroleum energy use, regulated tailpipe emissions, and well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions. To interface with and control the hybrid powertrain, the team added a Hybrid Vehicle Supervisory Controller, which enacts a torque split control strategy. This paper builds on an earlier paper [1] that evaluated the petroleum energy use, criteria tailpipe emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions of the Virginia Tech EcoCAR vehicle and control strategy from the 2nd year of the competition. The Year 2 control strategy was further refined to reduce tailpipe emissions and fuel consumption based on chassis dynamometer testing results gathered during Year 3 of the competition. Criteria tailpipe emissions, such as carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and hydrocarbons, were touched on briefly in the previous paper but not in depth. This paper presents the results from an empirical study of the impact of changes in the hybrid supervisory control strategy on emissions and energy consumption, and evaluates the success of the changes made to the control strategy based on test data taken in the third and final year of the EcoCAR competition. The improved control strategy enabled the vehicle to achieve a utility-factor-corrected fuel consumption of 82 mpgge on combined city and highway driving, as well as Tier 2 Bin 2 tailpipe emissions as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), when driven on the EcoCAR drive cycle, an on-road approximation of 55% city and 45% highway driving.

As such, the ability of chemical transport models to accurately predict continental boundary layer aerosol greatly depends on their ability to predict SOA. Although there has been much recent effort to better describe SOA formation mechanisms in models, little attention has been paid to the effects of model spatial resolution on SOA predictions. The Whistler Aerosol and Cloud Study (WACS 2010), held between 22 June and 28 July 2010 and conducted at Whistler, BC, Canada provides a unique data set for testing simulated SOA predictions. The study consisted of intensive measurements of atmospheric trace gases and particles at several locations strongly influenced by biogenic sources in the region. We test the ability of the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to predict the aerosol concentrations during this event and throughout the campaign. Simulations were performed using three different resolutions of the model: 4° × 5° , 2° × 2.5° and 0.5° × 0.667°. Predictions of organic aerosol concentrations at Whistler were greatly dependent on the resolution; the 4° × 5° version of the model significantly under predicts organic aerosol, while the 2° × 2.5° and 0.5° × 0.667° versions are much more closely correlated with measurements. In addition, we performed a comparison between the 3 versions of the model across North America. Comparison simulations were run for both a summer case (July) and Winter case (January). For the summer case, 0.5° × 0.667° simulations predicted on average 19% more SOA than 2° × 2.5° and 32% more than 4° × 5° . For the winter case, the 0.5° × 0.667° simulations predicted 8% more SOA than the 2° × 2.5° and 23% more than the 4° × 5°. This increase in SOA with resolution is largely due to sub-grid variability of organic aerosol (OA) that leads to an increase in the partitioning of secondary organic matter to the aerosol phase at higher resolutions. SOA concentrations were further increased because the shift of secondary organic gases to SOA at higher resolutions increased the lifetime of secondary organic matter (secondary organic gases have a shorter deposition lifetime than SOA in the model). SOA precursor emissions also have smaller, but non-negligible, changes with resolution due to non-linear inputs to the MEGAN biogenic emissions scheme. These results suggest that a portion of the traditional under-prediction of SOA by global models may be due to the effects of coarse grid resolution. © Author(s) 2012.

Materials and Methods: Participants were given a bag containing cement sachet, mixing pad, spatula, a variety of application instruments, and a polycarbonate crown form. The participants were instructed with a standardized audio-video presentation to proportion the cement, mix it, and apply it to the intaglio of the crown as they would if they were to cement it onto an implant abutment in a clinical situation. The crowns were weighed, first unfilled and then again once the applied cement had set. The mean weights of fully-loaded crowns (n = 10) were used as a control group. The patterns of cement loading were recorded. The weights of collected cement-loaded crowns were compared to those of the control group and analyzed statistically. Results: Four hundred and one dentists in several different geographic locations were surveyed. Three distinct cement loading patterns were observed: gross application (GA), brush-on application (BA), and margin application (MA). The mean weights for each cement loading pattern were 242.2 mg for the GA group, 59.9 mg for the BA group, and 59.0 mg for the MA group. The weight of cement in the GA group was significantly higher than that in the other groups. No statistically significant difference between groups BA and MA was seen. Conclusions: The diversity of the cement loading patterns disclosed in this study indicates that there is a lack of uniformity and precision in methods and a lack of consensus in the dental community regarding the appropriate quantity of cement and placement method for a cement-retained implant crown. © 2012 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.","Cement volume; Cement-retained implant crown; Dental cement; Luting cement application","tooth cement; adult; analysis of variance; clinical practice; dental abutment; female; human; male; qualitative research; reference value; standards; tooth crown; tooth prosthesis; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Crowns; Dental Abutments; Dental Cements; Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported; Dentist's Practice Patterns; Female; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Reference Values",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882854852

In addition to the local pollen assemblage zones, which represent transformations of forest vegetation at the local level, three regional pollen assemblage zones were described, as were also the changes of plant communities developing in water basins. In the case of Lake Miłkowskie the variations in the composition of fossil green algae showed its evolution from an oligotrophic to strongly eutrophic water body as early as the 11th century AD. The present studies have confirmed that the vegetation transformations in the Miłki-Staświny microregion differed from those in Szczepanki vicinity. In the first case, human activity, besides climate, proved decisive agent in vegetation cover development, in the second one it was a natural process of lake terrestrialization. Pollen record showed that a characteristic short-lasting phase of the intensive Picea development about 2000-1600 BC was delayed for at least a century compared to the Suwałki region. It was confirmed that the first Carpinus spread in the forests occurred about 1350 BC. The data provided evidence for metachronous beginning of formation and long-term persistence of anthropogenic forest communities dominated by birch in different parts of the area (1200 BC - 1100 AD in Miłki and Staświny regions, 200 BC - 1500 AD in Lake łazduny region). The investigations documented the spread of local cereal cultivation (Triticum and Hordeum types) during the middle Bronze Age. The phases of more intensified human impact on microregional vegetation were identi-fied with the middle Bronze Age settlement (Lusatian culture); with the activity period of the West Baltic Burrow culture population; with the societies of the Bogaczewo culture and Prussian Galindians. The last phase of the very strong agricultural exploitation of the area that lasts to the present time, was initiated in the Middle Ages, about 1100 AD in Lakes Wojnowo and Miłkowskie regions and in the 16th century near Lake łazduny. The datings of sediments deposited in the Middle Ages confirmed the asynchronous beginnings of the large-scale deforestations. Of special interest was the dating of the deforestation time in the surroundings of Lakes Miłkowskie and Wojnowo (in the Staświny settlement centre) to the earlier time than it was deduced from written sources and the presentation of arguments for the foundation of permanent settlement units prior the arrival of the Teutonic Order Knights. The stages of anthropogenic disturbances of vegetation distinguished in individual pollen diagrams in the most cases well reflected the history and intensity of settlement confirmed by archaeological findings and historical data.","Adoption of agriculture; Fire; Human impact; Large-scale clearings; Late Holocene; NE Poland; Palynology; Radiocarbon chronology; Settlement history; Vegetation history","agricultural history; Bronze Age; coniferous tree; cultivation; deforestation; fossil record; green alga; human activity; pollen; radiocarbon dating; vegetation history; vegetation structure; Poland; Carpinus; Chlorophyta; Hordeum; Picea; Triticum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863902598

Here, we present a novel model-based approach, where we force a model describing the processes and modifications of δ18O from rain water to speleothem calcite (Oxygen isotope Drip water and Stalagmite Model-ODSM) with the results of a state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model enhanced by explicit isotope diagnostics (ECHAM5-wiso). The approach is neither climate nor cave-specific and allows an integrated assessment of the influence of different varying climate variables, e.g. temperature and precipitation amount, on the isotopic composition of drip water and speleothem calcite. First, we apply and evaluate this new approach under present-day climate conditions using observational data from seven caves from different geographical regions in Europe. Each of these caves provides measured δ18O values of drip water and speleothem calcite to which we compare our simulated isotope values. For six of the seven caves modeled δ18O values of drip water and speleothem calcite are in good agreement with observed values. The mismatch of the remaining caves might be caused by the complexity of the cave system, beyond the parameterizations included in our cave model. We then examine the response of the cave system to mid-Holocene (6000 yr before present, 6 ka) climate conditions by forcing the ODSM with ECHAM5-wiso results from 6 ka simulations. For a set of twelve European caves, we compare the modeled mid-Holocene-to-modern difference in speleothem calcite δ18O to available measurements. We show that the general European changes are simulated well. However, local discrepancies are found, and might be explained either by a too low model resolution, complex local soil-atmosphere interactions affecting evapotranspiration or by cave specific factors such as non-equilibrium fractionation processes. The mid-Holocene experiment pronounces the potential of the presented approach to analyse δ18O variations on a spatially large (regional to global) scale. Modelled as well as measured European δ18O values of stalagmite samples suggest the presence of a strong, positive mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation at 6 ka before present, which is supported by the respective modelled climate parameters.",,"atmospheric general circulation model; calcite; cave; fractionation; geographical region; Holocene; North Atlantic Oscillation; oxygen isotope; parameterization; speleothem; stable isotope; stalagmite; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868644013

We present two models that assess the impacts of climate change on solar and wind power generation and use them to evaluate climate projections based on the A1B scenario for Germany's Northwest Metropolitan Region. For these projections the seasonal profile of solar power production is not affected despite less cloud coverage during the summer, while the seasonal profile of wind power production has a more pronounced seasonal peak during the wint er due to slightly increasing wind speeds. We compare the obtained seasonal profiles to different scenarios for electricity demand. For each scenario we identify the ratio of wind and solar power generation that minimizes the variance of the residual load at the monthly time scale under the premise of a full supply by wind and solar power. Our results suggest that the need for long-term storage of electricity and the need for extensions of the transmission grid will even increase because of climate change impacts in the Northwest Metropolitan Region over the next century.","Impact assessment models; Regional climate change; Renewable energy sources; Seasonal load profiles","Climate models; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Climate change impact; Impact assessments; Load profiles; Metropolitan regions; Regional climate changes; Renewable energy source; Renewable power generation; Wind and solar power; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896508656

The toolkit consists of a screening instrument and a database that need to be used together when preparing, monitoring and/or evaluating development interventions. This allows development practitioners in North and South to mainstream key environmental sustainability aspects such as climate change, but also biodiversity, desertification and deforestation, into the different aid modalities (projects, budget support, programmes, national strategies, etc.).

With respect to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) approaches, clinical myocardial perfusion imaging protocols are established with different 99mTc-labeled perfusion tracers; however, studies evaluating and optimizing protocols for these tracers in high-resolution pinhole SPECT in mice are lacking. This study aims at evaluating two clinically available 99mTc-labeled myocardial perfusion tracers (99mTcsestamibi vs. 99mTc-Tetrofosmin) in mice using four different imaging protocols. Methods Adult C57BL/6 male mice were injected with 99mTc-sestamibi (MIBI) or 99mTc-Tetrofosmin (TETRO) (4 MBq/g body weight) either intravenously through the tail vein (n = 5) or retroorbitally (n = 5) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) under anesthesia (n = 3) or i.p. in an awake state (n = 3) at rest. Immediately after injection, a multi-frame single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) acquisition was initiated with six subsequent time frames of 10 min each. Reconstructed images of the different protocols were assessed and compared by visual analysis by experts and by time-activity-curves generated from regions-of-interest for various organs (normalized uptake values). Results Visually assessing overall image quality, the best image quality was found for MIBI for both intravenous injection protocols, whereas TETRO only had comparable image quality after retroorbital injections. These results were confirmed by quantitative analysis where left ventricular (LV) uptake of MIBI after tail vein injections was found significantly higher for all time points accompanied with a significantly slower washout of 16% for MIBI vs. 33% for TETRO (p = 0.009) from 10 to 60 min post injection (PI). Interestingly, LV washout from 10 to 60 min PI was significantly higher for TETRO when applied by tail vein injections when compared to retroorbital injections (22%, p = 0.008). However, liver uptake was significant and comparable for both tracers at all time points. Radioactivity concentration in the lungs was negligible for all time points and both tracers. Conclusion Intravenous MIBI injection (both tail vein and retroorbital) results in the best image quality for assessing myocardial perfusion of the murine heart by SPECT/CT. TETRO has a comparable image quality only for the retroorbital injection route. © 2012 Vrachimis et al.","MIBI; Mouse; Multi-pinhole SPECT; Myocardial perfusion; Tetrofosmin","methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; tetrofosmin tc 99m; animal experiment; article; controlled study; drug distribution; drug uptake; image analysis; image display; image quality; image reconstruction; male; mouse; myocardial perfusion imaging; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; radiation detection; single photon emission computer tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874054932

For urban areas an increasing interest in the data acquisition of trees can be observed concerning aspects like urban climate, CO2 balance, and environmental protection. Urban trees differ significantly from natural systems with regard to the site conditions (e.g. technogenic soils, contaminants, lower groundwater level, regular disturbance), climate (increased temperature, reduced humidity) and species composition and arrangement (habitus and health status) and therefore allometric relations cannot be transferred from natural sites to urban areas. To overcome this problem an extended approach was developed for a fast and non-destructive extraction of branch volume, DBH (diameter at breast height) and height of single trees from point clouds of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). For data acquisition, the trees were scanned with highest scan resolution from several (up to five) positions located around the tree. The resulting point clouds (20 to 60 million points) are analysed with an algorithm based on voxel (volume elements) structure, leading to an appropriate data reduction. In a first step, two kinds of noise reduction are carried out: the elimination of isolated voxels as well as voxels with marginal point density. To obtain correct volume estimates, the voxels inside the stem and branches (interior voxels) where voxels contain no laser points must be regarded. For this filling process, an easy and robust approach was developed based on a layer-wise (horizontal layers of the voxel structure) intersection of four orthogonal viewing directions. However, this procedure also generates several erroneous ""phantom"" voxels, which have to be eliminated. For this purpose the previous approach was extended by a special region growing algorithm. In a final step the volume is determined layer-wise based on the extracted branch areas Ai of this horizontal cross-section multiplied by the thickness of the voxel layer. A significant improvement of this method could be obtained by a reasonable determination of the threshold for excluding sparsely filled voxels for noise reduction which can be defined based on the function change of filled voxels. Field measurements were used to validate this method. For a quality assessment nine deciduous trees were selected for control and were scanned before felling and weighing. The results are in good accordance to the control trees within a range of only -5.1% to +14.3%. The determined DBH values show only minor deviations, while the heights of trees are systematically underestimated, mainly due to field measurements. Possible error sources including gaps in surface voxels, influence of thin twigs and others are discussed in detail and several improvements of this approach are suggested.

Off-road engines account for a substantial portion of the total emissions, and are subject to increasingly strict legislation as well as voluntary emissions reduction programs. The benefits of various emissions reduction programs are typically quantified with simplified, short duration field tests. In an inquiry into the suitability of such tests, this paper examines experimental data collected by portable, on-board monitoring systems on truck, tractor, construction equipment, marine and locomotive diesel engines with rated power ranging from 130 to 1550 hp and displacement ranging from 4 to 163 liters. In engines operated extensively at low load, such as some locomotive engines, substantial amounts of solids and liquids accumulate inside of the engine and in the exhaust system. These deposits are then driven off during subsequent operation at high load. As a result, the emissions of particulate matter may be elevated for a rather long time, on the order of tens of minutes, which is longer than the duration of the individual modes of most field emissions tests. Therefore, the emissions of fine particles measured during short (units of minutes per mode) tests may be affected by the accumulated deposits. If this phenomenon is overlooked and not properly accounted for, the measurements may be less repeatable or comparable, and the particulate matter emissions based on such measurements may be overestimated. On the other hand, it is not clear that the problem can be remedied if the engine is diligently preconditioned prior to the measurement - in this case, the measured values do not account for ""excess"" emissions associated with extended low-load operation.

The emissions from non-road engines are often evaluated and reported in steady-state operating conditions. Many larger engines are tested in the field, due to impracticality of dynamometer testing, resulting in practical limits for testing time at constant operating conditions. With lower fractions of elemental carbon (black soot) in the particulate matter and increased deployment of catalytic aftertreatment devices, longer times are required for reaching stable values. This work seeks to infer stabilized emissions values from limited length segments of unsteady but converging data. Theoretical consideration of thermal factors and storage of material in the exhaust system, and emissions data obtained in a laboratory and on a locomotive engine tested in the field, suggest that the instantaneous emissions in steady-state conditions tend to follow the exponential function y(t) = y(steady) + [y(initial)-y(steady)]*exp(-const. *t) describing both mixing and Newton's law of cooling. Several pathways of non-linear iterative regression has been investigated, generally leading to consistent results, albeit many individual segments of data yield inconsistent or no solution. It appears that when multiple segments of data longer than approximately two minutes are available, there is a high chance at arriving at a plausible steady state value of emissions concentrations. In such case, steady state emissions can be derived from not fully stabilized data, such as from real-world operation of, for example, diesel locomotives, or from large engines tested in a laboratory. With large engines, this can possibly yield considerable savings in testing expenses and improved emissions data. The findings are preliminary, and as of now, interpretation of data requires some skill.

Amendments were made to Directive 2003/87/EC by Directive 2008/101/EC with the objective of reducing climate change impacts attributable to aviation, but also in order to avoid distortions of competition. The scheme now includes all airlines, including those from third countries, and accounts for emissions that occur partly outside the airspace of EU Member States. A large number of third countries claim that the extension of the Emissions Trading Scheme to legs of flights outside EU territory violates the principle of state sovereignty and deny the jurisdiction of the EU to regulate emissions that occur beyond its borders. So far, the validity of the EU regulation has been challenged by a claim brought by US and Canadian air carriers. They contended that, in adopting the Directive, the EU infringed principles of customary international law-in particular the principle of state sovereignty and the prohibition of extraterritorial application-As well as various international agreements. On 21 December 2011, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the inclusion of emissions from aviation in the EU ETS is valid. In response, Chinese and Indian carriers threatened not to pay the charge, while US airlines pledged to consider other options. This chapter analyses the judgment of the Court and the opinion of Advocate General Kokott in this case. Particular attention is given to the question of extraterritorial jurisdiction and the understanding of state sovereignty in the context of global climate change mitigation.

This chapter compares the role of central and local authorities in the US and the EU in formulating environmental regulations in three areas: automotive emissions for health-related (criteria) pollutants, packaging waste, and global climate change. Automotive emissions are relatively centralised in both political systems. In the cases of packaging waste and global climate change, regulatory policy-making is shared in the EU, but is primarily the responsibility of local governments in the US. Thus, in some important areas, regulatory policy-making is more centralised in the EU. The most important role that local governments play in the regulatory process is to help diffuse stringent local standards through more centralised regulations, a dynamic which has recently become more important in the EU than in the US. © Frank Wijen, Kees Zoeteman, Jan Pieters, and Paul van Seters 2012.

How they are cared for is becoming more important for a technical service providers and owners, because perceived comfort affects directly the productivity of the workers of an organisation. Linking more functions to the HVAC process control system creates opportunities to further expand their influence on Comfort and Energy management and monitoring. A better match between energy demand and energy need leads to an improved overall efficiency, therefore the process control of the energy infrastructure in the buildings needs to become intelligent and capable of adaptable behaviour due to changing conditions. Especially is it important to take in account the goal of the energy use: human comfort. An experiment was done to determine the relation between local conditioning of sensitive body parts and perceived comfort by the occupants. With two advanced infra red cameras the skin temperature was registered and correlated to the perceived comfort by the user. The perceived comfort was derived from the adjustment of the setting of the electrical heating panel's controls. This approach, to include the human as a sensor in the HVAC process control loop, makes it possible to optimize energy flows in a room in relation with the individual comfort of the occupant. By only optimal conditioning of the individual workspace, the rest of the room can be held on less strict indoor thermal conditions. This climate control strategy saves up to 30% energy while it optimizes the individual perceived comfort. The experiments performed were part of the proof of principle study to see whether it is possible to use the occupant as sensor for the HVAC process control. The experiments were there only done with one test person. Future experiments must be done with more persons to look for individual difference. Also different shapes of the infra red heating elements should be tested, as well as their applications on different place. This will enable to optimize the heating effect to the hands in relation to the perceived individual comfort.

One such approach utilizes the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide into coal beds which is a value addition process, capable of enhancing the yield of coalbed methane (CBM) in producing reservoirs. CO2 is preferentially adsorbed onto the microporous structure of coal seams and it displaces the methane molecule from the adsorption sites, thereby enhancing the production of the low carbon eco-friendly fuel. In this study, a finite difference based reservoir simulator, COMET3, has been utilized for construction of underground coal bed scenario for Indian seams. Numerical modeling involves solving complex equations used to describe some physical process by iterative approximate solutions. Such simulation is worked out for underground coal of Lower Gondwana sequence in Jharkhand state in India. Detailed field work was carried out to collect samples and field data. Laboratory tested parameters and some from published data were utilized for construction of the numerical model. The best fit model was developed for estimation of the volumes of gases involved in CO2 enhanced coalbed methane recovery. It also gives a detailed analysis of distribution of gases with time and space. The results obtained from the simulation are quite encouraging and ascertain that the process of CO 2 enhanced CBM recovery seems to be technically feasible for Indian scenario also. The simulation was executed for a period of 20 years to understand the space-time disposition of injected CO2 and recovery of methane from the reservoirs. It is quantified in this study that for the chosen dimensions of coal block, a total of 15.1 bcf of CO2 can be injected into the reservoir and approximately 5.0 bcf of methane can be recovered.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a toxic gas and is thus a regulated air pollutant. Besides, it is of major importance for the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and plays a pivotal role in the formation of ozone and acid precipitation. Detection of NO2 is a difficult task since many of the different commercial techniques used are affected by interferences. The chemiluminescence instruments that are used for indirect NO2 detection in monitoring networks and smog chambers use either molybdenum or photolytic converters and are affected by either positive (NOy) or negative interferences (radical formation in the photolytic converter). Erroneous conclusions on NO2 can be drawn if these interferences are not taken into consideration. In the present study, NO 2 measurements in the urban atmosphere, in a road traffic tunnel and in a smog-chamber using different commercial techniques, i.e. chemiluminescence instruments with molybdenum or photolytic converters, a Luminol based instrument and a new NO2-LOPAP, were compared with spectroscopic techniques, i.e. DOAS and FTIR. Interferences of the different instruments observed during atmospheric measurements were partly characterised in more detail in the smog chamber experiments. Whereas all the commercial instruments showed strong interferences, excellent agreement was obtained between a new NO 2-LOPAP instrument and the FTIR technique for the measurements performed in the smog chamber. © 2011 Author(s).",,"acid precipitation; atmospheric pollution; instrumentation; luminescence; molybdenum; nitrogen dioxide; oxidation; ozone; smog; trace gas; urban area; urban pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867065161

These regions were primarily the areas of middle Spiš and northern Gemer, where soils were under long-term contamination by solid polluting elements containing risk elements. A source of contamination was metallurgical plants located in the broken terrain with unfavorable dispersion conditions. Risk elements Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, and As were determined in the lixivium of Aqua regia and their accessible (mobile) forms in the lixivium of 1 mol·dm -3 NH 4HNO 3. To consider the solubility of the risk elements the lixivium of 0.05 mol·dm -3 EDTA (mobile and mobilizable forms) and the lixivium of 2 mol·dm -3 HNO 3 (potentially releasable contents) was used. Ascertained contents of the risk elements in the lixivium of Aqua regia correspond with the results regarding risk elements that were obtained by reduction in the mixture of inorganic acids before 1990. Then values of the solid polluting elements containing risk elements were the highest. The results confirm the large areal character of soil contamination by Hg and As in the emission areals of metallurgical plants where the natural endegeneous geochemical abnormalities now exist. Extremely high values of Pb, Zn, and Cd in close proximity to the former shaft-furnace (without any possibility of dispersion) are the result of solid polluting elements from Pb, Sn, alloys and ZnSO 4 production facilities. A considerably larger area of contaminated soils by Cu is connected to refined flame furnace copper production and convertors and its dispersion into the wider areas. Some isolated locations with Cd, Cu, Ni, Hg, and As excesses are connected to geological- petrographical conditions where polymetallic mineralizing of old environmental loads is characteristic. In the samples with high contents of risk elements in Aqua regia, there were also over limit values for accessible plant risk elements. In the sum of mobile and mobilizable forms with relatively the highest content of Cd (36.57%) and the lowest Cr (0.36%) were determined in the following decreasing order Cd &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; Ni &gt; Zn &gt; Cr. The relevant prevalence of risk elements in residual fractions is apparently connected to their emission origin from thermic processes as predominantly insoluble risk element oxids.","Burdened areas; Risk elements; Soil contamination",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867820546

The data from crops planted on July 6, 2010 and January 14, 2011 with application of 120 kg N ha-1 were used for model calibration. The remaining experimental data were used for model evaluation. The results for model calibration showed that the derived genetic coefficients provide simulated values of phenological events, biomass accumulation and grain yields that were in good agreement with their corresponding observed values. The model evaluation results indicated that for 2 rice cultivars grown under 3 rates of N-fertilizer application, the differences between observed and simulated values for time between transplantation and anthesis varied from 0-6 days, and for time between transplantation and maturity varied from 0-14 days. The normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) values for biomass accumulation ranged from 0-34% and for grain yield ranged from 2-354%.

Moreover, N 2O emission strongly depends on the position of agricultural land in relation with topographical gradients, as footslope soils are often more prone to denitrification. The estimation of land surface area occupied by agricultural soils depends on the available spatial input information and resolution. Surface areas of grassland, forest and arable lands were estimated for the Orgeval sub-basin using two cover representations: the pan European CORINE Land Cover 2006 database (CLC 2006) and a combination of two databases produced by the IAU IDF (Institut d'Aménagement et d'Urbanisme de la Région d'Île-de-France), the MOS (Mode d'Occupation des Sols) combined with the ECOMOS 2000 (a land-use classification). In this study, we have analyzed how different landcover representations influence and introduce errors into the results of regional N 2O emissions inventories. A further introduction of the topography concept was used to better identify the critical zones for N 2O emissions, a crucial issue to better adapt the strategies of N 2O emissions mitigation. Overall, we observed that a refinement of the land-cover database led to a 5%decrease in the estimation of N 2O emissions, while the integration of the topography decreased the estimation of N 2O emissions up to 25 %. © Author(s) 2012.",,"agricultural emission; arable land; atmospheric pollution; database; denitrification; estimation method; grassland; identification method; land cover; land surface; nitrous oxide; surface area; topography; watershed; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859117781

The hybrid material is made by fabricating palladium nanoparticles on two types of carbon supports: as-received microcellular foam (Foam) and foam with carbon nanotubes anchored on the pore walls (CNT/Foam). Catalytic reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride with these materials has been investigated using gas chromatography. It is seen that while both palladium-functionalized carbon supports are highly effective in the degradation of carbon tetrachloride, the rate of degradation is significantly increased with palladium on CNT/Foam. However, there is scope to increase this rate further if the wettability of these structures can be enhanced in the future. Microstructural and spectroscopic analyses of the fresh and used catalysts have been compared which indicates that there is no change in density or surface chemical states of the catalyst after prolonged use in dechlorination test. This implies that these materials can be used repeatedly and hence provide a simple, powerful, and cost-effective approach for dechlorination of water. © 2012 Hema Vijwani et al.",,"Carbon Nanostructures; Carbon support; Cost-effective approach; Environmental contaminant; High surface area; Micro-structural; Microcellular foams; Nano-catalyst; Palladium nanoparticles; Pore wall; Reductive dechlorination; Structural robustness; Surface chemical state; Carbon; Carbon tetrachloride; Catalysts; Dechlorination; Gas chromatography; Hybrid materials; Materials handling; Nanoparticles; Spectroscopic analysis; Foams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872853510

Its headwaters lie at the top of the subtropical Andes (>5; 000 m above sea level) and the river flows westward into the Pacific Ocean over a length of approximately 200 km. This basin has a marked snowmelt-driven hydrological regime and, in spite of the arid conditions that characterize this region, holds more than 50,000 ha of highly productive agricultural land thanks to its irrigation infrastructure and three interconnected reservoirs. Like many semiarid regions around the world, north-central Chile is expected to become warmer and drier during the 21st century as a consequence of ongoing anthropogenic climate change. The associated reduction in streamflow, changes in hydrograph timing, and enhanced evapotranspiration will undoubtedly threaten agriculture in the Limarí basin and elsewhere in semiarid Chile. In this paper, the effect of temperature and precipitation on surface hydrology, performance of water infrastructure, and irrigation coverage in the Limarí basin is investigated by using the water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model. WEAP was calibrated by using current climate and agriculture patterns, and then forced with a set of 30-year-long climate scenarios, each of them obtained by adding a temperature and precipitation perturbation to the historical time series. This delta approach allows (1) determination of the sensitivity of selected variables to climate change, and (2) obtaining a projection of the effects in irrigation coverage expected for the near and far future (2010-2040 and 2070-2100, respectively). Both aspects are investigated for agricultural districts with varying access to irrigation infrastructure and groundwater; this exercise highlights the relevance of added storage and innovative conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources for improving the resilience and adaptability of irrigated agriculture in the face of a changing climate. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Agriculture; Climate change; Reservoir systems; Semiarid regions; Vulnerability; Water resources","Agriculture; Arid regions; Groundwater; Irrigation; Reservoirs (water); Snow melting systems; Surface water resources; Water resources; Water supply; Watersheds; Anthropogenic climate changes; Effect of temperature; Hydrological regime; Irrigated agriculture; Reservoir systems; Semi-arid region; Vulnerability; Water infrastructure; Climate change; agricultural land; anthropogenic effect; climate change; groundwater resource; irrigation; perturbation; precipitation (climatology); river basin; semiarid region; snowmelt; streamflow; temperature effect; time series; vulnerability; water planning; watershed; Andes; Chile; Coquimbo; Limari Basin; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890203058

The fact that H2S is lethal at low concentrations and highly corrosive in the presence of CO2 and/or (salty) water indicates that safety is a main driver in these projects. It is of crucial importance that the H2S is contained and that plant integrity is assured through tightly controlled maintenance programs. Product specifications for produced gas and hydrocarbon liquids are ever tightening and legislation on emissions are becoming more stringent. Deep removal of H2S and other sulphur components like mercaptans and carbonyl sulphide is required. This increases the complexity and therefore cost of the sour gas processing facilities, which must compete with production from sweet gas in the region/country or alternatives such as LNG import. Technology innovation as well as smart integration of technologies are essential for the cost effective development of sour gas assets ensuring all specifications and emission requirements are met. Several examples of these technology innovations will be presented in this paper.

In this paper we show that even though no crisis actually occurred, the Second Delta Committee succeeded in three areas. First, the committee managed to create awareness and set the agenda for climate adaptation policy and the issue of safety in Dutch water management. Second, the committee succeeded to a large extent in getting the media, the public and politics to accept its frame and framing of the problems, causes, moral judgments and suggested remedies. Third, the committee has to a certain degree already succeeded in having its recommendations translated into policy programmes. It will be argued that framing strategies were key to the committee's success and that the committee used various framing strategies to convince the Cabinet, citizens and others of the urgency and necessity of implementing adaptation measures. The most important framing strategies identified were adherence to the climate adaptation narrative, using the story of our delta identity, creating a sense of urgency and collectiveness, and creating a crisis narrative.","Agenda setting; Climate change; Crises; Framing strategies; Policy change; The Netherlands","climate change; delta; environmental policy; farming system; policy analysis; sea level change; water management; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871526700

The clean development mechanism, from Kyoto Protocol, was envisioned as connecting carbon market and sustainable development objectives in developing countries. Previous research has shown that this potential is rarely being achieved. The paper explores how the incorporation of the human side into carbon management reinforces its contribution to generate human development in local communities and to improve the company's image. A case study of a Brazilian company is presented, with the results of the application of an analytical model that incorporates the human side and human development. The selected project is an 'efficient stoves' programme. 'Efficient stoves' are recognised in Brazil as social technologies. Results suggest that the fact that social technologies value the human side of the technology plays a key role when it comes to analysing the co-benefits of the project implementation.

Two digester sets (Sets A and B), were seeded with different inocula and operated (HRT = 10 days, OLR = 4 g-COD/LR-day). Bioaugmented digesters received 50 mg-VSS/LR-day of an active culture enriched for H2/CO2 and propionate utilization. The bioaugmented Set-A digesters showed a significant increase in methane production and COD reduction, whereas Set-B digesters did not. The specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of seed used to start Set-A was lower than that used to start Set-B. In addition, initial SMA screening of each inocula mixed with enrichment culture indicated Set-A inoculum would benefit from bioaugmentation, whereas Set-B would not. Therefore, low SMA may indicate that bioaugmentation is beneficial and initial SMA screening can predict bioaugmentation outcomes. In conclusion, bioaugmentation can result in higher methane production and lower effluent COD at steady state; however, success depends on the initial digester methanogenic community.

Time series of monthly temperature and precipitation were evaluated because of their importance for climate studies and because they represent two important types of statistics (additive and multiplicative). The algorithms were validated against a realistic benchmark dataset. The benchmark contains real inhomogeneous data as well as simulated data with inserted inhomogeneities. Random independent break-type inhomogeneities with normally distributed breakpoint sizes were added to the simulated datasets. To approximate real world conditions, breaks were introduced that occur simultaneously in multiple station series within a simulated network of station data. The simulated time series also contained outliers, missing data periods and local station trends. Further, a stochastic nonlinear global (network-wide) trend was added. Participants provided 25 separate homogenized contributions as part of the blind study. After the deadline at which details of the imposed inhomogeneities were revealed, 22 additional solutions were submitted. These homogenized datasets were assessed by a number of performance metrics including (i) the centered root mean square error relative to the true homogeneous value at various averaging scales, (ii) the error in linear trend estimates and (iii) traditional contingency skill scores. The metrics were computed both using the individual station series as well as the network average regional series. The performance of the contributions depends significantly on the error metric considered. Contingency scores by themselves are not very informative. Although relative homogenization algorithms typically improve the homogeneity of temperature data, only the best ones improve precipitation data. Training the users on homogenization software was found to be very important. Moreover, state-of-the-art relative homogenization algorithms developed to work with an inhomogeneous reference are shown to perform best. The study showed that automatic algorithms can perform as well as manual ones. © Author(s) 2012.",,"algorithm; benchmarking; data interpretation; data set; error analysis; homogeneity; integrated approach; outlier; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); software; stochasticity; time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855798694

The engine is advanced even for the strict European emission standards, because it meets the EURO 5 specifications and the Enhanced Environmental Vehicle (EEV), besides surpassing the limits imposed by the P-7 stage of PROCONVE. Today, ethanol-powered buses became a reality, because the chassis and the engine, then imported, as well as the additive for the ethanol, are already manufactured in Brazil. Starting from the signature, by initiative of the city hall, of a protocol of intent for the purchase of the first 50 ethanol buses, other actions come following, as 10 more buses were delivered. Besides evaluating GHGs emissions from ethanol-powered buses, this work analyzes the impacts in CO2 emissions due to the gradual substitution of the whole fleet of the city of São Paulo, currently powered by diesel, by ethanol buses. As there are no methodologies approved by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Council, of the Kyoto Protocol, that fully apply to the proposed situation, calculations are executed from equations predicted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and the Intergovernanmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in order to determine the income generated by the carbon credits.

Therefore, urban expansion and making existing urban areas more sustainable is a contemporary goal. There are major opportunities to do this through the 'normal' renewal of urban infrastructure and building stocks both now and in the future. However, significant building renewal cycles occur every 30-50 years and major infrastructure renewal cycles at even longer timescales of more than 100 years. Despite this there are significant opportunities to make buildings and infrastructure more resilient to external stress (an easier to realise goal than sustainability) beginning immediately. The challenge is to change the current norms for owners, urban planners, builders, professionals and policy makers to accept the need and urgency of doing this. Given the pace of climate and other changes and the need to manage carbon and energy better, there is an urgent need to begin to incorporate flexible, adaptable and more resilient measures by synergistic inclusion within refurbishment and renovation programmes. This needs to be recognised and planned as soon as possible, so that inclusion of such measures becomes the norm. Failure to do this will miss vital and unique opportunities that will hinder the delivery of carbon reduction targets. This is illustrated in the paper by recent studies in the Netherlands that have mapped urban flood and heat island vulnerabilities and identified where adaptive potential can best be targeted at the current building stock through refurbishment, renewal and regeneration and by reference to the latest developments in England and Wales.","Adaptation; Climate proofing; Flood risk management; Redevelopment","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Adaptive potential; Building stocks; Carbon reduction; Climate proofing; England; External stress; Flood proofing; Flood risk management; Heat island; Infrastructure renewal; Latest development; Netherlands; Policy makers; Redevelopment; Time-scales; Urban areas; Urban expansion; Urban floods; Urban infrastructure; Urban planners; Carbon; Flood control; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862017454

Green 'pushers' seek direct influence at the EU level, whereas 'forerunners' try to get national elements incorporated in an indirect fashion. Together with a second dimension, the nature of national policies (purposeful or incremental), four national positions towards EU legislation can be identified: pusher-by-example, constructive pusher, defensive forerunner, and opter-out. We applied an amended version of this framework to the influence of three 'green' member states-the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (UK), and Denmark-on the European Commission and the European Council when preparing and deciding on new legislation as to carbon dioxide taxation and emissions trading, both related to climate policy. Different aspects of influence were tested: timing, nature of contacts, alliance building, and uploading of national elements. We concluded that one type of position should be revised (late starter is preferable to opter-out); besides, countries may simultaneously follow different strategies rather than adopt one single approach. © Frank Wijen, Kees Zoeteman, Jan Pieters, and Paul van Seters 2012.

Small changes in temperature can change the flow of carbon and the community structure of planktonic ecosystems, and climatological models predict a rise in temperature of 2 to 5°C toward the end of the century in the NW Mediterranean. Laboratory culture experiments have shown that warming can increase the transfer of carbon between bacteria and protists and alter the community composition of microbial top predators (i.e. ciliates and dinoflagellates) by increasing the abundance of bacterivores and producing the extinction of herbivores. Here, we tested whether a small rise in temperature would produce these effects in the coastal Mediterranean. Between March 2003 and February 2004, we established 12 microcosm experiments with water from the Bay of Blanes. The samples were incubated for 48 h at ambient and warmer temperatures (~2.7°C higher than in situ values), and the net and gross growth rates of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were measured using unfiltered and 0.8 μm filtered treatments. Warming increased the rates of bacterial gross production and bacterial losses to grazing with a clear seasonality; the largest increments in the rates were observed during the cooler months of the year.

However, the benefits of HCCI are limited to low and medium loads by the simultaneous occurrence of combustion instability and knock at a maximum load that is too low for conventional SI combustion. To provide smooth operation in the intermediate range between HCCI and SI requires alternative combustion strategies. One such strategy is spark-assisted compression ignition (SACI), which uses a spark plug to initiate a flame that consumes a portion of the mixture, followed by autoignition of the remaining charge. This moderates the rapid heat release and allows higher loads to be achieved without exceeding knock and stability limits. In a recent study, we have explored this region and have found that spark assist at first dramatically reduces knock as load is raised above the HCCI limit; however, with further load increase, knock returns but in a form that resembles spark ignited knock rather than the HCCI knock. This study investigates in detail the knocking conditions observed in that work. The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to explore the differences between the two forms of knock and second, to apply and compare a number of commonly used metrics for knock and noise over the range of HCCI, SACI, and SI combustion. Experimental data were acquired on a single-cylinder DI research engine equipped with a fully flexible valve actuation (FFVA) system and fueled by research-grade gasoline. Cycle to cycle results based on filtered pressure traces are shown and compared with a number of knock measures including a widely used correlation for ringing intensity for HCCI combustion. Although based on a limited set of data, the results identify important qualitative features of the two forms of knock and point out significant differences among the knock metrics. The results suggest that further investigations are needed to fully understand both the knocking phenomenon and how best to quantify it.

Several structural parts of the combustor are exposed to high gas temperatures, and therefore their lifetime depends mainly on the metal temperatures, which must be kept within the acceptable limits. This paper describes methodology based on the state of the art methods of 3D CFD and finite element (FE) computations, which are combined into the computational process for the reliable silo combustor thermal analyses. In the first part of the paper the computational model of the silo combustor is discussed. The model comprises CFD models simulating the hot gas path and the cooling air supply system, as well as the FE model of the structural parts. The CFD models predict the gas temperatures and heat transfer coefficients that are used by the FE model for calculating the metal temperatures. In the second part of the paper the computational results are presented and several 3D flow phenomena are analysed in details. One effect is the interaction of dilution jets in swirled cross flow. At different operation conditions, pairing of those jets occurs, which generates the periodic metal temperature distribution, as recorded in the field. This analysis also revealed factors, which influence on the temperature distribution. The combustor simulation delivers an insight into nonhomogeneous temperature profiles in front of the turbine behind the transition channel of the silo-combustor. Finally, by adding leakages into the flow model, the interesting example of the non-homogeneous leakage of cold air, which can lead to local increase of material temperature, was simulated. All these simulations led to reliable silo-combustor upgrades.

A Bursa-Orhaneli lignite was used as coal and woodchips was used as biomass in the tests. Woodchips refers to the Rhododendron genus of woody plants in Ericaceae family which is mainly cultivated in the Black Sea region of Turkey. In this study, co-combustion of lignite and woodchips mixtures containing 10%, 30% and 50% woodchips by weight was studied. The experimental setup consists of a circulating fluidized bed combustor column, a fuel feeding system, electrical heaters, two cyclones and a bag filter. The combustor column has an inside diameter of 108 mm and a height of 6 m. The temperatures along the column are observed with thermocouples located at specific heights. The temperature of the column is kept at 850 °C during the combustion tests. The pressure drops along the combustor column, cyclone, and downcomer are continuously measured and observed in order to determine the solid mass flux within the combustor. A series of co-combustion tests was performed in order to investigate the effect of excess air ratio on the flue gas emissions. During the combustion tests, CO2, CO, O 2, NO, and SO2, emissions in the flue gas was continuously measured and recorded by ABB-AO 2000 flue gas analyzer. The results of the tests showed that as the woodchips ratio in the fuel mixture increases for co-combustion, the combustion takes place more in the freeboard of the main column. Therefore, the maximum temperatures are seen in the freeboard rather than in the bed. It is possible to combust Orhaneli lignite and woodchips mixtures in a circulating fluidized bed combustor without any operational problems for a long time. In order to get minimum flue gas emissions, the best excess air ratios for the co-combustion tests of fuel mixture including 10%, 30% and 50% woodchips by weight were determined to be 1.37, 1.54 and 1.59, respectively. As the percentage of woodchips in the fuel mixture was increased, it was required to feed more air into the combustor to get minimum emissions, especially CO emission. Woodchips addition to Orhaneli lignite made the CO emission worse and caused CO emission to exceed the Turkish emission limit. NO emissions were under the limits for all cases except for the case of co-combustion of Orhaneli lignite with 50% woodchips. SO2 emissions were above the emission limits when the percentage of woodchips in the Orhaneli+woodchips fuel mixture was 10% by weight. For the other mixtures, SO2 emissions were measured under the limit. Woodchips addition decreased the SO2 emissions as the percentage of biomass increased in the fuel mixture since the biomass contained almost no sulfur. When the system was operated under the condition where NO emission was minimum, it was observed that more CO emission was produced. Therefore, it is necessary to make an optimization on excess air ratio according to CO and NO emissions. In this set of experiments, CO emission has the priority in order to determine the best excess air ratio because it is possible to reduce NO emission by giving secondary air to the combustor.",,"Black Sea regions; Circulating fluidized bed combustor; Combustion of coal; Electrical heater; Excess air ratios; Fuel feeding system; Maximum temperature; Operational problems; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Flue gases; Fluidized bed combustors; Fuels; Gas emissions; Lignite; Mixtures; Sulfur dioxide; Testing; Thermocouples; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877624092

The deammonification process is a completely autotrophic nitrogen removal approach that eliminates the carbon needs for denitrification. Thus, it can be a promising approach for the biological removal of ammonia (NH4 +) from anaerobic digester effluents that are low in carbon and high in ammonia concentration. A high performance nitrifying sludge, HPNS (NRRL B-50298), was mixed with anammox bacterial sludge, Brocadia caroliniensis (NRRL B-50286), in a single reactor. The reactor was an aerated vessel operated under continuous flow. It contained biofilm plastic carriers that were fluidized by the aeration. The process water temperature was 22°C and DO &lt;0.5 mg/L. It was tested using inorganic synthetic wastewater and anaerobically digested swine wastewater. Ammonia removal rates of 1.2 kg N/m3-reactor/day were obtained with influent wastewater concentration of 440 mg/L NH 4-N and a removal efficiency of 87%. The stoichiometry of the reaction obtained was consistent with deammonification process combining partial nitritation and anammox. Analyses of the 16S rRNA of the single tank bacterial community detected Brocadia caroliniensis and Nitrosomonas europaea, and a large number (54 to 63%) of Bacteroidetes. Results obtained with the deammonification process showed several advantages over nitrification/denitrification: 1) it reduced 56% of the oxygen requirements to remove the ammonia; 2) it did not require carbon; and 3) it removed nitrogen at higher rates in a single-tank, further reducing equipment costs. Therefore, deammonification can be a key technology for development of more economical and energy efficient biological ammonia removal systems in the near future.","Ammonia emissions abatement; Anammox; Deammonification; Swine manure; Wastewater treatment","Agriculture; Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Carbon; Denitrification; Effluents; Energy efficiency; Fluidization; Manures; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; RNA; Stoichiometry; Tanks (containers); Wastewater treatment; 16S rRNA; Aerated vessels; Ammonia concentrations; Ammonia emissions; Ammonia removal; Anaerobic digester; ANAMMOX; Autotrophic nitrogen removal; Bacterial community; Biological removal; Continuous flows; Deammonification; Energy efficient; Equipment costs; Key technologies; Nitrification/denitrification; Nitrosomonas europaea; Partial nitritation; Plastic carriers; Process water; Removal efficiencies; Single reactor; Swine manure; Swine wastewater; Synthetic waste water; Wastewater concentration; Bacteria",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871745361

It contains both a giant radio halo and a relic, as well as a number of head-tail sources and smaller diffuse steep-spectrum radio sources. The origin of radio halos and relics is still being debated, but over the last years it has become clear that the presence of these radio sources is closely related to galaxy cluster merger events. Here we present the results from the first LOFAR low band antenna (LBA) observations of Abell 2256 between 18 and 67 MHz. To our knowledge, the image presented in this paper at 63 MHz is the deepest ever obtained at frequencies below 100 MHz in general. Both the radio halo and the giant relic are detected in the image at 63 MHz, and the diffuse radio emission remains visible at frequencies as low as 20 MHz. The observations confirm the presence of a previously claimed ultra-steep spectrum source to the west of the cluster center with a spectral index of-2.3 ± 0.4 between 63 and 153 MHz. The steep spectrum suggests that this source is an old part of a head-tail radio source in the cluster. For the radio relic we find an integrated spectral index of-0.81 ± 0.03, after removing the flux contribution from the other sources. This is relatively flat which could indicate that the efficiency of particle acceleration at the shock substantially changed in the last ~0.1 Gyr due to an increase of the shock Mach number. In an alternative scenario, particles are re-accelerated by some mechanism in the downstream region of the shock, resulting in the relatively flat integrated radio spectrum. In the radio halo region we find indications of low-frequency spectral steepening which may suggest that relativistic particles are accelerated in a rather inhomogeneous turbulent region. © 2012 ESO.","Galaxies: clusters: individual: Abell 2256; Large-scale structure of Universe; Radio continuum: general; Telescopes","Cluster centers; Downstream region; Galaxies: clusters: individual: abell 2256; Galaxy clusters; Large scale structure of universe; Low frequency; Nonthermal emission; Particle acceleration; Radio continuum: general; Radio emission; Radio halo; Radio sources; Radio spectra; Relativistic particles; Spectral indices; Steep spectra; Turbulent regions; Very low frequency; Mach number; Radio astronomy; Telescopes; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862731742

One of these technologies comprises a catalyst that facilitates the reactions of ammonia (NH3) with the exhaust nitrogen oxides (NOx) to produce nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O). This technology is referred to as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). The ammonia is delivered by a separate fluid supply and injection system to the exhaust in the form of AUS-32 (Aqueous Urea Solution), and is also known under its commercial name of AdBlue® in Europe, and DEF - Diesel Exhaust Fluid - in the USA. The development and application of current production AUS-32 injection systems typically rely on spray diagnostics techniques that were implemented for the gasoline port injector. These data are often obtained under standard room temperature conditions. These data are then used as initial conditions for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Up until the present, there had been only limited information about urea injector spray quality as the fluid temperature in the injector increased to typical hot levels in the exhaust-mount urea injection applications. This paper presents results from high-speed video imaging of an AUS-32 injector spray simulating the hot conditions at the injector spray exit for an exhaust injection application. The results show substantial structural differences in the static spray between room temperature conditions, and conditions where the fluid temperature is approaching and exceeding 100° C. There are also noticeable differences in the post injection phase, which are typically not taken into account by the CFD community, but which could have a significant impact on mixing calculations and prediction of deposits behavior. The high-speed video imaging setup and results for various spray configurations are described in this paper. The implications for better understanding of spray-gas mixing and deposits formation are also discussed.

As a consequence, both winners and losers contest the legitimacy of the institutions and mechanisms that govern global capitalism. In this article, we distinguish between Marx-type contestation, referring to emerging classes/states, and Polanyi-type contestation, referring to the victims of global mercantilization.

Adaptability, resilience, and cooperative approaches are promoted as the appropriate vehicles to meet the contemporary conditions of uncertainty and complexity. We claim that the legitimacy and effectiveness of these responsive strategies might be augmented via the use of legal perspectives. Rather than the instrumental use of command and control type of regulation, the legal perspectives should focus on establishing principal norms that enable the search for different solutions in different contexts. From these assumptions, the concept of legal obligation is explored as embodying the meaning of legality, and at the same time conditioning and committing the probing of different ways of purposeful action in different local circumstances. We explore the innovative potential of legal norms and demonstrate how responsive strategies to climate change can be guided by the contextualization of legal norms. © 2012 by the author(s).","Adaptive governance; Climate change; Contextualization of legal norms; Planning and law; Resilience","adaptive management; climate change; complexity; legal system; paradigm shift; planning system; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864483920

Especially in highly urbanized regions like Flanders, it's not easy to attain these standards. In order to formulate cost-efficient mitigation measures, the in depth knowledge of the current status of the quality of water bodies, as well as the location of the most important emission sources is paramount. WEISS is developed to address these questions as part of a LIFE+ project carried out by VITO and the Flemish Environment Agency. It is to support the latter in its monitoring and reporting obligations. WEISS is a shell, highly generic and applicable in European watersheds and regions. It is explicitly spatial in its approach: for Flanders, calculations are made for 2.280.000 grid cells at a 1 ha resolution. WEISS incorporates both point and diffuse emission sources and essentially consists of three modules. The first deals with the spatial distribution of the emissions. To the effect it provides spatial algorithms to allocate surface, line and point sources, depending on the type, the detail and the spatial resolution of the information available in the specific study area. The second represents all relevant routes transporting the emissions, including direct discharges, the sewer system and runoff. The third is an accounting module. It enables consulting and reporting the calculations for specific spatial entities in terms of maps and tables in every node of the transport routes. WEISS stores information for several years and enables yearly and inter-annual computations and comparisons. Parameters can be altered and indicators can be computed to analyze the state of the water system as part of decision support exercises. Among others the location of newly built sewage pipelines, improved efficiency of treatment plants, materials used in buildings and infrastructure, etc. can be experimented with. WEISS is a software shell programmed in C++ and is linked to an MS Access database.","Decision support system; Diffuse sources; Emission inventory; Model blocks; WFD",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894182735

Results of this assessment led to the creation of a student center to promote inclusion, diversity, excellence, and advancement across the Jacobs School of Engineering. During the summer of 2011 the center implemented its inaugural residential pre-engineering program (IDEA PrEP). The program's participants included 22 pre-freshman students all of whom were from historically underrepresented groups in engineering and/or first-generation to attend college. Funding constraints on the summer program required a tradeoff between academic preparation vs. motivational and social aspects. The Jacobs School decided to emphasize the motivational and social aspects while introducing students to existing academic resources on campus. The goals of the program were to a) foster a sense of community b) build awareness of campus programs and resources, c) provide tools to aid in the transition from high school to college, and d) inspire students by exposing them to opportunities in engineering. Activities during the four-day program were designed to address these goals and included: social and team building activities, academic-themed workshops, and an introduction to campus academic resources. This paper summarizes the results of a pre- and post-survey designed to assess whether the program met its goals. Noteworthy survey results include a 50% difference in the students' awareness of campus resources, a 28% difference in feeling a sense of community with UCSD, a 20% increase in understanding what an engineer does and a 14% increase in preference for seeking assistance from others.

To date, two facilities in North America have progressed through the carbon offset generation process, successfully validating and verifying their projects in accordance with the standard. The Lee County facility began generating carbon offsets with the 2007 emissions year, and the Hillsborough County facility has verified carbon offsets beginning with the 2009 emissions year. The credits are associated with the avoidance of landfill methane and displaced grid-connected fossil fuel electricity generation. Due to extensive conservatism on the part of the CDM methodology, approximately 0.15 - 0.3 tons of credits are generated per ton of waste processed, depending on the specific operation generating the offsets. This is in contrast to an overall net lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction of approximately 1 ton of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per ton of waste processed relative to the business as usual practice of landfilling. More realistic methodologies could generate offset credits at a rate approaching the life cycle benefits. However, even with the current methodology, the energy from waste carbon market could exceed 800 thousand metric tonnes per year, with a value of $1.6 - $3 million a year, based on current voluntary carbon offset pricing.

Other pollutants are divided into several groups and subgroups, such as substances with carcinogenic effects (asbestos, Co, Cd, Be, Ni, As, Cr, dioxins, etc.), solid inorganic contaminants (He, Se, animony, and others) and inorganic pollutants in the form of gases (HCl, HF, ammonia, etc.), organic gases and vapours (phenol, toluene, acetone and many others) and gases causing the greenhouse effect (CO2, methane, N2O, hydrofluorocarbons, etc.). The term particulate matter, or suspended matter refers to the emissions of a wide range of wind drift solids and liquid particles of material in size from several nanometres up to 0.5 mm, which stay in the air for some time. This is a major component of atmospheric pollution, which contributes to harmful effects not only on human health but also on intensity of materials degradation. Into the atmosphere, where we can meet them, regardless of particle size and chemical composition, in the form of a complex heterogeneous mixture, they are released from burning fossil fuels and also from burning biomass-based fuels, while domestic heating accounts for about 16% of the total production of particulate matter [4,5,6]. This percentage represents a degree of imperfect combustion of fuels used in local heating. Emissions from incomplete combustion are undesirable from the point of view of human health as well as from the economic point of view, because this leads to the degradation of materials. Nevertheless, since fuel combustion is necessary for the society, emissions are still produced. This paper presents an automated method of perfect combustion control in local heating in order to minimize emissions being produced. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.","Control; Emission; Local heat source","Acetone; Carbon monoxide; Control engineering; Diffusion in solids; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Heat transfer; Liquids; Microstructure; Nanostructured materials; Neutron emission; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Organic pollutants; Particle size; Sulfur dioxide; Waste incineration; Atmospheric pollution; Chemical compositions; Emission distribution; Heterogeneous mixtures; Incomplete combustion; Inorganic contaminants; Local heat source; Materials degradation; Particles (particulate matter)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860807710

The full genome has been sequenced (&lt;30 Mb), and approximately 20 to 30% triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation on a dry cell basis has been reported under different growth conditions. To elucidate P. tricornutum gene expression profiles during nutrient-deprivation and lipid-accumulation, cell cultures were grown with a nitrate to phosphate ratio of 20:1 (N:P) and whole-genome transcripts were monitored over time via RNA-sequence determination. Results: The specific Nile Red (NR) fluorescence (NR fluorescence per cell) increased over time; however, the increase in NR fluorescence was initiated before external nitrate was completely exhausted. Exogenous phosphate was depleted before nitrate, and these results indicated that the depletion of exogenous phosphate might be an early trigger for lipid accumulation that is magnified upon nitrate depletion. As expected, many of the genes associated with nitrate and phosphate utilization were up-expressed. The diatom-specific cyclins cyc7 and cyc10 were down-expressed during the nutrient-deplete state, and cyclin B1 was up-expressed during lipid-accumulation after growth cessation. While many of the genes associated with the C3 pathway for photosynthetic carbon reduction were not significantly altered, genes involved in a putative C4 pathway for photosynthetic carbon assimilation were up-expressed as the cells depleted nitrate, phosphate, and exogenous dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) levels. P. tricornutum has multiple, putative carbonic anhydrases, but only two were significantly up-expressed (2-fold and 4-fold) at the last time point when exogenous DIC levels had increased after the cessation of growth. Alternative pathways that could utilize HCO 3 - were also suggested by the gene expression profiles (e.g., putative propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylases). Conclusions: The results indicate that P. tricornutum continued carbon dioxide reduction when population growth was arrested and different carbon-concentrating mechanisms were used dependent upon exogenous DIC levels. Based upon overall low gene expression levels for fatty acid synthesis, the results also suggest that the build-up of precursors to the acetyl-CoA carboxylases may play a more significant role in TAG synthesis rather than the actual enzyme levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylases per se. The presented insights into the types and timing of cellular responses to inorganic carbon will help maximize photoautotrophic carbon flow to lipid accumulation. © 2012 Valenzuela et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Algae; Bio-oil; Biofuel; Carbon fixation; Diatom; Lipid-accumulation; RNA-seq; Transcriptomics","Bio oil; Carbon fixation; Diatom; Lipid-accumulation; RNA-seq; Transcriptomics; Algae; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cell culture; Fluorescence; Gene expression; Nutrients; Pollution control; Population statistics; RNA; Nitrates; alga; bioaccumulation; biofuel; carbon fixation; diatom; dissolved inorganic carbon; gene expression; lipid; RNA; algae; Bacillariophyceae; Bacillariophyta; Phaeodactylum tricornutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861829358

The ability of water supply systems to act as emission control barriers for tap water micropollutants, thereby providing environmental benefits in addition to potable water savings, have not been fully explored. This paper investigates the sources, presence and potential fate of a selection of manganese micropollutants in laboratory scaled water supply systems. All of the investigated compounds are listed under the European Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption (1998) and World Health Organization Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (2004). Significant water quality changes are identified. Hydro-chemical modelling indicates that the removal of manganese substances during water treatment is likely to be predominant due to the EC Directive manganese concentration requirement, with only minor contributions to the water supply network. Manganese compounds are resistant to biodegradation and the majority of conventional groundwater treatment plants periodically supply water with manganese residual to the potable water distribution system. Water treatment is unlikely to act as a comprehensive barrier for emission of manganese compounds. Hence, it is important to ensure that other manganese source control options (e. g. pipeline materials, manganese substance emission, and groundwater source control) for potable water supply continue to be pursued in order that emissions of manganese compounds from these sources are effectively reduced and / or phased out as required under the demands of the European Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption. © Lietuvos mokslu akademija, 2012.","Manganese; Pipelines; Users' taps; Water quality; Water supply",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897432450

Results show that overall resilience levels of ecosystems lie between 3.08 (medium resilience) and 3.26 (high resilience) on a scale of 1 to 5. The coastal ecosystem demonstrates the highest resilience while the mountain ecosystem shows the lowest resilience. Furthermore, spatial analysis of 36 villages in the ecological, physical, economic, social and institutional dimensions show that resilience levels vary from 2.57 (low resilience) to 3.51 (high resilience). On the whole, overall resilience levels in the 36 villages exhibit high levels in the social dimension and low levels in the economic dimension. By assessing the resilience of ecosystems as attempted in this study, a baseline is determined where entry points for adaptation actions that are responsive to prevailing ecosystem conditions can be identified, positive and negative factors addressed and gaps and opportunities acted upon to enhance the resilience of Infanta's ecosystems.","Ecosystem resilience; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Resilience analysis","Climate change; Disasters; Ecology; Economic analysis; Risk management; Rural areas; Surveys; Climate change adaptation; Coastal ecosystems; Disaster risk reductions; Ecosystem approach; Ecosystem resilience; Mountain ecosystems; Resilience analysis; Resource sustainability; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925004013

Optical investigations represent a powerful tool for getting a better understanding of the ongoing processes. For medium speed Diesel engines, optical investigations are relatively rare or not available. The ""Institut für Kolbenmaschinen"" (IFKM) and MAN Diesel & Turbo SE performed extensive optical in-situ investigations of the injection and combustion process of a MAN 32/44 CR single cylinder medium speed Diesel engine that provide previously unavailable insights into the ongoing processes. The optical investigations aimed on fuel spray visualization, high-speed soot luminescence measurement and two colour pyrometry applied for five combustion chamber regions. To apply the optical measurement techniques, two optical accesses were designed. Access no. 1 is placed near the cylinder liner. Access no. 2 is located close to the injector in a 46° angle to the cylinder vertical axis. An insert was used which consists of an illumination port and a visualization endoscope. Additionally some special nozzle designs were used beside the standard nozzle, which have one separated nozzle hole. This enables a simultaneous view from both optical accesses on the same flame cone. For Mie-Scattering investigation a pulsed Nd:YAG-Laser with 532 nm wavelength was used for illumination and a CCDcamera with an upstream 532 nm optical filter was used for visualization. This combination allows observing the liquid fuel distribution even after start of combustion. Penetration depth of liquid fuel spray was analysed for different swirl numbers, intake manifold pressures, injection timings and injection pressures. High-speed flame visualization was done by two CMOS cameras which were mounted at two different optical accesses with view on the same flame cone. Due to this application a simultaneous measurement of the flame distribution of two different views was possible. This enables a 3-dimensional investigation of the flame propagation process. In addition, the advanced two colour pyrometry was applied for five different regions of the same flame cone. Due to a calibration after each measurement the absolute radiant flux can be calculated and thus the absolute temperature and soot concentration. With this procedure it was possible to give a real temperature and soot concentration distribution of the flame cone. To provide more detailed information about the combustion process, selected engine operation points were simulated with a modified version of the CFD code KIVA3v-Release2 at the IFKM.

As a result there will probably be a substantial increase in the share of renewable (and dispersed) energy sources in final consumption and accelerated investment in renewable energy sources and their integration into the electric power system. The nominal power of distributed generation (DG) is relatively small and it is not concentrated in just one part of the network but throughout it. Due to their limited power, DG sources are connected to the distribution network. Their production depends on a number of factors and is difficult to predict. Inclusion of a large share of DG in the distribution network was not planned when the network was designed. As DG affects network operation, some difficulties may be expected. One of the first ones is most likely to be violation of the set limits because of the changes in network voltage. The paper is structured as follows. First, changes taking place in power network due to DG connection are described. To follow are a description of the impact of DG on the network voltage states and analytical determination of its impact on the voltage. Possible voltage control strategies with DG are shown by means of network simulations. The paper end by comparing losses incurred in different voltage-control regimes.","Distributed generation; Network losses; Voltage control; Voltage profile","Analytical determination; Control strategies; Energy source; European energy policy; Network loss; Network operations; Network simulation; Power networks; Power production; Renewable energy source; Voltage profile; Carbon dioxide; Distributed power generation; Electric power systems; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Investments; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Voltage control; Computer simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872388431

Early warning systems (EWS) are increasingly understood as an effective disaster risk reduction (DRR) mechanism that can support communities at-risk in minimizing the adverse effects of natural hazards upon their lives and livelihoods. Despite this insight, many EWS remain disjointed, ineffective and unsustainable since few have genuinely managed to address multiple community vulnerabilities and priorities, and to incorporate local hazard knowledge and skills with sustainable technology, financial and human resources. As climate-related hazards have increased in magnitude, frequency and severity in many parts of the world, so has the discourse on community EWS (CEWS) evolved. This extended abstract gives evidence as to why a CEWS is an essential element of DRR to build community resilience. It also presents arguments on why social capital and partnerships are important to consider when designing and implementing CEWS, and how CEWS fit within the integrative risk management framework.","Community; Early warning system; Partnership; Resilience; Social capital","Climate change; Disasters; Hazards; Risk management; Community; Early Warning System; Partnership; Resilience; Social capitals; Alarm systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924955826
