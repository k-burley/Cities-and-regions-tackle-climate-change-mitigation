There is a general consent that colours, and spectral features, most notably the 4000 Å break, can predict many properties of galaxies, including star formation rates and hence they could infer some of the line properties. We argue that these techniques have great prospects in helping us understand line emission in extragalactic objects and might speed up future galaxy redshift surveys if they are to target emission-line objects only. We use two independent methods, Artificial Neural Networks (based on the ANNz code) and Locally Weighted Regression (LWR), to retrieve correlations present in the colour N-dimensional space and to predict the equivalent widths present in the corresponding spectra. We also investigate how well it is possible to separate galaxies with and without lines from broad-band photometry only. We find, unsurprisingly, that recombination lines can be well predicted by galaxy colours. However, among collisional lines some can and some cannot be predicted well from galaxy colours alone, without any further redshift information. We also use our techniques to estimate how much information contained in spectral diagnostic diagrams can be recovered from broad-band photometry alone. We find that it is possible to classify active galactic nuclei and star formation objects relatively well using colours only. We suggest that this technique could be used to considerably improve redshift surveys such as the upcoming Fibre Multi Object Spectrograph (FMOS) survey and the planned Wide Field Multi Object Spectrograph (WFMOS) survey. © 2008 The Authors.","Galaxy: formation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249097329

Nanocrystalline compacts of pure and 26% NiO doped iron oxide were reduced at 800-1100 °C by solid carbon. The reduction behavior was investigated using advanced quadrupole mass spectrometer. XRD, SEM and TEM analysis were used to characterize the reduced samples. The aim of work is to clarify the reduction behavior of Fe2O3/NiO composite materials with solid carbon which is an important step for production of nanocrystalline Fe-Ni alloys. The influence of reduction conditions on the structural characteristics of the products was extensively studied to get clear comprehension of reduction process. It was found that the reduction rate increases with temperature. The experimental measurements were used to elucidate the carbothermic reduction mechanism of iron oxide doped with NiO. The reactions proceeded in a stepwise manner and Boudouard reaction is the major controlling step particularly at low temperatures whereas more contribution to solid state reaction control seems to have an effect at high temperatures. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

With its large field of view and long observation time, the Milagro Gamma Ray Observatory is an ideal instrument for surveying large regions of the northern hemisphere sky and for detecting diffuse 7-ray emission at very high energies. Here the spatial distribution and the flux of the diffuse γ-ray emission in the TeVenergy range with a median energy of 15 TeV for Galactic longitude between 30° and 110° and between 136° and 216° and for Galactic latitude between -10° and 10° are determined. The measured fluxes are consistent with predictions of the GALPROP model everywhere, except for the Cygnus region (l €[65°, 85°]). For the Cygnus region, the flux is twice the predicted value. This excess can be explained by the presence of active cosmic-ray sources accelerating hadrons, which interact with the local dense interstellar medium and produce gamma rays through pion decay. © 2008.

We compared two data sets that report power-plant CO 2 emissions in the conterminous U.S. for 2004, the most recent year reported in both data sets. The data sets were obtained from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the Environmental Protection Agency's eGRID database. Conterminous U.S. total emissions computed from the data sets differed by 3.5% for total plant emissions (electricity plus useful thermal output) and 2.3% for electricity generation only. These differences are well within previous estimates of uncertainty in annual U.S. fossil-fuel emissions. However, the corresponding average absolute differences between estimates of emissions from individual power plants were much larger, 16.9% and 25.3%, respectively. By statistical analysis, we identified several potential sources of differences between EIA and eGRID estimates for individual plants. Estimates that are based partly or entirely on monitoring of stack gases (reported by eGRID only) differed significantly from estimates based on fuel consumption (as reported by EIA). Differences in accounting methods appear to explain differences in estimates for emissions from electricity generation from combined heat and power plants, and for total and electricity generation emissions from plants that burn nonconventional fuels (e.g., biomass). Our analysis suggests the need for care in utilizing emissions data from individual power plants, and the need for transparency in documenting the accounting and monitoring methods used to estimate emissions.",,"Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide emissions; Data sets; Global warming; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; climate change; comparative study; data set; database; electricity generation; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; mitigation; pollution monitoring; power plant; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; air pollution; air pollution control; article; biomass; data base; electric power plant; electricity; statistical analysis; Air Pollutants; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Electric Power Supplies; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Hot Temperature; Incineration; Power Plants; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749102099

To gain insight into the processes underlying these observations, we have used molecular dynamics simulations, augmented with calculations of potentials of mean force, to investigate the stability of isolated host-guest complexes and the relationship between the dynamics of these complexes and the dynamics of a solvated host molecule. Thermal fluctuations of the calixarenes themselves are found to be consistent with proposed mechanisms for gas entry into the host cavities, while relative host-guest stabilities correlate well with experimental absorption-desorption isotherms in some cases (CO2 and CH 4) but not in others (C2H2). In these isolated systems, stable complexes characteristically form when the attractive interactions of the guest with the ring of negative charge density on the inner surface of the host cavity are not disrupted by thermal motion.

This paper characterizes fine particulate matter (PM2.5) aboard school buses as part of a larger study examining the respiratory health impacts of emission reducing retrofits. To assess onboard concentrations, continuous PM2.5 data were collected during 85 trips aboard 43 school buses during normal driving routines, and aboard hybrid lead vehicles traveling in front of the monitored buses during 46 trips. Ordinary and partial least squares regression models for PM2.5 onboard buses were created with and without control for roadway concentrations, which were also modeled. Predictors examined included ambient PM2.5 levels, ambient weather, and bus and route characteristics. Average concentrations aboard school buses (21 μg m-3) were four and two-times higher than ambient and roadway levels, respectively. Differences in PM2.5 levels between the buses and lead vehicles indicated an average of 7 μg m-3 originating from the bus's own emission sources. While roadway concentrations were dominated by ambient PM2.5, bus concentrations were influenced by bus age, diesel oxidative catalysts, and roadway concentrations. Cross-validation confirmed the roadway models but the bus models were less robust. These results confirm that children are exposed to air pollution from the bus and other roadway traffic while riding school buses. In-cabin air pollution is higher than roadway concentrations and is likely influenced by bus characteristics. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Diesel; Particulate matter; School buses; Traffic","Air pollution; Air quality; Curve fitting; Permanent magnets; Pollution; Regression analysis; Retrofitting; Air pollution exposures; Airborne particles; Ambient weathers; Average concentrations; Continuous; Cross-validation; Diesel; Emission sources; Fine particulate matters; Lead vehicles; Normal drivings; Oxidative catalysts; Partial least squares regressions; Particulate matter; Respiratory healths; Roadway models; School buses; Traffic; Washington states; Buses; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; automobile; concentration (composition); emission control; health impact; particulate matter; pollution exposure; prediction; traffic emission; air pollution; airborne particle; article; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; particulate matter; priority journal; North America; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049088882

This study aims to calculate the unit costs of carbon sequestration programs through afforestation in Korea and examine the cost-effectiveness of programs. The basis of our simulation is an econometric land use share model, and province level of aggregated panel data are used for model estimation. Four scenarios are considered depending on whether the program includes the harvest and which tree species are planted. The approach of sequestration program is to pay the landowners to convert their lands to forest for a period of time in exchange of fixed annual payment in addition to tree establishment cost.

In this work, the separation performance of membranes producing NEA is simulated and experimentally validated. Retentate nitrogen concentration and stage-cut depend on the membrane properties oxygen-nitrogen selectivity, oxygen permeance and membrane area as well as on the operating parameters, feed pressure, permeate pressure and feed flow rate. This complex dependence is presented using correlations of dimensionless numbers for retentate oxygen mole fractions between 16 and 21 mol%. It is herewith possible to calculate membrane area and compression power loss for any given membrane at any engine load point. The correlations also serve to identify the most suitable membrane and operating parameters when having to meet design criteria, e.g. limited construction space or maximum power loss. In a design example, both membrane area and power demand are calculated for three state-of-the-art membranes at a number of characteristic load points of a medium-duty diesel truck engine. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Due to high emissions, the city of Rijeka was one of the most polluted in Croatia in the mid-1980s. Considerable reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions led to lower airborne levels of these pollutants in the mid 1990s. In spite of the coke plant closure in 1994, there was only a weak decline in airborne ammonia over the period 1980-2005, with annual means in the range of 12-20 μg m-3 at urban Site 1 and 6-28 μg m-3 at suburban Site 2. Similar behaviour has been observed with ammonium in bulk rainwater samples since 1996. Higher and approximately equal deposition of nitrogen as ammonium (N-NH4+) were obtained for the urban Site 1 and the mountainous Site 4, but with different causative facts.

Many of them have been developed in connection to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) that backs the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the end of 1990s, IGBP sponsored release of a data set summarizing the model outputs and setting certain norms for estimates of terrestrial productivity. Since a number of new models and new versions of old models were developed during the past decade, these normative data require updating. Results: Here, we provide the series of updates that reflects evolution of biosphere models and demonstrates evolutional stability of the global and regional estimates of terrestrial productivity. Most of them fit well the long-living Miami model. At the same time we call attention to the emerging alternative: the global potential for net primary production of biomass may be as high as 70 PgC y-1, the productivity of larch forest zone may be comparable to the productivity of taiga zone, and the productivity of rain-green forest zone may be comparable to the productivity of tropical rainforest zone. Conclusion: The departure from Miami model's worldview mentioned above cannot be simply ignored. It requires thorough examination using modern observational tools and techniques for model-data fusion. Stability of normative knowledge is not its ultimate goal - the norms for estimates of terrestrial productivity must be evidence-based. © 2008 Alexandrov and Matsunaga; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Larix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62749112908

Four cities have developed around the complex. The metropolitan region of São Paulo is located on a plateau above the scarp. The combination of the region's topography, the industrial installations, and an intensely trafficked road network causes widespread atmospheric pollution. In November 2004, measurements were made of the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons designated as priority pollutants by the US Environmental Protection Agency, as well as of aerosol mass and ionic composition. Use of characteristic concentration ratios for emission sources show that tailpipe emissions from diesel vehicles was the main source of the compounds. This means that a shift from gasoline to ethanol as fuel in spark ignition engines will have only minor influence on atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations, despite very low emissions during ethanol combustion. On the other hand, reduction in emissions associated with increasing use of biodiesel in compression ignition engine fuel mixtures could significantly reduce atmospheric concentrations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the fraction of sky irradiance which is diffuse (fDIF) is close to half as a global annual average, owing mainly to the presence of clouds. Furthermore, as a consequence of human-induced perturbations, the occurrence and opacity of cloud is changing both regionally (due to deforestation and drainage) and globally (shortwave ""solar"" dimming). In this study, we quantify the impact of cloud on carbon assimilation at an unprecedented number of FLUXNET sites (38) and for six plant functional types (PFTs). We compare results from previously established empirical and statistical methods with novel land-surface and three-dimensional (3D) radiative-transfer (RT) simulations that take explicit account of diffuse sunlight. We record a much lower enhancement in canopy light-use efficiency (LUE) under diffuse sunlight relative to direct sunlight (factor 1.12-1.80) compared to previous authors (factors 2-3). Increased radiation-sharing, due to varied leaf orientation within the canopy, is the primary cause of LUE-enhancement rather than beam penetration within an open crown structure. Under cloud, we consistently record a decrease in primary productivity (≥10-40%) and an unequivocal decline in daily carbon sequestration (60-80%), owing to the dramatic reduction in total (direct plus diffuse) irradiance that occurs when clouds obscure the solar disk (≥60% attenuation). A cooling-induced reduction in ecosystem respiration offsets the decline in primary productivity by about one third. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A part of this organic matter remains in the wetland, and is degraded at different rates during the rest of the year. In this study, Municipal wastewater, pretreated in a septic tank and stabilization lagoon, was treated by two surface-flow wetlands. Both wetlands were planted with Typha latifolia with one of the wetlands harvested. Organic matter concentration and nutrients in both harvested and nonharvested wetlands were analyzed from December 2004 until August 2005 (272 days). TKN, NH4, and TP concentrations were always lower in the effluent of the harvested wetland, indicating nitrogen and phosphorus release by decomposition of vegetation, in the nonharvested system. In addition, harvesting reduced the effluent total suspended solids (TSS) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) concentrations by 37.3 and 49.2%, respectively, when compared to the nonharvested wetland in spring. Seasonal background concentrations (C*) in the wetlands, increased from winter to spring and decreased again in summer. Organic load and nutrients produced per gram of Typha were evaluated by using in situ Typha degradation experiments.

These characteristics are of major interest when analytes are in trace concentration, and are present in complex mixtures, as is the case of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in atmospheric particulate samples. Whilst GC × GC has been widely applied to identification of different types of analytes in several matrices, less seldom has it been used for quantification of these analytes. Although several quantitative methods have been proposed, they may be tedious and/or require considerable user development. Whereas quantification in 1D-GC is a routine and well-established procedure, in GC × GC, it is not so straightforward, especially where novel or untested procedures have yet to be incorporated into software packages. In the present study, it is proposed that a subset of the modulated peaks generated for each solute may be summed, based on the specific target ion mass of each compound present in a certified standard reference material (SRM) 1649a (urban dust). The ratio between a PAH and its corresponding deuterated (PAH-d) form showed that there is no statistical loss of sensitivity when this ratio is calculated based on whether the total sum of modulated peaks, or if only the two or the three most intense modulated peaks, are employed. Manual integration may be required, and here was found to give more acceptable values than automatic integration. Automated integration has been shown here to underestimate the modulated peak responses when low concentrations of PAHs were analyzed.

The C sequestration potential of reforested mined land is not well known. The purpose of this work was to estimate and compare the ecosystem C content in forests established on surface, coal-mined and non-mined land. We used existing tree, litter, and soil C data for fourteen mined and eight adjacent, non-mined forests in the Midwestern and Appalachian coalfields to determine the C sequestration potential of mined land reclaimed prior to the passage of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (1977). We developed statistically significant and biologically reasonable models for ecosystem C across the spectrum of site quality and stand age. On average, the highest amount of ecosystem C on mined land was sequestered in pine stands (148 Mg ha-1), followed by hardwood (130 Mg ha-1) and mixed stands (118 Mg ha-1). Non-mined hardwood stands sequestered 210 Mg C ha-1, which was about 62% higher than the average of all mined stands. Our mined land response surface models of C sequestration as a function of site quality and age explained 59, 39, and 36% of the variation of ecosystem C in mixed, pine, and hardwood stands, respectively. In pine and mixed stands, ecosystem C increased exponentially with the increase of site quality, but decreased with age. In mined hardwood stands, ecosystem C increased asymptotically with age, but it was not affected by site quality. At rotation age (60 yr), ecosystem C in mined hardwood stands was less on high quality sites, but similar for low quality sites compared to non-mined hardwood stands. The overall results indicated that the higher the original forest site quality, the less likely C sequestration potential was restored, and the greater the disparity between pre- and post-mining C sequestration stocks. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemistry of C; Coal mining; Forest productivity; Mine soils; Site quality; Soil organic carbon","Accreditation; Biochemistry; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Coal; Coal deposits; Ecology; Ecosystems; Emission control; Fire hazards; Forestry; Hardwoods; Land reclamation; Magnesium printing plates; Network protocols; Organic carbon; Soils; Trees (mathematics); Atmospheric CO; C sequestrations; Carbon sequestrations; Coal mining; Coalfields; Forest development projects; Forest productivity; Forest sites; GREAT-ER; Hardwood stands; High qualities; Kyoto protocols; Low qualities; Mine soils; Response surface models; Site qualities; Site quality; Stand ages; Surface mining controls; Mining; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; coal mine; comparative study; coniferous forest; forestry production; Kyoto Protocol; leaf litter; mixed forest; reclaimed land; reforestation; restoration ecology; soil carbon; soil organic matter; Biochemistry; Carbon; Coal; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Hardwoods; Magnesium; Mining; Plates; Printing; Soil; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54449099589

The mine is operated by Gold Fields Ghana. This large, low-grade, open pit, gold mining operation is located in Tarkwa, in the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 320 kilometres by road, west of Accra, the capital of Ghana, West Africa. In the Financial year ended June 2007, the operation mined a total of 108 million tons of which 22 million tons was ore. The mined ore is processed through three gyratory crushers supplying two heap leach pads (north and south) and a carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant Before the 6 Sigma project commenced, the current fragmentation was resulting in sub-optimal feed size to these crushers. It was decided to use 6 Sigma methodology to improve the fragmentation. A defect was defined as a fragmentation analysis indicating less than 95% passing 750 mm. The objective was to improve fragmentation in order to achieve a constant throughput to the north heap leach crusher of 1500 t/h, a 5% increase in pit loading efficiency and a 50% decrease in rock breaker hours, equipment damage costs and in-pit sheering costs respectively. However, this was not to be achieved at the expense of grade control as Tarkwa is exploiting a low grade, high volume deposit and therefore ore dilution must be kept to a minimum. This paper is intended to take the reader through the various 6 Sigma phases of the project (define-measure-analyse -improve-control), which have resulted in a 10% reduction in loading times, of which half has been attributed to improved fragmentation, as well as a substantial increase in blasted stocks. The focus has been on both drilling and blasting parameters as both processes had to be taken into account These parameters are technical but personnel factors were also identified and dealt with as they arose. In order to measure the impact of any change in the process parameters on the fragmentation size distribution, cameras have been acquired. One has been installed looking into the bowl of the north crusher and the other one was dedicated to field observation, of individual blasts. Both are used for ongoing fragmentation analysis. At Tarkwa, mining efficiency is strongly dependent on good fragmentation as well as the presence of unblasted 'toes' on the pit floors. Crusher throughput depends on an acceptable ore fragment size. Compliance with plan for actual hole depths was temporarily monitored by manual hole dipping, but this is now being replaced with a fully automated drill data management system developed by Sandvik and Modular Mining. The Six Sigma methodologies, using control charts based on data collected in the field, allowed the mine to improve methods for the control of blasted material. It also enforced the implementation of a quality control programme encompassing the entire drill and blast process. © The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2008.",,"A carbons; Blast fragmentations; Blasting parameters; Control charts; Data Management systems; Equipment damages; Field observations; Financial years; Fragment sizes; Fragmentation sizes; Gold minings; Gyratory crushers; Heap leach pads; Heap leaches; Hole depths; Loading efficiencies; Loading times; Low grades; Million tons; Open pits; Optimal feeds; Process parameters; Sandvik; Sigma phases; Crushers; Customer satisfaction; Drills; Gas emissions; Gold; Gold mines; Leaching; Management information systems; Mines; Mining; Mining machinery; Ores; Quality assurance; Quality control; Quality function deployment; Total quality management; Work simplification; Open pit mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149296251

A comparative treatment planning study has been performed between carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and photon radiotherapy [three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)] to assess the potential improvements and limitations that could result for locally advanced, nonresectable head and neck tumors. Materials and methods. Seven patients, originally treated with CIRT, were randomly selected for the comparative study. The evaluations analyzed using dose-volume histogram parameters, conformity index, inhomogeneity coefficient, and dose to the organs at risk (OARs). Results. The mean conformity index was 1.46, 1.43, and 1.22 for 3D-CRT, IMRT, and CIRT, respectively. The mean inhomogeneity coefficient was 0.05, 0.07, and 0.02 for 3D-CRT, IMRT, and CIRT respectively. Photon plans resulted in greater volumes of normal tissues at 10% to 95% isodose levels compared with the corresponding carbon ion plans where the volumes increased by a factor of 1.2 to 2.7 for 3D-CRT and 1.2 to 2.0 for IMRT. Conclusion. CIRT has the potential to improve the target dose conformity, inhomogeneity coefficient, and OAR sparing when compared with 3D-CRT and IMRT. Compared with 3D-CRT, normal tissue exposure was reduced mainly in the mid-to low-isodose levels using IMRT. Additional improvement was obtained using CIRT. © 2008 Japan Radiological Society.","Carbon ion radiotherapy; Comparative study; Dose distribution; Intensity-modulated radiotherapy; Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy","advanced cancer; article; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; comparative study; computer assisted radiotherapy; controlled study; head and neck cancer; histogram; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; ion therapy; photon therapy; radiation dose distribution; treatment planning; Carbon Radioisotopes; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Photons; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Conformal; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349095583

CboFDH is highly specific to NAD+ and virtually fails to catalyze the reaction with NADP+. Based on structural information for CboFDH, the loop region between β-sheet 7 and α-helix 10 in the dinucleotide-binding fold was predicted as a principal determinant of coenzyme specificity. Sequence alignment with other formate dehydrogenases revealed two residues (Asp195 and Tyr196) that could account for the observed coenzyme specificity. Positions 195 and 196 were subjected to two rounds of site-saturation mutagenesis and screening and enabled the identification of a double mutant Asp195Gln/Tyr196His, which showed a more than 2 × 107-fold improvement in overall catalytic efficiency with NADP+ and a more than 900-fold decrease in the efficiency with NAD+ as cofactors. The results demonstrate that the combined polar interactions and steric factors comprise the main structural determinants responsible for coenzyme specificity. The double mutant Asp195Gln/Tyr196His was tested for practical applicability in a cofactor recycling system composed of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Bacillus subtilis, (CYP102A2), NADP +, formic acid and ω-(p-nitrophenyl)dodecanoic acid (12-pNCA). Using a 1250-fold excess of 12-pNCA over NADP+ the first order rate constant was determined to be equal to kobs = 0.059 ± 0.004 min-1. © 2008 The Authors.","Coenzyme; Coenzyme specificity; Enzyme redesign; Formate dehydrogenase; Saturation mutagenesis","cytochrome P450; formate dehydrogenase; formic acid; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; unspecific monooxygenase; article; Bacillus subtilis; Candida boidinii; coenzyme; controlled study; enzyme specificity; enzyme structure; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein interaction; sequence alignment; site directed mutagenesis; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Candida; Chromatography, Affinity; Coenzymes; DNA Primers; Formate Dehydrogenases; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; NADP; Protein Conformation; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity; Bacillus subtilis; Candida boidinii; Kobus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249114525

Several emission scenarios for the year 2010 were also considered. The model results suggest that the emission reductions of ozone precursors should have been effective to reduce ozone production between 1985 and 2000 in northern Switzerland. However, observations do not indicate any significant change in surface ozone levels since early 1990s, except in the region of Zurich where there is a small negative trend. On the other hand, the model predictions match very well the spatial variability of the trends but the calculated trends are around 0.5 ppb year-1 lower than those observed. This difference is similar to the background ozone increase as suggested by the long-term observations at the high Alpine station Jungfraujoch. These results support the hypothesis that the decrease in local ozone production due to emission reductions might have been partly or completely compensated by the simultaneous increase in the background ozone. In 2010, a strict application of the Gothenburg Protocol in Europe would lead to a decrease in peak ozone concentrations by about 5% in Switzerland under the meteorological conditions applied. Our calculations also indicated that emission controls only in Switzerland would not be very effective to improve the air quality in the future.

Program OPEN (Odor, Pathogens, and Emissions of Nitrogen), funded by the North Carolina State University Animal and Poultry Waste Management Center (APWMC), was initiated and charged with the evaluation of potential environmentally superior technologies (ESTs) that have been developed and implemented at selected swine farms or facilities. The OPEN program has demonstrated the effectiveness of a new paradigm for policy-relevant environmental research related to North Carolina's animal waste management programs. This new paradigm is based on a commitment to improve scientific understanding associated with a wide array of environmental issues (i.e., issues related to the movement of N from animal waste into air, water, and soil media; the transmission of odor and odorants; disease-transmitting vectors; and airborne pathogens). The primary focus of this paper is on emissions of ammonia (NH3) from some potential ESTs that were being evaluated at full-scale swine facilities. During 2-week-long periods in two different seasons (warm and cold), NH3 fluxes from water-holding structures and NH3 emissions from animal houses or barns were measured at six potential EST sites: (1) Barham farm - in-ground ambient temperature anaerobic digester/energy recovery/ greenhouse vegetable production system; (2) BOC #93 farm - upflow biofiltration system - EKOKAN; (3) Carrolls farm - aerobic blanket system - ISSUES-ABS; (4) Corbett #1 farm - solids separation/ gasification for energy and ash recovery centralized system - BEST; (5) Corbett #2 farm - solid separation/ reciprocating water technology - ReCip; and (6) Vestal farm - Recycling of Nutrient, Energy and Water System - ISSUES-RENEW. The ESTs were compared with similar measurements made at two conventional lagoon and spray technology (LST) farms (Moore farm and Stokes farm). A flow-through dynamic chamber system and two sets of open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometers measured NH3 fluxes continuously from water-holding structures and emissions from housing units at the EST and conventional LST sites. A statistical-observational model for lagoon NH3 flux was developed using a multiple linear regression analysis of 15-min averaged NH3 flux data against the relevant environmental parameters measured at the two conventional farms during two different seasons of the year. This was used to compare the water-holding structures at ESTs with those from lagoons at conventional sites under similar environmental conditions. Percentage reductions in NH3 emissions from different components of each potential EST, as well as the whole farm on which the EST was located were evaluated from the estimated emissions from water-holding structures, barns, etc., all normalized by the appropriate nitrogen excretion rate at the potential EST farm, as well as from the appropriate conventional farm. This study showed that ammonia emissions were reduced by all but one potential EST for both experimental periods. However, on the basis of our evaluation results and analysis and available information in the scientific literature, the evaluated alternative technologies may require additional technical modifications to be qualified as unconditional ESTs relative to NH3 emissions reductions.

The used samples were made of thin films electrodeposited on gold substrate. The results from the present work, from our previous studies and from literature were compiled in order to establish a general scheme for the formation and transformation pathways involving carbonate or sulphate green rusts. Depending on experimental conditions, two routes of redox transformations occur. The first one corresponds to reaction via solution and leads to the formation of ferric products such as goethite or lepidocrocite (oxidation) or to the release of FeII ions into the solution (reduction) with soluble FeII-FeIII complexes acting as intermediate species. The second way is solid-state reaction that involve conversion of lattice Fe2+ into Fe3+ and deprotonation of OH groups in octahedra sheets (solid-state oxidation) or conversion of lattice Fe3+ into Fe2+ and protonation of OH groups (solid-state reduction). The solid-state oxidation implies the complete transformation of GR(CO3) or GR(SO4) to ferric oxyhydroxycarbonate exGRc-Fe(III) or ferric oxyhydroxysulphate exGRs-Fe(III), for which the following formulas can be proposed, FeIII6(OH)(12-2y)(O)(2+y)(H2O)(y)(CO3) or FeIII6(OH)(12-2z)(O)(2+z)(H2O)(6+z)(SO4) with 0 ≤ y or z ≤ 2.

In tempered-cold arid regions with a generous solar resource, adequate design and technology can substantially reduce the energy demand for space and water heating in urban buildings. This study assessed the solar potential of low-density urban environments in the city of Mendoza, Argentina. The results of the study will be used to develop technical guidelines for urban and energy planning agencies and professionals involved in the production of habitat. The study included the following successive steps: (i) selection of a representative sample of analysis units (city blocks); (ii) selection of a series of urban and building variables; (iii) definition of indicators accounting for solar masking, building's potential use of the solar radiation on the whole urban area, and availability of adequate collecting areas to satisfy high percentages of the energy demand in low-density urban environments; and (iv) insolation of potential collectors simulated by a graphic-computational model developed in the R+D unit. Only the results for solar space heating are presented in this paper. The results, direct and statistical, indicate that it is technically feasible to meet the target solar fractions. At the same time, by means of the solar recycling of existing building stocks, it is possible to considerably reduce the environmental impacts due to the extraction of materials from, and the disposal of solid wastes into, the ecosystem. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This survey covers the central 2° x 1:4° (∼280 x 200 pc) of the Galaxy. At 3.6 and 4.5 μm the emission is dominated by stellar sources, the fainter ones merging into an unresolved background. At 5.8 and 8 μm the stellar sources are fainter, and large-scale diffuse emission from the ISM of the Galaxy's central molecular zone becomes prominent. The survey reveals that the 8-to-5.8 μm color of the ISM emission is highly uniform across the surveyed region. This uniform color is consistent with a flat extinction law and emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Models indicate that this broadband color should not be expected to change if the incident radiation field heating the dust and PAHs is &lt;104 times that of the solar neighborhood. The few regions with unusually red emission are areas where the PAHs are underabundant and the radiation field is locally strong enough to heat large dust grains to produce significant 8 μm emission.

Their ability to form the scientific basis for environmental management decisions can be undermined by the underlying structural and parametric uncertainty. In this study, we outline how we can attain realistic predictive links between management actions and ecosystem response through a probabilistic framework that accommodates rigorous uncertainty analysis of a variety of error sources, i.e., measurement error, parameter uncertainty, discrepancy between model and natural system. Because model uncertainty analysis essentially aims to quantify the joint probability distribution of model parameters and to make inference about this distribution, we believe that the iterative nature of Bayes' Theorem is a logical means to incorporate existing knowledge and update the joint distribution as new information becomes available. The statistical methodology begins with the characterization of parameter uncertainty in the form of probability distributions, then water quality data are used to update the distributions, and yield posterior parameter estimates along with predictive uncertainty bounds. Our illustration is based on a six state variable (nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic nitrogen, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and bacteria) ecological model developed for gaining insight into the mechanisms that drive plankton dynamics in a coastal embayment; the Gulf of Gera, Island of Lesvos, Greece. The lack of analytical expressions for the posterior parameter distributions was overcome using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations; a convenient way to obtain representative samples of parameter values. The Bayesian calibration resulted in realistic reproduction of the key temporal patterns of the system, offered insights into the degree of information the data contain about model inputs, and also allowed the quantification of the dependence structure among the parameter estimates. Finally, our study uses two synthetic datasets to examine the ability of the updated model to provide estimates of predictive uncertainty for water quality variables of environmental management interest. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To provide a starting point for a more systematic discussion we review here global isoprene and monoterpene emission estimates to-date. We note a surprisingly small variation in the predictions of global isoprene emission rate that is in stark contrast with our lack of process understanding and the small number of observations for model parameterisation and evaluation. Most of the models are based on similar emission algorithms, using fixed values for the emission capacity of various plant functional types. In some cases, these values are very similar but differ substantially in other models. The similarities with regard to the global isoprene emission rate would suggest that the dominant parameters driving the ultimate global estimate, and thus the dominant determinant of model sensitivity, are the specific emission algorithm and isoprene emission capacity. But the models also differ broadly with regard to their representation of net primary productivity, method of biome coverage determination and climate data. Contrary to isoprene, monoterpene estimates show significantly larger model-to-model variation although variation in terms of leaf algorithm, emission capacities, the way of model upscaling, vegetation cover or climatology used in terpene models are comparable to those used for isoprene. From our summary of published studies there appears to be no evidence that the terrestrial modelling community has been any more successful in ""resolving unknowns"" in the mechanisms that control global isoprene emissions, compared to global monoterpene emissions. Rather, the proliferation of common parameterization schemes within a large variety of model platforms lends the illusion of convergence towards a common estimate of global isoprene emissions. This convergence might be used to provide optimism that the community has reached the ""relief phase"", the phase when sufficient process understanding and data for evaluation allows models' projections to converge, when applying a recently proposed concept. We argue that there is no basis for this apparent relief phase. Rather, we urge modellers to be bolder in their analysis, and to draw attention to the fact that terrestrial emissions, particularly in the area of biome-specific emission capacities, are unknown rather than uncertain.",,"atmospheric modeling; biogenic emission; global climate; isoprene; net primary production; oxidation; parameterization; vegetation cover; volatile organic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549092952

Residual feed intake (RFI) is a measure of feed efficiency, and is defined as the difference between an animal's actual feed intake and its expected feed intake based on its size and growth. It is independent of the level of production, and the lower the value the more efficient the animal is. This paper examines the current state of knowledge on RFI. Available information indicates that postweaning RFI is moderately heritable, and that selection for low RFI will result in progeny that consume less feed for the same level of production as progeny of high RFI cattle. Under ad libitum feeding, RFI is phenotypically independent of growth traits. There is a weak genetic relationship between RFI and fatness but additional studies are needed to assess the magnitude of this relationship in different breeds, sexes, ages and feeding regimes. Residual feed intake is believed to represent inherent variation in basic metabolic processes which determine efficiency. Economic analyses of genetic improvement schemes that incorporate testing of individuals for RFI have yielded substantial economic benefits over and above existing schemes that do not include RFI testing. Selection for low RFI has an additional benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by cattle. © 2008 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.","Cattle; Feed efficiency; Growth; Residual feed intake",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904333941

In terms of productivity - defined as barrel per day of FT product per ton of reactor mass - microchannel FT reactors far outstrip their conventional cousins. They are able to dissipate the heat produced from the exothermic FT reaction much more quickly than conventional systems. This makes them ideally suited for carrying out both highly exothermic catalytic reactions, such as FT synthesis, and highly endothermic reactions, such as methane reforming. From both the environmental and commercial perspective, existing BTL processes are not suitable for the production of second-generation biofuels. However, by working closely together to optimize and intensify the FT process, catalyst developers, and microreactor designers could ensure that the distributed production of second-generation biofuels becomes both a viable economic reality and a practical way to reduce carbon emissions, much sooner.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349142690

The latest version of MC1 was run on both VINCERA and VEMAP climate and soil input data to document how a change in the inputs can affect model outcome. We compared simulation results under the two sets of future climate scenarios and reported on how the different inputs can affect vegetation distribution and carbon budget projections. Under all future scenarios, the interior West becomes woodier as warmer temperatures and available moisture allow trees to get established in grasslands areas. Concurrently, warmer and drier weather causes the eastern deciduous and mixed forests to shift to a more open canopy woodland or savanna type while boreal forests disappear almost entirely from the Great Lakes area by the end of the 21st century. While under VEMAP scenarios the model simulated large increases in carbon storage in a future woodier West, the drier VINCERA scenarios accounted for large carbon losses in the east and only moderate gains in the West. But under all future climate scenarios, the total area burned by wildfires increased especially in C4 grasslands under all scenarios and in dry woodlands under VINCERA scenarios. The model simulated non-agricultural lands in the conterminous United States as a source of carbon in the 21st century under the VINCERA future climate scenarios but not VEMAP. However, the magnitude of this carbon source to the atmosphere could be greatly reduced if the CO2 growth enhancement factor built in the model was enhanced but evidence that all mature forests across the entire country will respond positively to increased atmospheric CO2 is still lacking. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.","biomass; carbon budget; Ecosystem modeling; fire; MC1; NPP; USA","boreal forest; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; comparative study; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem response; grassland; growth rate; sensitivity analysis; succession; twenty first century",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549110041

Reliable characterization of the magnitude and the dynamics of the THC fluxes from high latitude peatlands are important when considering to what extent trace gas emissions from such ecosystems may change and feed back on climate regulation as a result of warmer climate and melting permafrost. High frequency measurements of THC and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were conducted during four sequential growing seasons in three localities representing the trophic range of plant communities at the mire. The magnitude of the THC flux followed the moisture gradient with increasing emissions from a dry Paisa site (2.2 ± 0.1 mgC m-2 d -1), to a wet intermediate melt feature with Sphagnum spp. (28 ± 0.3 mgC m-2 d-1) and highest emissions from a wet Eriophorum spp. site (122 ± 1.4 mgC m-2 d-1) (overall mean±l SE, n = 2254,2231 and 2137).

Michigan Avenue, Kalamazoo, MI 49008-5343, United States","The recent quest to replace fossil fuels with renewable and sustainable energy sources has increased interest on utilization of landfill and bio gases. It is further augmented due to environment concerns and global warming caused by burning of conventional fossil fuels, energy security concerns and high cost of crude oil, and renewable nature of these gases. The main portion of landfill gas or biogas is comprised of methane and carbon dioxide with some other gases in small proportions. Methane if released directly to the atmosphere causes about 21 times global warming effects than carbon dioxide. Thus landfill gas is generally flared, where the energy recovery is not in place in practice. Using landfill gas to generate energy not only encourages more efficient collection reducing emissions into the atmosphere but also generates revenues for operators and local governments. However, use of landfill gases for energy production is not always perceived as an attractive option because of some disadvantages. Thus it becomes necessary to address these disadvantages involved by studying landfill gases in a technological perspective and motivate utilization of landfill gas for future energy needs. This paper discussed landfill gas as a fuel for a spark ignition engine to produce power in an effective way. It has been shown that though the performance and combustion characteristics of the landfill gas fueled engine deteriorated in comparison with methane operation, increasing compression ratio and advancing spark timing improved the performance of the landfill gas operation in par with methane operation. The effects due to composition changes in the landfill gas were found more pronounced at lean and rich mixture operation than at stoichiometry. In addition, the effects of additions of hydrogen up to 30% in the landfill gas were studied. Addition of even small quantities of hydrogen such as 3-5% delivered better performance improvement particularly at the lean and rich limit operations and extended the operational limits. Additions of hydrogen also improved the combustion characteristics and reduced cyclic variations of landfill gas operations especially at the lean and rich mixtures. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Contaminated particles carried from urban surfaces are deposited in infiltration ponds. This gives rise to a highly organic (11% DW) contaminated sedimentary layer (Zn:1.2 mg/g, Cd:15 mg/kg) that could threaten groundwater quality. During infiltration, particle arrangement impacts infiltrating water and sediment exchanges. In this context, understanding particle arrangement and leachable components is essential. This study investigates Organic Matter (OM) not only as a pollutant but also as a substrate and a structuring element. The leachable fraction was collected and grain size fractionation was performed. OM of sediments and isolated fractions were characterized by measuring organic carbon content, isolating aromatic hydrocarbons, saturated hydrocarbons and polar compounds after dichloromethane extraction, and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) molecular analyses. The organic compounds observed were petroleum byproducts (steranes and terpanes, unresolved complex mixture (UCM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)), but plant and bacteria biomarkers were also found (phytol and derivatives, sterols). Leachable OM consisted of 6% of sediment OM (associated with particles > 0.45 μm). This leachable OM is easily extractable by dichloromethane (96%) and contains fewer macromolecules than other fractions. Isolated grain size fractions showed dissimilarities (total organic carbon from 3.5 mg/g to 88.6 mg/g, extraction rate from 24 to 96%, aromatic hydrocarbon distribution) and similarities (proportions of aromatic and saturated hydrocarbons and polar compounds, molecular distribution of saturated hydrocarbons and polar compounds). The results suggest that organic macromolecules take part in the aggregation of sediments and prevent fine particles (< 10 μm) from being leached. On the other hand, leachable particles (20 μm grain size mode) could carry low molecular weight organic molecules. The physical structure of the sediments and the leaching of particles containing contaminants are considerably affected by the presence of OM. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Two indicators measure whether and how fast countries have committed to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol (KP). Three additional indicators quantify whether and how effectively measures have been implemented in line with these agreements. These three measures are reporting, financial contributions, and development of per capita CO2 emissions in relation to the per capita gross domestic product of each country. Results show that developed countries with emission targets under the KP ratified the protocol more often and faster, submitted their report timelier, and paid their annual financial contributions to the UNFCCC secretariat more regularly than the other countries. However, concerning CO2 emissions, developing countries are evaluated more positively than developed countries. The five indicators are aggregated to a 'Cooperation Index' that evaluates 198 countries' cooperative behavior within the international climate regime on a scale between 0 (=least cooperative) and 6 (=most cooperative). According to this Cooperation Index, the following large countries are ranked after their level of cooperation in ascending order: United States of America, Australia, Russia, Canada, Brazil, China, India, South Africa, and large European countries. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated; (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state; (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity according to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In December 2002 and January 2003 we studied the effect of entrainment of WDW on the fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in Weddell Sea surface waters. Ultimately the fCO2 difference across the sea surface drives air-sea fluxes of CO2. Deep CTD sections and surface transects of fCO2 were made along the Prime Meridian, a northwest-southeast section, and along 17° E to 23° E during cruise ANT XX/2 on FS Polarstern. Upward movement and entrainment of WDW into the winter mixed layer had significantly increased DIC and fCO2 below the sea ice along 0° W and 17° E to 23° E, notably in the southern Weddell Gyre. Nonetheless, the ice cover largely prevented outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere. During and upon melting of the ice, biological activity rapidly reduced surface water fCO2 by up to 100 μatm, thus creating a sink for atmospheric CO2. Despite the tendency of the surfacing WDW to cause CO 2 supersaturation, the Weddell Gyre may well be a CO2 sink on an annual basis due to this effective mechanism involving ice cover and ensuing biological fCO2 reduction. Dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in melting sea ice may play a minor role in this rapid reduction of surface water fCO2.",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; bioactivity; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; circumpolar current; dissolution; gyre; ice cover; melting; reduction; sea ice; supersaturation; surface water; Southern Ocean; Weddell Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349101685

In industrialized and developing countries, motor vehicle emissions are major contributors to urban air quality. Hydrogen is one of the clean fuel options for reducing motor vehicle emissions. Hydrogen is not an energy source. It is not a primary energy existing freely in nature. Hydrogen is a secondary form of energy that has to be manufactured like electricity. It is an energy carrier. Hydrogen has a strategic importance in the pursuit of a low-emission, environment-benign, cleaner and more sustainable energy system. Combustion product of hydrogen is clean, which consists of water and a little amount of nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen has very special properties as a transportation fuel, including a rapid burning speed, a high effective octane number, and no toxicity or ozone-forming potential. It has much wider limits of flammability in air than methane and gasoline. Hydrogen has become the dominant transport fuel, and is produced centrally from a mixture of clean coal and fossil fuels (with C-sequestration), nuclear power, and large-scale renewables. Large-scale hydrogen production is probable on the longer time scale. In the current and medium term the production options for hydrogen are first based on distributed hydrogen production from electrolysis of water and reforming of natural gas and coal. Each of centralized hydrogen production methods scenarios could produce 40 million tons per year of hydrogen. Hydrogen production using steam reforming of methane is the most economical method among the current commercial processes. In this method, natural gas feedstock costs generally contribute approximately 52-68% to the final hydrogen price for larger plants, and 40% for smaller plants, with remaining expenses composed of capital charges. The hydrogen production cost from natural gas via steam reforming of methane varies from about 1.25 US$/kg for large systems to about 3.50 US$/kg for small systems with a natural gas price of 6 US$/GJ. Hydrogen is cheap by using solar energy or by water electrolysis where electricity is cheap, etc. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Environmental benefits; Hydrogen; Hydrogen economy; Transportation fuel","Air pollution; Air quality; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal gas; Coal transportation; Developing countries; Electrochemistry; Electrolysis; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas fuel manufacture; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gas producers; Gases; Health; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Leakage (fluid); Liquid fuels; Methane; Motors; Natural gas; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Nonmetals; Oxygen; Ozone; Petroleum products; Raw materials; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Steam engineering; Vehicles; Burning speed; C-sequestration; Clean coal; Clean fuels; Dominant transport; Energy carriers; Energy sourcing; Environmental benefits; Hydrogen economy; Large systems; Medium term; Million tons; Motor vehicle emissions; Natural gas feedstocks; Natural gas pricing; Nuclear power; Octane numbers; Ozone-forming potential; Primary energies; Production costs; Production methods; Public health; Renewables; Small systems; Special properties; Steam reforming of methane; Sustainable energy; Time scaling; Transportation fuel; Transportation fuels; Transportation problems; Urban air quality; Water electrolysis; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50349093805

A study was designed to assess traffic emissions impacts on air quality and particle toxicity near a heavily traveled highway. In an attempt to describe the complex mixture of pollutants and atmospheric transport mechanisms affecting pollutant dispersion in this near-highway environment, several real-time and time-integrated sampling devices measured air quality concentrations at multiple distances and heights from the road. Pollutants analyzed included U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-regulated gases, particulate matter (coarse, fine, and ultrafine), and air toxics. Pollutant measurements were synchronized with real-time traffic and meteorological monitoring devices to provide continuous and integrated assessments of the variation of near-road air pollutant concentrations and particle toxicity with changing traffic and environmental conditions, as well as distance from the road. Measurement results demonstrated the temporal and spatial impact of traffic emissions on near-road air quality. The distribution of mobile source emitted gas and particulate pollutants under all wind and traffic conditions indicated a higher proportion of elevated concentrations near the road, suggesting elevated exposures for populations spending significant amounts of time in this microenviron-ment. Diurnal variations in pollutant concentrations also demonstrated the impact of traffic activity and meteorology on near-road air quality. Time-resolved measurements of multiple pollutants demonstrated that traffic emissions produced a complex mixture of criteria and air toxic pollutants in this microenvironment. These results provide a foundation for future assessments of these data to identify the relationship of traffic activity and meteorology on air quality concentrations and population exposures.

The reanalysis, started from 1 January 1959, is continuously maintained up to 11 days behind real time and is used to initialize seasonal forecasts as well as to provide a historical representation of the ocean for climate studies. It has several innovative features, including an online bias-correction algorithm, the assimilation of salinity data on temperature surfaces, and the assimilation of altimeter-derived sea level anomalies and global sea level trends. It is designed to reduce spurious climate variability in the resulting ocean reanalysis due to the nonstationary nature of the observing system, while still taking advantage of the observation information. The new analysis system is compared with the previous operational version; the equatorial temperature biases are reduced and equatorial currents are improved. The impact of assimilation in the ocean state is discussed by diagnosis of the assimilation increment and bias correction terms. The resulting analysis not only improves the fit to the data, but also improves the representation of the interannual variability. In addition to the basic analysis, a real-time analysis is produced (RT-S3). This is needed for monthly forecasts and in the future may be needed for shorter-range forecasts.

In order to provide a more realistic assessment of the economic potential for agricultural carbon sequestration, this study reflects regional trends in land management practices, incorporates the value of co-products from the conversion of cropland to permanent grass, and considers producer differences in crop production profitability. The economic model compared the expected net present value of (1) maintaining current farm practices, (2) switching tillage practices, or (3) converting cropland to permanent grass over a 20-year time horizon. Six different carbon prices ($10, $25, $50, $75, $100, and $125 per metric ton) were used to gauge producer/landowner response to incentive payments. A carbon price of $25 per metric ton led to a 29% increase over the baseline level of C sequestration, representing 49% of the study area's technical storage capacity.

A traditional hypothesis for growth limits of trees at alpine treeline is that low photosynthesis (A) leads to insufficient supply of carbon for growth. Alternatively, the sink-limitation hypothesis questions the importance of low A, and suggests that trees at treeline have abundant carbon for growth as a result of greater decreases in carbon use [respiration (R) and growth] than A at higher elevations. Concentrations of carbon intermediates (e.g., nonstructural carbohydrates, NSC) have been used to support the sink-limitation hypothesis, with the assumption that NSC reflects the ratio of carbon source to sinks. Our objective was to determine elevation effects on carbon balance (whole-plant uptake, storage, and efflux of carbon) of tree seedlings during their critical establishment phase at timberline. Changes in A and R (of whole crowns), NSC (starches and simple sugars), and growth were measured in seedlings of a treeline (Abies lasiocarpa) and nontreeline species (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Seedlings were outplanted at the lower (2,450 m) and upper (3,000 m) edges of the timberline zone in the Rocky Mountains, USA. At the upper compared with lower elevation, both species had 10-20% less root and needle growth, 13-15% less A, 35-39% less R, and up to 50% greater NSC. A. lasiocarpa allocated more biomass to needles and had greater A but less NSC than P. menziesii. The greater effects of elevation on R compared with A led to a 1.3-fold increase in A:R at the upper elevation, and a corresponding increase in starch (r 2 = 0.42)-a pattern consistent with the predictions of the sink-limitation hypothesis. Nevertheless, A and dry mass gain were positively correlated (r 2 = 0.42), indicating that variation in photosynthesis was related to growth of seedlings at timberline. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Growth; Nonstructural carbohydrates; Photosynthesis; Respiration; Timberline","carbohydrate; carbon; carbon balance; concentration (composition); coniferous tree; elevation; growth rate; growth response; nutrient uptake; nutrient use; photosynthesis; respiration; seedling; treeline; Abies; adaptation; altitude; analysis of variance; article; Douglas fir; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microclimate; photosynthesis; regression analysis; seedling; tree; United States; Abies; Adaptation, Physiological; Altitude; Analysis of Variance; Carbohydrates; Carbon; Ecosystem; Microclimate; Photosynthesis; Pseudotsuga; Regression Analysis; Seedling; Trees; United States; North America; Rocky Mountains; United States; Abies; Abies lasiocarpa; Coniferophyta; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54349094224

Hunger to conserve energy has recently won the"" Certificate of Merit"" in ""National Energy Conservation Awards"" for the Year 2007. Calcium Carbonate is an exceptional mineral. The chemical formula CaCO3 covers a raw material, which is widespread throughout nature, whether dissolved in rivers and oceans, in molten form as ""cold"" carbonated-lava, or solid as a mineral in the form of stalactites, stalagmites or as the major constituent of whole mountain ranges. Plants and animals need calcium carbonate to form their skeletons and shells. The Earth's crust contains more than 4% calcium carbonate. As a result, the three calcium carbonate minerals - calcite, aragonite and vaterite - are among the most important rock-forming minerals. Rocks are not the only calcium carbonate deposits in nature, most stretches of water and countless plants and animals contain huge amounts of calcium carbonate. The link between these natural resources is the calcium carbonate cycle. Plants and animals absorb calcium carbonate from water - where it exists, in most cases, in the dissolved form of calcium hydrogen carbonate Ca(HCO3)2 - and use it to build up their skeletons and shells. After their death, crustacean, coccoliths, algae and corals form sedimentary deposits on sea-beds, thus the rock forming process is put in motion. The first stage is the sedimentation process from which chalk and limestone originate. Chalk is a poorly compacted sedimentary calcium carbonate rock, whose digenesis is incomplete. When the sedimentation process is completed this results in the formation of limestone. If the sedimentation process takes place in magnesium containing water a dolomitisation may occur. Part of the calcium ions in the crystal lattice are replaced by magnesium ions, a fact that leads to the formation of dolomite CaMg[CO3]2. The carbonate rocks, chalk, limestone, dolomite and marble rocks are subject to erosion, under the influence of wind, temperature and water they dissolve, and the cycle may start again.",,"Branded products; Calcium carbonate; Calcium ions; Carbonate rocks; Chemical formulae; Conserve energy; Cutting problems; Earth's crust; Final products; Forming processes; Ground calcium carbonate; Hydrogen carbonates; In-line; Magnesium ions; Mountain ranges; Paper manufacturing; Precipitated Calcium Carbonate; Quality improvement; Rock-forming minerals; Sedimentary deposits; Sedimentation processes; Vaterite; Calcite; Calcium; Calcium alloys; Carbonate minerals; Carbonates; Carbonation; Competition; Conservation; Dissolution; Electrolysis; Energy conservation; Energy management; Forming; Hydrogen; Ions; Limestone; Magnesium; Magnesium printing plates; Metal ions; Mineralogy; Mining; Papermaking; Powders; Raw materials; Rocks; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentation; Sedimentology; Shells (structures); Silica; Silicate minerals; Water resources; Wind power; Minerals; Calcium Carbonate; Cutting; Fillers; Forest Products; Forests; Paper Industry; Paper Mills; Rock",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53849111622

As such, even today, electric utilities are making resource planning and investment decisions that consider the possible implications of these future carbon regulations. In this article, we examine the manner in which utilities assess the financial risks associated with future carbon regulations within their long-term resource plans. We base our analysis on a review of the most recent resource plans filed by 15 electric utilities in the Western United States. Virtually all of these utilities made some effort to quantitatively evaluate the potential cost of future carbon regulations when analyzing alternate supply- and demand-side resource options for meeting customer load. Even without federal climate regulation in the US, the prospect of that regulation is already having an impact on utility decision-making and resource choices. That said, the methods and assumptions used by utilities to analyze carbon regulatory risk, and the impact of that analysis on their choice of a particular resource strategy, vary considerably, revealing a number of opportunities for analytic improvement. Though our review focuses on a subset of US electric utilities, this work holds implications for all electric utilities and energy policymakers who are seeking to minimize the compliance costs associated with future carbon regulations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric utilities; Greenhouse gas; Resource planning","Air pollution; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Competition; Decision making; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Finance; Global warming; Investments; Occupational risks; Problem solving; Public policy; Public utilities; Resource allocation; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Carbon dioxide emissions; Compliance costs; Current practices; Financial risks; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas; Investment decisions; Policy-makers; Resource planning; Western United States; Laws and legislation; carbon dioxide; climate change; decision making; demand-side management; global climate; greenhouse gas; policy making; resource management; utility sector; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949094073

Fisheries can affect non-target species through bycatch, and climate change may act simultaneously on their population dynamics. Estimating the relative impact of fisheries and climate on non-target species remains a challenge for many populations because the spatio-temporal distribution of individuals remains poorly known and available demographic information is incomplete. 2. We used population survey data, capture-mark-recapture methods, population modelling and the demographic invariant method to investigate the effects of climate and fisheries on the demography of a predator species affected by bycatch. These complementary approaches were used to help account for different sources of uncertainty. 3. The white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis is the commonest seabird species killed by longline fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Petrel breeding success was positively related to the fishing effort for Patagonian toothfish Dissosticus eleginoides. El Niño events negatively affected adult survival with a time lag of 3 years. Fishing efforts for toothfish and hake (Merluccius spp.) were negatively related to petrel recruitment, suggesting that fisheries-induced mortality strongly impacted younger age classes. Lambda estimated from matrix population models was below replacement (0.964 ± 0.026), and the number of breeding pairs declined by ≈ 37% in 21 years. This decline was probably caused by low survival of both young age classes and adults. 4. The Crozet archipelago, Southern Indian Ocean, population size was estimated at ≈ 170 000 individuals in the early 1980s, and would be severely affected by any additional source of mortality that approached 8000 individuals per year. The number of petrels killed by the toothfish fishery alone exceeded this threshold during the late 1990s and early 2000s, but has declined well below this since 2003. 5. Synthesis and applications. Complementary approaches suggest that both longline fishery bycatch and climate have a significant impact on the size of the Southern Ocean white-chinned petrel population. Stopping or reversing climate change will be a very slow process, and may be impossible. Therefore, we recommend a reduction in bycatch to help the populations recover. Further information on the status of individuals caught in longlines is required to understand the demographic processes involved. © 2008 The Authors.","Demographic invariants; El Niño; Longline fishing; Population model; Procellaria aequinoctialis; Recruitment; Survival","age class; bycatch; climate change; climate effect; demographic survey; demographic trend; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; longlining; mortality; population decline; population dynamics; population estimation; population size; recruitment (population dynamics); seabird; survival; Crozet Islands; French Southern Territories; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Merluccius; Procellaria aequinoctialis; Procellariidae; Rexea solandri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649088563

An understanding of soil microbial ecology is central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycle-climate feedbacks, but the complexity of the soil microbial community and the many ways that it can be affected by climate and other global changes hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions on this topic. In this paper, we argue that to understand the potential negative and positive contributions of soil microbes to land-atmosphere carbon exchange and global warming requires explicit consideration of both direct and indirect impacts of climate change on microorganisms. Moreover, we argue that this requires consideration of complex interactions and feedbacks that occur between microbes, plants and their physical environment in the context of climate change, and the influence of other global changes which have the capacity to amplify climate-driven effects on soil microbes. Overall, we emphasize the urgent need for greater understanding of how soil microbial ecology contributes to land-atmosphere carbon exchange in the context of climate change, and identify some challenges for the future. In particular, we highlight the need for a multifactor experimental approach to understand how soil microbes and their activities respond to climate change and consequences for carbon cycle feedbacks. © 2008 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.","Carbon cycle; Carbon cycle feedback; Climate change; Enzymes; Microbial ecology; Soil respiration","carbon; climate; metabolism; microbiology; plant; short survey; Carbon; Climate; Environmental Microbiology; Plants",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49449087467

The distribution and properties of the silicate mineral deposits are provided and the quantities of CO2 that can be sequestered in these deposits is estimated. The silicate minerals in the Orhaneli and Divrigi deposits provide significant CO2 sequestration capacity. Assuming 100% mineral carbonation efficiency, approximately 2.4 million tons/year of olivine and 6.5 million tons/year of serpentine would be required to sequester the CO2 released by the power plants investigated in this study. Although more detailed studies are needed, it is concluded that this approach has potential given Turkey's large dunite (olivine) and serpentine reserves. Furthermore, the proximity of these deposits and active open-pit mines to thermal power plants emitting CO2 facilitate the utilization of mineral carbonation.","CO2 emission; CO2 sequestration; Greenhouse gases; Magnesium silicates; Mineral carbonation; Olivine; Serpentine","Assesment; Magnesium silicate minerals; Magnesium silicates; Mineral carbonation; Open pit mines; Thermal power plants; Carbonation; Deposits; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Magnesium; Mine power plants; Mineral resources; Minerals; Mining; Olivine; Serpentine; Silicate minerals; Thermoelectric power plants; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449121118

Public health recommendations during smoke episodes typically include advising community members to remain indoors and the use of air cleaners, yet little information is available on the effectiveness of these measures. Our study attempted to address the following objectives: to measure indoor infiltration factor (Finf) of PM2.5 from forest fires/wood smoke, to determine the effectiveness of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaners in reducing indoor PM2.5, and to analyze the home determinants of Finf and air cleaner effectiveness (ACE). We collected indoor/outdoor 1-min PM2.5 averages and 48-h outdoor PM2.5 filter samples for 21 winter and 17 summer homes impacted by wood burning and forest fire smoke, respectively, during 2004-2005. A portable HEPA filter air cleaner was operated indoors with the filter removed for one of two sampling days. Particle Finf and ACE were calculated for each home using a recursive model. We found mean F inf±SD was 0.27±0.18 and 0.61±0.27 in winter (n=19) and summer (n=13), respectively, for days when HEPA filters were not used. Lower Finf±SD values of 0.10±0.08 and 0.19±0.20 were found on corresponding days when HEPA filters were in place. Mean±SD ACE ([Finf without filter-Finf with filter]/Finf without filter) in winter and summer were 55±38% and 65±35%, respectively. Number of windows and season predicted F inf (P 0.001). No significant predictors of ACE were identified.

To reduce emissions, electric powered vehicles are in use in many cities. Depending on the number of commuters and on the available infrastructure, different types of electric vehicles (battery electric buses, trolley buses, trams, metro, light rail) can be applied. Although these mass transit vehicles enable large reductions in terms of emissions, their energy efficiency could be significantly improved. This improvement can be reached by the hybridization of their drive train with the inclusion of an energy storage system (ESS) for energy recovery purposes [1], [2].

The motivation of this work is to extend the lead time of operational drought forecasts. The research strategy is to explore the predictability of drought severity from space-time varying indices of large-scale climate phenomena relevant to regional hydrometeorology (e.g. ENSO) by integrating linear and non-linear statistical data models, specifically self-organizing maps (SOM) and multivariate linear regression analysis. The methodology is demonstrated through the step-by-step development of a model to forecast monthly spatial patterns of the standard precipitation index (SPI) within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia up to 12 months in advance. First, the rationale for the physical hypothesis and the exploratory data analysis including principal components, wavelet and partial mutual information analysis to identify and select predictor variables are presented. The focus is on spatial datasets of precipitation, sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) patterns over the Indian and Pacific Oceans, temporal and spatial gradients of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) in the Pacific Ocean, and the far western Pacific wind-stress anomaly. Second, the process of model construction, calibration and evaluation is described. The experimental forecasts show that there is ample opportunity to increase the lead time of drought forecasts for decision support using parsimonious data models that capture the governing climate processes at regional scale. OLR gradients proved to be dispensable predictors, whereas SPI-based predictors appear to control predictability when the SSTA in the region [87.5°N-87.5°S; 27.5°E-67.5°W] and eastward wind-stress anomalies in the region [4°N-4°S; 130°E-160°E) are small, respectively, ±1° and ±0.01 dyne/cm2, that is when ENSO activity is weak. The areal averaged 12-month lead-time forecasts of SPI in the MDB explain up to 60% of the variance in the observations (r &gt; 0.7). Based on a threshold SPI of -0.5 for severe drought at the regional scale and for a nominal 12-month lead time, the forecast of the timing of onset is within 0-2 months of the actual threshold being met by the observations, thus effectively a 10-month lead time forecast at a minimum. Spatial analysis suggests that forecast errors can be attributed in part to a mismatch between the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall and raingauge density in the observational network. Forecast uncertainty on the other hand appears associated with the number of redundant predictors used in the forecast model. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However historic distributions can be difficult to estimate objectively because substantial habitat changes may have occurred prior to comprehensive surveys. As a means to address this question, we evaluated a novel approach by creating spatial niche models for two species of psammophilic lizards. Using a partitioned Mahalanobis D2 analysis and abiotic variables that were independent of anthropogenic change, we created niche models for the federally threatened Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard (Uma inornata) and for the flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii). The niche models estimated that within the Coachella Valley there were originally 32,164 ha of potential habitat for the fringe-toed lizard and 33,502 ha of potential habitat for the horned lizard. After screening these estimates of historic habitat for current conditions that would render that potential habitat unsuitable, we calculated a 91-95% loss of potential habitat for the fringe-toed lizard and an 83-92% loss for the horned lizard. Unlike the fringe-toed lizard, the horned lizard also occurs outside the Coachella Valley. Conducting a similar analysis throughout its range would provide an objective estimate of the total habitat loss experienced by this species. This information could be used to address whether granting it federal or state protection is warranted. For species whose distributions can be modeled with abiotic variables such as soils, elevation, topography, and climate, this approach may have broad applications for resolving questions regarding their current levels of habitat loss and regional conservation planning. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimates are presented based on a 1:2 million scale soil and terrain (SOTER) database for Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda (hereafter referred to as Central Africa). Each SOTER map unit consists of up to six soil components, characterized by a representative soil profile extracted from survey data. Gaps in the measured soil analytical data were filled using consistent, taxonomy-based pedotransfer procedures. Natural variation in individual soil components was simulated to put bounds on regional-scale carbon stocks rather than a single figure. The 95% confidence interval for the median stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) to 1 m is 19.3 to 19.6 Pg C; this corresponds with some 11% of African and about 1% of worldwide SOC stocks to that depth. The area-weighted SOC content is largest in the cool, humid mountains (22.1-22.7 kg C m- 2) in part due to the presence of soils formed on volcanic parent materials, and smallest for the warm savannah region (7.6-7.7 kg C m- 2). Local differences in SOC content are related to type and texture of parent material, soil drainage conditions, and land use/vegetation. Less than 1% of the region consists of soil units that contain secondary carbonates (~ 0.19 Pg C), accounting for ~ 0.8% of the total carbon stock to 2 m in the soils of Central Africa.

Despite this progress, stakeholders must be convinced that the scientific community has studied all possible scenarios, including a potential leak into the biosphere. To better understand the potential impact of such an event, a detailed geochemical and biological study was conducted during two different seasons on a naturally occurring gas vent located within a Mediterranean pasture ecosystem (Latera geothermal field, central Italy). Results from botanical, soil gas, and gas flux surveys, and from chemical and biological analyses of shallow soil samples (0-20 cm depth), show that a significant impact is only observed in the 6 m wide centre of the vent, where CO2 flux rates exceed 2000-3000 g m-2 d-1. In this ""vent core"" there is no vegetation, pH is low (minimum 3.5), and small changes are observed in mineralogy and bulk chemistry. In addition, microbial activities and populations are regulated in this interval by near-anoxic conditions, and by elevated soil gas CO2 (&gt;95%) and trace reduced gases (CH4, H2S, and H2). An approximately 20 m wide halo surrounding the core forms a transition zone, over which there is a gradual decrease in CO2 concentrations, a rapid decrease in CO2 fluxes, and the absence of reactive gas species. In this transition zone grasses dominate near the vent core, but these are progressively replaced by clover and a greater plant diversity moving away from the vent centre. Physical parameters (e.g. pH, bulk chemistry, mineralogy) and microbial systems also gradually return to background values across this transition zone. Results indicate that, even at this anomalous high-flux site, the effects of the gas vent are spatially limited and that the ecosystem appears to have adapted to the different conditions through species substitution or adaptation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, we aimed to test rigorously a number of hypotheses that were proposed as 'general explanations' for such patterns, namely (1) the mid-domain effect, (2) overlap between lowland and montane (or endemic) fauna, (3) water and energy availability (i.e. temperature-limitation at high elevations, water-limitation at low elevations), (4) area size of elevational bands, and (5) determination by (host) plant diversity. Location: Northern Borneo, Malaysia. Methods: We used quantitative light-trapping data across northern Borneo (from our own field work and published literature) for 52 sites (covering &gt; 800 species) to quantify local diversity (as Fisher's α). We used these data to test predictions of the five hypotheses in spatially explicit correlation analyses, using published data on climate, plant diversity and topography (Digital Elevation Model) as predictor variables. Results: We documented a pronounced diversity peak at c. 650 m a.s.l. (breakpoint regression, r2 = 0.55). We observed additional effects of other habitat parameters, sampling methodology and time on diversity only for data below 655 m a.s.l. Furthermore, we did not find unequivocal support for any of the above-stated hypotheses. The mid-domain effect and faunal overlap can be ruled out as single explanations of observed patterns, whereas the data equally fit predictions from water-energy dynamics, area and plant diversity only at higher elevations, but not in the lower part of the gradient. Of those, only effects of energy (i.e. temperature) were expected a priori to be restricted to elevations above the breakpoint. Main conclusions: We tentatively conclude that temperature (i.e. energy limitation) is the best explanation for decreasing diversity towards high elevations, but we did not find a compelling explanation of lowered diversity near sea level. We discuss and present some preliminary data on further possible explanations, i.e. niche conservatism of higher taxonomic groups. © 2008 The Authors.","Altitudinal gradient; Faunal overlap; Mid-domain effect; Plant diversity; Spatial regression; Water-energy dynamics","altitude; elevation; hypothesis testing; moth; spatial distribution; species diversity; temperature effect; Asia; Borneo; Eurasia; Malay Archipelago; Southeast Asia; Geometridae; Lepidoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48049119942

Time-series analysis was conducted with the use of dynamic harmonic regression (DHR), which provided a very good model fit, to examine both the seasonal behaviour in these isomers and the longer-term, underlying trends. Strong spatial differences were not apparent between the two sites, although subtle differences in seasonal behaviour and composition were identified. For example, the composition of γ-HCH to total HCH (α + γ) was greater at Zeppelin compared to Alert, probably reflecting this site's proximity to major use regions of lindane. Pronounced seasonality in air concentrations for γ-HCH was marked by a 'spring maximum event' (SME), confirming earlier studies. For α-HCH, the SME was much weaker and only evident at Alert, whereas at Zeppelin, seasonal fluctuations for α-HCH were marked by elevated concentrations in summer and lower concentrations during winter, with this pattern most apparent for the years after 2000. We attribute this difference in spatial and temporal patterns to the Arctic oscillation. A similar climatic pattern was not evident at either site in the γ-HCH data. Seasonally adjusted, long-term trends revealed declining concentrations at both sites for α- and γ-HCH over the entire time-series. Recent legislation affecting lindane use appear to account for this decline in γ-HCH, with little evidence of a delay or 'lag' between the banning of lindane in Europe (a main source region) or Canada, and a decline in air concentrations observed at both Arctic sites. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Data are also available from laboratory chassis dynamometer studies in which particle number emissions from engines of a range of capacity and technologies have been measured. In this study the data from the PARTICULATES project database of laboratory test bed measurements have been aggregated to estimate fleet average particle number emission factors for light duty and heavy duty vehicles which have then been compared with the results of field measurement studies. Measurements carried out by [Jones, A.M., Harrison, R.M., 2006. Estimation of the emission factors of particle number and mass fractions from traffic at a site where mean vehicle speeds vary over short distances. Atmospheric Environment 40, 7125-7137] at the Marylebone Road London, represented an 'urban' fleet and were estimated by the aggregated laboratory measured emission factors within one or two standard deviations of their values. For light and heavy duty vehicles travelling with an average speed of 39.5 km h-1 the NOx emission factors were estimated to be 0.62 and 5.88 g veh-1 km-1, respectively, and the PM2.5 emission factors were estimated to be, respectively, 0.017 and 0.17 g veh-1 km-1. The total particle number emission factors (including volatiles) were estimated for light and heavy duty vehicles travelling according 'urban' Common ARTEMIS Driving Cycle (CADC) to be 6.31 × 1013 and 70.6 × 1013 num veh-1 km-1 and these were both within one standard deviation of the values measured using the field data. Similarly, the fractionated solid particle number emission factors (excluding volatiles), measured for the aerodynamic diameter ranges, 30-50 nm, 50-100 nm and 100-1000 nm, were estimated to within one standard deviation of the equivalent measured emission factors for the light duty vehicles and to within two standard deviations of the equivalent measured emission factors for the heavy duty vehicles. Extending this work to estimate the total number emission factors measured by other research groups, conditions representing both the 'rural' and 'highway' Common ARTEMIS Driving Cycles were considered. For the light duty vehicles, a general increase in the calculated value of the total number emission factor was observed with increased fleet speed and the observed scatter was accounted for by the split in the fleet according to the vehicle's fuel, whether gasoline or diesel. The calculated values of the total number emission factors for the heavy duty vehicles also show an increase with speed after 60 km h-1. High values are observed at 20 km h-1 suggesting an underlying inverted binomial trend similar to that observed for gaseous emission factors and arguably supported by the field measured values. The scatter of the calculated points about this trend was accounted for by the distribution of the fleet across the vehicle weight and emission legislation categories. With the exception of three of the field research studies considered - where the measured emission factors were significantly underestimated by the aggregated laboratory emission factors - there was a general agreement in the order of magnitude between the calculated and field emission factors, but not to the high degree shown for the Marylebone Road data. Furthermore, dilution temperature, fuel sulphur content and tunnel deposition effects did not individually account for the observed discrepancies in this work and point to the need for correction factors derived from these parameters together with additional information such as dilution ratio in giving a more complete description. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made towards the reduction of energy consumption and reduction of greenhouse gases in Kwinana. One way to further advance sustainable energy use is through the realisation of regional synergies. These concern the capture, recovery and reuse of by-products, water and energy between industries in close proximity. Kwinana is recognised as a leading edge example in regional synergy development, but more synergy opportunities appear to exist. The centre for sustainable resource processing (CSRP) is undertaking research to develop new synergies in Kwinana, including energy utility synergies. As part of the research, a methodology was developed and applied to identify and evaluate the economic, technical, and environmental feasibility of collaborative energy recovery opportunities from industry flue gases in Kwinana. The trial application demonstrated the significant potential to mitigate CO2 emissions through energy recovery from flue gases by applying technologies to convert the embedded energy into useful thermal and electric applications.

Locations that were once inconvenient have become accessible through extensive road networks leading to population decentralization from the traditional urban centre to suburbia, creating polycentric sprawls from once monocentric communities. Hamilton, Ontario is one such city. The decentralization and urban decline of the city is widely attributed to sprawling development. This change in the sociospatial structure creates challenges for transportation planners as we see greater automobile dependency, greater commuting distances and increased congestion. Smart growth policies such as urban residential intensification (URI) aim to increase population densities in the urban core. This exploratory study estimates the benefits of such policies from a transportation aspect. It is predicted that the City of Hamilton will experience household growth of approximately 80,000 households over the period 2005-2031. Using IMULATE, an integrated urban transportation and land-use model, a variety of development scenarios model this anticipated growth. Changes in vehicular emissions, traffic congestion and energy consumption as a result of URI are examined. Models of the land-use/transportation relationship demonstrate how increasing population densities within a city's urban centre drastically reduce congestion, emissions and gasoline consumption. © / Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association canadienne des géographes.","Hamilton; IMULATE; Modelling; Smart growth; Sustainable development; Urban residential intensification","decentralization; population density; population modeling; strategic approach; sustainable development; traffic congestion; transportation planning; urban planning; Canada; Hamilton [Ontario]; North America; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849100738

Inverse analysis of the temporal inorganic carbon dioxide system and nutrient variations was used to determine the net community stoichiometric uptake characteristics of a natural pelagic ecosystem perturbed over a range of pCO2 scenarios (350, 700 and 1050 μatm). Nutrient uptake showed no sensitivity to CO2 treatment. There was enhanced carbon production relative to nutrient consumption in the higher CO2 treatments which was positively correlated with the initial CO2 concentration. There was no significant calcification response to changing CO2 in Emiliania huxleyi by the peak of the bloom and all treatments exhibited low particulate inorganic carbon production (∼15 μmol kg&amp;minus;1). With insignificant air-sea CO 2 exchange across the treatments, the enhanced carbon uptake was due to increase organic carbon production. The inferred cumulative C:N:P stoichiometry of organic production increased with CO2 treatment from 1:6.3:121 to 1:7.1:144 to 1:8.25:168 at the height of the bloom.

To investigate the changes in bacterial diversity in general, and SRB in particular, following this salination, two sets of universal primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene and the functional apsA [adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (APS) reductase α-subunit] gene of SRB were used. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum both before and after salination (with 52% and 68%, respectively), whereas Firmicutes was the second most dominant phylum before (39%) and after (19%) salination. Sequences belonging to Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes and Actinobacteria were also found. Several groups of SRB from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were also found to inhabit this saline environment. Comparison of bacterial diversity before and after salination of the ponds revealed both a shift in community composition and an increase in microbial diversity following salination. The share of SRB in the 16S rRNA gene was reduced following salination, consistent with the reduction of H2S emissions. However, the community composition, as shown by apsA gene analysis, was not markedly affected. © 2008 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This article suggests that the rapid growth of emissions trading markets themselves may be helping to swing the cost-benefit analysis of participation in emissions reduction commitments for American actors and others. Most simply, the practical viability of international emissions trading has now been confirmed, largely by the European market, but there are two further elements to this development for which this article presents the early evidence.

The fluxes of organic matter, mercury (THg), and monomethylmercury (MeHg) were studied in natural stands of Spartina foliosa and Salicornia virginica. Seasonal fluxes from the sediment into aboveground biomass of live plants and subsequent transfer into the dead plant community by mortality were measured. Loss of THg and MeHg from the dead plant community through fragmentation, leaching, and excretion were calculated and were similar to net uptake. Seasonal data were added up to calculate annual mass balances. In S. foliosa, annual net production was 1,757 g DW m-2, and the annual net uptakes in the aboveground biomass were 305 μg THg m-2 and 5.720 μg MeHg m-2. In S. virginica, annual net production was 2,117 g DW m-2, and the annual net uptakes in aboveground biomass were 99.120 μg THg m-2 and 1.990 μg MeHg m-2. Of both plant species studied, S. foliosa had a slightly lower production rate but greater mercury species uptake and loss rates than S. virginica, and, consequently, it is to be expected that S. foliosa matter may affect the local and possibly the regional food web relatively more than S. virginica. However, the actual effects of the input of mercury-species-containing plant-derived particulate matter into the food webs would depend on trophic level, food preference, seasonal cycle of the consumer, total sediment surface area vegetated, location of the vegetation in the marsh landscape, and estuary bay landscape. Since the levels of mercury species in dead plant material greatly exceed those in live plant material (on a dry weight basis), detritivores would ingest greater mercury species concentrations than herbivores, and consumers of S. foliosa would ingest more than consumers of S. virginica. The greatest THg and MeHg losses of both plant species due to mortality and to fragmentation-leaching-excretion occurred in late spring and early autumn, which corresponds to peak MeHg levels observed in sediments of coastal systems of previous studies, suggesting enhanced THg-MeHg export from the marsh to the nearshore sediment. © 2008 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Estuarine; Mercury; Monomethylmercury; Salicornia; Salt marsh; Spartina","aboveground production; flux measurement; food web; leaching; mass balance; mercury (element); net primary production; particulate matter; plant community; saltmarsh; seagrass; seasonal variation; transport process; vegetation; California; North America; San Pablo Bay; United States; Salicornia; Salicornia virginica; Spartina; Spartina foliosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55649094442

Remediation generally requires parasitic bleeding of a small fraction (<5%) of air into the fuel stream to promote oxidation of the CO and use of a platinum-ruthenium or other noble metal based catalyst. For enhancement of system efficiency, air bleed should be controlled using real-time feedback of CO level in the feed-stream. In this paper, a recently reported data-driven pattern identification method, called Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF), is applied for on-line sensing of CO content in an impure reformed hydrogen fuel stream. A small fuel cell, fuelled by a diverted stream of reformate, is used as a CO sensor. CO level is determined through time series analysis of the dynamic current response of the sensor cell due to load oscillations. The pattern identification algorithms are built upon the underlying concepts of Symbolic Dynamics, Information Theory and Probabilistic Finite State Machines. The effect of temperature on sensitivity was analyzed, and results demonstrate the efficacy of CO sensor under different operating conditions. The sensitivity of the CO sensor can be tailored for a particular application by changing the type of catalyst, its loading and operation temperature. A similar approach is now being used to develop online sensors for a variety of other important fuel cell phenomena, such as flooding and catalyst degradation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Adult Japanese goats (&gt;2 years old) with a mean body weight of 26±5.4 kg were used in these experiments. Each diet was fed to four randomly selected goats and feeding was carried out at 1.1 maintenance (M) as per National Research Council (NRC) (1981) for goats. Average CH4 emission by goats in the RC ranged from 0.23 to 0.39 (mean value 31 ml/g dry matter intake (DMI)); when it was expressed as a proportion of gross energy or, with methane conversion rate (MCR), it ranged from 5.0 to 8.2, with an average of 6.6. Incorporation of by-products like sweet potato vine silage (SPVS) (P=0.016), dried pumpkin (P=0.052) and brewers' grain in the diet suppressed (P&lt;0.01) methanogenesis in goats, when compared with that of standard farm diet (D1). The CH4 output measured in the RC was very close to that estimated from the gas collected after 24 h and higher after 48 h of in vitro incubation. Although composition of the diets' acid detergent fibre (ADF) had a significant effect on methane emission, methane output estimated by IVGPT was very close to that measured in the RC demonstrating that this system could be used to estimate the CH4 production potential from diets in preparing a database and also in the planning of mitigation strategies in small ruminants to improve their performance as well as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,"bioengineering; biogenic emission; comparative study; diet; goat; measurement method; methanogenesis; nutritive value; vine; Bovidae; Capra hircus; Ipomoea batatas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56749104776

The surface modification by carbon was achieved in order to make the cubic/tetragonal nanocrystals non-toxic and biocompatible.

Manganese is mainly present as +II or +III oxidation states. The magnetic behavior was found to be very dependent on the manganese concentration with a ferromagnetic behavior of the 1% doped sample due to the coupling between carriers and manganese spins.

A metagenomic analysis was made by using whole-genome amplification and pyrosequencing of sediments from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1229 on the Peru Margin to further explore the microbial diversity and overall community composition within this environment. A total of 61.9 Mb of genetic material was sequenced from sediments at horizons 1, 16, 32, and 50 m below the seafloor. These depths include sediments from both primarily sulfate-reducing methane-generating regions of the sediment column. Many genes of the annotated genes, including those encoding ribosomal proteins, corresponded to those from the Chloroflexi and Euryarchaeota. However, analysis of the 16S small-subunit ribosomal genes suggests that Crenarchaeota are the abundant microbial member. Quantitative PCR confirms that uncultivated Crenarchaeota are indeed a major microbial group in these subsurface samples. These findings show that the marine subsurface is a distinct microbial habitat and is different from environments studied by metagenomics, especially because of the predominance of uncultivated archaeal groups. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Archaea; Chloroflexi; Marine sediment; Quantitative PCR","article; biosphere; Chloroflexi; controlled study; environment; Euryarchaeota; gene amplification; gene sequence; genetic analysis; nonhuman; Peru; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Archaea; Bacteria; DNA, Archaeal; DNA, Bacterial; Geography; Geologic Sediments; Peru; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Water Microbiology; Archaea; Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Crenarchaeota; Euryarchaeota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749117805

Renewable energy systems already reduce GHG emissions from the energy sector, although on a modest scale. Most long-term energy projections show that renewable energy will play a major role in the global energy supply in the second half of the century, with capacity increasing gradually in the first three decades. On the other hand, Turkey is heavily dependent on expensive imported energy resources (oil, gas and coal) that place a big burden on the economy and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources.

Cells were exposed to Dunkerque city's PM2.5 at its Lethal Concentrations at 10% and 50% (i.e. LC10 = 23.72 μg/mL or 6.33 μg/cm2, and LC50 = 118.60 μg/mL or 31.63 μg/cm2), and the study of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 gene expression (i.e. RT-PCR) and protein activity (i.e. EROD activity), and the formation of PAH-DNA adducts (i.e. 32P-postlabeling), were investigated after 24, 48, and/or 72 h. PAH, PolyChlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and -Furans (PCDD/F), Dioxin-Like PolyChlorinated Biphenyls (DLPCB), and PolyChlorinated Biphenyls (PCB)-coated onto collected PM were determined (i.e. GC/MS and HRGC/HRMS, respectively), Negative (i.e. TiO2 or desorbed PM, dPM; EqLC10 = 19.42 μg/mL or 5.18 μg/cm2, and EqLC50 = 97.13 μg/mL or 25.90 μg/cm2), and positive (i.e. benzo(a)pyrene; 1 μM) controls were included in the experimental design. Statistically significant increases of CYP1A1 gene expression and protein activity were observed in A549 cells, 24, 48 and 72 h after their exposure to dPM, suggesting thereby that the employed outgassing method was not efficient enough to remove total PAH. Both the CYP1A1 gene expression and EROD activity were highly induced 24, 48 and 72 h after cell exposure to PM. However, only very low levels of PAH-DNA adducts, also not reliably quantifiable, were reported 72 h after cell exposure to dPM, and, particularly, PM. The relatively low levels of PAH together with the presence of PCDD/F, DLPCB, and PCB-coated onto Dunkerque City's PM2.5 could notably contribute to explain the borderline detection of PAH-DNA adducts in dPM and/or PM-exposed A549 cells. Hence, remaining very low doses of PAH in dPM or relatively low doses of PAH-coated onto PM were involved in enzymatic induction, a key feature in PAH-toxicity, but failed to show a clear genotoxicity in this in vitro study. We also concluded that, in the human lung epithelial cell model we used, and in the experimental conditions we chose, bulky-DNA adduct formation was apparently not a major factor involved in the Dunkerque City's PM2.5-induced toxicity. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Together with the two published records from the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere that each span at least a portion of this interval of time, we begin to assemble a spatial picture of sea surface hydrography during the late Miocene early Pliocene climate transition (~ 8-3 Ma). We hypothesize that meridional movements in the frontal zones (Polar Front and Subtropical Convergence) with their impact on hydrographic gradients would be evident in temporal changes in the planktonic foraminiferal stable isotopic gradients among the sites. Our results indicate that there were no large changes in δ18O gradients during the interval of study. Relatively small changes such as a gradual warming of about 3-4 °C at Site 1088 during the late Miocene fall well within the realm of modern ocean seasonality in this region. The early Pliocene δ18O records largely parallel the global decrease defined by benthic foraminifera in the deep Pacific suggesting no amplified warming of surface waters in the Southern Ocean. The planktic δ13C records vary positively with the δ18O records both in the long term trend as well as on the scale of individual data points. We believe that this association reflects primarily reduced nutrient utilization during warmer intervals although a small component of the signal would also be consistent with reduced carbon isotope fractionation during air-sea gas exchange during relatively warmer conditions. If correct, this argument would have implications for carbon cycling during the early Pliocene and would support scenarios of elevated CO2 levels. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, such models focus upon individual metals, not metal mixtures. This study determined whether Pb and Cd interact at the gill of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) when trout were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of these metals (Cd &lt; 100 nmol L-1; Pb &lt; 500 nmol L-1) in soft (&lt;100 μmol Ca2+ L-1), moderately acidic (pH 6.0) water. The 96-h LC50 for Pb was 482 nmol L-1, indicating that Pb was one-order of magnitude more toxic in soft, acidic water than in harder, circumneutral pH waters. The LC50 for Cd alone was also low, 6.7 nmol L-1. Surprisingly, fish acclimated to soft water had multiple populations of Pb-gill and Cd-gill binding sites. A low capacity, high affinity population of Pb-gill binding sites had a Bmax of 18.2 nmol g-1 wet weight (ww) and apparent log KPb-gill = 7.05, but a second low affinity population could not be saturated up to free Pb concentrations approaching 4000 nmol L-1. Two populations of Cd-gill binding sites were characterized: a high affinity, low capacity population with an apparent log KCd-gill = 7.33 and Bmax = 1.73 nmol g-1 ww, and a low affinity, high capacity population with an apparent log KCd-gill = 5.86, and Bmax = 13.7 nmol g-1 ww. At low concentrations, Cd plus Pb accumulation was less than additive because Cd out-competed Pb for gill binding sites, which were likely apical Ca2+-channels. While disturbances to Ca2+ influx were caused by Cd alone, Pb alone had no effect. However, Pb exacerbated Cd-induced disturbances to Ca2+ influx demonstrating that, although Pb- plus Cd-gill binding was less than additive due to competition, the effects (ionic disturbances) were more than additive (synergistic). Pb was also likely binding to intracellular targets, such as branchial carbonic anhydrase, which led to inhibited Na+ influx. This ionic disturbance was exacerbated by Cd. We conclude that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of Pb plus Cd results in less than additive metal-gill binding in soft, moderately acidic waters. However, ionic disturbances caused by Cd plus Pb are greater than additive, and this may ultimately increase the toxicity of Cd-Pb mixtures to fishes. Our findings suggest that it may be necessary to re-evaluate water quality criteria and assumptions of the BLM for fish exposed to mixtures of Pb and Cd in the acidic, soft waters found in the Canadian Shield, Scandinavia and other sensitive regions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated in a comprehensive way soil chemical, as well as below and aboveground biological parameters of two organic and two conventional wheat farming systems that primarily differed in fertilization and weed management strategies. Contrast analyses identified management related differences between ""herbicide-free"" bioorganic (BIOORG) and biodynamic (BIODYN) systems and conventional systems with (CONFYM) or without manure (CONMIN) and herbicide application within a long-term agricultural experiment (DOK trial, Switzerland). Soil carbon content was significantly higher in systems receiving farmyard manure and concomitantly microbial biomass (fungi and bacteria) was increased. Microbial activity parameters, such as microbial basal respiration and nitrogen mineralization, showed an opposite pattern, suggesting that soil carbon in the conventional system (CONFYM) was more easily accessible to microorganisms than in organic systems. Bacterivorous nematodes and earthworms were most abundant in systems that received farmyard manure, which is in line with the responses of their potential food sources (microbes and organic matter). Mineral fertilizer application detrimentally affected enchytraeids and Diptera larvae, whereas aphids benefited. Spider abundance was favoured by organic management, most likely a response to increased prey availability from the belowground subsystem or increased weed coverage. In contrast to most soil-based, bottom-up controlled interactions, the twofold higher abundance of this generalist predator group in organic systems likely contributed to the significantly lower abundance of aboveground herbivore pests (aphids) in these systems. Long-term organic farming and the application of farmyard manure promoted soil quality, microbial biomass and fostered natural enemies and ecosystem engineers, suggesting enhanced nutrient cycling and pest control. Mineral fertilizers and herbicide application, in contrast, affected the potential for top-down control of aboveground pests negatively and reduced the organic carbon levels. Our study indicates that the use of synthetic fertilizers and herbicide application changes interactions within and between below and aboveground components, ultimately promoting negative environmental impacts of agriculture by reducing internal biological cycles and pest control. On the contrary, organic farming fosters microbial and faunal decomposers and this propagates into the aboveground system via generalist predators thereby increasing conservation biological control. However, grain and straw yields were 23% higher in systems receiving mineral fertilizers and herbicides reflecting the trade-off between productivity and environmental responsibility. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A collaborative study between the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the University of Southern California was initiated to investigate the physicochemical and toxicological characteristics of the semi-volatile and non-volatile particulate matter (PM) fractions from HDDV emissions. This paper reports the physical properties, including size distribution, volatility (in terms of number and mass), surface diameter, and agglomeration of particles emitted from HDDV retrofitted with advanced emission control devices. Four vehicles in combination with six after-treatment devices (V-SCRT®, Z-SCRT®, CRT®, DPX, Hybrid-CCRT®, EPF) were tested under three driving cycles: steady state (cruise), transient (urban dynamometer driving schedule, UDDS), and idle. An HDDV without any control device is served as the baseline vehicle. Substantial reduction of PM mass emissions (&gt;90%) was accomplished for the HDDV operating with advanced emission control technologies. This reduction was not observed for particle number concentrations under cruise conditions, with the exceptions of the Hybrid-CCRT® and EPF vehicles, which were efficient in controlling both-mass and number emissions. In general, significant nucleation mode particles (&lt;50 nm) were formed during cruise cycles in comparison with the UDDS cycles, which emit higher PM mass in the accumulation mode. The nucleation mode particles (&lt;50 nm) were mainly internally mixed, and evaporated considerably between 150 and 230 °C. Compared to the baseline vehicle, particles from vehicles with controls (except of the Hybrid-CCRT®) had a higher mass specific surface area. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We searched for mid-infrared H2 emission in the S(1), S(2), and S(4) transitions. Keck/NIRSPEC observations of the H2 S(9) transition were included for some sources as an additional constraint on the gas temperature. We detected H2 emission from 6 of 29 sources observed: AB Aur, DoAr 21, Elias 29, GSS 30 IRS 1, GV Tau N, and HL Tau. Four of the six targets with detected emission are class I sources that show evidence for surrounding material in an envelope in addition to a circumstellar disk. In these cases, we show that accretion shock heating is a plausible excitation mechanism. The detected emission lines are narrow (∼10 km s-1), centered at the stellar velocity, and spatially unresolved at scales of 0.4″, which is consistent with origin from a disk at radii 10-50 AU from the star. In cases where we detect multiple emission lines, we derive temperatures ≳; 500 K from ∼1 M⊕ of gas. Our upper limits for the nondetections place upper limits on the amount of H2 gas with T &gt; 500 K of less than a few Earth masses. Such warm gas temperatures are significantly higher than the equilibrium dust temperatures at these radii, suggesting that the gas is decoupled from the dust in the regions that we are studying and that processes such as UV, X-ray, and accretion heating may be important. © 2008.

The procedure identified 16 coherent zones that reflect the variability of climate across Europe whilst maintaining a manageable number of zones for subsequent modelling studies. An analysis of basic climatic parameters for each zone demonstrates the success of the scheme in identifying distinct climatic regions. Objective criteria were used to identify one representative 26-year daily meteorological series from a European dataset for each zone. The representativeness of each series was then verified against the zonal classifications.

We determined CH4 fluxes and concentration profiles of dissolved gases and anions and some δ13C ratios of CO 2 and CH4 in a thermokarst pond and adjacent smaller thermokarst depressions in the forest tundra near Igarka, northern Siberia in August 2006. Methane was emitted at 110-170 mg m-2 d-1 and produced mostly by CO2 reduction, which also provided high Gibbs free energies on the order of 50-70 KJ mol-1 H2 due to high H2concentrations. The diffusive flux calculated from CH 4 gradients in the floating mat contributed &lt;2% to emissions. CH4 was apparently not oxidized deeper than 20 cm into the floating mat and the water body below. Anaerobic respiration required to reproduce nonsteady state CO2 concentration maxima in the floating mat above the water body was 30-80 nmol cm-3 d-1 or 250 mg m -2 d-1 and thus on a similar order of magnitude as CH 4 fluxes. The results suggest that floating mat-covered thermokarst ponds located in northern Siberian bogs effectively convert recently fixed carbon into CH4 and thus allow for emissions independently from the finite, bog-derived carbon source. The relative contribution of recently fixed and old bog-derived carbon to C fluxes requires further investigation, however.

Results show a continuous growth trend of China's historical NMVOCs emissions during the period of 1980ĝ€""2005, with the emission increasing by 4.2 times at an annual average rate of 10.6% from 3.91 Tg in 1980 to 16.49 Tg in 2005. Vehicles, biomass burning, industrial processes, fossil fuel combustion, solvent utilization, and storage and transport generated 5.50 Tg, 3.84 Tg, 2.76 Tg, 1.98 Tg, 1.87 Tg, and 0.55 Tg of NMVOCs, respectively, in 2005. Motorcycles, biofuel burning, heavy duty vans, synthetic fibre production, biomass open burning, and industrial and commercial consumption were primary emission sources. Besides, source contributions of NMVOCs emissions showed remarkable annual variation. However, emissions of these sources had been continuously increasing, which coincided well with China's economic growth. Spatial distribution of NMVOCs emissions illustrates that high emissions mainly concentrates in developed regions of northern, eastern and southern coastal areas, which produced more emissions than the relatively underdeveloped western and inland regions. Particularly, southeastern, northern, and central China covering 35.2% of China's territory, generated 59.4% of the total emissions, while the populous capital cities covering merely 4.5% of China's territory, accounted for 24.9% of the national emissions. Annual variation of regional emission intensity shows that emissions concentrating in urban areas tended to transfer to rural areas year by year. Moreover, eastern, southern, central, and northeastern China were typical areas of high emission intensity and had a tendency of expanding to the northwestern China, which revealed the transfer of emission-intensive plants to these areas, together with the increase of biomass open burning.",,"aerial survey; annual variation; anthropogenic source; biomass burning; emission inventory; GIS; history; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; spatial variation; temporal variation; urban atmosphere; volatile organic compound; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57949099800

Tree-growth association with climate was analysed at regional and local scales using correlation coefficient and bootstrapped response functions. • Radial growth at both scales was positively correlated with rainfall during and prior to the growing season at all sites, and with summer rainfall before the growing season at five sites. Mean temperature effect changed according to the sampling site, from non-significant at the highest sites to significant (positive relationship in winter) at the lowest sites. Growth season temperature also had a negative effect. • The Kalman filter was applied to estimate changing association between growth and climate over-time.

In this study we used the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) approach driven by daily standard weather station data, specific soil properties and crop characteristics at the scale of Canadian agricultural ecoregions. The objectives were to calculate a climate-dependent soil biological activity parameter representative for annual agricultural crop production systems (re_crop) and to estimate the effect of fallow (re_fallow). These parameters are based on the daily product of soil temperature and stored water that influence biological activity in the arable layer, and are used to adjust the decomposition rates of the ICBM SOC pools. We also tested re_crop and re_fallow on SOC stock change data for different site and treatment combinations from long-term field experiments located in some of the ecoregions. An re_crop value of 0.95 for western ecoregions was on average 0.23 units lower than that of the eastern ecoregions, indicating a lower decomposition rate of SOC. Although the estimated annual C inputs to soil for small-grain cereals were on average ≈7.5% higher in the eastern ecoregions (305 vs. 285 g C m-2 yr-1), the overall results suggest that the western ecoregions would have a greater potential to maintain high SOC levels in the long term. However, these parameters varied between ecoregions and, consequently, the SOC sequestration potential was not always higher for the western ecoregions. The effect of fallow was on average ≈0.04, i.e., SOC decomposed slightly faster under fallow. Predictions for 24 out of 33 site and treatment combinations across Canada were significantly improved (P = 0.003), compared with a previous application with the ICBM that did not differentiate between crops and fallow. The methodology used here enabled us to examine regional differences in the potential for SOC sequestration as a balance between annual C inputs to soil and soil biological activity.","Agroecosystems; Annual C inputs; Climate; Fallow; Soil biological activity","agricultural ecosystem; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; crop production; ecoregion; fallow; modeling; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil property; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56849122720

The generation of input information from regulatory emission inventories compatible with the requirements of eulerian chemical-transport models needs a computationally efficient, reliable, and flexible emissions data processing system. The Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel System (SMOKE) was developed in the United States and redesigned by the US Environmental Protection Agency to support air quality modelling activities in the framework of the USEPA Models-3 system. In this contribution the adaptation of the SMOKE system to European conditions is discussed. The system has been applied to the Iberian Peninsula and the Madrid Region (Spain) to process Spain's official emission inventories and projections for the years 2000 and 2010. This software tool has been found useful to generate emission input information for the CMAQ model as well as providing a valuable platform for emission scenario analysis. The model has been proved flexible enough to accommodate and process emissions based on the EMEP/CORINAIR methodology, although the lack of meaningful ancillary information may hinder its application outside the US. This study has established a practical methodology for the adaptation of the SMOKE system to Spain and potentially to any other European country. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

By chance, an established large-scale experiment was partially burned in the 2002 Biscuit fire in southwestern Oregon. About 200 grid points were sampled across seven burned and seven unburned stands before and after the fire. Fire-related soil changes - including losses of soil organic and inorganic matter - were so large that they became complicated to measure. The 51 Mg·ha-1 of loose rocks on the soil surface after fire suggests erosion of 127 Mg·ha-1 of fine mineral soil, some of which likely left in the fire plume. After accounting for structural changes and erosion with a comparable-layers approach, combined losses from the O horizon and mineral soil totaled 23 MgC·ha-1 and 690 kg N·ha-1, of which 60% (C) and 57% (N) were lost from mineral horizons. Applying a fixed-depth calculation - commonly used in previous fire studies - that disregards structural changes and erosion led to underestimates of loss of nearly 50% for C and 25% for N. Although recent debate has centered on the effects of postwildfire forest management on wood, wildlife habitat, and fuels, this study indicates that more consideration should be given to the possible release of greenhouse gases and reduction of future forest productivity and CO2 uptake. © 2008 NRC.",,"Erosion; Fires; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Magnesium printing plates; Mineralogy; Minerals; Mining; Silica; Silicate minerals; Soil mechanics; Wood fuels; Before and after; Fire plumes; Forest managements; Forest productivities; Forest soils; Forest wildfires; Grid points; Inorganic matters; Mineral horizons; Mineral soils; Soil changes; Soil surfaces; Structural changes; Wildlife habitats; Soils; carbon dioxide; forest fire; forest soil; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil nitrogen; stand structure; wildfire; Fires; Forestry; Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Leakage; Magnesium; Minerals; Mining; Printing Plates; Silica; Silicates; North America; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549128251

Gemelli, 1, 20123 Milan, Italy","It is now widely recognized that technological change will play a substantial role in reducing GHG emissions without compromising economic growth; hence, any better understanding of the process of technological innovation is likely to increase our knowledge of mitigation possibilities and costs. This paper explores how international knowledge flows affect the dynamics of the domestic R&D sector and the main economic and environmental variables. The analysis is performed using WITCH, a dynamic regional model of the world economy, in which energy-related technological change is endogenous. The focus is on disembodied energy R&D international spillovers. The knowledge pool from which regions draw foreign ideas differs between High Income and Low Income countries. Absorption capacity is also endogenous in the model. The basic questions are as follows. Do knowledge spillovers enhance energy-related technological innovation in different regions of the world? Does the speed of innovation increase? Or do free-riding incentives prevail and international spillovers crowd out domestic R&D efforts? What is the role of domestic absorption capacity and of policies designed to enhance it? Do greenhouse gas stabilization costs drop in the presence of international technological spillovers? The new specification of the WITCH model presented in this paper enables us to answer these questions. Our analysis shows that international knowledge spillovers tend to increase free-riding incentives and decrease the investments in energy R&D. The strongest cuts in energy R&D investments are recorded among High Income countries, where international knowledge flows crowd out domestic R&D efforts. The overall domestic pool of knowledge, and thus total net GHG stabilization costs, remain largely unaffected. International spillovers, however, are also an important policy channel. We therefore analyze the implication of a policy-mix in which climate policy is combined with a technology policy designed to enhance absorption capacity in Low Income countries. Significant positive impacts on the costs of stabilizing GHG concentrations are singled out.

Parties of the Kyoto Protocol had the option to elect to account for direct human-induced carbon (C) sources and sinks from land management activities since 1990. The effect of age-class structure of a forest landscape resulting from past practices and disturbances before the reference year 1990 should be excluded, but methods for ""factoring out"" the effects of this age-class legacy on carbon emissions and removals are lacking. The legacy effect can be strong and can even overwhelm effects of post-1990 management. It therefore needs to be ""factored out"", i.e., removed from the direct human-induced post-1990 effects. In this study we examine how the contributions to forest biomass carbon stock changes of (1) past (pre-1990) disturbances and harvest and (2) recent (post-1990) changes in forest management can be differentiated in present and future observable carbon dynamics in managed forest ecosystems. We also calculate the consequences of different accounting rules for the magnitude and direction of accountable C stock changes in European countries in the period 2013-2017. Different accounting approaches are compared in terms of applicability and their ability to provide incentives for management changes to increase carbon sinks and reduce carbon sources. We demonstrate implications of the various ways of accounting for a sample of European countries with different initial age-class structures. The current forest age-class distribution in countries determines whether and how many credits can be created by the various accounting approaches. We suggest an approach that includes a dynamic, forward-looking baseline as reference and list options to define such a baseline. Accounting of recent management change against such a baseline factors out the contribution of the legacy effect to accounting results and only rewards the effect of recent changes in forest management practices in support of climate change mitigation. We demonstrate that relatively simple, state-of-the-art forest models can factor out effects of past practices and past disturbances on present and future carbon stock changes. Factoring out of past practice effects is thus technically feasible but the numerical results are highly dependent on the choice of baseline which will be subject to negotiation. It is possible, however, to select a dynamic baseline that represents ""business-as-usual"", and to isolate and account for only the changes in management. Changes in accounting rules will always be advantageous for some countries and disadvantageous for others, but using a dynamic ""business-as-usual"" baseline effectively removes the legacy of pre-1990 age-class effects, and thus overcomes one of the acknowledged shortcomings of the current accounting approach. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These systems are very useful to collect data, but cannot be used to forecast the probable spread of the virus in coming years. Such forecasts, if proven reliable, would permit preventive measures to be put into place at the appropriate level of expected risk and at the appropriate time. It is within this context that the Multi-Agent GeoSimulation approach has been selected to develop a system that simulates the interactions of populations of mosquitoes and birds over space and time in relation to the spread and transmission of WNV. This simulation takes place in a virtual mapping environment representing a large administrative territory (e.g. province, state) and carried out under various climate scenarios in order to simulate the effects of vector control measures such as larviciding at scales of 1/20 000 or smaller. Results: After setting some hypotheses, a conceptual model and system architecture were developed to describe the population dynamics and interactions of mosquitoes (genus Culex) and American crows, which were chosen as the main actors in the simulation. Based on a mathematical compartment model used to simulate the population dynamics, an operational prototype was developed for the Southern part of Quebec (Canada). The system allows users to modify the parameters of the model, to select various climate and larviciding scenarios, to visualize on a digital map the progression (on a weekly or daily basis) of the infection in and around the crows' roosts and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the populations. The basic units for visualisation are municipalities. Conclusion: In all likelihood this system might be used to support short term decision-making related to WNV vector control measures, including the use of larvicides, according to climatic scenarios. Once fully calibrated in several real-life contexts, this promising approach opens the door to the study and management of other zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease. © 2008 Bouden et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"computer simulation; decision making; disease spread; disease transmission; forecasting method; health risk; mosquito; numerical model; public health; risk assessment; virus; Canada; North America; Quebec [Canada]; Aves; Corvidae; Corvus brachyrhynchos; West Nile virus; animal; article; biological model; Canada; climate; computer simulation; crow; Culex; decision support system; disease carrier; epidemic; geographic information system; growth, development and aging; human; methodology; risk management; virology; virus infection; West Nile flavivirus; Animals; Climate; Computer Simulation; Crows; Culex; Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; Disease Outbreaks; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Insect Vectors; Models, Biological; Quebec; Risk Management; West Nile Fever; West Nile virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749132010

We consider principally selected seismic events reported by Molchanov et al. (2006). These authors studied the VLF signals radiated by ground transmitters and received on board the DEMETER micro-satellite. They revealed a drop of the signals (scattering spot) connected with the occurrence of large earthquakes. In our investigations, we proceed to a spectral analysis of ICE observations with the aim to find if the natural ionospheric VLF/ELF emissions show, or not, a similar ''drop'' in the intensity as it is the case of the VLF transmitter signal. We combine our results with those of Molchanov et al. (2006), and we discuss the origin of such interesting ionospheric features in the frame of the investigation of the pre-seismic electromagnetic emissions. We show that the geomagnetic activity is a key parameter which could disturb the natural VLF ionospheric emissions, and also the transmitter signal. We find that it is not possible to conclude the presence, or not, of a preseismic effect when the Kp-index is higher than one. © 2008.

This system is a particularly challenging one because nitrogen dioxide exists as a mixture of monomers (NO2) and dimers (N2O4) under certain pressure and temperature conditions. The chemical equilibrium between N2O4 and 2NO2 and the vapor-liquid equilibriumof CO2 + NO 2/N2O4 mixtures were simulated using simultaneously the reaction ensemble and the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (RxMC and GEMC) methods. Rigid all atoms molecular potentials bearing point charges were proposed to model both NO2 and N2O4 species. Liquid-vapor coexistence properties of the reacting NO 2/N2O4 system were first investigated. The calculated vapor pressures and coexisting densities were compared to experimental values, leading to an average deviation of 10% for vapor pressures and 6% for liquid densities. The critical region was also addressed successfully using the subcritical Monte Carlo simulation results and some appropriate scaling laws. Predictions of CO2 + NO2/N2O 4 phase diagrams at 300, 313, and 330 K were then proposed. Derivative properties calculations were also performed in the reaction ensemble at constant pressure and temperature for both NO2/N2O 4 and CO2 + NO2/N2O4 systems. The calculated heat capacities show a maximum in the temperature range where N2O4 dissociation occurs, in agreement with available experimental data. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Chemical sensors; Experiments; Hydrostatic pressure; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Oligomers; Phase diagrams; Phase equilibria; Thermodynamics; Vapor pressure; Vapors; Average deviations; Bearing points; Chemical equilibriums; Constant pressures; Critical regions; Experimental datums; Experimental values; Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo; Heat capacities; Liquid densities; Molecular potentials; Molecular simulations; Monte carlo; Monte Carlo simulations; Nitrogen dioxides; Pressure and temperatures; Temperature ranges; Monte Carlo methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149175633

Amongst the emission reduction regimes being considered is that of Contraction and Convergence; conceived by Global Commons Institute (GCI) as a practical interpretation of the philosophy that ""every adult on the planet has an equal right to emit greenhouse gases"". To support the Contraction and Convergence regime, the GCI have developed a computer model, CCOptions, to correlate CO2 stabilisation levels with global, regional and national carbon reduction targets. This paper analyses the model, concluding that, whilst the aim of CCOptions is laudable, the application of the model in its current form is unnecessarily ambitious and as a consequence potentially misleading to all but the well-informed user. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Computer systems; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Philosophical aspects; Carbon reductions; Computer models; Emission reductions; Global Commons institutes; Kyoto agreements; Kyoto protocols; Stabilisation; Shrinkage; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; convergence; emission control; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; philosophy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56549105948

Planktic forms dominate the fossil diatom assemblages throughout this record, but changes in species dominance indicate varying nutrient levels over time, particularly phosphorus. The changes in the nutrient concentrations in the lake were probably driven by changes in temperature and wind strength that affected the duration of water-column mixing and thus the extent of nutrient recycling from deep waters. Prior to 2100 cal before present (BP), Stephanodiscus minutulus and Synedra tenera dominated, suggesting long cool springs with extensive regeneration of phosphorus from the hypolimnion that resulted from isothermal mixing. From 2100 to 800 cal BP, these species were replaced by Cyclotella michiganiana and Cyclotella bodanica. These species are characteristic of lower nutrient concentrations and are interpreted here to reflect warm summers with long periods of thermal stratification. From 800 to 50 cal BP, S. minutulus dominated the diatom assemblage, suggesting a return to lengthy mixing during spring.

In the long-term, its response to temperature is uncertain. One reason for this is because in field experiments increases in respiration due to warming are relatively short-lived. The explanations proposed for this ephemeral response include depletion of fast-cycling, soil carbon pools and thermal adaptation of microbial respiration. Using a > 15 year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude forest, we show that the apparent 'acclimation' of soil respiration at the ecosystem scale results from combined effects of reductions in soil carbon pools and microbial biomass, and thermal adaptation of microbial respiration. Mass-specific respiration rates were lower when seasonal temperatures were higher, suggesting that rate reductions under experimental warming likely occurred through temperature-induced changes in the microbial community.

Measurements of hydrology, nutrients, and aboveground net primary productivity were made from September 1998 through March 2002. Accretion measurements were made in October 2000 and October 2004. The major hydrologic inputs to the system were the effluent, precipitation, and back water flooding from Lake Pontchartrain. Nutrient levels were generally low except in the immediate vicinity of the outfall. Mean net primary production of the freshwater forest system was significantly higher downstream of the effluent discharge (1202 g m-2 yr-1) compared to the control site (799 g m-2 yr-1). Downstream of the outfall, accretion rates were double the rate of relative sea level rise in the area. Removal efficiencies of N and P were as high as 75% and 95%, respectively. The relatively constant flow of secondarily treated municipal effluent buffered the downstream area from salinity intrusion during a region-wide drought. Re-direction of nutrient-enhanced effluents from open water bodies to wetland ecosystems can maintain plant productivity, sequester carbon, and maintain coastal wetland elevations in response to sea-level rise in addition to improving overall surface water quality, reducing energy use, and increasing financial savings.","Forest productivity; Loading rate; Louisiana; Nutrients; Retention time; USA; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands","Earth sciences; Effluents; Forestry; Industrial management; Photosynthesis; Pollution; Water; Water pollution; Wetlands; Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP); Assimilation system; Effluent discharges; Louisiana; Net primary production (NPP); Nutrient dynamics; Nutrient levels; Precipitation (metallography); Primary production (PP); Water flooding; Wetland ecosystems; Nutrients; accretion; effluent; measurement method; nutrient dynamics; primary production; saline intrusion; urban area; wetland; Deposition; Ecosystems; Effluents; Flooding; Forestry; Hydrology; Measurement; Nutrients; Photosynthesis; Precipitation; Productivity; Salinity; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Wetlands; Lake Pontchartrain; Louisiana; Mandeville [Louisiana]; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48549102228

Methods were developed and applied in a Northern California case study. An ensemble of 59 twentieth century climate simulations from 17 WCRP CMIP3 models was analyzed to evaluate relative model credibility associated with a 75-member projection ensemble from the same 17 models. Credibility was assessed based on how models realistically reproduced selected statistics of historical climate relevant to California climatology. Metrics of this credibility were used to derive relative model weights leading to weight-threshold culling of models contributing to the projection ensemble. Density functions were then estimated for two projected quantities (temperature and precipitation), with and without considering credibility-based ensemble reductions. An analysis for Northern California showed that, while some models seem more capable at recreating limited aspects twentieth century climate, the overall tendency is for comparable model performance when several credibility measures are combined. Use of these metrics to decide which models to include in density function development led to local adjustments to function shapes, but led to limited affect on breadth and central tendency, which were found to be more influenced by ""completeness"" of the original ensemble in terms of models and emissions pathways. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Air pollution; Probability density function; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Business media; California; Case studies; Climate projection; Climate research; Climate simulations; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2); Data sets; Density functions; Emissions (asphalt); Metrics (CO); Model performance; Multi modeling; Precipitation (metallography); Twentieth century; Risk assessment; atmospheric modeling; data set; emission; estimation method; risk assessment; twentieth century; California; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749119593

We review existing knowledge on interactive influences of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, temperature and soil moisture on plant growth, development and yield as well as on plant water use efficiency (WUE) and physiological and uptake efficiencies of soil-immobile nutrients. Elevated atmospheric CO 2 will increase leaf and canopy photosynthesis, especially in C3 plants, with minor changes in dark respiration. Additional CO2 will increase biomass without marked alteration in dry matter partitioning, reduce transpiration of most plants and improve WUE. However, spatiotemporal variation in these attributes will impact agronomic performance and crop water use in a site-specific manner. Nutrient acquisition is closely associated with overall biomass and strongly influenced by root surface area. When climate change alters soil factors to restrict root growth, nutrient stress will occur. Plant size may also change but nutrient concentration will remain relatively unchanged; therefore, nutrient removal will scale with growth. Changes in regional nutrient requirements will be most remarkable where we alter cropping systems to accommodate shifts in ecozones or alter farming systems to capture new uses from existing systems. For regions and systems where we currently do an adequate job managing nutrients, we stand a good chance of continued optimization under a changed climate. If we can and should do better, climate change will not help us. © Physiologia Plantarum 2008.",,"water; conference paper; crop; greenhouse effect; metabolism; Crops, Agricultural; Greenhouse Effect; Water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47149116466

By grading land quality, the resulting information is particularly relevant for planners and managers, and for land valuation. Higher-grade land is more flexible and has more options for land use. Using Scotland as a case study, a widely-used land capability system was adapted to investigate the influence of recent and future climate change on land-use potential. The adapted method was applied to both interpolated gridded weather station data and to future climate change scenarios derived from the HadRM3 climate model. At a national scale, differing regional patterns of land capability were recognised, with changes in these patterns occurring in recent decades and projected to occur on a more substantial scale into the future. In general, climate change is acting to enhance land-use potential in Scotland, mainly in the drier east, while the west remains constrained by its wetter climate. These results demonstrate the key control directed by soil moisture values on land-use options, in addition to temperature change. Shifts in land-use potential have implications for both strategic resource planning and for developing anticipatory climate change adaptation actions. The land capability assessment highlights not only potential changes in agriculture and other productive land uses, but also repercussions for biodiversity and terrestrial carbon stocks. Various amendments are suggested to the land capability procedures to reflect existing or emerging climate-related issues that were not considered necessary in the original system, notably excessive soil moisture deficits. © Inter-Research 2008.","Accumulated temperature; Agriculture; Climate change; Land capability; Land suitability; Land-use 'change; Soil moisture","Agriculture; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Biodiversity; Climate change; Climatology; Interpolation; Land use; Mathematical models; agricultural land; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; land evaluation; land use planning; soil moisture; Eurasia; Europe; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54849422201

On average, people spend around 90% of their time indoors (homes, workplaces, cars and public transport means, etc.) and are exposed to a complex mixture of pollutants at concentration levels that are often several times higher than outdoors. These pollutants are emitted by different sources indoors and outdoors and include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbonyls (aldehydes and ketones) and other chemical substances often adsorbed on particles. Moreover, legal obligations opposed by legislations, such as the European Union's General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), increasingly require detailed understanding of where and how chemical substances are used throughout their life-cycle and require better characterisation of their emissions and exposure. This information is essential to be able to control emissions from sources aiming at a reduction of adverse health effects. Scientifically sound human risk assessment procedures based on qualitative and quantitative human exposure information allows a better characterisation of population exposures to chemical substances. In this context, the current paper compares inhalation exposures to three health-based EU priority substances, i.e. benzene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Materials and methods: Distributions of urban population inhalation exposures, indoor and outdoor concentrations were created on the basis of measured AIRMEX data in 12 European cities and compared to results from existing European population exposure studies published within the scientific literature. By pooling all EU city personal exposure, indoor and outdoor concentration means, representative EU city cumulative frequency distributions were created. Population exposures were modelled with a microenvironment model using the time spent and concentrations in four microenvironments, i.e. indoors at home and at work, outdoors at work and in transit, as input parameters. Pooled EU city inhalation exposures were compared to modelled population exposures. The contributions of these microenvironments to the total daily inhalation exposure of formaldehyde, benzene and acetaldehyde were estimated. Inhalation exposures were compared to the EU annual ambient benzene air quality guideline (5 μg/m3-to be met by 2010) and the recommended (based on the INDEX project) 30-min average formaldehyde limit value (30 μg/m3). Results: Indoor inhalation exposure contributions are much higher compared to the outdoor or in-transit microenvironment contributions, accounting for almost 99% in the case of formaldehyde. The highest in-transit exposure contribution was found for benzene; 29.4% of the total inhalation exposure contribution. Comparing the pooled AIRMEX EU city inhalation exposures with the modelled exposures, benzene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde exposures are 5.1, 17.3 and 11.8 μg/m3 vs. 5.1, 20.1 and 10.2 μg/m3, respectively. Together with the fact that a dominating fraction of time is spent indoors (&gt;90%), the total inhalation exposure is mostly driven by the time spent indoors. Discussion: The approach used in this paper faced three challenges concerning exposure and time-activity data, comparability and scarce or missing in-transit data inducing careful interpretation of the results. The results obtained by AIRMEX underline that many European urban populations are still exposed to elevated levels of benzene and formaldehyde in the inhaled air. It is still likely that the annual ambient benzene air quality guideline of 5 μg/m3 in the EU and recommended formaldehyde 30-min average limit value of 30 μg/m3 are exceeded by a substantial part of populations living in urban areas. Considering multimedia and multi-pathway exposure to acetaldehyde, the biggest exposure contribution was found to be related to dietary behaviour rather than to inhalation. Conclusions: In the present study, inhalation exposures of urban populations were assessed on the basis of novel and existing exposure data. The indoor residential microenvironment contributed most to the total daily urban population inhalation exposure. The results presented in this paper suggest that a significant part of the populations living in European cities exceed the annual ambient benzene air quality guideline of 5 μg/m3 in the EU and recommended (INDEX project) formaldehyde 30-min average limit value of 30 μg/m3. Recommendations and perspectives: To reduce exposures and consequent health effects, adequate measures must be taken to diminish emissions from sources such as materials and products that especially emit benzene and formaldehyde in indoor air. In parallel, measures can be taken aiming at reducing the outdoor pollution contribution indoors. Besides emission reduction, mechanisms to effectively monitor and manage the indoor air quality should be established. These mechanisms could be developed by setting up appropriate EU indoor air guidelines. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","AIRMEX; Exposure assessment; Exposure determinants; Exposure modelling; INDEX; Indoor air quality; Inhalation exposure; Time-activity data","acetaldehyde; benzene; formaldehyde; acetaldehyde; air quality; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; European Union; formaldehyde; health risk; indoor air; measurement method; pollution exposure; public health; urban pollution; urban population; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; article; chemical model; comparative study; computer simulation; European Union; exposure; human; indoor air pollution; urban population; Acetaldehyde; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Benzene; Computer Simulation; European Union; Formaldehyde; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Models, Chemical; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349143147

With this algorithm, the model produces a mean diurnal cycle of <0.5 K over most oceanic regions and >0.5 K primarily in tropical and subtropical oceans of the summer hemisphere with isolated areas of >2 K. The diurnal cycle in air temperature is substantially increased over regions with large skin SST diurnal cycles, and the enhanced diurnal cycle agrees better with the TAO buoy data over the equatorial Pacific. There is also a significant effect on the diurnal cycle in precipitation particularly in the increased hourly maximum precipitation over the Bay of Bengal and the western Pacific in boreal summer. These changes to the diurnal cycle in SST affect the seasonal climatologies in the model with improved seasonal mean precipitation mainly in the tropics following similar patterns to the hourly maximum precipitation rates. The near-surface flow across the Indian subcontinent is also increased during the summer monsoon resulting in higher seasonal precipitation over the Bay of Bengal.

In this study, we assess the potential economic viability of biomass production in the South Australian River Murray Corridor and quantify the resultant benefits for local and global scale environmental objectives. We model the spatial distribution of economically viable biomass production in a Geographic Information System and quantify the model sensitivity and uncertainty using Monte Carlo analysis. The total potentially viable area for biomass production under the Most Likely Scenario is 360,728 ha (57.7% of the dryland agricultural area), producing over 3 million tonnes of green biomass per annum, with a total Net Present Value over 100 years of A$ 88 million. The salinity in the River Murray could be reduced by 2.65 EC (μS/cm) over a 100-year timeframe, and over 96,000 ha of land with high wind erosion potential could be stabilised over a much shorter period. With sufficient generating capacity, our Most Likely Scenario suggests that economically viable biomass production could reduce carbon emissions by over 1.7 million tonnes per annum through the production of renewable energy and a reduced reliance on coal-based electricity generation. Our analyses suggest that biomass production is a potentially viable alternative agricultural system that can have substantial local scale environmental benefits with complimentary global scale benefits for climate change mitigation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Such uptake has not been observed when measurements were made with closed-path analyzers, chambers, or profile methods, suggesting it is an artifact due in some way to the use of open-path analyzers. In this study, a series of laboratory tests and field experiments were conducted to determine the magnitude of the instrument surface heat exchange in the open path and its relationship with the measured CO2 flux. Results showed that (1) the surface of an open-path instrument became substantially warmer than ambient due to electronics and radiation load during daytime, while at night, radiative cooling moderated temperature increases in the path; (2) high-frequency temperature measurements inside the path were correlated with vertical wind speed producing sensible heat flux inside the instrument path exceeding the ambient heat flux by up to 14%; (3) enclosing the open-path instrument eliminated the sensible heat flux in the path, and caused measured CO2 flux to match a closed-path reference; (4) using sensible heat flux measured directly inside the open path in the WPL term instead of the ambient sensible heat flux also led to a match in CO2 flux between open-path instrument and closed-path reference; and (5) correcting previously collected open-path CO2 flux data was possible by estimating the instrument heating effect with a semi-empirical model using standard weather variables. Results showed that all proposed techniques led to a significant reduction in apparent CO2 uptake during off-season periods and to a reduction of the underestimation of CO2 release in other periods. Close agreement between the open-path measurements and closed-path references was achieved in all cases. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Carbon budget; Carbon dioxide exchange; Closed path; CO2 flux; Density correction; Gas analyzer; Heat exchange; Open path; Sensible heat flux; Surface heating; WPL","carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; cooling; eddy covariance; field method; laboratory method; sensible heat flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949120710

Although, Phragmites has high rates of primary production, it is not known whether this species supports lower trophic levels of a marsh food web in the same manner as Spartina. Using several related photochemical and biological assays, we compared patterns of organic matter flow of plant primary production through a key salt marsh metazoan, the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa), using a bacterial intermediate. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was derived from plants collected from a Delaware Bay salt marsh and grown in the laboratory with 14C-CO2. Bacterial utilization of plant-derived DOM measured as carbon mineralization revealed that both species provided bioavailable DOM to native salt marsh bacteria. Total carbon mineralization after 19 days was higher for Spartina treatments (36% 14CO2±3 SE) compared with Phragmites treatments (29% ±2 SE; Wilcoxon-Kruskal-Wallis rank sums test, P&lt;0.01). Pre-exposing DOM to natural sunlight only enhanced or decreased bioavailability of the DOM to the bacterioplankton during initial measurements (e.g., 7 days or less) but these differences were not significant over the course of the incubations. Mixtures of 14C-labeled bacterioplankton (and possibly organic flocs) from 14C-DOM treatments were cleared by G. demissa at similar rates between Spartina and Phragmites treatments. Moreover, 14C assimilation efficiencies for material ingested by mussels were high for both plant sources ranging from 74% to 90% and not significantly different between plant sources. Sunlight exposure did not affect the nutritional value of the bacterioplankton DOM assemblage for mussels. There are many possible trophic and habitat differences between Spartina- and Phragmites-dominated marshes that could affect G. demissa but the fate of vascular plant dissolved organic carbon in the DOM to bacterioplankton to mussel trophic pathway appears comparable between these marsh types. © 2008 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Dissolved organic matter; Geukensia demissa; Phragmites australis; Spartina alterniflora; Trophic linkages","bacterioplankton; bacterium; bioassay; bioavailability; biological invasion; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; comparative study; dissolved organic matter; dominance; food web; grass; mineralization; mollusc; primary production; radiation exposure; saltmarsh; trophic level; vascular plant; Delaware Bay; North America; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms); Geukensia demissa; Metazoa; Phragmites; Phragmites australis; Spartina; Spartina alterniflora; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749132796

Since the limitations of brightfield and polarized light microscopy for foreign body analysis are well known, a method was applied that ensures the detailed histological assessment of nonbirefringent particles in periprosthetic soft and hard tissue. Cemented and cementless interface regions of five selected autopsy hip implant cases (2 X Endo-Modell Mark III, LINK, 1 X St. Georg Mark II, LINK, Germany; 2 X Spongiosa Metal II, ESKA, Germany) were viewed under darkfield illumination and subsequently analyzed with proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Eight autopsy cases without implants served as controls. Using darkfield illumination technique, metallic particles became visible as luminous points under the microscope. The majority of particles in the samples from the cemented cases were degradation products of radiopaque bone cement. There was minimal evidence of metallic alloy particles in the soft tissues. However, a considerable quantity of heavy metal cobalt (Co) was found in the periprosthetic mineralized bone tissue, which was not observed in the controls. The periprosthetic concentration of cobalt ranged from 38 to 413 ppm. The findings demonstrate a correlation between cobalt concentration, time since implantation, and distance from the implant.

OLC samples were initially prepared by annealing nanodiamonds (3-20 nm in diameter) at 1800 K in vacuum. The resulting OLC consists of closed fullerene-like shells. The 'closed' OLC was subsequently treated with carbon dioxide at 1020 K in order to open the carbon shells by partial oxidation to create 'opened' OLC. Core level and valence band photoelectron spectroscopy have been employed in characterizing the changes in electronic structure of the samples. Upon intercalation of the closed OLC with K the C1s core level and valence band features shift to higher binding energies and the density of states at the Fermi level increases, while this effect is significantly smaller for intercalated opened OLC. These results indicate that opening the shells of carbon onions allows potassium to penetrate inside the particles and thus opens up a possible route to fill carbon onions with desired substances and their application as nanocapsules. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The growth conditions were substrate temperatures of 323 K, 573 K and 773 K and cathode voltage of -400 V, corresponding to 30 W of forward power. The samples were studied by micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and optical transmittance. The films are remarkably transparent in the visible range, with transmittances about 88% at 400 nm and band gap energies above the absorption edge of the glass substrates. Although only the samples prepared at 773 K present defined diffraction peaks, the analysis of the Raman spectra indicate that samples prepared at 323 K and 573 K have a defined microstructure indeed. The spectra fitting performed by comparison with pattern compounds demonstrate that Cd-Te-O films are formed of Te-O units similar to those present in metal oxide-doped tellurite glasses, such as TeO3 and TeO3 + 1 linked through Cd-O bonds. As the substrate temperature increases the microstructure evolves from a γ-TeO2 richer state to CdxTeyOz. In the crystalline sample the main phase identified was CdTeO3 even though evidence of other phases was observed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

First, we physically mapped D8 at ∼300 kb 3′ of Tb1. Second, we analyzed patterns of nucleotide variation at Tb1, D8, and seven short regions (400-700 bp) located in the Tb1-D8 region sequenced on a 40 maize inbred lines panel encompassing early-flowering temperate and late-flowering tropical lines. The pattern of polymorphism along the region is characterized by two valleys of depleted polymorphism while the region in between exhibits an appreciable amount of diversity. Our results reveal that a region ∼100 kb upstream of the D8 gene exhibits hallmarks of divergent selection between temperate and tropical lines and is likely closer than the D8 gene to the target of selection for climate adaptation. Selection in the tropical lines appears more recent than in the temperate lines, suggesting an initial domestication of early-flowering maize. Simulation results indicate that the polymorphism pattern is consistent with two interfering selective sweeps at Tb1 and D8.

Such models couple a dynamic representation of traffic with noise emission laws. The contribution of the paper is to test different traffic and noise source representations for LAeq and statistical levels estimation. Tests on four scenarios that reflect urban traffic conditions are carried on. They show that an individualized representation of vehicles with a macroscopic behavior rule is sufficient for noise descriptors estimation. Noise sources have to be aggregated on cells to reduce the calculation time of noise emission propagation. To this end a grid of line source representation appears to be more relevant than a grid of point source representation. Furthermore, large cells do not affect substantially the noise descriptors estimation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Addressing the environmental impact calls for building specific models for studying both local and global emissions. In this framework, the adoption of natural gas-fueled DG cogeneration technologies may provide, as a consequence of cogeneration enhanced overall energy efficiency and of natural gas relatively low carbon content, a significant reduction of global impact in terms of CO2 emissions with respect to the separate production of electricity and heat. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the DG alternatives should take into account as well the impact due to the presence of plants spread over the territory that could increase the local pollution, in particular due to CO and NOx, and thus could worsen the local air quality. This paper provides an overview on the characterization of the emissions from small-scale natural gas-fueled cogeneration systems, with specific reference to the DG technologies nowadays most available in the market, namely, microturbines and internal combustion engines. The corresponding local and global environmental impacts are evaluated by using the emission balance approach. A numerical case study with two representative machines highlights their different emission characteristics, also considering the partial-load emission performance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The reliability of ocean models in projecting oceanic CO2 uptake is fundamentally dependent on their skills in simulating ocean circulation and air-sea gas exchange. In this study we demonstrate how a model simulation of multiple tracers and utilization of a variety of observational data help us to obtain additional information about the parameterization of ocean circulation and air-sea gas exchange, relative to approaches that use only a single tracer. The benefit of using multiple tracers is based on the fact that individual tracer holds unique information with regard to ocean mixing, circulation, and air-sea gas exchange. In a previous modeling study, we have shown that the simulation of radiocarbon enables us to identify the importance of parameterizing sub-grid scale ocean mixing processes in terms of diffusive mixing along constant density surface (isopycnal mixing) and the inclusion of the effect of mesoscale eddies. In this study we show that the simulation of phosphate, a major macronutrient in the ocean, helps us to detect a weak isopycnal mixing in the upper ocean that does not show up in the radiocarbon simulation. We also show that the simulation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) reveals excessive upwelling in the Southern Ocean, which is also not apparent in radiocarbon simulations. Furthermore, the updated ocean inventory data of man-made radiocarbon produced by nuclear tests (bomb 14C) enable us to recalibrate the rate of air-sea gas exchange. The progressive modifications made in the model based on the simulation of additional tracers and utilization of updated observational data overall improve the model's ability to simulate ocean circulation and air-sea gas exchange, particularly in the Southern Ocean, and has great consequence for projected CO2 uptake. Simulated global ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from pre-industrial time to the present day by both previous and updated models are within the range of observational-based estimates, but with substantial regional difference, especially in the Southern Ocean. By year 2100, the updated model estimated CO2 uptake are 531 and 133 PgC (1PgC=1015 gram carbon) for the global and Southern Ocean respectively, whereas the previous version model estimated values are 540 and 190 PgC. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon; Cobalt compounds; model simulations; Ocean carbon cycle; Ocean modelling; Climate change; air-sea interaction; carbon cycle; climate change; gas exchange; learning; mixing; observational method; oceanic circulation; phosphate; tracer; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46649104731

The factors controlling surface O3 concentrations are discussed initially to provide a basis for the ensuing discussion, followed by a summary of the evidence for recent trends in ground-level ozone concentrations, i.e. over the past 3 decades, which have shown a significant increase in the annual average in 'background' air typical of the unpolluted northern hemisphere. Closer to precursor sources, although urban winter concentrations have increased, rural peak spring and summer concentrations during ozone 'episodes' have decreased markedly in response to emissions reductions. In order to determine whether such trends are meaningful, the statistical techniques for determining temporal trends are reviewed. The possible causes of long-term trends in ozone are then discussed, with particular reference to the use of chemistry-transport models to interpret past trends. Such models are also used to make predictions of future trends in surface ozone concentrations, but few are comprehensive in integrating future climate changes with changes in land use and in emissions of ozone precursors. Guidance is given on the likely effects of climate/precursor/chemistry interactions so that model predictions can be judged. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

California is now embarking on a similar project: implementing the country's most ambitious greenhouse gas emissions limitations, including rolling back the state's emissions to J990 levels by 2020. The state's leadership on climate change legislation deserves significant praise. But the hard work in actually achieving emissions limits is just beginning. In this Essay, Professor Ann Carlson provides a case study of the country's largest municipally owned utility-the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP)-and the challenges it will face in holding its emissions to J 990 levels by 2020. The case study is particularly useful to anticipate challenges utilities across the country will face if the federal government also mandates greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The DWP's energy mix, with its heavy reliance on coal, looks quite similar to the energy mix of the country as a whole (and quite afferent from the rest of California's electricity market). The challenges are daunting. They include shifting rapidly to renewable energy sources in the face of labor pressures to have DWP own its own sources; building miles of transmission lines to bring the renewable energy to DWP's customer base; repowering natural gas facilities while attempting to comply with stringent Clean Water Act requirements; and eliminating the utility's reliance on coal over the next two decades. These efforts will raise complex environmental and other value clashes, pitting those concerned about jobs, water pollution, species protection, and aesthetic harms against a utility admirably committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Whether and how we resolve these clashes remains an open and contested question.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349119033

A methodology for predicting future market penetration of DER that considers economics and emission factors was used to estimate the most likely implementation of DER. The methodology results in spatially and temporally resolved emission profiles of criteria pollutants that are subsequently introduced into a detailed atmospheric chemistry and transport model of the region. The DER technology determined by the methodology includes 62% reciprocating engines, 34% gas turbines, and 4% fuel cells and other emerging technologies. The introduction of DER leads to retirement of 2625 MW of existing power plants for which emissions are removed from the inventory. The air quality model predicts maximum differences in air pollutant concentrations that are located downwind from the central power plants that were removed from the domain. Maximum decreases in hourly peak ozone concentrations due to DER use are 10 ppb and are located over the state of New Jersey. Maximum decreases in 24-hr average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations reach 3 μg/m3 and are located off the coast of New Jersey and New York. The main contribution to decreased PM2.5 is the reduction of sulfate levels due to significant reductions in direct emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx) from the DER compared with the central power plants removed. The scenario presented here represents an accelerated DER penetration case with aggressive emission reductions due to removal of highly emitting power plants. Such scenario provides an upper bound for air quality benefits of DER implementation scenarios.

Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with [111In]- diethylene triamine pentaacetate acid (DTPA)-octreotide is an accurate method for detecting neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) but often does not provide clear anatomical localisation of lesions. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical usefulness of anatomical-functional image fusion. Materials and methods. Fifty-four patients with known or suspected NET were included in the study. Planar and single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging was performed using a dual-head gamma camera equipped with an integrated X-ray transmission system, and the images were first interpreted alone by two nuclear medicine physicians and then compared with SPECT/CT fusion images together with a radiologist. The improvement provided by SPECT/CT in the interpretation of SPECT data alone and any modification in patientmanagement were recorded. Results. Fusion images improved SPECT interpretation in 23 cases, providing precise anatomical localisation of increased tracer uptake in 20 cases and disease exclusion in sites of physiological uptake in 5. In 10 patients, SPECT/CT allowed definition of the functional significance of lesions detected by diagnostic CT.

Two ships of equal tonnage with the same painted area as each other, which were built in Turkish shipyards, are compared in terms of VOCs produced during painting and coating. Total area of all painted surfaces and total paint consumption of a 3500 deadweight tonne (DWT) oil/chemical tanker and a general cargo ship are calculated. An improved model for calculating the surface emissions of VOCs from painting and coating processes is utilized. Material balance emission estimation approach is employed to calculate the amount of VOCs, since it is used most often where a relatively large amount of material is emitted during use, and/or all air emissions are uncaptured. For both ships calculated VOCs are presented in figures. For the years 2005 and 2006 the total deadweight tonnage of ships delivered in Tuzla region, where 42 shipyards are located, is known. Therefore, a linear estimation is made to guess the total annual VOC emissions caused by painting operations.

Conversely, precipitation of calcium carbonate by marine planktonic calcifiers such as coccolithophorids increases pCO2 and promotes its outgassing (i.e., the ""alkalinity pump""). Over the past ≈100 million years, these two carbon fluxes have been modulated by the relative abundance of diatoms and coccolithophores, resulting in biological feedback on atmospheric CO2 and Earth's climate; yet, the processes determining the relative distribution of these two phytoplankton taxa remain poorly understood. We analyzed phytoplankton community composition in the Atlantic Ocean and show that the distribution of diatoms and coccolithophorids is correlated with the nutricline depth, a proxy of nutrient supply to the upper mixed layer of the ocean. Using this analysis in conjunction with a coupled atmosphere-ocean intermediate complexity model, we predict a dramatic reduction in the nutrient supply to the euphotic layer in the coming century as a result of increased thermal stratification. Our findings indicate that, by altering phytoplankton community composition, this causal relationship may lead to a decreased efficiency of the biological pump in sequestering atmospheric CO2, implying a positive feedback in the climate system. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the connection between upper ocean dynamics, the calcium carbonate-to-organic C production ratio and atmospheric pCO2 variations on time scales ranging from seasonal cycles to geological transitions. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate change; Coccolithophorids; Diatoms; Stratification","calcium; calcium carbonate; carbon; carbon dioxide; lead; nitrogen; organic matter; article; Atlantic Ocean; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon dioxide tension; carbon dynamics; climate; climate change; diatom; geological time; human; microbial community; nonhuman; nutrient supply; phytoplankton; plankton; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; sea; seasonal variation; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Food; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Marine Biology; Oceans and Seas; Partial Pressure; Seasons; Bacillariophyta; Haptophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149512789

The integral membrane protein particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) mediates the facile conversion of methane to methanol in methanotrophic bacteria. Most evidence indicates that pMMO is a multicopper enzyme, and these copper ions support redox, dioxygen, and oxo-transfer chemistry. However, the exact identity of the copper species that mediates the oxo-transfer chemistry remains an area of intense debate. This highly complex enzyme is notoriously difficult to purify because of its instability outside the lipid bilayer and tendency to lose its essential metal cofactors. For this reason, pMMO has resisted both initial identification and subsequent isolation and purification for biochemical and biophysical characterization. In this Account, we describe evidence that pMMO is a multicopper protein. Its unique trinuclear copper cluster mediates dioxygen chemistry and O-atom transfer during alkane hydroxylation. Although a recent crystal structure did not show this tricopper cluster, we provide compelling evidence for such a cluster through redox potentiometry and EPR experiments on the ""holo"" enzyme in pMMO-enriched membranes. We also identify a site in the structure of pMMO that could accommodate this cluster. A hydrophobic pocket capable of harboring pentane, the enzyme's largest known substrate, lies adjacent to this site. In addition, we have designed and synthesized model tricopper clusters to provide further chemical evidence that a tricopper cluster mediates the enzyme's oxo-transfer chemistry. These biomimetic models exhibit similar spectroscopic properties and chemical reactivity to the putative tricopper cluster in pMMO. Based on computational analysis using density functional theory (DFT), triangular tricopper clusters are capable of harnessing a ""singlet oxene"" upon activation by dioxygen. An oxygen atom is then inserted via a concerted process into the C-H bond of an alkane in the transition state during hydroxylation. The turnover frequency and kinetic isotope effect predicted by DFT show excellent agreement with experimental data. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"copper; hydrocarbon; membrane protein; methane monooxygenase; oxygenase; article; chemistry; coenzyme; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Coenzymes; Copper; Hydrocarbons; Membrane Proteins; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygenases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51649104571

The study shows that information bias is asymmetrical. Respondents receiving only information on positive measures taken by the authority to reduce noise emission are more tolerant of the noise impact, but those receiving only critical views tend to be more annoyed because they feel that not all measures to reduce noise have been employed. Additionally people who use the line frequently are more tolerant to the noise impact than those who do not. Information bias seems to have a temporary masking effect over riding frequency lasting for a few weeks after railway opening. This suggest that whilst free flow of information provided by the authority can help alleviate annoyance response, encouraging the people affected to make use of the new infrastructure may be useful to reduce public resistance and noise annoyance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, the percent of the time with PSI &gt;100 in Taiwan has been reduced from 7% in 1994 to 4.3% in 2005, but there is still about 6.5% of the time with PSI &gt; 100 in the southern region in 2005, of which 77% is due to O3 contribution. The main goal of the present study is to develop a control strategy for reduction of NOx and NMHCs for reducing O3 levels. The maximum 1-h O3 isopleth profiles for southern Taiwan were first established based on 40 cases of different emission quantities of NOx and NMHCs using Taiwan Air Quality Model (TAQM) with four-level nested domains. The emission rates of O3 precursors from other regions are assumed to be constant and exert the same effect on the air quality under different weather conditions in southern Taiwan. To meet the air quality goals, the allowable capacity for NOx and NMHCs in this region was determined by the following two methods: (a) linear and (b) cumulated frequency. The allowable capacity of NOx and NMHC to meet a certain goal can be easily demonstrated by plotting arbitrary reduction lines in the O3 isopleth profiles. To meet the goal in the year 2011 (or O3 151 ppb from the cumulated frequency method), for example, the emission reduction NOx/NMHC for 1:4 case amounts to 75 and 300 ton d-1, respectively, for NOx and NMHC; the corresponding emission rates are 290 and 430 ton d-1 (or 21 and 41% reduction, respectively). Clearly, there are many possibilities for achieving the desirable goal by manipulating reduction quantities in both NOx and NMHC. © 2008.","Allowable capacity; Ozone control strategy; Ozone precursor; Photochemical grid model","Allowable capacity; Emission reductions; Ozone control strategy; Ozone precursor; Photochemical grid model; Air quality; hydrocarbon; nitric oxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; emission control; nitrogen oxides; ozone; photochemistry; standard (regulation); strategic approach; traffic emission; air quality; article; exhaust gas; industrial area; priority journal; scoring system; Taiwan; weather; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349126680

This paper presents a study assessing the impact of recently implemented municipal solid waste (MSW) reduction and recycling management strategies on the characteristics of waste feedstock for incineration in Taiwan. Through the periodic sampling of two typical MSW incineration plants, proximate and ultimate analyses were conducted according to standard methods to explore the influence of MSW reduction and recycling management strategies on incineration feed waste characteristics. It was observed that the annual amount of MSW generated in 2005 decreased by about 10% compared to 2003 and that the characteristics of MSW have changed significantly due to recent management strategies. The heating value of the MSW generated in Taiwan increased yearly by about 5% after program implementation. A comparison of the monthly variations in chemical concentrations indicated that the chlorine content in MSW has changed. This change results from usage reduction of PVC plastic due to the recycling fund management (RFM) program, and the food waste as well as salt content reduction due to the total recycling for kitchen garbage program. This achievement will improve the reduction of dioxin emissions from MSW incineration. In summary, management strategies must be conducted in tandem with the global trend to achieve a zero-waste-discharge country. When implementing these strategies and planning for future MSW management systems, it is important to consider the changes that may occur in the composition and characteristics of MSW over time. © 2007.",,"ABS resins; Air pollution; Chlorine; Incineration; Management; Materials science; Planning; Polyvinyl chlorides; Recycling; Solid wastes; Waste management; Chemical concentrations; Chlorine contents; Dioxin emissions; Food wastes; Global trends; Heating values; Implementing; Incineration plants; Kitchen garbages; Management strategies; Management systems; Municipal solid wastes; Periodic samplings; Program implementations; Recycling funds; Recycling managements; Salt contents; Standard methods; Ultimate analysis; Waste incineration; incineration; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste management; animal food; article; incineration; municipal solid waste; priority journal; recycling; solid waste management; Taiwan; Conservation of Natural Resources; Plastics; Refuse Disposal; Taiwan; Time Factors; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54149090884

Consequently, efforts to mitigate climate change through modification of one pathway, as with carbon in the Kyoto Protocol, only partially address the issue of ecosystem-climate interactions. For example, the cooling of climate that results from carbon sequestration by plants may be partially offset by reduced land albedo, which increases solar energy absorption and warms the climate. The relative importance of these effects varies with spatial scale and latitude. We suggest that consideration of multiple interactions and feedbacks could lead to novel, potentially useful climate-mitigation strategies, including greenhouse-gas reductions primarily in industrialized nations, reduced desertification in arid zones, and reduced deforestation in the tropics. Each of these strategies has additional ecological and societal benefits. Assessing the effectiveness of these strategies requires a more quantitative understanding of the interactions among feedback processes, their consequences at local and global scales, and the teleconnections that link changes occurring in different regions. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"carbon sequestration; climate change; cooling; energy balance; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; water budget",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049085258

The particle-unbound states are produced in a variety of reaction mechanisms, ranging from projectile fragmentation to proton pickup. New proton-decaying excited states are observed in Li9(E*=14.1±0.1 MeV, Γ=207±49 keV) and Be10(E*=20.4±0.1 MeV, Γ=182±74 keV). In addition a new α-decaying state is observed in B13(E*=13.6±0.1 MeV, Γ≤320 keV). Also found was a Be8 state with E*=23 MeV, Γ=616±30 keV, which decays to the p+3H+α channel. Correlation between the fragments indicates that the decay is initiated by a proton emission to the 4.63-MeV state of Li7 and the spin of the state is J>2. A second T=2 state was confirmed in B12 at 14.82 MeV, which decays to the p+11Be, 3H+9Be, and α+8Li channels.

The carbon supports used were derived from the N234, N330, and N650 commercial furnace grades. In this study, we tried to increase the performance of Fe/N/C-based cathode of PEM fuel cells by using the following two approaches: (1) increasing the number of catalytic sites on the carbon black either by optimizing the structural parameters of the pristine carbon supports or by increasing the initial metal content above 0.2 wt% Fe on the carbon support; (2) increasing the catalyst loading in the cathodic layer of a PEM fuel cell. For (1), we show, on the one hand, that optimizing the structural parameters of the pristine carbon support, in order to increase the number of catalytic sites, has its limits and that these limits have been reached for the present synthesis method of Fe/N/C catalysts. On the other hand, increasing the initial metal content above 0.2 wt% Fe leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. For (2), it is shown that increasing the catalyst loading per cm2 of cathode well improves the performance of a cathode based on Fe/N/C catalysts in the kinetic region of the polarization curve. At lower potentials, a large improvement in the performance of these non-precious metal cathodes would occur if the mass transport properties in these electrodes were significantly increased. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in soil microbial community structure were more pronounced in ponderosa pine uneven-aged and heavy harvest stands and in lodgepole pine even-aged stand as compared to their respective unmanaged stands.

Laser intensity of 1013-1014 W/cm2 was produced on the targets by a 2 J Nd:glass laser having a variable pulse duration of 300-800 ps. Nano-particle size was in the range of 15-25 nm. Ion emission from the nano-particle plasma was compared with plasma generated from a polished copper target. Ion emission from the nano-structured target was observed to depend on the polarization of the incident laser beam. This effect was stronger for a shorter laser pulse. X-ray emission was measured in the soft and hard X-ray region (0.7 to 8 keV) using various X-ray filters. A nano-particle coated target is found to yield a larger flux as well as velocity of ions as compared to polished target when the laser polarization is parallel to the plane containing target normal and detector axis.

At normal activity sites, vehicular, industrial and soil dust contributions are observed to be dominant. At two of the kerbside sites, marine contributions are observed to be significant which was due to the proximity of the sites to sea.

At places, the dissolved oxygen saturation level becomes as low as 2%. Naturally, CH4, N2O, and CO2 are highly supersaturated. Once the river water discharges into the main estuary, the Lingdingyang, it tends to flow out on the western side while open ocean waters with lower nutrient contents and pCO2 but higher salinity and pH values enter on the eastern side. Largely as a result of mixing with the open ocean water but partly because of biological consumption, pCO2 quickly reduces to near saturation only tens of kilometers off the mouth of the estuary. The % saturation of CH4 and N2O is also greatly reduced but the continental shelf remains as a source of these greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"dissolved oxygen; estuary; eutrophication; greenhouse gas; hydrogeochemistry; mixing; river discharge; saturation; tributary; Asia; Beijiang Basin; China; Dongjiang Basin; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong; Zhujiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249104892

It is influenced by a suite of climate (i.e. temperature and rainfall) and soil (physical and chemical) variables, interacting soil and plant nitrogen (N) transformations (either competing or supplying substrates) as well as land management practices. It is not surprising that N2O emissions are highly variable both spatially and temporally. Computer simulation models, which can integrate all of these variables, are required for the complex task of providing quantitative determinations of N2O emissions. Numerous simulation models have been developed to predict N2O production. Each model has its own philosophy in constructing simulation components as well as performance strengths. The models range from those that attempt to comprehensively simulate all soil processes to more empirical approaches requiring minimal input data. These N2O simulation models can be classified into three categories: laboratory, field and regional/global levels. Process-based field-scale N2O simulation models, which simulate whole agroecosystems and can be used to develop N2O mitigation measures, are the most widely used. The current challenge is how to scale up the relatively more robust field-scale model to catchment, regional and national scales. This paper reviews the development history, main construction components, strengths, limitations and applications of N2O emissions models, which have been published in the literature. The three scale levels are considered and the current knowledge gaps and challenges in modelling N 2O emissions from soils are discussed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agroecosystem modelling; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide emissions; Soil nitrogen","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; computer simulation; denitrification; ecosystem modeling; land management; modeling; nitrification; nitrous oxide; soil emission; soil nitrogen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47349084593

A one-dimensional THz generation model based on the transient ionization electric current mechanism is given, which explains the results of one-dimensional PIC simulations. At the same time the relation between the final THz field and the initial transient ionization current is shown. One- and two-dimensional simulations show that for the THz generation the contribution of the electric current due to ionization is much larger than the one driven by the usual ponderomotive force. Ionization current generated by different laser pulses and gases is also studied numerically.

The selected incinerators include two grate-type MSWIs: MSWI-A (350 t/d) and MSWI-B (150 t/d), and two fluidized bed MSWIs: MSWI-C (400 t/d) and MSWI-D (400 t/d), which are all equipped with semi-dry lime scrubber and bag filter except MSWI-D equipped with cyclone and wet scrubber (WS) as air pollutant control device (APCD). Results indicated that the emission concentration and the international toxic equivalents (I-TEQs) of the PCDD/Fs from the stacks were in the range of 1.210∼10.273 ng/Nm 3 and 0.019∼0.201 ng I-TEQ/Nm3, respectively. They were greatly lower than the emission regulation standard of PCDD/Fs in China (1.0 ng I-TEQ/Nm3). However, only the PCDD/Fs emission level from MSWI-C was below 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3. Although the homologue profiles were distinct, the contributions of the 2,3,7,8-subsituted congeners to the total I-TEQ were similar among all the investigated MSWIs. Two major 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, account for 47% and 9% (average values) of the total I-TEQ values, respectively.

First, the physical and transport properties of CO2 at supercritical conditions are discussed and then their influence on heat transfer and pressure drops. Next, a review of experimental studies on heat transfer and pressure drops of supercritical CO2 cooling is provided and detailed comparisons and analysis relative to the available heat transfer and pressure drop correlations for supercritical CO2 cooling were done where possible. Furthermore, noting the lack of all pertinent experimental details required to use the data published in many of these studies, comments are given on how to reduce and present supercritical CO2 experimental data properly in the future. In addition, the effect of oil on heat transfer and pressure drops for supercritical CO2 is shown to significantly decrease the former and to increase the latter. Comparison of experimental data to a selection of heat transfer correlations shows that the Fang et al. [2001b. Modeling and analysis of gas coolers. ASHRAE Trans. 107 (1), 4-13] correlation gives the closest values to the experimental data but is still not satisfactory. According to the comparison and analysis, it is recommended that further efforts be made to develop good heat transfer methods for supercritical CO2 cooling based on accurate database in the future. To achieve this, more careful experiments should be done over a wide range of test parameters to meet the requirement in practical applications. In addition, four experimental studies show that the Blasius equation works well for CO2 cooling in the near supercritical region. More careful experimental data are still needed to further validate this conclusion because some experimental data are much different from others. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.","Carbon dioxide; Correlation; Heat exchanger; Heat transfer; Microcanal; Pressure drop; Survey; Transcritical cycle; Tube","Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Correlation methods; Drops; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Heating equipment; Pressure drop; Thermoanalysis; Transport properties; Applications.; Blasius equations; Comprehensive analysis; Correlation; Experimental datums; Experimental studies; Gas coolers; Heat transfer and pressure drops; Heat transfer correlations; Heat transfer methods; Microcanal; Modeling and analysis; Supercritical CO; Supercritical conditions; Supercritical regions; Test parameters; Transcritical cycle; Tube; Experiments",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55249100005

The most aqueous hydrocarbons dissolved in the wastewater of Taiwanese WWTPs were acetone, acrylonitrile, methylene chloride, and chloroform for the petrochemical districts; acetone, chloroform, and toluene for the science-based districts; and chlorinated and aromatic hydrocarbons for the multiple industrial districts. The aqueous pollutants in the united WWTPs were closely related to the characteristics of the manufacturing plants in the districts. To effectively prevent VOC emissions from the primary treatment section of petrochemical WWTPs, the updated regulations governing VOC emissions were issued by the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration in September 2005, legally mandating a seal cover system incorporating venting and air purification equipment. Cost analysis indicates that incinerators with regenerative heat recovery are optimal for treating high VOC concentrations, exceeding 10,000 ppm as CH4, from the oil separation basins. However, the emission concentrations, ranging from 100 to 1000 ppm as CH4 from the other primary treatment facilities and bio-treatment stages, should be collected and then injected into the biological oxidation basins via existing or new blowers.

The influence of traffic restrictions on the particle concentrations differed for different particle sizes. More significant effects on fine particles with diameters ranging from 40 to 500 nm have been found. Based on statistical analysis of long-term observations, under comparable weather conditions, the number concentrations of the particles in Aitken and accumulation modes seemingly were reduced by 20-60% when the traffic restrictions were in place. This change may be mainly due to the reduction of secondary particle contributions. However, it is worth to notice that the reduction of 60% might overestimate the effect of the measures of traffic control, due to the inherent data shortage with very high wind speeds in the comparison data population. Our size-dependent aerosol data also indicate that measures led to reductions in particulate air pollution in the optically most important diameter range, whereas further vehicle restriction measures might lead to an increase in ultrafine particle formation if the condensational sink further decreased. Assuming that there were no traffic restrictions and with normal levels of the vehicle emissions, the visibilities during the Summit would have been lower by about 20-45%. The fact that over 95% cases with visibility range lower than 5 km during 2004 to 2007 occurred when the local wind speed was lower than 3 m s-1 may suggest that the importance of the emission restrictions is highest when the wind speed is lower than 3 m s-1, concerning the improvement of serious low visibility situations in Beijing. © Author(s) 2008.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051960521

In this work we analyse selected alternative scenarios aimed at minimizing the unused material fraction to be delivered to the landfill. The methodological framework of the analysis is the life cycle assessment, in a multi-method form developed by our research team. The approach was applied to the case of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Rome, with a special focus on energy and material balance, including global and local scale airborne emissions. Results, provided in the form of indices and indicators of efficiency, effectiveness and environmental impacts, point out landfill activities as the worst waste management strategy at a global scale.

The sensitivity of crop production to climate makes agriculture vulnerable to the risks associated with climate change. While it is generally acknowledged that climate change may not imperil the ability of world's agriculture to maintain food security, it does, however, challenge farmers to adapt in regions where it may be stressful, such as dryland areas of the world. World's dryland farmers with limited capacities to adapt to climate variability and change are faced with the new threats, which could have serious impacts on food security. The vulnerability of agriculture to climate change in dryland regions of the world also comes from factors associated with socioeconomic, political, and technological conditions limiting their ability to adapt to change. However, adaptations to climate change could reduce the impact considerably.","Climate change; Dryland agriculture; Food security; Impacts and adaptation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955420232

These experiments were conducted using CO2 as a reagent for neutralizing an initially alkaline APC residue. The neutralization and heavy metals separation was enhanced by adjusting the pH values using hydrochloric acid from 3 to 7.5. The effect of particle sizes on heavy metals separation was also evaluated. The results indicate that a decrease in the pH value enhances the heavy metals separation and recovery efficiency from MSW incinerator APC residues, especially for Cd, Zn and Cu. The results also show that the metals extraction percent was not significantly influenced by variations in the tested particle size range. The valuable metals Cd and Zn recovered from the extraction liquid formed metal hydroxide precipitates using the chemical precipitation method. The quantities of metal precipitates were determined by weight on the dry basis, ranging from 0.5% to 1.0% of the original APC residues. All tested metal concentrations in the effluent complied with current Taiwan regulation thresholds. The treated APC residues after the FGN/AE process were classified as non-hazardous waste with the potential to significantly increase APC residue reuse.

Despite wide variations in climate, organ temperature is regulated 'tightly' by homeostatic mechanisms controlling heat production and conservation, as well as heat loss. Although less is known about the temperature of the healthy or injured human brain, mammalian brain homeothermy involves interplay between neural metabolic heat production, cerebral blood flow and the temperature of incoming arterial blood. Recent advances in invasive and non-invasive thermometry have allowed measurement of brain temperature to be made in man. In health, small differences only exist between local brain and body core temperature. Large (negative) brain-body temperature dissociation, observed in some patients after severe brain damage, does not appear to be a feature of cerebral homeothermy in healthy people. The extent to which changes in brain temperature reflect, or 'drive', secondary cerebral pathology remains uncertain in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Raised temperature may be due to a regulated readjustment in the hypothalamic 'set-point' in response to inflammation and infection, or it may occur as a consequence of damage to the hypothalamus and/or its pathways. Diagnosis of the mechanism of raised temperature; fever v. neurogenic hyperthermia (regulated v. unregulated temperature rise) is difficult to make clinically. Whatever the cause, a 1-2°C rise in brain or body temperature, especially when it develops early after injury, is widely regarded as harmful. There is no clear evidence that fever per se leads directly to worsened neurological damage or poor outcome, nor evidence that antipyretic treatments (pharmacological or cold-induced therapies) preserve damaged brain tissue or result in a better outcome. Part 2 follows part one with a detailed analysis of the evidence for the significance of raised temperature on outcome after TBI. © The Neurosurgical Foundation.","Brain temperature; Fever; Homeothermy; Hyperthermia; Neuronal damage; Traumatic brain injury","paracetamol; body temperature; brain damage; brain temperature; core temperature; disease predisposition; fever; human; induced hypothermia; neuropathology; nonhuman; outcome assessment; priority journal; review; thermometer; thermoregulation; traumatic brain injury; Body Temperature Regulation; Brain; Brain Injuries; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Female; Fever; Homeostasis; Humans; Hypothermia, Induced; Male; Risk Assessment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52749089582

Combustion chamber temperatures, stack gas concentrations, i.e., CO2 and CO, and the residual oxygen were measured. The maximum ratio of organic sludge waste to total waste input was 30 wt.%. Oxygen-enriched air, 22 vol.% (dry basis) oxygen, was used for stable combustion. As the co-incineration ratio of the sludge increased, the primary and secondary combustion chamber temperatures were decreased to 900 and 750 °C, respectively, approximately 100 °C below the proper incineration. However, if the supplied air was enriched with 22 vol.% (dry basis) oxygen content, the incinerator temperature was high enough to burn the waste mixture containing 30 wt.% moisture sludge, with an estimated heating value of 6.72 MJ/kg. There are two main benefits of using oxygen enrichment in the co-incineration. First, the sensible heat can be reduced as the quantity of nitrogen in the flue gas will be decreased. Second, the unburned carbon formation is reduced due to the oxygen-enriched burning of the waste, despite an increase in the sludge co-incineration ratio. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a spatial methodology for distributing a compensatory fund more logically based on the environmental impact on each neighborhood in Taipei City. This method integrates ten impact factors, which have been proposed by a local committee, to evaluate all neighborhoods using mathematical models combined with spatial analyses in an analytic hierarchy process. The compensatory fund is distributed according to the resulting final scores. A GIS (geographic information systems)-based system has been developed to assist in assigning the final scores to the neighborhoods impacted. Results on impact factors and fund distributions are combined; they are included in an information system and displayed in spatial scales. For Taipei City, the impact of air quality during the incinerator operating period is the item of greatest concern to the surrounding residents and thus, it receives a relatively higher weight of 0.2894. As a result, high impact scores were assigned to not only those neighborhoods hosting the incinerators, but also the neighborhoods where the maximum particulate air pollutants occurred. This approach could be applicable to other MSW incinerators with similar environmental impact problems and interest in compensation schemes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Bare and silica coated ZnS quantum dots were prepared following an inexpensive chemical route using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the dielectric host matrix. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study of the samples show the formation of almost spherical ZnS quantum dots. The UV-Vis absorption spectra reveal blue shift relative to bulk material in absorption energy while photoluminescence (PL) spectra suggests that surface state and near band edge emissions are dominating in case of bare and coated samples, respectively. Swift heavy ion irradiation of the samples was carried out with 160 MeV Ni12+ ion beam with fluences 1012 to 1013 ions/cm2. Size enhancement of bare quantum dots after irradiation has been indicated in XRD and TEM analysis of the samples which has also been supported by optical absorption spectra.

The thermodynamics and aspects related to heat and mass transport is also evaluated, and an extensive table on research contributions to methane partial oxidation over transition metal catalysts in the literature is provided. Presented are both theoretical and experimental evidence pointing to inherent differences in the reaction mechanism over transition metals. These differences are related to methane dissociation, binding site preferences, the stability of OH surface species, surface residence times of active species and contributions from lattice oxygen atoms and support species. Methane dissociation requires a reduced metal surface, but at elevated temperatures oxides of active species may be reduced by direct interaction with methane or from the reaction with H, H2, C or CO. The comparison of elementary reaction steps on Pt and Rh illustrates that a key factor to produce hydrogen as a primary product is a high activation energy barrier to the formation of OH. Another essential property for the formation of H2 and CO as primary products is a low surface coverage of intermediates, such that the probability of O-H, OH-H and CO-O interactions are reduced. The local concentrations of reactants and products change rapidly through the catalyst bed. This influences the reaction mechanisms, but the product composition is typically close to equilibrated at the bed exit temperature. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We estimated the contribution of wood and food product trade, of emission and oxidation of reduced carbon species, and of river erosion and transport as lateral carbon fluxes to the carbon balance of Europe (EU-25). The analysis is completed by new estimates of the carbon fluxes of coastal seas. We estimated that lateral transport (all processes combined) is a flux of 165 Tg C yr-1 at the scale of EU-25. The magnitude of lateral transport is thus comparable to current estimates of carbon accumulation in European forests.

Mixing ratio profile and column results show that special attention must be given to retrievals that may be disturbed by the dynamics and chemical processing of the polar vortex. Largest differences occur on days when observations were made in regions of the vortex with large gradients in wind and potential vorticity, and the differences were especially noticeable in results for HNO3 and HCl, whose profiles may be dramatically changed by vortex activity. The mean difference between coincident column observations by MLS and the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is 2.4%, VMR profile amounts generally are in good agreement between the satellite observations where they are available.

This paper develops and applies an assay to measure digester stability by measuring the maximum aceticlastic methane production rate (Vmax,ac). The Vmax,ac in combination with acetate concentrations was found to be an effective digestion monitoring tool to indicate process upsets. At steady state, thermophilic, first stage and short SRT digesters generally had a greater Vmax,ac than mesophilic, second stage or long SRT digesters. The ratio of the Vmax,ac to the plant aceticlastic methane production rate, termed the Acetate Capacity Number (ACN), is a measure of the excess capacity of the digester. Either Vmax,ac or ACN can be used to estimate the capability to handle higher organic loading rates. Monod modeling was used to predict Vmax,ac, ACN and maximum VS loading rates for mesophilic and thermophilic digestion and for staged digesters to better understand expected digestion capacity and stability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In lieu of extant specified property rights, participants were invited to agree to obligations to provide groundwater recharge credits in exchange for pecuniary compensation. Participants were able to meet their obligations to supply groundwater recharge credits through land management actions resulting in monitored outcomes consistent with contractual obligations to reduce recharge. Alternatively, those in deficit were provided the option to obtain sufficient credits through market exchange. Surplus transferable recharge credits were produced by those participants who exceeded their own contractual obligations through improved land management. The paper describes the process of contract design and implementation. The trial involved a design and testing phase and an on-ground implementation phase. We describe composite methodologies deployed in the design and testing of alternative policy instruments and institutional arrangements, conducted prior to implementation. These involved community consultation, an attitudinal and behavioural survey, experimental economics and the development of a transparent and credible monitoring protocol. The conclusions drawn as a result of this analysis provided an empirical basis to implement the on-ground trial phase. Results of on-ground implementation are described. Finally, the methods and results of a Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) of the on-ground trial implementation are outlined. The BCA accounted for salinity damage reduction, forgone river flow, carbon sequestration, production benefits and costs. The result of BCA was an estimated net benefit.

There are several works regarding regulated pollutants emissions, but there is a lack of reports in non-regulated emissions. In a previous paper (Corrêa and Arbilla, 2006) the emissions of aromatic hydrocarbons were reported and in 2007 another paper was published in 2008 focusing carbonyls emissions (Corrêa and Arbilla, 2008). In this work four mercaptans (methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl mercaptans) were evaluated for a heavy-duty diesel engine, fueled with pure diesel (D) and biodiesel blends (v/v) of 2% (B2), 5% (B5), 10% (B10), and 20% (B20). The tests were carried using a six cylinder heavy-duty engine, typical of the Brazilian fleet of urban buses, during a real use across the city. The exhaust gases were diluted near 20 times and the mercaptans were sampled with glass fiber filters impregnated with mercuric acetate. The chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. The results indicated that the mercaptans emissions exhibit a reduction with the increase of biodiesel content, but this reduction is lower as the mercaptan molar mass increases. For B20 results the emission reduction was 18.4% for methyl mercaptan, 18.1% for ethyl mercaptan, 16.3% for n-propyl mercaptan, and 9.6% for n-butyl mercaptan. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we explore various optimization strategies for characterizing surface leakage (seepage) using near-surface measurement approaches such as accumulation chambers and eddy covariance towers. Seepage characterization objectives and limitations need to be defined carefully from the outset especially in light of large natural background variations that can mask seepage. The cost and sensitivity of seepage detection are related to four critical length scales pertaining to the size of the: (1) region that needs to be monitored; (2) footprint of the measurement approach, and (3) main seepage zone; (4) region in which concentrations or fluxes are influenced by seepage. Seepage characterization objectives may include one or all of the tasks of detecting, locating, and quantifying seepage. Each of these tasks has its own optimal strategy. Detecting and locating seepage in a region in which there is no expected or preferred location for seepage nor existing evidence for seepage requires monitoring on a fixed grid, e.g., using eddy covariance towers. The fixed-grid approaches needed to detect seepage are expected to require large numbers of eddy covariance towers for large-scale geologic CO2 storage. Once seepage has been detected and roughly located, seepage zones and features can be optimally pinpointed through a dynamic search strategy, e.g., employing accumulation chambers and/or soil-gas monitoring. Quantification of seepage rates can be done through measurements on a localized fixed grid once the seepage is pinpointed. Background measurements are essential for seepage detection in natural ecosystems. Artificial neural networks are considered as regression models useful for distinguishing natural system behavior from anomalous behavior suggestive of CO2 seepage without need for detailed understanding of natural system processes. Because of the local extrema in CO2 fluxes and concentrations in natural systems, simple steepest-descent algorithms are not effective and evolutionary computation algorithms are proposed as a paradigm for dynamic monitoring networks to pinpoint CO2 seepage areas.","Geologic storage; Monitoring networks; Optimization","Geologic storage; Monitoring networks; Optimality; Optimization; Carbon dioxide; artificial neural network; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; eddy covariance; modeling; optimization; seepage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51449100964

One of the three lakes also received acid mine drainage. The sediments were dated using 210Pb and 137Cs and analysed for stable Pb isotope ratios and for total concentrations of 15 elements (Ag, Al, Au, Ca, Cu, Cd, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, S, Ti, Zn). Stable lead isotopic signatures helped to determine the quantitative contributions of different industrial Pb sources to our sampling sites. This source apportionment showed the dominant influence of the Rouyn-Noranda copper smelter in airborne Pb emissions for the decades following 1926, when industrialization began in the region. The smelter source had a low ratio of 206Pb/207Pb ranging between 0.90 and 1.05, as typical of the Abitibi Archean sulphides. The relationships between element (metal) sedimentary fluxes and anthropogenic Pb fluxes allowed us to infer the origin of the anthropogenic source. These relationships strongly suggest that the copper smelter was (and may still be) an atmospheric source of Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag and Hg to the surrounding lakes. Our study indicates that the efforts made by the Rouyn-Noranda copper smelter to reduce airborne emissions of metals have been translated in reduced atmospheric metal loadings to the surrounding lakes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","210Pb; Contamination history; Metals; Sediment record; Source apportionment; Stable Pb isotopes","atmospheric deposition; cesium isotope; chronology; copper; core analysis; emission control; human activity; industrial emission; isotopic ratio; lacustrine deposit; lead isotope; mining; pollutant source; sediment pollution; smelting; stable isotope; sulfide; Canada; North America; Quebec [Canada]; Rouyn-Noranda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46249127041

This can reduce the potential risks of elevated city temperatures due to the urban heat island (UHI). Unfortunately, simple tools are not readily available for urban planners to assess the climatological impacts of various urban development scenarios. Urban modelling could be developed into such a tool to achieve this. This study attempts to design and evaluate a suitable tool for application in Melbourne, Australia. The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) was chosen to assess the impact of a long-term urban planning strategy on local climate and the above canopy UHI in Melbourne. Improvements were made to TAPM by increasing the number of urban land-use classes in the model and creating a higher resolution land cover database focused on housing density. This modified version of TAPM showed a good performance in replicating the surface energy balance compared with an observational flux tower site in suburban Melbourne during summer. TAPM simulated a mean maximum UHI intensity of 3-4 °C at 2 a.m. in January. A future UHI scenario was then examined (year 2030) using an urban land cover database derived from plans in the Melbourne 2030 urban planning strategy. Results highlighted specific areas where planning intervention would be particularly useful to improve local climates, namely activity centres and growth areas. The appropriateness of the use of TAPM and climate models as a tool in urban planning is also discussed.

Components tested included primary clarifiers, primary settling ponds, spill ponds, aerated basins, activated sludge treatment reactors, and post-aeration retention ponds. Concurrent liquid sampling was conducted, and relevant process information was gathered. For a given component, emissions of hydrogen sulfide were dependent mainly on the inlet sulfide loading, in-basin pH, and the level of in-basin sulfide generation, which was apparently due to anaerobic biological activity. Quiescent pre-aeration settling ponds and spill basins had the largest emissions of hydrogen sulfide, with wind speed also being a significant factor affecting emissions from these components. Emissions of organic reduced sulfur compounds were largely a function of mill condensate handling practices.

However, the prospect of higher temperatures liberating large areas of land from permanent ice cover in the Arctic plus a retreat of the nival zone on higher mountains could provide new terrain for the continued existence and expansion of both arctic and alpine floras. Examination in detail of these floras reveals numerous examples of species that have sufficient genetic variability to adapt phenologically and physiologically to warmer and drier conditions. The calcicole flora of the Alps is well placed to withstand the drier conditions that may arise with climatic warming. In the Arctic the polar night will persist whatever changes may take place in the temperature regime. There will therefore always be features of the arctic environment that will be distinctive and can be expected to provide a habitat for a polar flora. The polar bear with its complete dependence on sea ice for hunting seals may disappear. However, cold climate floras by contrast will find sufficient heterogeneity in the arctic and alpine habitats and variation within species to evolve and provide adapted species that may benefit from higher temperatures and longer growing seasons. © 2008 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.","Alpine; Arctic; Climate change; Genetic diversity; Migration; Phenology; Phenotypic plasticity; Physiology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010521511

The authors suggest that Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis provides a useful and stimulating framework for consideration of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle. If it is used, it suggests that urbanization and management of sewage, and intensive animal rearing are probably bigger global issues than nitrogen deposition from fossil fuel combustion, and that plant evolution may be driven by the requirement of locally sustainable and near optimal soil mineral N supply dynamics. This may, in turn, be partially regulating global carbon and oxygen cycles. It is suggested that pollutant N deposition may disrupt this essential natural plant and terrestrial ecosystem evolutionary process, causing biodiversity change. Interactions between the Earth and other bodies in the solar system, and possibly beyond, also need to be considered in the context of the global N cycle over geological time scales. This is because of direct potential impacts on the nitrogen content of the atmosphere, potential long-term impacts of past boloid collisions on plate tectonics and thus on global N cycling via subduction and volcanic emissions, and indirect effects upon C, O and water cycling that all may impact upon the N cycle in the long term. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) angiography is a safe alternative to iodinated contrast media vastly under-utilized by vascular surgeons. We herein describe our experience with a simple angiographic technique using CO2 for EVAR guidance that does not require a separate angiographic catheter. Methods: Eighteen patients underwent EVAR using angiography with CO2 delivered through the endograft sheath. The renal and hypogastric arteries were localized for endograft deployment exclusively with CO2 in all patients. Completion angiography was done with CO2 in all patients and an additional angiogram with iodinated media was done in 13 cases. Results: All endograft deployments were done successfully with CO2 angiography injected through the endograft delivery systems and femoral access sheaths. Additional iodinated media completion angiography did not modify the procedure in any case. All patients were discharged within two days after surgery. There were no ischemic or systemic complications related to CO2 administration. Follow-up CT-scan revealed well positioned endografts with the expected patent renal and hypogastric arteries in all patients, and no additional endoleaks. No significant deterioration in renal function occurred in any case. Conclusion: Carbon dioxide angiography conducted through the endograft delivery sheath is reliable for endograft deployment, safe, non-toxic and inexpensive. In addition, it may expedite EVAR by eliminating a number of angiographic catheter placements and exchanges during the procedure.

We investigate the mechanisms of the ocean's carbon uptake within the feedback loop of atmospheric CO2 concentration, climate change and atmosphere/ocean CO2 flux. We evaluate two transient simulations from 1860 until 2100, performed with a version of the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with the carbon cycle included. In both experiments observed anthropogenic CO2 emissions were prescribed until 2000, followed by the emissions according to the IPCC Scenario A2. In one simulation the radiative forcing of changing atmospheric CO2 is taken into account (coupled), in the other it is suppressed (uncoupled). In both simulations, the oceanic carbon uptake increases from 1 GT C/year in 1960 to 4.5 GT C/year in 2070. Afterwards, this trend weakens in the coupled simulation, leading to a reduced uptake rate of 10% in 2100 compared to the uncoupled simulation. This includes a partial offset due to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the coupled simulation owing to reduced carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere. The difference of the oceanic carbon uptake between both simulations is primarily due to partial pressure difference and secondary to solubility changes. These contributions are widely offset by changes of gas transfer velocity due to sea ice melting and wind changes. The major differences appear in the Southern Ocean (-45%) and in the North Atlantic (-30%), related to reduced vertical mixing and North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, respectively. In the polar areas, sea ice melting induces additional CO2 uptake (+20%). © The Author(s) 2007.","Air-sea CO2 flux; Climate change; Climate scenarios; Ocean carbon cycle; Ocean circulation","air-sea interaction; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; oceanic circulation; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849153149

In the US, livestock agriculture produces over one billion tons of manure annually on a renewable basis. Most of this manure is disposed of in lagoons or stored outdoors to decompose. Such disposal methods emit methane and nitrous oxide, two important GHGs with 21 and 310 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, respectively. In total, GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in the US amounted to 536 million metric tons (MMT) of carbon dioxide equivalent, or 7% of the total US emissions in 2005. Of this agricultural contribution, 51 to 118 MMT of carbon dioxide equivalent resulted from livestock manure emissions alone, with trends showing this contribution increasing from 1990 to 2005. Thus, limiting GHG emissions from manure represents a valuable starting point for mitigating agricultural contributions to global climate change. Anaerobic digestion, a process that converts manure to methane-rich biogas, can lower GHG emissions from manure significantly. Using biogas as a substitute for other fossil fuels, such as coal for electricity generation, replaces two GHG sources - manure and coal combustion - with a less carbon-intensive source, namely biogas combustion. The biogas energy potential was calculated using values for the amount of biogas energy that can be produced per animal unit (defined as 1000 pounds of animal) per day and the number of animal units in the US. The 95 million animal units in the country could produce nearly 1 quad of renewable energy per year, amounting to approximately 1% of the US total energy consumption. Converting the biogas into electricity using standard microturbines could produce 88 ± 20 billion kWh, or 2.4 ± 0.6% of annual electricity consumption in the US. Replacing coal and manure GHG emissions with the emissions from biogas would produce a net potential GHG emissions reduction of 99 ± 59 million metric tons or 3.9 ± 2.3% of the annual GHG emissions from electricity generation in the US. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Anaerobic digestion; Animal manure; Biogas; Greenhouse gas emissions; National study; Renewable energy","Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Animals; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Electric generators; Emission control; Energy utilization; Global warming; Manures; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Animal manure; Annual electricity consumption; Electricity generation; Global warming potential; National study; Renewable energies; Renewable portfolio standard; Total energy consumption; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749131822

One model for implementation is the sale of carbon offsets. Modeling studies predict that OIF has the potential to produce a material difference in the rise of atmospheric CO2 over the next several decades, but this could only be attained by alteration of the ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles of much of the world's oceans. The efficacy of OIF on this scale has not been proven. However, the consequences of successful implementation must be considered now, for 2 important reasons: (1) to determine if the environmental effects would be predictable and verifiable, and if so, acceptable; and (2) to establish whether the basis for valuing carbon offsets - an accurate audit of net reductions in cumulative greenhouse gas potential over 100 yr - can be met. Potential side-effects of widespread OIF that must be considered include a reduced supply of macronutrients to surface waters downstream of fertilized regions, increased emissions of the potent greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and methane, and changes in the extent or frequency of coastal hypoxia. Given the uncertainties inherent in ocean models, predictions of environmental effects must be backed up by measurements. Thus, to go forward with confidence that the effects of rising CO2 could indeed be mitigated through OIF over the next century, and to establish the foundations for auditing carbon offsets, it must be explicitly demonstrated that methods exist to predict and detect downstream effects of OIF against the background of both climate variability and global warming. We propose that until the side-effects of widespread OIF can be shown to be verifiable - and there is good reason to believe that they cannot - OIF should not be considered a viable technology for climate mitigation. © Inter-Research 2008.","Carbon offsets; Climate change; Climate change mitigation; Ecological effects; Hypoxia; Nitrous oxide; Ocean fertilization","biogeochemical cycle; climate variation; concentration (composition); ecological modeling; environmental effect; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; hypoxia; iron; mitigation; prediction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50149105709

While UFORE contains several modules, Module-D quantifies the levels of air pollution for contaminants such as NO2, S02, CO, PM10 and ozone as well as hourly pollution removal rates and the economic value of pollutant removal. Six vegetation scenarios were developed within the Toronto study area to compare different subsets of vegetation and their effect on air contaminants. Results of the study indicate that grass on roofs (extensive green roofs) could augment the effect of trees and shrubs in air pollution mitigation, placing shrubs on a roof (intensive green roofs) would have a more significant impact.

Moreover, the carbon content is directly related on the capacity of water retention, fertility, among other properties. Thus, soil carbon quantification in field conditions is an important challenge related to carbon cycle and global climatic changes. Nowadays, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) can be used for qualitative elemental analyses without previous treatment of samples and the results are obtained quickly. New optical technologies made possible the portable LIBS systems and now, the great expectation is the development of methods that make possible quantitative measurements with LIBS. The goal of this work is to calibrate a portable LIBS system to carry out quantitative measures of carbon in whole tropical soil sample. For this, six samples from the Brazilian Cerrado region (Argisoil) were used. Tropical soils have large amounts of iron in their compositions, so the carbon line at 247.86 nm presents strong interference of this element (iron lines at 247.86 and 247.95). For this reason, in this work the carbon line at 193.03 nm was used. Using methods of statistical analysis as a simple linear regression, multivariate linear regression and cross-validation were possible to obtain correlation coefficients higher than 0.91. These results show the great potential of using portable LIBS systems for quantitative carbon measurements in tropical soils. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the focus is the concept of the long-term opencast mine and power plant development. Essential part of the concept Is the strategy for meeting future challenges of climate change policy. CCS is the key for it, It is expected, that the CCS technology will be commercially available after 2020. Another Important aspect Is among others the use of the priority areas of the Welzow-Süd and Nochten opencast mines. The corresponding long-term lignite mining planning procedures were opened In autumn 2007. The plans of the company contain clear and reliable statements regarding the long-term opencast mine development until 2050. However, all decisions the company makes are focussing on putting people and their needs first. Solutions for mining related questions and requirements are jointly developed with the people of the region. Communities in direct neighbourhood to opencast mines are safely protected against immissions by structural and organisational measures. The principles of socially responsible resettlements set the framework of constructive and trustful co-acting of the people concerned and the company very early. The future post-mining landscape offers alternative utilization forms providing employment for many people. Economic development of the region is an important aspect of the company's activities.

CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased by 33% (to 380 ppm) since 1750 ad, whilst CH4 concentration has increased by 75% (to 1,750 ppb), and as the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 is 25 fold greater than CO2 it represents about 20% of the global warming effect. The purpose of this review is to: (a) address recent findings regarding biophysical factors governing production and consumption of CH 4, (b) identify the current level of knowledge regarding the main sources and sinks of CH4 in Australia, and (c) identify CH 4 mitigation options and their potential application in Australian ecosystems. Almost one-third of CH4 emissions are from natural sources such as wetlands and lake sediments, which is poorly documented in Australia. For Australia, the major anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions include energy production from fossil fuels (∼24%), enteric fermentation in the guts of ruminant animals (∼59%), landfills, animal wastes and domestic sewage (∼15%), and biomass burning (∼5%), with minor contributions from manure management (1.7%), land use, land-use change and forestry (1.6%), and rice cultivation (0.2%). A significant sink exists for CH4 (∼6%) in aerobic soils, including agricultural and forestry soils, and potentially large areas of arid soils, however, due to limited information available in Australia, it is not accounted for in the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. CH4 emission rates from submerged soils vary greatly, but mean values ≤10 mg m-2 h-1 are common. Landfill sites may emit CH4 at one to three orders of magnitude greater than submerged soils. CH4 consumption rates in non-flooded, aerobic agricultural, pastoral and forest soils also vary greatly, but mean values are restricted to ≤100 μg m-2 h-1, and generally greatest in forest soils and least in agricultural soils, and decrease from temperate to tropical regions. Mitigation options for soil CH 4 production primarily relate to enhancing soil oxygen diffusion through water management, land use change, minimised compaction and soil fertility management. Improved management of animal manure could include biogas capture for energy production or arable composting as opposed to open stockpiling or pond storage. Balanced fertiliser use may increase soil CH 4 uptake, reduce soil N2O emissions whilst improving nutrient and water use efficiency, with a positive net greenhouse gas (CO 2-e) effect. Similarly, the conversion of agricultural land to pasture, and pastoral land to forestry should increase soil CH4 sink. Conservation of native forests and afforestation of degraded agricultural land would effectively mitigate CH4 emissions by maintaining and enhancing CH4 consumption in these soils, but also by reducing N2O emissions and increasing C sequestration. The overall impact of climate change on methanogenesis and methanotrophy is poorly understood in Australia, with a lack of data highlighting the need for long-term research and process understanding in this area. For policy addressing land-based greenhouse gas mitigation, all three major greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) should be monitored simultaneously, combined with improved understanding at process-level. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agricultural soils; Desert soils; Forest soils; Methane emission; Methane oxidation; Savanna soils; Wetlands","agricultural land; agricultural soil; anthropogenic source; biophysics; carbon sequestration; climate change; composting; concentration (composition); desert soil; emission inventory; forest soil; global warming; greenhouse gas; human activity; magnitude; methane; methanogenesis; savanna; soil emission; soil fertility; water use efficiency; Australasia; Australia; Animalia; Bovidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47349106407

Samples were collected on 10 dates from spring to autumn and from three spatial locations: in the potato ""hill"" between plants (H), close to the plant (Hp), and in the ""furrow"" (F). The denitrification rates, N2O emissions, and environmental parameters were also measured. Changes in denitrifier abundance over time and spatial location were small (1.7- to 2.7-fold for the nirK, nosZ, and cnorBB guilds), whereas the cnorBP community (Pseudomonas mandelii and closely related spp.) showed an ∼4.6-fold change. The seasonal patterns of denitrifier gene numbers varied with the specific community: lower nosZ gene numbers in April and May than in June and July, higher cnorBP gene numbers in May and June than in March and April and September and November, higher nirK gene numbers in early spring than in late autumn, and no change in cnorBB gene numbers. Gene numbers were higher for the Hp than the H location for the nosZ and nirK communities and for the cnorB P community on individual dates, presumably indicating an effect of the plant on denitrifier abundance. Higher cnorBP gene numbers for the H location than the F location and for nosZ and cnorBB on individual dates reflect the effect of spatial location on abundance. Denitrifier abundance changes were not related to any environmental parameter, although a weak relationship exists between cnorBP gene numbers, extractable organic carbon values, and temperature. Denitrification and N 2O emissions were mostly regulated by inorganic nitrogen availability and water-filled pore space but were uncoupled from denitrifier community abundances measured in this system.

J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 11805). It has been suggested recently (Zazubovich, V.; Jankowiak, R. J. Lumin. 2007, 127, 245) that the site distribution functions of the red states (A and B) are uncorrected and that narrow holes are burned in the subpopulations of chlorophylls (Chls) from states A and B that are the lowest-energy Chl in their complex and previously thought not to transfer energy. This model of uncorrelated excitation energy transfer (EET) between the quasidegenerate bands is expanded by taking into account both electron-phonon and vibrational coupling. The model is applied to fit simultaneously absorption, emission, zero-phonon action, and transient hole burned (HB) spectra obtained for the CP43 complex with minimized contribution from aggregation. It is demonstrated that the above listed spectra can be wellfitted using the uncorrelated EET model, providing strong evidence for the existence of efficient energy transfer between the two lowest energy states, A and B (either from A to B or from B to A), in CP43. Possible candidate Chls for the low-energy A and B states are discussed, providing a link between CP43 structure and spectroscopy. Finally, we propose that persistent holes originate from regular NPHB accompanied by the redistribution of oscillator strength due to excitonic interactions, rather than photoconversion involving Chi-protein hydrogen bonding, as suggested before (Hughes J. L. et al. Biochemistry 2006, 45, 12345). In the accompanying paper (Reppert, M.; Zazubovich, V.; Dang, N. C.; Seibert, M.; Jankowiak, R. J. Phys. Chem.

This sulphur can be considered as legacy atmospheric pollution, stored within the peat by processes of dissimilatory sulphate reduction and now being leached into the region's surface waters. Persistently lower water tables at gully edge locations define a thick erosional acrotelm that is vulnerable to aeration, oxidation and flushing throughout the year, and not solely confined to periods of drought. Stream discharge behaves as a two-end member system, whereby pre-event water, rich in DOC and sulphate, is diluted by event water as a result of event water flowing through fast flow pathways such as macropores and overland flow. A rapid increase in water table elevation during the storm and a decrease in elevation after the storm indicate that event water has infiltrated the peat and has then been released into the stream. Streamwaters in peat dominated upland catchments with high densities of gullying have high concentrations of sulphate and low concentrations of DOC, whereas the reverse is true for those catchments with low densities of gullying. This is consistent with the concept that high concentrations of sulphate can suppress the solubility of DOC. A significant store of sulphate exists within South Pennine peats, and continued gully erosion will enhance sulphur leaching meaning that the timescale involved for any depletion is uncertain. It is therefore important that models predicting recovery from acidification in these upland systems include an understanding of how this stored sulphur is being leached, especially with respect to gully erosion, climate change and reduced precipitation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed three distinct mesozooplankton assemblages. A neritic assemblage occurred on the Mackenzie Shelf and in Franklin Bay, while distinct off-shelf assemblages prevailed in the Cape Bathurst Polynya and on the Beaufort Slope respectively. Over 95% of the mesozooplankton was comprised of eight copepod taxa. Pseudocalanus spp. contributed predominantly to the discrimination of the three assemblages and was the only significant indicator of the Shelf assemblage. Oithona similis, Oncaea borealis, Metridia longa and Calanus hyperboreus were indicators of the Polynya assemblage. Cyclopina sp. and Microcalanus pygmaeus were indicative of the overall off-shelf community (Polynya and Slope assemblages). The importance of omnivores and carnivores increased from the shelf to the polynya and the slope. Station depth and duration of reduced ice conditions during summer (&lt; 50% ice concentration) underpinned the distribution of the assemblages (r2 = 0.71 and 0.45 respectively). The abundance of Pseudocalanus spp. was independent of depth and increased with the duration of reduced ice conditions (rs = 0.438). The abundance of Cyclopina sp., M. pygmaeus and other indicators of the offshore assemblages followed the opposite trend (rs = - 0.467 and - 0.5 respectively). Under continued climate warming, a reduction of the ice cover will affect the biogeography of mesozooplankton on and around the Mackenzie Shelf, to the potential advantage of Pseudocalanus spp. and other calanoid herbivores. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The well-known fact that the competitive ability of plant species depends on size differences among species, raises the question of effects of community species richness on small-stature subordinate species. We used experimental grasslands differing in species richness (1-60 species) and functional group richness (one to four functional groups) to study biodiversity effects on biomass production and ecophysiological traits of five small-stature herbs (Bellis perennis, Plantago media, Glechoma hederacea, Ranunculus repens and Veronica chamaedrys). We found that ecophysiological adaptations, known as typical shade-tolerance strategies, played an important role with increasing species richness and in relation to a decrease in transmitted light. Specific leaf area and leaf area ratio increased, while area-based leaf nitrogen decreased with increasing community species richness. Community species richness did not affect daily leaf carbohydrate turnover of V. chamaedrys and P. media indicating that these species maintained efficiency of photosynthesis even in low-light environments. This suggests an important possible mechanism of complementarity in such grasslands, whereby smaller species contribute to a better overall efficiency of light use. Nevertheless, these species rarely contributed a large proportion to community biomass production or achieved higher yields in mixtures than expected from monocultures. It seems likely that the allocation to aboveground plant organs to optimise carbon assimilation limited the investment in belowground organs to acquire nutrients and thus hindered these species from increasing their performance in multi-species mixtures. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Biodiversity; Leaf area ratio; Leaf carbohydrates; Leaf nitrogen; Phenotypic plasticity; Productivity; Specific leaf area","nitrogen; aboveground biomass; adaptation; ecophysiology; functional group; grassland; herb; leaf area; phenotypic plasticity; shade tolerance; species diversity; species richness; survival; angiosperm; article; biomass; carbohydrate metabolism; ecosystem; Germany; growth, development and aging; legume; light; metabolism; phenotype; physiology; plant; plant leaf; Angiosperms; Biomass; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Ecosystem; Fabaceae; Germany; Light; Nitrogen; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Plant Shoots; Bellis perennis; Glechoma hederacea; Plantago; Plantago media; Ranunculaceae; Ranunculus repens; Veronica; Veronica chamaedrys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349107488

Medusahead invasion has been demonstrated to reduce livestock forage, but otherwise information comparing vegetation characteristics of medusahead-invaded to noninvaded sagebrush steppe communities is limited. This lack of knowledge makes it difficult to determine the cost-benefit ratio of controlling and preventing medusahead invasion. To estimate the impact of medusahead invasion, vegetation characteristics were compared between invaded and noninvaded Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis [Beetle & A. Young] S. L. Welsh) steppe communities that had similar soils, topography, climate, and management. Noninvaded plant communities had greater cover and density of all native herbaceous functional groups compared to medusahead-invaded communities (P < 0.01). Large perennial grass cover was 15-fold greater in the noninvaded compared to invaded plant communities. Sagebrush cover and density were greater in the noninvaded compared to the medusahead-invaded communities (P < 0.01). Biomass production of all native herbaceous functional groups was higher in noninvaded compared to invaded plant communities (P < 0.02). Perennial and annual forb biomass production was 1.9- and 45-fold more, respectively, in the noninvaded than invaded communities. Species richness and diversity were greater in the noninvaded than invaded plant communities (P < 0.01). The results of this study suggest that medusahead invasion substantially alters vegetation characteristics of sagebrush steppe plant communities, and thereby diminishes wildlife habitat, forage production, and ecosystem functions. Because of the broad negative influence of medusahead invasion, greater efforts should be directed at preventing its continued expansion.","Annual grass; Artemisia tridentata; Diversity; Invasive plants; Production; Taeniatherum caput-medusae; Weeds","biomass; comparative study; cost-benefit analysis; ecosystem function; forage; grass; invasive species; native species; population density; rangeland; shrub; species diversity; species richness; steppe; vegetation dynamics; weed; North America; Oregon; United States; Artemisia; Artemisia tridentata; Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis; Coleoptera; Taeniatherum; Taeniatherum caput-medusae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61949307651

However, food, or rather the production chain of food, from primary production (agriculture/aquaculture/fishing) to consumer and beyond, also results in some form of environmental impact, as does transport between steps. There are several life cycle assessment studies of food products, most of them analysing the impact of the food chain of single food items. Still, detailed studies of complete meals are less frequent in the literature. In the Swedish study presented in this article, the environmental impacts of two different chicken meals (homemade and semi-prepared) were analysed. The aim of the study was to gain knowledge of the environmental impact of integrated food chains and also to explore the effect of improvement measures in the post-farm systems. To this end, two chicken meals were chosen for analysis, with two scenarios for each meal; the first scenario reflects the present conditions of the food chain, and the second scenario incorporates a number of improvement actions in the stages after the farm. Materials and methods: Input data to the model were based mainly on previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of Swedish food products and studies on wastage and consumer transport. Food engineering data and information from producing companies were used for modelling the industries. The improvement scenario was constructed using insight from a preceding LCA study of a meatball meal (Sonesson et al., Ambio, 34:411-418, 2005a) along with goals set out by a Swedish agreement between representatives from national and regional government, food industry sectors and retailers. The impact assessment was conducted according to Lindfors et al. (Nordic guidelines on life cycle assessment, The Nordic Council of Ministers, Copenhagen, Denmark, 1995), and the following environmental effects were included: global warming potential, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, and use of primary energy carriers and secondary energy. Results: In terms of energy use, the largest part is used in the steps after the farm for both meal types. Hence, the changes made in the improvement scenario have a significant impact on the total energy use. For the homemade and semi-prepared meal, the reduction is 15% and 20% respectively, not only due to less consumer transport and packaging but also reduction in industry (semi-prepared). Agriculture is also a significant contributor to emissions of greenhouse gases and eutrophying emissions; for the homemade meal, around 40% of the greenhouse gases originate from agriculture, and for the semi-prepared meal, the figure is 50%. The improvement actions with the greatest reduction in greenhouse gases are, again, less consumer transport and, in the case of the semi-prepared meal, the reduction in energy use in industry. Regarding eutrophication, more than 90% of the emissions originate from agriculture. Hence, the only improvement action that has an effect here is the utilisation of raw material downstream in the production chain; a slight reduction in waste still gives a notable reduction in overall eutrophic emissions. Discussion: There are two significant areas of research to reduce the impact of meals that are not explored in this study: choice of meal components and production methods in agriculture. However, the aim with this study was to explore if there are further ways of reducing the impact without going into these very complex areas, and our conclusion is that there are effective ways in the post-farm chain to cut emissions that, together with choices of diet and agricultural research, can significantly reduce the impact of our food consumption. Conclusions: Actions in the post-farm chain that can significantly reduce the environmental impact of a meal are less food thrown away in the household, fewer car trips to the supermarket (e.g. only once a week) and, for semi-prepared food products, more efficient energy use in the food industry. The study shows that consumer actions prove just as important as industrial actions. Recommendations and perspectives: Further research is needed to understand the mechanism for the disposal of food, i.e. the reasons for food being wasted, and the relationship between shopping frequency, retail location, size of packaging, etc. in order to reduce the impact of waste and consumer transport. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Chicken; Environmental impact; Food; Improvement; Life cycle assessment; Meal; Sweden","ozone; agriculture; article; chicken meat; comparative study; environmental impact; eutrophication; food chain; food industry; food processing; government; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; meal; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249094317

The chemistry data from five precipitation-sampling sites were combined to provide a regional average for each summer season over the 21-year period from 1984 to 2004. The long-term trend of sulfate concentration is associated to a statistically significant extent by composited flow patterns associated with the East Pacific-North Pacific index. The regional weather pattern for the sulfate-rich years is associated with an intensification of the Bermuda High over the southeastern United States at the surface in tandem with a weakening of the 500-hPa. geopotential height (GPH) climatological trough located over the northeastern United States. The highest-sulfate concentration days for the Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network (AIRMoN) Pennsylvania site occurred during a similar synoptic pattern when intense convection over the eastern United States was favoured thermodynamically. This study suggests that temporal changes in the large-scale circulation pattern over North America need to be considered, in addition to changes in precursor emissions, as an explanation for the decreases in sulfate concentrations observed in summertime rains across the eastern United States.

In this study, the growth of L. monocytogenes under different CO2 concentrations as affected by the physiological state of the cells was investigated. Exponential-growth-phase, stationary-phase, dried, and starved cells were prepared and inoculated at 5°C into brain heart infusion broths that had been preequilibrated under atmospheres of 0, 20, 40, 60, or 80% CO2 (the balance was N 2). Lag-phase duration times (LDTs) and exponential growth rates were determined by enumerating cells at appropriate time intervals and by fitting the data to a three-phase linear function that has a lag period before the initiation of exponential growth. Longer LDTs were observed as the CO 2 concentration increased, with no growth observed at 80% CO 2 For example, the LDTs for exponential-phase, stationary-phase, starved, and dried cells were 2.21, 8.27, 9.17, and 9.67 days, respectively, under the 40% CO2 atmosphere.

Most soil organic nitrogen is macromolecular (chitin, protein, nucleotides); enzymatic depolymerization is likely rate limiting for plant nitrogen accumulation. Analyzing Avena (wild oat) planted in microcosms containing sieved field soil, we observed increased rhizosphere chitinase and protease-specific activities, bacterial cell densities, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compared with bulk soil. Low-molecular-weight (MW) DON (<3000 Da) was undetectable in bulk soil but comprised 15% of rhizosphere DON. Extracellular enzyme production in many bacteria requires quorum sensing (QS), cell-density-dependent group behavior. Because proteobacteria are considered major rhizosphere colonizers, we assayed the proteobacterial QS signals N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), which were significantly increased in the rhizosphere. To investigate the linkage between soil signaling and nitrogen cycling, we characterized 533 bacterial isolates from Avena rhizosphere: 24% had chitinase or protease activity and AHL production; disruption of QS in seven of eight isolates disrupted enzyme activity. Many Alphaproteobacteria were newly found with QS-controlled extracellular enzyme activity. Enhanced specific activities of nitrogen-cycling enzymes accompanied by bacterial density-dependent behaviors in rhizosphere soil gives rise to the hypothesis that QS could be a control point in the complex process of rhizosphere nitrogen mineralization.","Bacterial quorum sensing; Density-dependent bacterial group behavior; Extracellular enzymes; Nitrogen cycle; Rhizosphere soil","chitinase; gluconolactonase; n acylhomoserine lactone; organic nitrogen; proteinase; bacterium; biomineralization; density dependence; enzyme activity; gene expression; group behavior; growth rate; microbial activity; microbial community; microcosm; nitrogen cycle; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; Alphaproteobacteria; article; bacterial cell; bacterial colonization; cell density; controlled study; microcosm; molecular weight; nitrogen cycling; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oat; priority journal; protein synthesis; Proteobacteria; quorum sensing; rhizosphere; soil analysis; Acyl-Butyrolactones; Alphaproteobacteria; Avena sativa; Bacteria; Chitinase; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Nitrogen; Peptide Hydrolases; Plant Roots; Quorum Sensing; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Alphaproteobacteria; Avena; Avena fatua; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53949123076

We analyze a total of 150 observational spells in 122 days of data spreaded over the entire outburst phase of Feb. 2005 to Oct. 2005. From our study, a comprehensive understanding of the detailed behaviour of this black hole candidate has emerged. Based on the degree of importance of the black body and the power-law components we divide the entire episode in four spectral states, namely, hard, soft, very soft and intermediate. Quasi-Periodic oscillations (QPOs) were found in two out of these four states, namely, in the hard and the intermediate states. In the hard state, at the rising phase of the outburst, QPO frequency ranged from 0:034 - 17:78Hz and the spectra was fitted by a disk black body, power-law and iron emission line at 6:2 - 6:5 keV. In the intermediate state, QPOs vary from 13:17Hz to 19:04Hz and the QPO frequency modulation in this state was not significant. The spectra in this state are well fitted by the disk black body and the power-law components. In the hard state of the declining phase of the outburst, we found QPOs of decreasing frequency from 13:14 Hz to 0:034 Hz. The spectra of this state were fitted by a disk black body and power-law components, but in the initial few days a cooler Comptonized component was required for a better fit. In the soft/very soft states, the spectral states are mostly dominated by the strong disk black body component.","Individual (GRO J1655-40); Radiation hydrodynamics; Spectrum; Stars; X-ray sources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949513741

We chose not to consider the physiological effect of increased CO2 on plant production and kept CO2 fixed at 350 ppmv. Our simulations of the end of the 21st century result in less extensive tropical forests and reduced leaf area index and net primary productivity (NPP) where forest remains. At the northern and southern limits of the forest there is also a switch between tropical evergreen types and tropical deciduous types. With one climate scenario, vegetation cover and NPP increase around Lake Chad. The simulated climate change also results in widespread increase in evapotranspiration and reduction in runoff and NPP (proxies for important ecosystem services, like freshwater availability, food, timber and fuel supply) along the Atlantic coast.

The box summarises the results of the IPCC authors' analysis of the literature on the regional allocation of the emission reductions. The box states that Annex I countries as a group would need to reduce their emissions to below 1990 levels in 2020 by 25% to 40% for 450 ppm, 10% to 30% for 550 ppm and 0% to 25% for 650 ppm CO2-eq, even if emissions in developing countries deviate substantially from baseline for the low concentration target. In this paper, the IPCC authors of Box 13.7 provide background information and analyse whether new information, obtained after completion of the IPCC report, influences these ranges. The authors concluded that there is no argument for updating the ranges in Box 13.7. The allocation studies, which were published after the writing of the IPCC report, show reductions in line with the reduction ranges in the box. From the studies analysed, this paper specifies the ""substantial deviation"" or ""deviation from baseline"" in the box: emissions of non-Annex I countries as a group have to be below the baseline roughly between 15% to 30% for 450 ppm CO2-eq, 0% to 20% for 550 ppm CO2-eq and from 10% above to 10% below the baseline for 650 ppm CO2-eq, in 2020. These ranges apply to the whole group of non-Annex I countries and may differ substantially per country. The most important factor influencing these ranges above, for non-Annex I countries, and in the box, for Annex I countries, is new information on higher baseline emissions (e.g. that of Sheehan, Climatic Change, 2008, this issue). Other factors are the assumed global emission level in 2020 and assumptions on land-use change and forestry emissions. The current, slow pace in climate policy and the steady increase in global emissions, make it almost unfeasible to reach relatively low global emission levels in 2020 needed to meet 450 ppm CO2-eq, as was first assumed feasible by some studies, 5 years ago. © 2008 The Author(s).",,"Alternative fuels; Climatology; Concentration (process); Developing countries; Emission control; Forestry; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Metal drawing; Background informations; Base-lines; Climate policies; Climatic changes; Emission reductions; Global emissions; Greenhouse gas concentrations; Greenhouse Gas emissions; In lines; Low concentrations; Stabilisation; Working groups; Carbon monoxide; carbon dioxide; climate change; developing world; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; land use change; Carbon Monoxide; Concentration; Developing Countries; Forestry; Gas; Greenhouse Gases; Greenhouses; Land Use; Leakage; Metal Drawing; Meteorology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56549105431

It was found that abatement costs as percentages of GDP vary significantly by region, with high costs for the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, medium costs for the OECD regions and low costs or even gains for (other) developing regions. In addition to the abatement costs they incur, fossil-fuel-exporting regions are also likely to be affected by losses of coal and oil exports while the former Soviet Union and South America could experience increased bio-energy exports. Especially in the former Soviet Union and Asia, non-CO2 abatement options are important in the short term in reducing their emissions. Carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, bio-energy use and the use of renewables dominate reductions in the long term in all regions.

Several mitigation measures, referred to as 'geoengineering options', have been proposed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To be successful, such a mitigation operation must remove 'significant' CO2 from the atmosphere for many decades, be verifiable, and not cause deleterious side effects. One option, purposeful addition of iron to fertilize photosynthetic uptake of CO2 by phytoplankton in regions of the ocean where iron is a limiting nutrient, has received considerable scientific attention. In the last 15 yr, a dozen small-scale open ocean iron fertilization experiments have been performed and a succession of models of large-scale fertilization have been developed. As successive models have become more realistic, the amounts of CO2 forecast to be sequestered have dropped, and in all cases are small relative to the amounts of CO2 projected to be released through fossil fuel burning over the next century for any of the IPCC emission scenarios. Possible side effects include a long term reduction in ocean productivity, alteration of the structure of marine food webs, and a more rapid increase in ocean acidity. Most importantly, increased remineralization associated with the increased downward export of organic carbon particles would result in increased production of the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas, N2O. The magnitude of this effect is poorly known. © Inter-Research 2008.","Climate change; Iron fertilization; Mitigation; Ocean carbon cycle","acidity; carbon cycle; climate change; concentration (composition); fertilizer application; food web; iron; nutrient limitation; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; remineralization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50149116341

We evaluated the clinical biological effects of curcumin (diferuloyl-methane), a plant-derived dietary ingredient with potent nuclear factor-κB (NF- κB) and tumor inhibitory properties, against advanced pancreatic cancer. Experimental Design: Patients received 8 g curcumin by mouth daily until disease progression, with restaging every 2 months. Serum cytokine levels for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-1 receptor antagonists and peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of NF-κB and cyclooxygenase-2 were monitored. Results: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, with 21 evaluable for response. Circulating curcumin was detectable as drug in glucuronide and sulfate conjugate forms, albeit at low steady-state levels, suggesting poor oral bioavailability. Two patients showed clinical biological activity. One had ongoing stable disease for &gt;18 months; interestingly, one additional patient had a brief, but marked, tumor regression (73%) accompanied by significant increases (4- to 35-fold) in serum cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-1 receptor antagonists). No toxicities were observed. Curcumin down-regulated expression of NF-κB, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients (most of whom had baseline levels considerably higher than those found in healthy volunteers). Whereas there was considerable interpatient variation in plasma curcumin levels, drug levels peaked at 22 to 41 ng/mL and remained relatively constant over the first 4 weeks. Conclusions: Oral curcumin is well tolerated and, despite its limited absorption, has biological activity in some patients with pancreatic cancer.",,"curcumin; cyclooxygenase 2; gemcitabine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1 receptor; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; antineoplastic agent; curcumin; cyclooxygenase 2; cytokine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; absence of side effects; adult; advanced cancer; aged; antineoplastic activity; article; cancer growth; cancer staging; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled study; down regulation; drug absorption; drug tolerability; human; human tissue; pancreas cancer; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; protein expression; treatment response; adenocarcinoma; blood; drug effect; female; gel mobility shift assay; immunohistochemistry; male; metabolism; middle aged; pancreas tumor; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Curcumin; Cyclooxygenase 2; Cytokines; Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Middle Aged; NF-kappa B; Pancreatic Neoplasms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51649118928

The system was fed with treated unchlorinated effluent. Three sets of experiments were conducted. At first, the UF pilot unit was operated as a direct filtration unit. During the second phase, ultrafiltration was combined with the addition of a coagulant (alum). The last phase of the experiments involved the addition of activated carbon (either powdered or granular) into the system. During direct filtration, the average COD removal was 19%, while the average DOC was removed to a similar extent (25%). Effluent turbidity was practically independent of the influent turbidity with an overall average removal of 90%. Faecal and total coliform were also removed efficiently reaching average removals of 99.94% and 99.96%, respectively. Removal of heavy metals in particulate form also took place. When ultrafiltration was combined with in-line coagulation, the results were similar to those exhibited without coagulation. Combining ultrafiltration with powdered activated carbon resulted in DOC removal as high as 60%. However, after the addition of the PAC, the transmembrane pressure increased rapidly due to the formation of PAC cake on the membrane surface. Application of granular activated carbon resulted in 36% reduction of DOC without causing an increase to the trans-membrane pressure. Heavy metals present in the secondary effluent were also removed very efficiently by the GAC in the UF tank. © 2008.","Activated carbon adsorption; Coagulation; Immersed membrane; Municipal wastewater; Tertiary treatment; Ultrafiltration","Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Carbon; Charcoal; Chemical oxygen demand; Coagulation; Effluents; Experiments; Fiber optics; Filters (for fluids); Granular materials; Heavy metals; Metal recovery; Metals; Optical properties; Pollution; Porous materials; Removal; Turbidity; Ultrafiltration; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water filtration; Water pollution; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Activated carbon adsorption; Advanced treatments; COD removal; Direct filtration; Effluent turbidity; Fiber ultrafiltration; Granular activated carbons; Immersed membrane; In-line; Membrane surfaces; Municipal wastewater; Municipal wastewaters; Pilot-scale; Powdered activated carbon; Removal of heavy metals; Second phase; Secondary effluents; Tertiary treatment; Trans-membrane pressure; Waste water treatment plant; Activated carbon; activated carbon; adsorption; chemical oxygen demand; coagulation; dissolved organic carbon; effluent; heavy metal; membrane; turbidity; ultrafiltration; wastewater; water treatment; Crete; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Rethymne; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48449097994

The objective of this study was to assess whether, and to what extent, a lowering of the maximum speed limit from 100 to 80 kph had reduced traffic related air pollution in the direct vicinity of a highway. A monitoring station of the Amsterdam Air Quality Monitoring Network is situated adjacent to the intervened road section. Daily mean concentrations (PM10, PM1, Black Smoke and NOx) in the first year since the intervention were compared with measured concentrations in the prior year. The intervention effect was adjusted for daily traffic flow, congestion and downwind exposure. The concentration changes were compared with those observed at a section of the same ring highway where the speed limit had not been reduced. Since the intervention, the adjusted traffic contribution to PM10 concentrations has decreased by 2.20 μg m-3 (95%-CI: 1.43-2.98), PM1 0.42 μg m-3 (95%-CI: 0.01-0.82) and Black Smoke 3.57 μg m-3 (95%-CI: 1.50-5.65). At the not intervened highway section the adjusted traffic contribution to PM10 and Black Smoke concentrations has also decreased by 0.97 and 2.43 μg m-3 respectively. However, decreases were significantly greater for PM10 and PM1 at the intervention site. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a significant reduction of PM10 and PM1 as a result of reducing the speed limit at an urban ring highway. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Foliar fluoride contents of eight species collected at different distances from an aluminium smelter were analyzed. The plant species were: Baccaharis dracunculifolia, Bidens pilosa, Borreria verticillata, Calopogonium mucunoides, Erigeron bonariensis, Hedychium coronarium, Ipomoea purpurea and Ipomoea cairica. In all species the fluoride accumulation decreased exponentially with the distance from the emission source. There was specific and distinct variation in fluoride accumulation among the species, a group of high-accumulator species (B. dracunculifolia and Bidens pilosa) and a group of low-accumulator species (I. cairica, H. coronarium and Borreria verticillata). C. mucunoides and E. bonariensis occupied an intermediate position. There was a pattern of plant contamination response during the periods analyzed. The plants nearest to the emission source, between 0.4 km northwest and 1.1 km east, showed fluoride contamination traits in leaves reaching values between 100 and 500 μg g-1. Moreover, fluoride contents higher than 1000 μg g-1 were found in these plants. At the most distant stations, situated 2.9 km northwest and 6 km east from the factory, the fluoride content of the dry matter was less than 10 μg g-1 showing that plants at those distances were submitted to minimum contamination. There were different patterns of tolerance among the species analyzed. While B. dracunculifolia accumulated fluoride up to 1500 μg g-1 in dry matter without any signs of injury, Borreria verticillata showed severe necrosis in leaves, but the fluoride content found was not higher than 120 μg g-1. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most controversially discussed long-term solutions to climate change and air emission externalities is the introduction of hydrogen as an energy fuel and fuel cell vehicles. In this paper, we integrate the two debates on the sustainability of today's transport systems and on the opportunities, threats and possible transition paths towards a ""hydrogen economy"" in road transport. We focus our analysis on developed countries as well as the specific needs of the fast growing markets for car travel in the emerging economies. We conclude that the use of hydrogen can significantly reduce CO2 emissions of the transport sector, even if taking into account tailpipe and upstream emissions as well as alternative technology developments. Moreover, local air pollutants can be reduced up to 80%. Possible negative impacts, including accident risks, nuclear waste or increased biomass demand, need to be benchmarked against these benefits. Thus, we highlight the need for integrated energy and transport policies and argue for more reflexive and inclusive societal debate about the impacts and beneficiaries of hydrogen transport technologies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the relative magnitude of these sinks and sources has never been directly measured in this region, limiting our understanding of the role of fire in regional and US carbon budgets. We used the eddy covariance technique to measure the CO2 exchange of two forest sites, one burned by fire in 1996, and an unburned forest. The fire was a high-intensity stand-replacing burn that killed all trees. Ten years after the fire, the burned site was still a source of CO2 to the atmosphere [109±6 (SEM) g Cm-2yr-1], whereas the unburned site was a sink (-164 ± 23 g Cm-2 yr-1). The fire reduced total carbon storage and shifted ecosystem carbon allocation from the forest floor and living biomass to necromass. Annual ecosystem respiration was lower at the burned site (480 ± 5 g Cm-2yr-1) than at the unburned site (710 ± 54 g Cm-2 yr-1), but the difference in gross primary production was even larger (372 ± 13 g Cm-2yr-1 at the burned site and 858 ± 37 g Cm-2yr-1 at the unburned site). Water availability controlled carbon flux in the warm season at both sites, and the burned site was a source of carbon in all months, even during the summer, when wet and warm conditions favored respiration more than photosynthesis. Our study shows that carbon losses following stand-replacing fires in ponderosa pine forests can persist for decades due to slow recovery of the gross primary production. Because fire exclusion is becoming increasingly difficult in dry western forests, a large US forest carbon sink could shift to a decadal-scale carbon source. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Carbon; CO2 flux; Conifer; Disturbance; Eddy covariance; GPP; NEE; Pinus ponderosa; Respiration","carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; coniferous forest; ecosystem function; eddy covariance; environmental disturbance; long-term change; primary production; stand dynamics; wildfire; North America; United States; Coniferophyta; Pinus ponderosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949120720

Asthma management guidelines recommend avoiding exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants. A limitation of such recommendations is that they do not provide information about how the public should obtain and act on air quality information. Although the Air Quality Index (AQI) provides simplified outdoor air quality forecasts, communities with high rates of asthma morbidity tend to have low rates of internet access due to factors such as low socioeconomic status. Assessments of knowledge about air quality among low-income minority communities are lacking, as are community-based programs to educate the public about using the AQI. Methods. An air quality education program and system for disseminating air quality information were developed to promote pollutant avoidance during the reconstruction of a major highway in a low-income minority community on Chicago's South Side. The program, which centered on workshops run by community asthma educators, was evaluated using a pre-test, post-test, and 1-year follow-up questionnaire. Results. A total of 120 community workshop participants completed at least a portion of the evaluation process. At baseline, knowledge about air quality was limited. Following the workshops, substantial increases were noted in rates of correct answers to questions about health effects of air pollution, the availability of air quality information, and the color code for an AQI category. Approximately 1 year after the workshops were held, few participants could recall elements of the training. Few participants have internet access, and alternative means of distributing air quality information were suggested by study participants. Conclusions. Baseline knowledge of air quality information was limited in the community studied. Air quality education workshops conducted by community educators can increase knowledge about outdoor air quality and its impact on health over the short term. Refresher workshops or other efforts to sustain the knowledge increase may be useful. Given the known short-term and long-term effects of air quality on morbidity and mortality, air quality education efforts should be further developed, evaluated, and promoted for the general public, for people with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and given the documented health disparities within the general population, for low-income and minority communities.

The operating temperatures are lower than a critical temperature of 800 °C above which the combustion occurs in the vicinity of the fluidized bed. Our study focusses on the freeboard zone where most of the methane combustion takes place at such temperatures. Experimental results show the essential role of the projection zone in determining the global thermal efficiency of the reactor. The dense bed temperature, the fluidizing velocity and the mean particle diameter significantly affect the thermal behaviours. A model for natural gas-air mixture combustion in fluidized beds is proposed, counting for interactions between dense and dilute regions of the reactor [P. Pré, M. Hemati, B. Marchand, Study of natural gas combustion in fluidised beds: modelling and experimental validation, Chem. Eng.

Thermal exchanges due to the convection between gas and particles, and due to the conduction and radiation phenomena between the gas-particle suspension and the reactor walls are counted.

We attempted to: (1) identify the factors limiting this flux using additions of glucose and an electron transport uncoupler (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone); and (2) improve yearly estimates of Rr by directly measuring its Q 10in situ using temperature-controlled cuvettes buried around intact, attached roots. The proximal limits of Rr of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) and N fertilization were seasonally variable; enzyme capacity limited Rr in the winter, and a combination of substrate supply and adenylate availability limited Rr in summer months. The limiting factors of Rr were not affected by elevated CO2 or N fertilization. Elevated CO2increased annual stand-level Rr by 34% whereas the combination of elevated CO2 and N fertilization reduced Rr by 40%. Measurements of in situ Rr with high temporal resolution detected diel patterns that were correlated with canopy photosynthesis with a lag of 1 d or less as measured by eddy covariance, indicating a dynamic link between canopy photosynthesis and root respiration. These results suggest that Rr is coupled to daily canopy photosynthesis and increases with carbon allocation below ground. © 2008 The Authors.","Carbon cycle; Duke FACE; FACTS-1; Global climate change; Net ecosystem exchange; Soil respiration","ammonium nitrate; carbon; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; glucose; nitrate; nitrogen; canopy; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; enzyme; evergreen tree; global climate; glucose; net ecosystem exchange; nitrogen; photosynthesis; soil respiration; substrate; analysis of variance; article; atmosphere; cell respiration; ecosystem; loblolly pine; metabolism; oxygen consumption; photosynthesis; plant root; regression analysis; season; temperature; tree; United States; Analysis of Variance; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Respiration; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Glucose; Least-Squares Analysis; Nitrates; Nitrogen; North Carolina; Oxygen Consumption; Photosynthesis; Pinus taeda; Plant Roots; Seasons; Temperature; Trees; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53449098662

Alteration of the electric field and plasma rotation in the vicinity of magnetic islands is also an important factor in tokamak plasma confinement. In the STOR-M tokamak, fast (∼1 ms) simultaneous alterations of the radial electric field, plasma rotation (M|| = 0-0.4 in the plasma current direction), floating potential fluctuations in the periphery and MHD activity generated by rotating islands have been observed experimentally during normal ohmic discharges. The observed time and magnitude of the changes depend on the average electron density and poloidal beta at the beginning of the discharge. In discharges with high initial poloidal beta these changes are accompanied by a reduction in Hα emission and an increase in the line averaged density. Drastic decreases in Hα and increases in line averaged electron density and estimation of poloidal beta suggest that STOR-M confinement is significantly affected in ohmic discharges without an external additional energy input or biasing. MHD activity in STOR-M is damped when a negative electric field is observed at the limiter region of the plasma edge.

The keystone saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) establishes in cohorts. We test whether there is a statistical relationship between Carnegiea gigantea establishment and volcanic eruptions. Location: Northern Sonoran Desert, Arizona, USA. Methods: We use both a region-wide dataset made up of 30 populations, and a dataset from a marginal site. We incorporate data for over 750 individuals over an area of more than 50 000 km2. We created a 111-year time series of population peaks and troughs and correlated this over the 111-year record with the annual Weighted Historical Dust Veil Index (WHDVI). A t-test compared establishment patterns with the WHDVI. Results: We found a significant relationship between volcanism and C. gigantea regeneration at both the marginal site, and in the region-wide dataset. Conclusions: We suggest that while different populations are influenced by temporary global temperature ameliorations to different extents, our results show that populations do derive significant benefits from volcanic eruptions that promote their regeneration over large portions of their range, as is also exhibited locally at our marginal site, where populations are most susceptible to the inhospitable conditions that are witnessed at the edge of their range.

This paper discusses the challenges posed by measuring progress towards this target. It takes as a premise that the conventional production-based accounting framework, enshrined in the UNFCCC emissions accounting guidelines, is inappropriate for this task because it fails to account for the carbon 'traded' across the UK national boundary. Accordingly, it sets out a consumption-based accounting framework - using a two-region Environmental Input-Output (EIO) model - which could in principle measure progress in reducing the emissions attributable to final consumers in the UK. It illustrates the use of this framework to measure the reduction in carbon dioxide achieved by the UK between 1990 (the Kyoto base year) and the year 2004 and compares this against the production perspective. The results indicate that any progress towards the UK's carbon reduction targets (visible under a production perspective) disappears completely when viewed from a consumption perspective. But the robustness of this conclusion depends critically on the accuracy of underlying economic and environmental datasets as well as specific assumptions concerning imports. By analysing the consistency of UK Input-Output data, we conclude that EIO is still some way from being able to answer the critical question of the carbon trade balance for the UK.

We developed ultrasonication collection method for determination of the biomass and microbial attachment and growth in activated carbon filter. Based on this method, we found that using hydraulic cycle to immobilize cells onto GAC can greatly improve the attachment of inoculated microbial cells. The immobilization parameters of immobilization time and flow rate were optimized to assure the dominant growth of inoculated cells on GAC. To keep the consistency of the surrounding biological environment, sand layer and backwash were employed to dilute the locally enriched amino acids and cells due to the inoculation. Although the backwash can cause some cell detachment on GAC, this is of little significance compared with cells staying on GAC. Optimized hydraulic cycle immobilization (HCI) can accelerate the biodegradation process, thus extend the life of GAC, but has little effect on the stability of the surrounding biological environment.","Bacteria biomass; Granular activated carbon; Hydraulic cycle immobilization; Ultrasonic","Amines; Amino acids; Biochemical engineering; Biochemistry; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Biomass; Cell immobilization; Cells; Charcoal; Cytology; Elastic moduli; Electric currents; Fluid mechanics; Granular materials; Hydraulics; Life cycle; Optimization; Organic acids; Renewable energy resources; Water filtration; Water pollution; Water supply; Wave filters; Bacteria biomass; Granular activated carbon; Hydraulic cycle immobilization; Ultrasonic; Activated carbon; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349117705

For example, the Gulf Coast region of the United States could ultimately involve tens if not hundreds of storage sites with injection projects creating CO2 plumes with a cumulative surface area amounting to hundreds of square kilometers. The scale of individual injection projects is likely to be as large as or larger than any fluid injection projects previously permitted under the existing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program. In addition, CO2 is more buoyant (and therefore more upwardly mobile) than other fluids regulated by the UIC Program. All these factors combined lead us to the conclusion that the regulatory framework for geologic sequestration in deep brine reservoirs should be comprehensive and take into consideration concepts and approaches that significantly extend the scope of the current UIC framework. Any regulatory framework for CO2 sequestration should pay careful attention to relative risks. A key factor should be both the severity and probability of leakage and the scale of the potential impact on the local residents and ecology (e.g., the regulatory approach to permitting a 15-million ton/yr injection in the vicinity of a major metropolitan area vs. a similar injection in an area with very sparse population and very low biological diversity). The risk profile of large COs injection projects differ from contaminated water injections due to the buoyancy of CO2. As a result, the decades of UIC experience in permitting and monitoring such injection projects gives us limited insights into the behavior of large CO2 plumes. Numerical simulation should be an important tool in identifying potential risks. Comprehensive education and training of regulatory agency staff will be a prerequisite to effective implementation of any performance-based regulatory regime. Geologic CO 2 sequestration is a new technology that justifies and, arguably, requires a new approach to regulation and permitting. Development of a regulatory framework for geologic CO2 sequestration provides an opportunity implement new approaches to permitting and to enable improved accountability.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54249098589

In the short term, i.e. the period that will rely on current or existing technologies, the road map and priorities are clear. A variety of available technologies will lead to energy demand reduction in industrial processes, boiler operation, compressed air usage, electric motor efficiency, heating and lighting, and ancillary uses such as transport. The prospects for the commercial exploitation of innovative technologies by the middle of the 21st century are more speculative. Emphasis is therefore placed on the range of technology assessment methods that are likely to provide policy makers with a guide to progress in the development of high-temperature processes, improved materials, process integration and intensification, and improved industrial process control and monitoring. Key among the appraisal methods applicable to the energy sector is thermodynamic analysis, making use of energy, exergy and 'exergoeconomic' techniques. Technical and economic barriers will limit the improvement potential to perhaps a 30% cut in industrial energy use, which would make a significant contribution to reducing energy demand and carbon emissions in UK industry.

In this paper, recently calculated dairy GHG emissions for 2001 were extrapolated back to 1981 for census years using an index. The index was verified by comparing it with estimates based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology for 1991. The index agreed with the IPCC estimates within 1% for methane and 4% for nitrous oxide on a national scale with no region having a difference of more than 5% for methane. For nitrous oxide, all regions were within 10%, except British Columbia, where the index was 19% too high. The index indicates that GHG emissions from primary milk production within the Canadian dairy industry have decreased by about 49% since 1981, mainly due to a 57% reduction in the dairy cow population during that period. The GHG emissions per kilogram of milk decreased by 35%, that is from 1.22 kg CO2eq kg -1 milk to 0.91 kg CO2eq kg-1 milk. Because this study took into account the energy-related CO2 emissions from all the major farm inputs (fertilizer and fossil fuel), there was little risk of hidden GHG emissions in the emission intensity calculation. This study demonstrates that where lack of input data restricts historical application of simulation models, a semi-empirical index approach can yield valuable results.","Dairy industry; Greenhouse gas; Index; Intensity indicator","climate change; dairy farming; emission; greenhouse gas; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56849095519

Few studies have attempted to determine the contribution of individual land uses to water quality degradation in urban areas. A 40% urban, 332 ha watershed in Ithaca, NY was selected as the research site. Runoff collected from 98 precipitation events over a two-year period and three land uses was analyzed for ammonium NH 4+-N), and nitrate (NO3--N) and mass losses were calculated. Monitored land uses included fertilized lawns (FL), urban barren (UB) areas and wooded (FR) areas. Stream gauges were installed at the stream entrance to the urban area and the watershed outlet to monitor the impact of the urban land uses on stream water quality. A multivariate analysis of the data revealed that the FL land use had significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) nitrogen (N) loss than the other land uses in areas with shallow soil and high runoff potential. On the deeper soil where runoff was low, the FL land use had significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) N loss than the UB or FR land uses. Precipitation derived N inputs had an influence on N lost from all land uses in the watershed, while N measured in throughfall under the FR land use canopy was of the same order of magnitude as the N lost in runoff from these areas. As the stream flowed through the urban area there was a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in stream flow rates under storm conditions and a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in stream flow rates under dry conditions when compared to the undeveloped upper watershed. Areally weighted N loads in the stream were as high, and in many cases significantly higher (p&lt;0.05), from the undeveloped upper watershed than following streamflow through the urban area. This indicated that the urban area may be a N sink. The results demonstrate that it is imperative to assess land use performance both spatially and under varying climatic conditions in order to reduce surface water contamination. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Eutrophication; Flow rate; Nutrients; River pollution; Runoff; Stream flow; Urban growth; Water quality; Watersheds; Climatic conditions; Human health risks; Multi variate analysis; Precipitation events; Runoff potentials; Stream water quality; Water contamination; Water quality degradation; Land use",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904767429

Using state and country level data, net emissions of mercury from the marginal use of fluorescent lightbulbs are examined for a base year of 2004 for each of the 50 United States and 130 countries. Combustion of coal for electric power generation is generally the largest source of atmospheric mercury pollution; reduction in electricity demand from the substitution of incandescent bulbs with fluorescents leads to reduced mercury emissions during the use of the bulb. This analysis considers the local mix of power sources, coal quality, thermal conversion efficiencies, distribution losses, and any mercury control technologies that might be in place. Emissions of mercury from production and end-of-life treatment of the bulbs are also considered, providing a life-cycle perspective.

Coalfired power plants have therefore begun implementing flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubbers that use a highly oxygenated water stream (calcium-carbonate-saturated water) to transform sulfur gases into soluble anion species (sulfite and sulfate). The chemical compositions of FGD waters are dependent on the FGD scrubber design, coal types burned, chemical additives, and scrubbing solution source. The FGD waters contain potentially toxic elements including arsenic, cadmium, chemical oxygen demand (COD), copper, mercury, selenium, chloride, sulfates, and zinc. Therefore, these waters must be treated before discharge into a receiving system because of constituents that can elicit toxicity. The specific objectives of this research were to (1) characterize FGD waters in terms of chemical composition and constituents of concern, (2) design constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTSs) for the remediation of constituents of concern in FGD waters, and (3) measure the performance of CWTSs for formulated and actual FGD waters based on discharge criteria established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and regulated by National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits. The FGD waters are characteristically high in total dissolved solids (calcium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfate), are semineutral in pH, contain high concentrations of total suspended solids, and contain several potentially toxic constituents. Constituents of concern were identified as cadmium, COD, chloride, copper, mercury, selenium, and zinc. Pilot-scale CWTSs were designed based on biogeochemical data, and each system contained an equalization basin and two reducing and oxidizing wetland reactors in series. Three FGD waters were introduced in the pilot-scale CWTS, and the performance was assessed by measuring targeted constituents of concern (mercury and selenium) and the toxicity of pre- and posttreatment waters. Results from these studies indicate that mercury and selenium concentrations in FGD waters can be decreased using CWTSs, and, with an appropriate comanagement of low-ionic strength water for chloride concentrations, toxicity of posttreatment samples is decreased to acceptable discharge limits.

Their unique properties arise from special energy level structures in different host materials and highly efficient laser operation became possible with the availability of highly efficient high-brightness pump sources like laser diodes. This work will give an overview of quasi-three-level solid-state lasers emitting in the wavelength range 1-5 μm. Recent research and advances in spectroscopic and laser results will be presented. In comparison to four-level lasers such as e.g. Nd3+ lasers at 1.06 μm, quasi-three-level lasers show a much stronger influence of temperature on laser performance, mainly due to the thermally induced changes in the spectroscopic properties of the laser medium. Nevertheless, highly efficient lasers can be realized by direct diode pumping with high spatial and spectral brightness laser diodes. The population dynamics in the manifolds also play an important role and ion concentrations are used to minimize or maximize energy-transfer effects. These general topics will be addressed in Sect. 1, in which basic aspects of quasi-three-level lasers and their description are discussed. Section 2 deals with the general energy-level structure of trivalent rare earths in hosts, from which the most interesting ions and their transitions can be derived. These ions, Nd3+, Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+, are investigated in detail in Sect. 3 in order of their emission wavelengths, focusing on their spectral properties and laser results in different laser architectures and host media.

As a part of the Stockholm County Council environmental program it was decided in 2002 that the emissions should be drastically reduced. Different ways were theoretically evaluated, and catalytic splitting to nitrogen and oxygen gas (N2 and O2) was chosen for a demonstration installation. A Japanese commercial unit for treatment of mixed anaesthetic gases (Anesclean® from Showa Denko K.K.) was thoroughly modified and installed at the Karolinska University Hospital at Huddinge in Stockholm in 2004. The destruction of N 2O was optimised and studied for 2 years. Data from both collection and destruction are given in the article. Of the collected N2O more than 95% was split to N2 and O2 in the very stable system. The overall emission decrease was mainly dependent on the share that could be collected in the specific exhaustion system as compared to the normal room ventilation.

Several studies proved that the rhizome possesses diverse biological activities such as cytotoxic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Recently, interest in ginger for treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions has been renewed. Aim of the study: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the potential role of ginger extract [GE] in modulating the extent and severity of ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronically recurrent inflammatory bowel disease of unknown origin. Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats received 3 different doses of GE, sulfasalazine, or vehicle for 3 consecutive days before induction of UC by intra-rectal acetic acid administration, and continued further for 7 days after the induction. The colonic mucosal injury was assessed by macroscopic scoring, and histological examination. Furthermore, the mucosal content of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PCO), and reduced glutathione (GSH) with the catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, were appraised as parameters of the redox state. Acute inflammatory response was determined by measuring myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Results: All parameters were altered in ulcerated rats, and improved in animals receiving GE, an effect that was comparable to that of the standard sulfasalazine, especially at the highest dose level. Colonic mucosal injury parallels with the histological and biochemical evaluations. Conclusions: Results showed a valuable effect of ginger extract against acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis possibly by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Fossil evidence from lowland BLB organic deposits dating to the Last Glaciation indicates that this broad region was dominated by shrub tundra vegetation, and had a mesic climate. The dominant ecosystem in Western Beringia and the interior regions of Eastern Beringia was steppe-tundra, with herbaceous plant communities and arid climate. Although Western and Eastern Beringia shared many species in common during the Late Pleistocene, there were a number of species that were restricted to only one side of the BLB. Among the vertebrate fauna, the woolly rhinoceros was found only to the west of the BLB, North American camels, bonnet-horned musk-oxen and some horse species were found only to the east of the land bridge. These were all steppe-tundra inhabitants, adapted to grazing. The same phenomenon can be seen in the insect faunas of the Western and Eastern Beringia. The steppe-tundra beetle fauna of Western Beringia was dominated by weevils of the genus Stephanocleonus, a group that was virtually absent from Eastern Beringia. The dry-adapted weevils, Lepidophorus lineaticollis and Vitavitus thulius were important members of steppe-tundra communities in Eastern Beringia, but were either absent or rare in Western Beringia. The leaf beetles Chrysolina arctica, C. brunnicornis bermani, and Galeruca interrupta circumdata were typical members of the Pleistocene steppe-tundra communities of Western Beringia, but absent from Eastern Beringia. On the other hand, some steppe tundra-adapted leaf beetles managed to occupy both sides of the BLB, such as Phaedon armoraciae. Much of the BLB remains unstudied, but on biogeographic grounds, it appears that there was some kind of biological filter that blocked the movements of some steppe-tundra plants and animals across the BLB. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods and Materials: Predictions of the LEM are compared with a broad panel of experimental data in vitro and to the tolerance of the rat spinal cord in vivo. To improve the accuracy of the LEM, the description of track structure is modified by taking into account a velocity-dependent extension of the inner part of the track. Results: The original version of the LEM (LEM I) underestimates the therapeutic ratio of carbon ions (i.e., the ratio of RBE in the Bragg peak region as compared with the RBE in the entrance channel). Although significantly reduced, the cluster extension of the LEM (LEM II) still shows the same tendency. Implementation of the modified track structure (LEM III) almost completely compensates these systematic deviations, and predictions of RBE by LEM III for high and low energetic carbon ions show good agreement for a wide panel of different cell lines, as well as for the tolerance of the rat spinal cord. As a consequence, the expected RBE in the normal tissue surrounding the tumor becomes significantly lower than estimated with the LEM in its original version (LEM I). Conclusions: The modified track structure description represents an empiric approach to improve the accuracy of the LEM for treatment planning. This will be particularly useful for further optimization of carbon ion therapy in general and with respect to comparison with other treatment modalities, such as protons or intensity-modulated radiotherapy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Although there is a substantial theoretical literature investigating the potential for various environmental policies to attain these dual goals, this is a challenging empirical problem because every industry has its own inherent characteristics that play an important role in determining the performance of different regulatory tools. The majority of the work to date focuses on pollution abatement while leaving pollution prevention understudied. In most of the literature firms are also assumed to be symmetric. Asymmetries among firms add another degree and level of complexity to their strategic interactions, and affect the performance of different regulatory tools. This paper investigates the performance of two alternative regulatory tools, an emissions performance standard and an emissions tax, in reducing pollution and inducing pollution prevention and abatement R&D in the US pulp and paper industry. We construct a model representing the industry in an asymmetric Cournot duopoly framework, calibrate the model to disaggregated industry data, and run scenarios to replicate the behavior of the firms in an imperfectly competitive output market. Our results suggest that pollution prevention R&D can respond quite differently than abatement R&D to different policy instruments. The results indicate that R&D spillovers among firms play crucial role in technology development and strategies of the firms. Our results also suggest that strategic interactions between firms in an imperfectly competitive industry can have significant impacts of the levels of both types of R&D. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Environmental policy; Pollution abatement; Pollution prevention; R&D; Technology","Air pollution; Computer networks; Environmental protection; Flow interactions; Industrial economics; Industrial management; Industrial research; Industry; Innovation; Mathematical models; Multitasking; Paper; Paper coating; Paper products; Planning; Pollution; Public policy; Pulp; Standards; Strategic planning; Technological forecasting; Technology; Tools; Weight control; (algorithmic) complexity; (OTDR) technology; (R ,S)-symmetric; Business media; Cournot duopoly; Different types; Emissions (asphalt); Emissions performance; Environmental economics; Environmental policies; Industrial organizations; policy instruments; pollution abatement; Pollution prevention (PP); Pulp and paper; Significant impacts; Springer (CO); Strategic interactions; Technology development (TD); Paper and pulp industry; environmental economics; game theory; industrial competition; pollution control; pollution policy; pulp and paper industry; regulatory approach; research and development; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45749113005

This decline has now reached a plateau. Several new regulatory programs have been put in place to further reduce PCB emissions/releases. However, our ability to measure the effectiveness of these regulatory/voluntary programs and to support regional fate/transport and source/receptor modeling efforts depend on reliable emission information. In this study, we attempt to improve the emission inventory for PCBs by compiling and analyzing the multimedia total PCB emission/release data reported for the U.S Great Lakes states for each year from 1990 to 2000. Although Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), National Emissions Inventory (NEI), Great Lakes Regional Air Toxic Emissions Inventory (GLRATEI), and Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) data formed the basis of estimating air emissions, we used the TRI, National Response Center (NRC), and PCB transformer inventory data to estimate PCB releases to land. We used the Permit Compliance System and NRC data to obtain estimates of PCB discharges to water systems in the Great Lakes states. The Remedial Action Plans for each area of concern were the primary source for estimating PCB loads of dredged sediments. On the basis of the NEI, IADN, and GLRATEI data, the total air emissions within the decade were approximately 126 t. The regionwide discharges to water systems and releases to land in the form of landfills and accidental spills in 1990-2000 were estimated as approximately 170 and 3225 t, respectively. We estimated that approximately 1.3 million t of PCB-contaminated sediment were removed or targeted for removal in five lakes of the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes basin.

J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1991, 258). Using a model species, trans-[IrMe(PH3)2(PH2Et)], a low-energy mechanism involving nucleophilic attack of the electron-rich Ir metal center at C6F6 with displacement of fluoride has been identified. A novel feature of this process is the capture of fluoride by a phosphine ligand to generate a metallophosphorane intermediate [Ir(C6F 5)(Me)(PH3)2(PH2EtF)]. These events occur in a single step via a 4-centered transition state, in a process that we have termed ""phosphine-assisted C-F activation"". Alternative mechanisms based on C-F activation via concerted oxidative addition or electron-transfer processes proved less favorable. From the metallophosphorane intermediate the formation of the final products can be accounted for by facile ethyl group transfer from phosphorus to iridium followed by β-H elimination of ethene and reductive elimination of methane. The interpretation of phosphine-assisted C-F activation in terms of nucleophilic attack is supported by the reduced activation barriers computed with the more electron-rich model reactant trans-[IrMe(PMe3)2(PMe2Et)] and the higher barriers found with lesser fluorinated arenes. Reactivity patterns for a range of fluoroarenes indicate the dominance of the presence of ortho-F substituents in promoting phosphine-assisted C-F activation, and an analysis of the charge distribution and transition state geometries indicates that this process is controlled by the strength of the Ir-aryl bond that is being formed. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation analysis; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Ethylene; Iridium; Methane; Phosphorus; Phosphorus compounds; Activation barriers; Activation pathways; Alternative mechanisms; Bond activations; Computational studies; Density functional theory calculations; Energy mechanisms; Ethyl groups; Final products; Fluoroarenes; H eliminations; Metal centers; Metallophosphorane; Model reactants; Nucleophilic attacks; Oxidative additions; Phosphine ligands; Reactivity patterns; Reductive eliminations; Single steps; Transfer processes; Transition state geometries; Transition states; Chemical activation; fluoride; iridium; metallophosphorane; methane; phosphine derivative; phosphorane derivative; phosphorus; unclassified drug; article; calculation; carbon fluoride bond; chemical bond; chemical reaction; defluorination; electron transport; fluorination; geometry; molecular dynamics; oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449129482

Hydrogen is colorless, odorless and its only by-product is water. It offers cost-effective solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol), improve air quality, diversify energy supply and reduce noise. The use of hydrogen with the practical application of household fuel cells such as micro-cogeneration and fuel-cell vehicles signifies a paradigm shift from a society that burns fossil fuels, to a society based around hydrogen. In the short term, hydrogen could be used in urban vehicles, which would reduce emissions in city centers. In the long term, it could be used in combined heat/power generation, in industry, in residential applications and in every form of transport like ships, trains and airplanes. There are several methods of producing hydrogen from fossil resources such as natural gas or naphtha, for example, steam reforming, partial oxidation and autothermal reforming. Among these, steam reforming of natural gas is a widely used method of extracting hydrogen by a process in which natural gas and steam are caused to react in a reactor filled with a catalyst. In this article, the effects of reforming operation parameters on the product distribution and conversion efficiency of hydrocarbon mixtures were discussed. The investigated reforming options are autothermal reforming (ATR), steam reforming (SR) and partial oxidation (POX). The ASPEN-HYSIS 3.2 process simulation software code has been utilized for the calculations of the whole fuel processing systems. Natural gas fuel has been simulated and applied to the flow-sheet model. It is desired to produce hydrogen-rich reformate gas with as low as possible CO formation. Different parametric process simulation studies have been studied such as reactor temperature affects the steam to carbon (S/C) and oxygen to carbon (O2/C) ratios. Net electrical and fuel processing efficiencies of all selected options have been investigated as well. The results indicate that these selected operation parameters are very important for the appropriate selection of the most efficient system approach. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen; Micro-cogeneration; PEM fuel cell; Reforming","Air pollution; Air quality; Catalyst activity; Chemical elements; Chemical oxygen demand; Conversion efficiency; Cost effectiveness; Electric batteries; Electrochemistry; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuels; Gas industry; Gas supply; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Nonmetals; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Oxygen; Reforming reactions; Ships; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Steam; Steam engineering; Autothermal reforming; Co formations; Cogeneration systems; Effective solutions; Efficient systems; Energy supplies; Fossil resources; Fuel processing; Fuel processing systems; Greenhouse Gas emissions; Household fuel cells; Hydrocarbon mixtures; Hydrocarbon reforming; Kyoto protocols; Long terms; Micro-cogeneration; Natural gas fuels; Operation parameters; Paradigm shifts; Parametric processes; Partial oxidations; PEM fuel cell; Process simulation softwares; Product distributions; Reactor temperatures; Reformate gasses; Reforming; Residential applications; Short terms; Steam reforming; Urban vehicles; Weight ratios; Leakage (fluid)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449110482

Initially, wetland science and management emerged as professions in response to widespread conversion of wetlands to other uses and concerns over negative impacts on wildlife populations, especially migratory birds. Consequently, wetland management was focused on wildlife, and the initial management technique was simply to protect wetlands. However, extensive conversion of lands for agricultural and urban expansion over the past 60 years has modified ecosystem processes at the landscape scale sufficiently to compromise wetland management activities on adjacent lands dedicated to conservation. Moreover, society now expects a broad suite of ecosystem services to be delivered. As a result, many previously used wetland management techniques are no longer appropriate because they do not take into account influences of adjacent land uses or other ecosystem services, such as ground-water recharge. Other early management approaches may have been ineffective because they were based on an incomplete understanding of wetland processes or social influences. Meanwhile, wetland losses continued, as well as loss of services provided by the remaining managed wetlands. Regulation starting in the 1970s and subsequent research attention on wetland functioning has led to new knowledge and a broader understanding of wetland processes and recognition of the full suite of services (e.g., water storage, water quality improvement, aquifer maintenance, climate mitigation). To be effective in today's highly modified landscape, knowledge of social choices, political influences, and dynamic wetland processes is required to meet wetland management objectives for a range of ecosystem services. We argue that adopting a process-based perspective is critical to develop strategies to optimize a suite of wetland services, including providing traditional wildlife habitat. © 2008 The Society of Wetland Scientists.","Wetland ecology; Wetland processes; Wetland science; Wildlife management","ecological impact; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental education; landscape change; political power; regulatory approach; sustainability; wetland management; wildlife management; United States; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58349121263

Since many of the compounds comprising DOC are acidic, the resulting increases in organic acidity may have the potential to offset the benefits of a decrease in mineral (sulphate) acidity. To test this, we used a triprotic model of organic acid dissociation to estimate the proportional organic acid buffering of reduced mineral acidity as measured in the 22 lakes and streams monitored by the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network. For an average non-marine sulphate decrease of 30 μeq l- 1 over 15 years from 1988-2003, we estimate that around 28% was counterbalanced by rising strong organic acids, 20% by rising alkalinity (partly attributable to an increase in weak organic acids), 11% by falling inorganic aluminium and 41% by falling non-marine base cations. The situation is complicated by a concurrent decrease in marine ion concentrations, and the impact this may have had on both DOC and acidity, but results clearly demonstrate that organic acid increases have substantially limited the amount of recovery from acidification (in terms of rising alkalinity and falling aluminium) that have resulted from reducing sulphur emissions. The consistency and magnitude of sulphate and organic acid changes are consistent with a causal link between the two, possibly due to the effects of changing acidity, ionic strength and aluminium concentrations on organic matter solubility. If this is the case, then organic acids can be considered effective but partial buffers to acidity change in organic soils, and this mechanism needs to be considered in assessing and modelling recovery from acidification, and in defining realistic reference conditions. However, large spatial variations in the relative magnitude of organic acid and sulphate changes, notably for low-deposition sites in northwestern areas where organic acid increases apparently exceed non-marine sulphate decreases, suggest that additional factors, such as changes in sea-salt deposition and climatic factors, may be required to explain the full magnitude of DOC increases in UK surface waters. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Two proposed drivers of these increases are (1) deposition of atmospheric pollutant nitrogen (N) with consequent effects on plant and decomposer carbon dynamics, and (2) soil recovery from acidification associated with decreasing sulphur deposition. Examination of 12 European and North American field N addition experiments showed inconsistent (positive, neutral, and negative) responses of DOC to N addition. However, responses were linked to the form of N added and to resulting changes in soil acidity. Sodium nitrate additions consistently increased DOC, whereas ammonium salts additions usually decreased DOC. Leachate chemistry was used to calculate an index of ""ANC forcing"" of the effect of fertilization on the acid-base balance, which showed that DOC increased in response to all de-acidifying N additions, and decreased in response to all but three acidifying N additions. Exceptions occurred at two sites where N additions caused tree mortality, and one experiment located on an older, unglaciated soil with high anion adsorption capacity. We conclude that collectively these experiments do not provide clear support for the role of N deposition as the sole driver of rising DOC, but are largely consistent with an acidity-change mechanism. It is however possible that the unintended effect of acidity change on DOC mobility masks genuine effects of experimental N enrichment on DOC production and degradation. We suggest that there is a need, more generally, for interpretation of N manipulation experiments to take account of the effects that experimentally-induced changes in acidity, rather than elevated N per se, may have on ecosystem biogeochemistry. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acidity; ANC forcing; Atmospheric deposition; Dissolved organic carbon; Manipulation experiments; Nitrogen","acid soil; acidification; acidity; adsorption; atmospheric deposition; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; experimental study; leachate; upland region",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349114604

Towards this goal, serious technological obstacles are set: (i) by the non-isothermal operation of the redox process, that causes serious reactor construction problems, and (ii) by the need for efficient high temperature oxygen/hydrogen separation technology which is a very challenging development. In this paper, perovskite materials having the formula La0.3Sr0.7FeO3 were synthesized and subsequently tested for their high temperature oxidation/reduction behavior. The redox activity of the materials in relation to the water splitting reaction has been also investigated. Dense, disc shaped membranes of the materials were synthesized and placed in a membrane reactor. Experiments at 1133 K revealed the possibility of performing the reduction and oxidation steps simultaneously and isothermally on each side of the membrane reactor. A steady-state situation was thereby achieved where hydrogen was continuously produced on one side while the material was simultaneously regenerated on the other side. The created oxygen vacancy gradient formed the driving force for a continuous flux of vacancies from the membrane reduction surface to the membrane oxidation surface. The hydrogen production rate under the particular experimental conditions estimated to be ∼47.5 cm3 H2 (STP) m-2 min-1. It could be increased by a factor of approximately 3, up to ∼145 cm3 H2 (STP) m-2 min-1, if the membrane reduction was enhanced with a reductant such as carbon monoxide. This approach resulted in an efficient execution of the water gas shift reaction towards high purity hydrogen production. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that 1) heating-induced hypocapnia and peripheral redistribution of cardiac output (Q̇) would compromise blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAv) and cerebral oxygenation; 2) Hypo would exacerbate the hyperthermic-induced hypocapnia, further decreasing MCAv; and 3) heating would reduce MCAv-CO2 reactivity, thereby altering ventilation. Ten men, resting supine in a water-perfused suit, underwent progressive hyperthermia [0.5°C increments in core (esophageal) temperature (TC) to +2°C] while euhydrated (Euh) or Hypo by 1.5% body mass (attained previous evening). Time-control (i.e., non-heat stressed) data were obtained on six of these subjects. Cerebral oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy), MCAv, end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) and arterial blood pressure, Q̇ (flow model), and brachial and carotid blood flows (CCA) were measured continuously each 0.5°C change in TC. At each level, hypercapnia was achieved through 3-min administrations of 5% CO2, and hypocapnia was achieved with controlled hyperventilation. At baseline in Hypo, heart rate, MCAv and CCA were elevated (P &lt; 0.05 vs. Euh). MCAv-CO2 reactivity was unchanged in both groups at all TC levels. Independent of hydration, hyperthermic-induced hyperventilation caused a severe drop in PETCO2 (-8 ± 1 mmHg/°C), which was related to lower MCAv (-15 ± 3%/°C; R2 = 0.98; P &lt; 0.001). Elevations in Q̇ were related to increases in brachial blood flow (R2 = 0.65; P &lt; 0.01) and reductions in MCAv (R2 = 0.70; P &lt; 0.01), reflecting peripheral distribution of Q̇. Cerebral oxygenation was maintained, presumably via enhanced O2-extraction or regional differences in cerebral perfusion.

Conventional models of cancer progression are typically based on the genetic and epigenetic changes observed in malignant and premalignant tumors. We have explored an alternative approach that emphasizes the selection forces within adaptive landscapes governing growth and evolution in in situ, microinvasive, and metastatic cancers. In each environment, specific barriers to proliferation act as strong selection forces that determine the optimal phenotypic properties that permit tumor growth and invasion. Thus, the phenotypic properties or ""hallmarks"" of cancer can be viewed as successful adaptations to these microenvironmental selection forces. In turn, these selection pressures are not static but will dynamically change as a result of tumor population growth and evolution. Here, we emphasize the role of hypoxia and acidosis in the progression of tumor from in situ to invasive cancer. This is a consequence of early tumor cell proliferation on epithelial surfaces, which are separated from the underlying blood supply by the intact basement membrane. As tumor cells proliferate further away from the basement membrane, the diffusion-reaction kinetics of substrate and metabolite flow to and from the blood vessels result in regional hypoxia and acidosis. Cellular adaptation to the former include upregulation of glcyolysis and to the latter include upregulation of Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE1) and other acid-regulating proteins such as carbonic anhydrase. We propose this phenotype is critical for subsequent malignant growth of primary and metastatic cancers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

High-speed liquid fuel Mie-scattering was employed to investigate the liquid distribution and evolution. By carefully setting up the optics, three-dimensional images of fuel spray were obtained from both the bottom of the piston and the side window. The NOx emissions were measured in the exhaust pipe. The influence of injection pressure and injection timing on liquid fuel evolution and combustion characteristics was studied under similar fuel quantities. Interesting spray development was seen from the side window images. Liquid impingement was found for all of the cases due to the small diameter of the piston bowl. The liquid fuel tip hits the bowl wall obliquely and spreads as a wall jet in the radial direction of the spray. Due to the bowl geometry, the fuel film moves back into the central part of the bowl, which enhances the air-fuel mixing process and prepares a more homogeneous air-fuel mixture. Stronger impingement was seen for high injection pressures. Injection timing had little effect on fuel impingement. No liquid fuel was seen before ignition, indicating premixed combustion for all the cases. High-speed combustion video was taken using the same frame rate. Ignition was seen to occur on or near the bowl wall in the vicinity of the spray tip, with the ignition delay being noticeably longer for lower injection pressure and later injection timing. The majority of the flame was confined to the bowl region throughout the combustion event. A more homogeneous and weaker flame was observed for higher injection pressures and later injection timing. The combustion structure also proves the mixing enhancement effect of the liquid fuel impingement. The results show that ultra-low sooting combustion is feasible in an HSDI diesel engine with a higher injection pressure, a higher EGR rate, or later injection timing, with little penalty on power output. It was also found that injection timing has more influence on HCCI-like combustion using a single main injection than the other two factors studied. Compared with the base cases, simultaneous reductions of soot and NOx were obtained by increasing EGR rate and retarding injection timing. By increasing injection pressure, NOx emissions were increased due to leaner and faster combustion with better air-fuel mixing. However, smoke emissions were significantly reduced with increased injection pressure. © 2008 The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg GmbH.","HCCI combustion; HSDI diesel engine; MK combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549102483

Methane emissions occurred mainly in the first two days after application and were observed only in treatments with the US and liquid fractions. Significant N2O emissions were observed only in the US and liquid fractions treatments. A significant increase of the grass yield relatively to the US was observed in plots amended with the composted solid fraction and with the PAM-sup fraction resulting from the PAM sediment settling of the liquid fraction previously obtained by screw press separation, whereas in all other treatments, no significant differences were observed.

Field experiments showed an increase in pH, total nitrogen, organic carbon, and carbonate contents; a reduction of diethylenetetramine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)- and water-extractable metals; and an improvement of plant establishment. The field studies showed that pig manure could be utilized to remediate polluted soils. Column studies in the laboratory showed that amendment of mine soil with pig manure initially increased soil pH from 2.21 to 6.34, promoted reduced conditions in the surface soil, and decreased the metal mobility. After 21 weeks, while the leachate was slightly acidic, however, the mobility of metals was substantially low.

HD 179218 shows a double ring-like 10 μm emission with the first ring peaking at ∼1 AU and the second at ∼20 AU. The [O I] emitting region is more compact, peaking between 3-6 AU.Conclusions. The disks around HD 101412 and HD 135344 B appear strongly flared in the gas, but self-shadowed in the dust beyond ∼2 AU. The difference in the gas and dust vertical structure beyond 2 AU might be the first observational evidence of gas-dust decoupling in protoplanetary disks. The disk around HD 179218 is flared in the dust. The 10 μm emission emerges from the inner rim and from the flared surface of the disk at larger radii. No dust emission is detected between ∼3-15 AU. The oxygen emission seems also to come from a flared structure, however, the bulk of this emission is produced between ∼1-10 AU. This could indicate a lack of gas in the outer disk or could be due to chemical effects which reduce the abundance of OH - the parent molecule of the observed [O I] emission - further away from the star. It may also be a contrast effect if the [O I] emission is much stronger in the inner disk. We suggest that the three systems, HD 179218, HD 135344 B and HD 101412, may form an evolutionary sequence: the disk initially flared becomes flat under the combined action of gas-dust decoupling, grain growth and dust settling. © 2008 ESO.","Stars: circumstellar matter; Stars: planetary systems: protoplanetary disks; Stars: pre-main sequence","Astronomy; Compact disks; Disks (machine components); Disks (structural components); Dust; Emission spectroscopy; Gases; Grain growth; Oxygen; Powders; Stars; Brightness profiles; Chemical effects; Contrast effects; Double rings; Dust emissions; Dust settling; Forming regions; Gas distributions; Geometrical models; High resolutions; Mass stars; Optical-; PAH emissions; Parent molecules; Peaked structures; Protoplanetary disks; Spatially resolved; Stars: circumstellar matter; Stars: planetary systems: protoplanetary disks; Stars: pre-main sequence; Vertical structures; Leakage (fluid)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049085314

A total of 27 tests was performed. The chord member of the test specimen was filled with concrete along its full length. Both high strength stainless steel (duplex and high strength austenitic) and normal strength stainless steel (AISI 304) specimens filled with nominal concrete cylinder strength of 30 MPa were tested. The axial compression force was applied to the top end of the brace member, which was welded to the center of the chord member. Local buckling failure of brace member was the main failure mode observed during the tests. Hence, the axial compression force was then applied by means of a steel bearing plate to avoid failure of brace member. The failure modes of chord face failure and chord side wall failure as well as crushing of the concrete infill were observed. All the tests were performed by supporting the chord member of the specimen along its entire length to apply the pure concentrated force without any bending moment. The test results were also compared with design rules for carbon steel tubular structures, which is the only existing design guideline for concrete-filled tubular joints. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the current design rules are quite conservative for the test specimens.

They did not examine the effect of buoyancy on vertical stratification. Since seawater upwelled from depth is colder and saltier, and therefore denser than surface water, it would have to be diluted sufficiently to prevent its convective sinking. This dilution would lead to a decrease in vertical stratification, which could counteract N2 fixation, as diazotrophs bloom only under well-stratified conditions.

Four different piles were made of EGM in Pile 1, EGM mixed with cow manure and straw (CMS) in Pile 2, EGM mixed with municipal solid waste (MSW) in Pile 3 and EGM mixed with grape stalks (GS) in Pile 4. The results obtained were modelled to determine the main kinetic and stoichiometric parameters. Regarding to the rate constants of the composting processes they were increased from 0.033 d-1, the value obtained when EGM was composted alone, to 0.040 and 0.044 d-1 when MSW and GS were added, respectively as co-substrates. However, the addition of CMS reduced the rate constant. About the biodegradable carbon fractions, it was observed that the co-composting reduced significantly the remanent carbon concentration after composting in all the piles whilst increased the readily biodegradable carbon fractions from 35, the value obtained when EGM was composted alone, to 50 and 60%, respectively when MSW or GS were added. As regards the temperature profiles, only Piles 1 and 4 achieved thermal hygienization values and about the nitrogen losses, the lowest percentage of nitrogen loss took place when GS were added, because of its optimum pH and C/N initial ratio. Thus, though any of these wastes could be used for co-composting with EGM, the use of GS as co-substrate and bulking agent for the co-composting process of EGM was recommended. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Our previous studies showed that a large percentage of the SOC accrued under invading woody clusters was not stabilized within protective soil aggregates or on mineral-surfaces. Here we evaluated lignin and cutin- and suberin-derived substituted fatty acid (SFA) chemistry to determine if the accrual of nonaggregated particulate organic matter (POM) in woodlands was promoted by inherently greater recalcitrance of tissues from woody versus grass species, and if there was selective input of aboveground versus belowground plant carbon to POM. Woody clusters exhibited reduced concentrations of cutin-derived SFA and cinnamyl phenols within surface litter compared to fresh aboveground plant material. However, root litter exhibited relatively minor changes in biopolymer chemistry compared to fresh root tissue, suggesting it was either more stable or was refreshed at a greater rate. Between 14 and 105 years of woody plant encroachment, SFA in free POM fractions appeared to be consistently derived from root material while SFA within intraaggregate POM were increasingly derived from cutin sources. In addition, the shift from herbaceous to woody input was accompanied by enrichment in the amount of cutin and suberin-derived aliphatics with respect to lignin in both root and surface litter as well as nonaggregated POM. Woody plant encroachment at this site results in the rapid accrual of POM pools that are biochemically recalcitrant, providing a mechanism by which soil organic carbon can accumulate in this sandy soil system. Our results also lend further credence to the hypothesis that aliphatic biopolymers, particularly root-derived suberin, are important components of long-term soil organic carbon stabilization Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); fatty acid; grassland; lignin; particulate organic carbon; savanna; soil organic matter; woodland; North America; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60049089097

Methods and Results - Local inflammation was provoked in 2 separate murine models of acute cardiac and cerebral ischemia, followed by intravenous injection of PFCs. Simultaneous acquisition of morphologically matching proton ( 1H) and fluorine ( 19F) images enabled an exact anatomic localization of PFCs after application. Repetitive 1H/ 19F magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4 T revealed a time-dependent infiltration of injected PFCs into the border zone of infarcted areas in both injury models, and histology demonstrated a colocalization of PFCs with cells of the monocyte/macro-phage system. We regularly found the accumulation of PFCs in lymph nodes. Using rhodamine-labeled PFCs, we identified circulating monocytes/macrophages as the main cell fraction taking up injected nanoparticles. Conclusions - PFCs can serve as a ""positive"" contrast agent for the detection of inflammation by magnetic resonance imaging, permitting a spatial resolution close to the anatomic 1H image and an excellent degree of specificity resulting from the lack of any 19F background. Because PFCs are nontoxic, this approach may have a broad application in the imaging and diagnosis of numerous inflammatory disease states. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.","Inflammation; Ischemia; Macrophages; Magnetic resonance imaging; Monocytes; Perfluorocarbons","fluorine; nanoparticle; proton; rhodamine; fluorocarbon; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; brain ischemia; cell fractionation; controlled study; heart muscle ischemia; histology; in vivo study; inflammation; inflammatory infiltrate; lymph node; macrophage; monocyte; morphology; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; animal; emulsion; inflammation; methodology; pathology; validation study; Animals; Brain Ischemia; Emulsions; Fluorocarbons; Inflammation; Lymph Nodes; Macrophages; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mice; Monocytes; Myocardial Ischemia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47649095503

To fully evaluate the microbial origin of the gas and mechanisms of methane generation, additional data for 165 gas and water samples from 7 different coal-bed methane-bearing coal-bed reservoirs were collected basinwide and correlated to the coal geology and stratigraphy. The C1/(C2 + C3) ratio and vitrinite reflectance of coal and organic shale permitted differentiation between microbial gas and transitional thermogenic gas in the central part of the basin. Analyses of methane δ13C and δD, carbon dioxide δ13C, and water δD values indicate gas was generated primarily from microbial CO2 reduction, but with significant gas generated by microbial methyl-type fermentation (aceticlastic) in some areas of the basin. Microbial CO2 reduction occurs basinwide, but is generally dominant in Paleocene Fort Union Formation coals in the central part of the basin, whereas microbial methyl-type fermentation is common along the northwest and east margins. Isotopically light methane δ13C is distributed along the basin margins where δD is also depleted, indicating that both CO2-reduction and methyl-type fermentation pathways played major roles in gas generation, but gas from the latter pathway overprinted gas from the former pathway. More specifically, along the northwest basin margin gas generation by methyl-type fermentation may have been stimulated by late-stage infiltration of groundwater recharge from clinker areas, which flowed through highly fractured and faulted coal aquifers. Also, groundwater recharge controlled a change in gas composition in the shallow Eocene Wasatch Formation with the increase of nitrogen and decrease of methane composition of the coal-bed gas. Other geologic factors, such as burial, thermal and maturation history, lateral and vertical continuity, and coalification of the coal beds, also played a significant role in controlling methanogenic pathways and provided new perspectives on gas evolution and emplacement. The early-stage gas produced by CO2 reduction has mixed with transitional thermogenic gas in the deeper, central parts of the Powder River Basin to form 'old' gas, whereas along the basin margins the overprint of gas from methyl-type fermentation represents 'new' gas. Thus, a clear understanding of these geologic factors is necessary to relate the microbiological, biogeochemical, and hydrological processes involved in the generation of coal-bed gas.","CO2 reduction; Coal-bed gas; Methanogenesis; Methyl-type fermentation; Microbial gas","CO2 reduction; Coal-bed gas; Methanogenesis; Methyl-type fermentation; Microbial gas; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Earth sciences; Gases; Geology; Methanation; Methane; Powders; Stratigraphy; Watersheds; Coal gas; carbon dioxide; coal seam; coalbed methane; coalification; fermentation; methanogenesis; shale; Tertiary; thermal maturity; vitrinite reflectance; Montana; North America; Powder Basin; United States; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249097490

Portable samplers were positioned inside four regularly scheduled diesel-powered buses and four taxis during eight weekdays. Each sampler consisted of a 2.5 μm size pre-separator cyclone, a direct-reading data logging photometer (pDR-1200), and a 4 L min-1 filter sampler for the determination of PM2.5 mass concentration. Based on reflectance analysis measurements, a PM2.5 Black Smoke Index was determined for each filter, and the elemental composition of the PM2.5 was analyzed by Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE). PM2.5 mass concentrations inside the vehicles correlated well with the urban ambient air PM2.5 concentrations measured at the fixed-site monitoring stations. The PM2.5 excess above the urban ambient level was on average 32 μg m-3 (range: 22-52 μg m-3) and 20 μg m-3 (range: 11-29 μg m-3) in buses and taxis, respectively. The PM2.5-bound sulfur concentration was also higher in the buses than in the taxis. Based on daily Time-Microenvironment-Activity-Diary (TMAD) data, the Florentines spend on average 9.7% of their day in traffic, and the corresponding average exposure is approximately 12% of their daily PM2.5 personal exposure. The obtained data could be used to plan interventions to minimize the PM2.5 citizen exposures in commuting. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In general, it is desirable to maximize the use of low- or zero-carbon energy sources to reduce CO2 emission. However, such technologies are either more expensive (as with renewable energy) or more controversial (as in the case of nuclear energy or carbon capture and storage) than conventional fossil fuels. Thus, in many energy planning scenarios, there is some interest in identifying the minimum amount of low- or zero-carbon energy sources needed to meet the national or regional energy demand while maintaining the CO2 emission limits. Via the targeting step of pinch analysis, that quantity can be identified. Besides, another related problem involves the energy planning of biofuel systems in view of land availability constraints, which arises when agricultural resources need to be used for both food and energy production. Algebraic targeting approach of cascade analysis technique that was originally developed for resource conservation network is extended to determine targets or benchmarks for both of these problems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These models are typically based on observed correlations between current species distribution and climate data. One limitation of this basic approach is that the relationship modelled is assumed to be constant in space; the analysis is global with the relationship assumed to be spatially stationary. Here, it is shown that by using a local regression analysis, which allows the relationship under study to vary in space, rather than conventional global regression analysis it is possible to increase the accuracy of bioclimate envelope modelling. This is demonstrated for the distribution of Spotted Meddick in Great Britain using data relating to three time periods, including predictions for the 2080s based on two climate change scenarios. Species distribution and climate data were available for two of the time periods studied and this allowed comparison of bioclimate envelope model outputs derived using the local and global regression analyses. For both time periods, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve derived from the analysis based on local statistics was significantly higher than that from the conventional global analysis; the curve comparisons were also undertaken with an approach that recognised the dependent nature of the data sets compared. Marked differences in the future distribution of the species predicted from the local and global based analyses were evident and highlight a need for further consideration of local issues in modelling ecological variables. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A multilayer strategy to replace oil using nuclear energy and various carbon sources (fossil fuels, biomass, or air) is described that (a) allows the continued use of liquid fuels (ethanol, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) in the transport sector, (b) does not require major changes in lifestyle by the consumer, and (c) ultimately eliminates carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector. Nuclear energy is used to provide electricity, heat, and ultimately hydrogen, with the hydrogen produced by either electrolysis or more advanced thermochemical production methods. In the near term, nuclear energy can provide low-temperature heat (steam) for ethanol production and electricity for transportation. Midterm options include low-temperature heat and limited quantities of hydrogen for processing cellulosic biomass into liquid fuels (ethanol and lignin-derived hydrocarbons) and providing high-temperature heat for (a) traditional refining and (b) underground oil production and refining. In the longer term, biomass becomes the feedstock for liquid-fuels production, with nuclear energy providing heat and large quantities of hydrogen for complete biomass conversion to hydrocarbon fuels. Nuclear energy could be used to provide over half the total energy required by the transportation system, and the use of oil in the transport sector could potentially be eliminated within several decades.","Biofuels; Liquid fuels; Oil refining; Shale oil","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Crude oil; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Liquid fuels; Liquids; Nuclear energy; Petroleum refining; Petroleum transportation; Refining; Shale oil; Temperature; Transportation; Well stimulation; Biomass conversion; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cellulosic biomass; Ethanol production; Oil refining; Thermochemical production; Transport sectors; Transportation system; Low temperature production; Automotive Engines; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Crude Oil; Emission; Ethanol; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Hydrocarbons; Leakage; Nuclear Power; Refining; Renewable Resources; Stimulation; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149112290

In-use activity, fuel use, and emissions were measured for six selected motor graders using a portable emission measurement system. Each motor grader was tested with petroleum diesel and B20 biodiesel. Duty cycles were quantified in terms of the empirical cumulative distribution function of manifold absolute pressure (MAP), which is an indicator of engine load. The motor graders were operated under normal duty cycles for road maintenance and repair at various locations in Wake and Nash Counties in North Carolina. Approximately 3 hr of quality-assured, second-by-second data were obtained during each test. An empirical modal-based model of vehicle fuel use and emissions was developed, based on stratifying the data with respect to ranges of normalized MAP, to enable comparisons between duty cycles, motor graders, and fuels. Time-based emission factors were found to increase monotonically with MAP. Fuel-based emission factors were mainly sensitive to differences between idle and non-idle engine operation. Cycle average emission factors were estimated for road ""resurfacing,"" ""roading,"" and ""shouldering"" activities. On average, the use of B20 instead of petroleum diesel leads to a negligible decrease of 1.6% in nitric oxide emission rate, and decreases of 19-22% in emission rates of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. Emission rates decrease significantly when comparing newer engine tier vehicles to older ones. Significant reductions in tailpipe emissions accrue especially from the use of B20 and adoption of newer vehicles.

As a complement to these approaches, carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of tooth enamel can provide insight into habitat and dietary preferences of herbivorous dinosaurs. This approach is based on the isotopic variability in plant material and in surface waters of the past, which is in turn reflected by carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of animals that ingested the organic matter or drank the water. Thus, it has the potential to identify and characterize dietary and habitat preferences for coexisting taxa. In this study, stable isotope ratios from coexisting hadrosaurian and ceratopsian dinosaurs of the Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota are compared for four different stratigraphic levels. Isotopic offsets between tooth enamel and tooth dentine, as well as taxonomic differences in means and in patterns of isotopic data among taxa, indicate that primary paleoecological information is preserved. The existence of taxonomic offsets also provides the first direct evidence for dietary niche partitioning among these herbivorous dinosaur taxa. Of particular interest is the observation that the nature of this partitioning changes over time: for some localities ceratopsian dinosaurs have higher carbon and oxygen isotope ratios than hadrosaurs, indicating a preference for plants living in open settings near the coast, whereas for other localities isotope ratios are lower, indicating a preference for plants in the understory of forests. In most cases the isotope ratios among hadrosaurs are similar and are interpreted to represent a dietary preference for plants of the forest canopy. The inferred differences in ceratopsian behavior are suggested to represent a change in vegetation cover and hence habitat availability in response to sea level change or to the position of river distributaries. Given our current lack of taxonomic resolution, it is not possible to determine if dietary and habitat preferences inferred from stable isotope data are associated with single, or multiple, species of hadrosaurian/ceratopsian dinosaurs. © 2008 The Paleontological Society.

Palaeoecological research techniques provide the tools to address some of the key questions presently being asked by conservation ecologists and land management organizations. But is this type of analysis currently being utilized to its full potential? Are the results of palaeoenvironmental analyses routinely applied to practical issues of natural resource management, and if not what can be done to expand the application of this research within the conservation community? This paper reviews recent developments in the application of the analysis of late Quaternary environmental change to key environmental issues of biodiversity and conservation management and examines areas which could be strengthened in the future including: (i) determination of baselines and natural ecosystem variability; (ii) understanding ecological thresholds and resilience; (iii) climate change conservation strategies; (iv) biological invasions; and (v) conservation and culture. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Tai (1534 m above sea level) on a daytime and nighttime basis during a summertime campaign (May-June 2006) and were characterized for organic molecular compositions using solvent extraction/derivatization and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique. The n-Alkanes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, sugars, glycerol and polyacids, and phthalate esters were found as major organic compound classes, whereas lignin and resin products, sterols, aromatic acids, hopanes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected as minor classes. Sugars (49.8-2115 ng m-3, average 640 ng m-3 in daytime; 18.1-4348 ng m-3, 799 ng m-3 in nighttime) were found to be the dominant compound class. Levoglucosan, a specific cellulose pyrolysis product, was detected as the most abundant single compound, followed by C28 fatty alcohol, diisobutyl and di-n-butyl phthalates, C 29 n-alkane, C16 and C28 fatty acids, and malic acid. By grouping organic compounds based on their sources, we found that emission of terrestrial plant waxes was the most significant source (30-34%) of the TSP, followed by biomass burning products (25-27%) (e.g., levoglucosan and lignin and resin products), soil resuspension (15-18%) due to agricultural activities, secondary oxidation products (8-10%), plastic emission (3-10%), marine/microbial sources (6%), and urban/industrial emissions from fossil fuel use (4%). However, low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids (such as oxalic acid) of photochemical origin were not included in this study. Malic acid was found to be much higher than those reported in the ground level, suggesting an enhanced photochemical production in the free troposphere over mountain areas. Temporal variations of biomass burning tracers (e.g., levoglucosan, galactosan, mannosan) and some higher plant wax derived compound classes suggested that there were two major (E1 and E2) and one minor (E3) biomass-burning events during this campaign. Most of the compound classes showed higher concentrations in nighttime samples when organic aerosols can be long-range transported from different source regions to the summit of Mt. Tai above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). This study also demonstrates that the free troposphere over Mt. Tai is heavily influenced by field burning of agricultural wastes such as wheat straws in the North China Plain during the harvest season in early summer.

Solvation shell distribution functions and solvent density maps around the solute were computed at different supercritical temperatures in the range 308-328 K and densities varying from 0.117 to 0.94 g/cm3. At the lowest density, we detect a strongly inhomogeneous local density augmentation effect manifested as the clustering of solvent molecules above and below the solute molecular plane and around its carbonyl and N-H groups. The free-energy benefit for a CO 2 molecule to be in the first solvation shell relative to the bulk is roughly twice the thermal energy at such conditions. The distribution of the relative orientation of CO2 with respect to the solute suggests that local bond multipolar solute-solvent interactions are responsible for the solvent density enhancement in these systems. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","5-fluorouracil; Local density augmentation; Molecular dynamics simulations; Supercritical CO2","Carbon dioxide; Solvation; 5-fluorouracil; Local density augmentation; Molecular dynamics simulations; Solvation properties; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Supercritical CO; Supercritical CO2; Supercritical fluid extraction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52449130356

The study allows to identify two regions in the study domain, that require the implementation of different pollution abatement policies: (1) the central urbanized area, that is sensitive to the local anthropogenic emission reduction measures, and (2) the northern mountain region, where the implementation of international policies is required because of the limited effectiveness of local reduction strategies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The utilization of grid electricity and operating effciency signifcantly reduce petroleum consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and criteria pollutants, especially benefting urban areas. Southern California Edison (SCE) collaborated with EPRI and DaimlerChrysler to evaluate the vehicle and two different battery technologies. This paper documents one of the first published battery test results related to PHEV applications from the beginning of the project, in September 2004. The partners selected two advanced battery technologies, lithium ion (Li-Ion) chemistry from SAFT and nickel metal hydride (NiMH) chemistry from VARTA. The primary goals of the test are to evaluate the performance and cycle life of traction batteries for future PHEV Sprinter Van production using PHEV test profles. The test profle replicates the most demanding urban driving conditions for the battery (i.e., low speed, high acceleration in charge-sustained HEV mode at low battery state of charge). It also uses a combination of HEV and EV driving modes to represent over 50% of statistical daily trips. One cycle includes three modes: (1) charge depletion mode, simulating the EV operation, (2) charge sustained mode, simulating the HEV operation, and (3) recharge mode, simulating the plug-in operation.

An up-scaling approach of the output of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model with the information system SLISYS-BW has been used to estimate the CO2-mitigation potential in the state of Baden-Württemberg (SW-Germany). The state territory of 35,742 km2 is subdivided into eight agro-ecological zones (AEZ), which have been further subdivided into a total of 3976 spatial response units. Annual CO2-mitigation rates where estimated from the changes in soil organic carbon content comparing 30 years simulations under conventional and zero tillage. Special attention was given to the influence of tillage practices on the losses of organic carbon through soil erosion, and consequently on the calculation of CO2-mitigation rates. Under conventional tillage, mean carbon losses through erosion in the AEZ were estimated to be up to 0.45 Mg C ha-1 a-1. The apparent CO2-mitigation rate for the conversion from conventional to zero tillage ranges from 0.08 to 1.82 Mg C ha-1 a-1 in the eight AEZ, if the carbon losses through soil erosion are included in the calculations. However, the higher carbon losses under conventional tillage compared to zero tillage are composed of both, losses through enhanced CO2 emissions, and losses through intensified soil erosion. The adjusted net CO2-mitigation rates of zero tillage, subtracting the reduced carbon losses through soil erosion, are between 0.07 and 1.27 Mg C ha-1 a-1 and the estimated net mitigation rate for the entire state amounts to 285 Gg C a-1. This equals to 1045 Gg CO2-equivalents per year with the cropping patterns in the reference year 2000. The results call attention to the necessity to revise those estimation methods for CO2-mitigation which are exclusively or predominantly based on the measurements of differential changes in total soil organic carbon without taking into account the tillage effects on carbon losses through soil erosion. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Thanks to minor inputs of marine organic matter and almost complete preservation of riverine organic carbon, organic matter buried in Bengal Fan sediments is a proxy of Himalayan basin paleo-vegetation. The active channel-levee system of the middle fan documents the last 19 ka and allows the reconstruction of vegetation change in the Himalayan basin since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We measured δ13C of organic carbon (Corg) in order to track changes in the proportions of C3 and C4 plants in the Himalayan basin. From LGM to mid-Holocene, δ13C of bulk Corg shifts of 3-4‰ towards more negative values. Relative abundance of individual n-alkanes reveals that terrestrial higher plant inputs represent a dominant fraction of Corg buried in Bengal Fan sediments. δ13C of higher plants biomarkers mimic that of bulk Corg showing that the later can be used as continental paleo-vegetation proxy. δ13C negative shift from LGM to mid-Holocene, mostly indicates the transition from a dominant input of C4 plants to a dominant input of C3 plants and therefore reveals that C4 plants were more abundant in the basin under glacial conditions. Vegetation repartition in the basin simulated using the CARAIB dynamic vegetation model is consistent with Corg data. The model indicates a dominance of C4 plants in the Gangetic plain during the LGM while eastern part of the basin remains dominated by C3 plants. The comparison between our data and proxies of regional paleo-climate suggests that the large decline of C4 plants after the LGM was due to combined increase of atmospheric CO2 and humidity levels. Integrated record of Himalayan basin paleo-vegetation suggests more arid conditions during the LGM than during the mid-Holocene and agrees with reconstructions of the monsoon indicating stronger SW monsoon during interglacial and stronger NE monsoon during glacial periods. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study first quantifies the likely penetration percentage of hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) in the NYC Taxi industry, and then analyzes the environmental impact of a conversion of this percentage of fleet toward HEVs. This is done by conducting a survey of both individual owner-operators and fleet managers. A logistic regression model was estimated from the data that can be used to better understand the likelihood of a NYC taxi owner's preference of buying an HEV. Distribution functions of time-to-buy based on Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimation and Weibull distribution demonstrate the future progression of taxicab turnover, and no significant difference was observed between non-HEV and HEV buyers. Results indicate that without government intervention the 5-year future NYC taxi fleet will be comprised of 9.35% HEVs, which will lead to a 2.29% decrease in carbon dioxide emission over the current fleet. Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxide emissions will decrease by 1.45%, 1.12%, and 1.70%, respectively. However, a 0.03% increase in particulate matter is possible due to the higher proportion of sport-utility hybrid taxis.

The temperature is retrieved from SABER measurements of the atmospheric 15 μ CO2 limb emission. This emission separates from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions in the rarefied mesosphere and thermosphere, making it necessary to consider the CO2 vibrational state non-LTE populations in the retrieval algorithm above 70 km. Those populations depend on kinetic parameters describing the rate at which energy exchange between atmospheric molecules take place, but some of these collisional rates are not well known. We consider current uncertainties in the rates of quenching of CO2(v2) by N2, O2 and O, and the CO2(v2) vibrational-vibrational exchange to estimate their impact on SABER Tk for different atmospheric conditions. The Tk is more sensitive to the uncertainty in the latter two, and their effects depend on altitude. The Tk combined systematic error due to non-LTE kinetic parameters does not exceed ±1.5 K below 95 km and ±4-5 K at 100 km for most latitudes and seasons (except for polar summer) if the Tk profile does not have pronounced vertical structure. The error is ±3 K at 80 km, ±6 K at 84 km and ±18 K at 100 km under the less favorable polar summer conditions. For strong temperature inversion layers, the errors reach ±3 K at 82 km and ±8 K at 90 km. This particularly affects tide amplitude estimates, with errors of up to ±3 K.

The aim of this study is to assess the factors that regulate C mineralization in mountain grassland soils under standard laboratory conditions to compare regulation mechanisms at surface and subsurface horizons. For this purpose soil samples of surface and subsurface horizons from 35 locations were incubated under laboratory conditions, CO2 efflux rates were measured and microbial biomass C (MBC) and net N mineralization were determined. We also analysed the samples for pH, extractable C after fumigation (Cfe), potentially mineralizable N (PMN), reactive and non-reactive P, sum of exchangeable bases and clay content in order to assess the influence of soil characteristics on C mineralization. The influence of climate of each site on soil C mineralization under the same laboratory conditions was also explored for surface and subsurface horizons. C mineralization in surface horizons related positively with Cfe content, suggesting that microbial activity in this horizon was mainly regulated by the availability of C. By contrast, in subsurface horizons, C mineralization related with PMN and was independent of measured C fractions, suggesting that microbial activity in subsurface horizons was limited by the availability of N and that the available forms of C were more stable in these horizons. The effects of local climate on laboratory C mineralization were significant in both soil horizons, with lower rates of C mineralization being recorded in soils from wetter and warmer sites. This fact, suggested that the C stabilisation mechanisms in mountain grassland soils may be affected by the climate in which soils develop. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus particularly on the hybrid mechanistic/empirical models GALES and HWIND, which have been designed for calculating wind damage risk at the stand level within uniform forests and which are the most widely adopted models within the research community. These models have been integrated with different methods for predicting the local wind climate in order to calculate the probability of wind damage in a number of different countries. We also discuss ongoing modelling work and proposals for future development in order to deal with complex forest structures and to predict the wind damage risk of individual trees within stands through the integration of mechanistic risk models with forest growth and yield models within a geographical information system framework. This kind of model integration will enable spatial representation of tree lists and damage propagation and allow managers to evaluate the effect of different harvesting and thinning scenarios on the risk of windthrow of both stands and individual trees within a stand. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2008.

Methods:: Fifty patients who underwent lung perfusion imaging before RT for lung cancer were included. Planar and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography images of the lungs were obtained. Lung perfusion score (LPS) was developed to visually grade localized perfusion defect per lung on a scale of 0 to 4 and perfusion pattern in the remaining lungs on a scale of 1 to 4. The LPS is the sum of the score for the localized perfusion defect in each lung plus the score for the remaining lungs perfusion. LPSs were correlated with pulmonary function tests and the patients were followed for 8 months after therapy to determine the incidence of grade 2 to 5 symptomatic therapy related pulmonary complications according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE 3.0). Results:: Thirty-four patients underwent CRT and 16 underwent RT. The mean total radiation dose delivered was 56.1 ± 10.4 Gy. Eighteen patients (36%) suffered from pulmonary complications at a mean interval of 3.4 months after therapy. Nine patients had grade 2, 7 had grade 3, 1 had grade 4, and 1 had grade 5 pulmonary complications. The mean LPS was 4.9 in patients who developed pulmonary complications versus 3.5 in patients who did not (p = 0.01). There were no significant difference between pulmonary function tests in the patients with pulmonary complications and the patient without. In addition, there were no significant differences between the mean lung radiation dose, the volume of lung irradiated or the percentage of lung receiving greater than 20 Gy between the two groups. Conclusions:: LPS using lung perfusion imaging is useful for predicting possible pulmonary complications after CRT or RT in lung cancer patients.

Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), a shrub frequently used for fuel across much of the western United States, seems a potentially better candidate for 14C dating than tree wood since the possibility for significant age discrepancy might be less. A comparison of multiple assays from single features reveals that sagebrush can overestimate age more than even tree wood charcoal. A plausible cause of this appears to be persistence of the shrub on the ground surface for an extended interval after death, such that use as fuel almost invariably occurs hundreds of years after fixation of carbon. The potential for age discrepancy may decrease as population density increases because the demand for fuel wood would have resulted in a more rapid turnover of the fuel biomass. This is not true for Archaic period foragers of western North America when population levels were likely quite low and residential mobility quite high. © 2008 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.",,"age determination; archaeology; carbon fixation; carbon isotope; charcoal; dicotyledon; fuelwood; mobility; persistence; phytomass; population density; population size; radiocarbon dating; residential mobility; shrub; United States; Artemisia tridentata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953952432

We consider the case where a quasar is observed in an intergalactic medium (IGM) whose ionization structure evolves slowly relative to the light crossing time of the H II region, as well as the case where the evolution is rapid. The latter case is expected towards the end of the reionization era where the highest redshift luminous quasars will be observed. In the absence of foregrounds, the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM could be measured directly from the contrast between the H II region and surrounding IGM. However, we find that foreground removal lowers the observed contrast between the H II region and the IGM. This indicates that measurement of the neutral fraction would require modelling to correct for this systematic effect. On the other hand, foreground removal does not modify the most prominent features of the 21-cm maps. Using a simple algorithm, we demonstrate that measurements of the size and shape of observed H II regions will not be affected by continuum foreground removal. Moreover, measurements of these quantities will not be adversely affected by the presence of a rapidly evolving IGM. © 2008 The Authors.","Cosmology: theory; Diffuse radiation; Galaxies: high redshift; Intergalactic medium",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54849432395

This study was performed in order to assess the role of otoacoustic emissions in a screening programme for middle-ear disorders and hearing loss in school-age children. Methods: Cross-sectional, preliminary screening study. Setting: Primary schools of Argolida municipality, south-east Greece, between December 2004 and March 2005. Patient selection and recruitment: All the primary school students of Argolida were invited, by press releases and individually by their teachers, to attend a session of otological and audiological screening. Results: One hundred and ninety-six children were evaluated using transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. Twenty per cent failed in both ears, while in 32 per cent otoacoustic emissions could not be produced in at least one ear. Younger children had higher rates of absent transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. The absence of otoacoustic emissions was highly correlated with tympanic membrane changes seen on otoscopy and the presence of a type B tympanogram. As a single screening modality, otoacoustic emissions had a 100 per cent sensitivity in diagnosing hearing loss worse than 30 dB, and a 90 per cent sensitivity and 64 per cent specificity in diagnosing hearing loss worse than 25 dB, which did not improve by adding tympanometry to the screening protocol. Conclusion: These results strongly suggest the potential usefulness of otoacoustic emission testing in screening school-age children for hearing loss. Further studies, taking into account cost-effectiveness issues, are indicated.

To illustrate the first point, we review recent theoretical advances in studying the wind-driven circulation of the oceans. In doing so, we concentrate on the large-scale, wind-driven flow of the mid-latitude oceans, which is dominated by the presence of a larger, anticyclonic and a smaller, cyclonic gyre. The two gyres share the eastward extension of western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or Kuroshio, and are induced by the shear in the winds that cross the respective ocean basins. The boundary currents and eastward jets carry substantial amounts of heat and momentum, and thus contribute in a crucial way to Earth's climate, and to changes therein. Changes in this double-gyre circulation occur from year to year and decade to decade. We study this low-frequency variability of the wind-driven, double-gyre circulation in mid-latitude ocean basins, via the bifurcation sequence that leads from steady states through periodic solutions and on to the chaotic, irregular flows documented in the observations. This sequence involves local, pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations, as well as global, homoclinic ones. The natural climate variability induced by the low-frequency variability of the ocean circulation is but one of the causes of uncertainties in climate projections. The range of these uncertainties has barely decreased, or even increased, over the last three decades. Another major cause of such uncertainties could reside in the structural instability-in the classical, topological sense-of the equations governing climate dynamics, including but not restricted to those of atmospheric and ocean dynamics. We propose a novel approach to understand, and possibly reduce, these uncertainties, based on the concepts and methods of random dynamical systems theory. The idea is to compare the climate simulations of distinct general circulation models (GCMs) used in climate projections, by applying stochastic-conjugacy methods and thus perform a stochastic classification of GCM families. This approach is particularly appropriate given recent interest in stochastic parametrization of subgrid-scale processes in GCMs. As a very first step in this direction, we study the behavior of the Arnol'd family of circle maps in the presence of noise. The maps' fine-grained resonant landscape is smoothed by the noise, thus permitting their coarse-grained classification. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the near future, there will certainly be changes in the Brazilian phytosanitary scenario attributed to global climate change. The impacts of climate change can be positive, negative or neutral, since these changes can decrease, increase or have no impact on diseases, depending on each region or period. These impacts will also be observed on plants and other organisms as well as on other agroecosystem components. However, these impacts are not easily determined, and consequently, specialists from several areas must go beyond their disciplinary boundaries and placing the climate change impacts in a broader context. This review focuses on the discussion of different aspects related to the effects of climate change on plant diseases. On the geographical and temporal distribution of diseases, a historical context is presented and recent studies using data of forecast models of future climate associated with disease simulation models are discussed in order to predict the distribution in future climate scenarios. Predicted future disease scenarios for some crops in Brazil are shown. On the effects of increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and other gases, important aspects are discussed of how diseases change under altered atmospheric gases conditions in the future. The consequences of these changes on the chemical and biological control of plant diseases are also discussed.","CO2; Control; Global climate change; Global warming; Spatial analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62149122922

When combined with GPS (global positioning system) functionality enabling geo-referenced information to be gathered and analysed in real-time, new opportunities emerge for the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN) for decision making in precision agriculture (PA). The use of WSN technologies in precision viticulture (PV) to date is mostly confined to on-farm and narrow regions within a city or in the case of a larger region the data collection is limited to monitoring weather conditions alone. This paper reviews three application scenarios: a) within a vineyard b) regionally within the state of Washington in the USA and c) cities within the Asia Pacific Region. It then details the development of a system proposed for comparative analysis of viticulture management information from two countries, namely Chile and New Zealand that have the same latitude but are at different longitude points. The paper looks at a variety of remotely located real-time sensors (telemetry devices), associated hardware devices (server, workstation, architectures and topologies) and software suitable for data collection, logging, distribution and streaming. Data gathered by the sensors is relayed via a series of repeaters to a workstation, which logs the data and is connected directly to the Internet for transmission to a server acting as the final collection and data analysis point for a comparative information matching synthesis. The data collected is to be used for building models that could enhance our understanding about the effects of climate change on grapevine growth and wine quality within major wine regions in the two countries being studied in this initial research. Finally, the paper desc ribes variable parameters considered for analysis in this research so far in relation to plant growth, weather, climate, atmospheric influences such as climate change, pollution and also wine quality determinants such as soil, terrain and grape variety.","GPS and precision viticulture; Plant growth factors; Telemetry devices; Weather data","Application scenario; AS-soils; Asia Pacific region; Atmospheric conditions; Building model; Comparative analysis; Data analysis; Data collection; Grape variety; Hardware devices; Management information; New opportunities; New zealand; Plant growth; Precision Agriculture; Real time sensors; Sensor data; Sensor technologies; Variable parameters; Washington; Weather conditions; Weather data; Wine quality; Wireless radio-frequency; Bioactivity; Climate models; Data acquisition; Global positioning system; Meteorology; Peptides; Plant life extension; Sensors; Telemetering equipment; Wine; Wireless sensor networks; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74249119037

Examples include an altered energy exchange and hydrology which contribute to the urban heat island and an enhanced surface runoff; due, in part, to an altered surface cover, with more built and fewer vegetated surfaces. Landscape planning needs to protect urban ecosystem services and to enable this, an urban characterisation which is meaningful for these properties is useful. This paper presents such a characterisation for Greater Manchester which uses urban morphology type mapping and surface cover analysis. The results show that residential areas cover almost half of the 'urbanised' area of Greater Manchester, with medium density residential accounting for 37%. It is within this category, which represents the urban matrix, that 32% of all the evapotranspiring (i.e. vegetated and water) surfaces are found. This will include private gardens and street trees which are often not represented by traditional mapping approaches.

Previous studies have not fully addressed many of the dynamic interactions and effects of a policy-induced expansion of bioenergy crop production, particularly on crop yields and human food demand. This study combines an updated agriculture and land use (AgLU) model with a well-developed energy-economic model to provide an analysis of the effects of bioenergy crops on energy, agricultural and land use systems. The results indicate that carbon dioxide mitigation policies can stimulate a large production of bioenergy crops, dependent on the level of the policy. This production of bioenergy crops can lead to several impacts on the agriculture and land use system: decreases in forestland and unmanaged land, decreases in the average yield of food crops, increases in the prices of food crops, and decreases in the level of human demand of calories. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bioenergy; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Global energy scenarios; Integrated assessment","agricultural land; agricultural modeling; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; climate change; crop production; crop yield; food; integrated approach; land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749113420

We review the state of knowledge of mangrove vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact on mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainty over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors on mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) chemical-transport model, equipped with the process analysis technique, was applied in modeling scenarios involving 2002 base case emissions and an emissions scenario containing real-world point source NOx reductions implemented before the summer ozone season of 2004. Spatial patterns and temporal variations in process rates and changes in chemical-transport indicators are highlighted from results of summer 2002 days, representative of generally southwesterly wind flows across the Midwestern source region with ozone transport toward the northeastern states. Substantial decreases exceeding 50% in O3 chemical production rates were associated with the largest NOx point source emission reductions, causing declines in ozone concentrations at the surface and aloft in downwind areas. The decreases in the various physical processes and their spatial difference patterns closely resembled the change in maximum O3 concentrations. The net ozone production efficiency was found to increase, since the decline in O3 concentrations was less than the decrease in reactive nitrogen products (NO Z). The O3/NOx ratio also increased between the base case and NOx reduction scenario results, indicating a noticeable shift in the chemical regime toward more NOx-limited conditions in plume-impacted areas downwind of the sources. The drop in surface NOx concentrations in modeled and observed results at a location just downwind of the Ohio River Valley source region is attributable to the point source NOx emission reductions.

Methods and Results: Saponins were extracted from Carduus, Sesbania and Knautia leaves and fenugreek seeds. Two levels of saponin-rich fractions with a substrate were incubated using the Hohenheim gas method. Methane was measured using an infrared-based methane analyser and microbial communities using quantitative PCR. On addition of saponin-rich fractions, methane and short-chain fatty acid production was not affected. The protozoal counts decreased by 10-39%. Sesbania saponins decreased methanogen population by 78%. Decrease in ruminal fungal population (20-60%) and increase in Fibrobacter succinogenes (21-45%) and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (23-40%) were observed. Conclusions: The saponins evaluated possessed anti-protozoal activity; however, this activity did not lead to methane reduction. Fenugreek saponins seemed to have potential for increasing rumen efficiency. The saponins altered the microbial community towards proliferation of fibre-degrading bacteria and inhibition of fungal population. Significance and Impact of the Study: The uni-directional relationship between protozoal numbers and methanogenesis, as affected by saponins, is not obligatory. All saponins might not hold promise for decreasing methane production from ruminants. © 2008 The Authors.","Methane; Microbial communities; Protozoa; Rumen fermentation; Saponins","methane; saponin; short chain fatty acid; antimicrobial activity; community structure; fermentation; methanogenesis; microbial community; plant extract; polymerase chain reaction; protozoan; sesbania; analyzer; antiprotozoal activity; article; Carduus; Dipsacaceae; fenugreek; fermentation; Fibrobacter succinogenes; Knautia; methanogen; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; plant leaf; polymerase chain reaction; protozoon; quantitative analysis; ruminant stomach; Ruminococcus flavefaciens; Sesbania; Animal Feed; Animals; Carduus; Cattle; Dipsacaceae; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Fermentation; Methane; Plant Extracts; Protozoa; Rumen; Saponins; Sesbania; Trigonella; Carduus; Fibrobacter succinogenes; Knautia; Protozoa; Ruminococcus flavefaciens; Sesbania; Trigonella foenum-graecum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49849094031

In anoxic environments, available acetate is a competitive substrate for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and methane-producing archaea. Little is known about the fractionation of carbon isotopes by sulfate reducers. Therefore, we determined carbon isotope compositions in cultures of three acetate-utilizing SRB, Desulfobacter postgatei, Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, and Desulfobacca acetoxidans. We found that these species showed strong differences in their isotope enrichment factors (ε) of acetate. During the consumption of acetate and sulfate, acetate was enriched in 13C by 19.3‰ in Desulfobacca acetoxidans. By contrast, both D. postgatei and D. hydrogenophilus showed a slight depletion of 13C resulting in εac- values of 1.8 and 1.5‰, respectively. We suggest that the different isotope fractionation is due to the different metabolic pathways for acetate oxidation. The strongly fractionating Desulfobacca acetoxidans uses the acetyl-CoA/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase pathway, which is also used by acetoclastic methanogens that show a similar fractionation of acetate (εac = -21 to -27‰). In contrast, Desulfobacter spp. oxidize acetate to CO2 via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and apparently did not discriminate against 13C. Our results suggest that carbon isotope fractionation in environments with sulfate reduction will strongly depend on the composition of the sulfate-reducing bacterial community oxidizing acetate. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteriology; Carbon; Chemical analysis; Chemical oxygen demand; Methane; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Strain relaxation; Acetate oxidations; Acetoclastic methanogens; Anaerobic degradations; Anoxic environments; Archaea; Bacterial communities; Carbon isotope compositions; Carbon isotope fractionations; Carbon isotopes; Isotope enrichments; Isotope fractionations; Key intermediates; Metabolic pathways; Organic matters; Sulfate reducers; Sulfate reductions; Tricarboxylic acids; Isotopes; acetic acid; carbon 13; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; sulfate; acetate; anoxic conditions; bacterium; bioremediation; carbon isotope; isotopic fractionation; methane; oxidation; sulfate; article; chemical analysis; Desulfobacca acetoxidans; Desulfobacter; Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus; Desulfobacter postgatei; isotope analysis; nonhuman; oxidation; sulfate reducing bacterium; Acetates; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Isotopes; Chemical Fractionation; Citric Acid Cycle; Multienzyme Complexes; Oxidation-Reduction; Sulfur-Reducing Bacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Desulfobacca acetoxidans; Desulfobacter; Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus; Desulfobacter postgatei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349147985

Each receiver records both orthogonal horizontal magnetic components of the chorus waves. All sites use GPS-synchronized sampling, allowing for the localization of ionospheric exit points utilizing both arrival azimuth and time of arrival lag between sites. Results show two distinct groups of cases, emissions with singular ionospheric exit points and those with multiple exit points. Singular exit point cases exhibit migration and mode conversion as a function of propagation distance from the source point. The multiple exit point case shows chorus waves impinging on the ionosphere over a spread in magnetic latitude, suggesting nonducted propagation. Ray tracing for this case is unable to reproduce the observations unless a cold plasma density different than that predicted by geomagnetic conditions is used. It is proposed that chorus elements cross the transionospheric boundary after experiencing scattering from meter-scale irregularities. Additionally, subionospheric VLF remote sensing is used to detect precipitation onto the ionosphere of energetic radiation belt electrons that have been pitch angle scattered by individual chorus emission packets. VLF perturbation signatures are consistent with precipitation fluxes being dominated by electrons with energies less than 1 MeV.

The records from these cores include a suite of elements, organic carbon content, fossil seeds, pollen, and stable carbon isotopes. The stratigraphy indicates fresher water conditions than present between 3400 and 2000 cal YBP. A tidal marsh became established at China Camp after about 2000 cal YBP; between 2000 cal YBP and approximately 700 cal YBP, conditions in the estuary were apparently more saline and variable. This interval was terminated by at least three or possibly five flood events, as evidenced by coarse clastic materials most likely washed down from the surrounding uplands. These floods represent high rainfall events, possibly El Niño years, and occurred during the late Medieval Climatic Anomaly. Greater plant diversity and pollen from some species with low salt tolerance are found in a core collected near the upland edge of the marsh and date to about 200 years ago, suggesting fresher conditions than today. Over the past 50 years, the diversity of marsh vegetation has decreased, and salt tolerant plants (especially Salicornia virginica) have become the dominant species. These changes are likely a result of the impacts of water diversions and upstream dams in the San Francisco Bay watershed.","Holocene climate; Iron; Lead; Marsh development; Pollen; Sea level rise; Stable isotopes","core analysis; dominance; environmental history; evolution; flood; Holocene; Medieval Warm Period; palynology; salinity tolerance; saltmarsh; sea level change; species diversity; stratigraphy; California; North America; San Francisco Bay; San Pablo Bay; United States; Salicornia virginica",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549104419

Multiple strains of this pathogen have been introduced into southern Australia for the biological control of at least 15 taxa of European blackberry, a nonindigenous, invasive plant. In climates conducive to leaf rust, the intensity of disease varies within and among infestations of the genetically variable host. Genetic markers developed from the selective amplification of microsatellite polymorphic loci were used to assess the population genetic structure and reproductive biology of P. violaceum within and among four geographically isolated and diseased infestations of the European blackberry in Victoria, Australia. Despite the potential for long-distance aerial dispersal of urediniospores, there was significant genetic differentiation among all populations, which was not associated with geographic separation. An assessment of multilocus linkage disequilibrium revealed temporal and geographic variation in the occurrence of random mating among the four populations. The presence of sexual spore states and the results of genetic analyses indicated that recombination, and potentially random migration and genetic drift, played an important role in maintaining genotypic variation within populations. Recombination and genetic differentiation in P. violaceum, as well as the potential for metapopulation structure, suggest the need to release additional, genetically diverse strains of the biocontrol agent at numerous sites across the distribution of the Australian blackberry infestation for maximum establishment and persistence.

Nowadays the emissions inventories are one of the causes of uncertainties in air quality modeling. This work explores the improvements in urban air quality assessment by using the WRF-ARW/HERMES/CMAQ modeling system when switching from constant on-road traffic speed to hourly variable speeds taken from measurement campaigns in the emissions model. Furthermore, the effects of limiting the speed circulation in the Barcelona Metropolitan area to 80 km h-1 are assessed. A photochemical pollution episode representative of summertime conditions (corresponding to the year 2004) in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula and fitting in a usual traffic circulation pattern (working day) is selected to carry out the study. The introduction of variable speed in the HERMES emissions model affect the model evaluation in the urban area, improving specifically the O3 precursors estimates, and consequently O3 predictions in the area (reductions in mean normalized gross error (MNGE) around 1%). The speed limitation effects assessed with the modified modeling system represent improvements in air quality levels; specifically it reduces local NO2, SO2 and PM10 levels, up to 5.7%, 5.3% and 3.0% over the area affected by the speed limit, respectively. The O3 concentrations slightly increase in the urban area (up to 2.4%), due to the chemical regime (NOx emissions reduction in a VOCs limited area), but the effects in the urban plume are negligible.

Atmospheric CO2 approaches a new equilibrium state, reached after ocean invasion ceases after typically 1000 years, given by PCO2 - P0exp(δIχ/IB), where P0 and pco2 are the initial and final partial pressures of atmospheric CO2, δIχ is a CO2 perturbation, and IB is the buffered carbon inventory of the air-sea system. The perturbation, δIχ, includes carbon emissions and changes in the terrestrial reservoir, as well as ocean changes in the surface carbon disequilibrium and fallout of organic soft tissue material. Changes in marine calcium carbonate, δICaco3, lead to a more complex relationship with atmospheric CO2, where PCO2 is changed by the ratio PCO2 = P0{IO(A - C)/{IO(A - C) - δICaCO3)} and then modified by a similar exponential relationship, where IO(A - C) is the difference between the inventories of titration alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon. The overall atmospheric PCO2 response to a range of perturbations is sensitive to their nonlinear interactions, depending on the product of the separate amplification factors for each perturbation.

Such impact is particularly salient for long-haul destinations. Recently tourism organisations such as the unwto have also expressed concern that aviation sector-focused mitigation policies in wealthy nations that are the major international tourism outbound markets will negatively affect tourism development and wealth transfers to tourism-dependent developing nations. This article reviews emerging climate policies in major tourism outbound markets that have direct implications for the aviation sector and examines the potential consequences for travel costs and tourism demand in 10 tourism-dependent less developed island states with diverse geographic and tourism market characteristics. The analysis confirms that aviation mitigation policies would affect tourism demand to these nations.

Over the past 2 decades, more than 50 publications have investigated long-term effects of ambient air pollution on lung function with most finding adverse effects. Several studies have also suggested effects from traffic-related air pollution. There is strong support for air pollution effects on the development of lung function in children and adolescents. It remains unclear whether subjects with slower development of lung function compensate by prolonging the growth phase, or whether they end their development at a lower plateau, thus entering the decline phase with a reduced lung function. In adults, the evidence for long-term air pollution effects is mostly based on cross-sectional comparisons. One recent longitudinal study observed that decreasing pollution attenuated the decline of lung function in adults. Earlier inconclusive cohort studies were based on limited data. There is great diversity in study designs, markers of air pollution, approaches to the measurement of exposure, and choices in lung function measures. These limit the comparability of studies and impede quantitative summaries. New studies should use individual-level exposure assessment to clarify the role of traffic and to preclude potential community-level confounding. Further research is needed on the relevance of specific pollution sources, particularly with regard to susceptible populations and relevant exposure periods throughout life.

Using a combination of ecological and meteorological methods, we quantified the response of annual C storage to historically widespread disturbances, forest succession, and climate variation in a common forest type of the upper Great Lakes region. At our study site in Michigan, repeated clear-cut harvesting and fire disturbance resulted in a lasting decrease in annual forest C storage. However, climate variation exerts a strong control on C storage as well, and future climate change may substantially reduce annual C storage by these forests. Annual C storage varies through ecological succession by rising to a maximum and then slowly declining in old-growth stands. Effective forest C sequestration requires the management of all C pools, including traditionally managed pools such as bole wood and also harvest residues and soils. © 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Carbon; Climate change; Disturbance; Forests; Succession",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249147928

However, many of these trips are by car. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of private car ownership internationally, low-density urban development, and a poor public transport infrastructure. Social and recreational trips make up a sizeable proportion of domestic travel and are contributing to New Zealand's increasing rate of CO2 emissions.

This paper reviews the present knowledge of recorded impacts of climate change and variability on crop production, in order to estimate its contribution to the current situation. Many studies demonstrate increased regional temperatures over the last 40 years (often through greater increases in minimum rather than maximum temperatures), but effects on crop yields are mixed. Distinguishing climate effects from changes in yield resulting from improved crop management and genotypes is difficult, but phenological changes affecting sowing, maturity and disease incidence are emerging. Anthropogenic factors appear to be a significant contributory factor to the observed decline in rainfall in southwestern and southeastern Australia, which reduced tradable wheat grain during 2007. Indirect effects of climate change through actions to mitigate or adapt to anticipated changes in climate are also evident. The amount of land diverted from crop production to biofuel production is small but has had a disproportionate effect on tradable grains from the USA. Adaptation of crop production practices and other components of the food system contributing to food security in response to variable and changing climates have occurred, but those households without adequate livelihoods are most in danger of becoming food insecure.

To adequately assess this assumption and then obtain the net GHG emissions from the Eastmain-1 hydroelectric reservoir, the carbon stock and GHG emissions from peatlands and different succession stages of forested areas need to be characterized prior to the reservoir impoundment. It is therefore important to characterize the carbon flow process (surface fluxes and sequestrated carbon) from these terrestrial systems prior to impoundment. The Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada, Québec region, has developed an approach for mapping wetlands using Landsat/RADARSAT-1 satellite images. The method is based on image segmentation using the Definiens Professional software. The top-down object-based classification is based on the Canadian Wetland Classification System and quickly and precisely identifies ecologically meaningful wetland polygons. The main objective of this study is to produce a wetland map of the Eastmain River watershed using a SPOT-4 image aimed at identifying five classes of wetlands (bog, fen, marsh, swamp, shallow water) for a geographical unit of at least 1 ha, and to add to the peatland classes a description of their components, such as pool complexes and vegetation structures, to assign measured carbon values to these different peatland classes and scale up the data to obtain a regional carbon budget. The second objective of the study consists in determining whether SPOT-4 images can be used to map wetlands, using the object-based method developed with Landsat/RADARSAT-1 images, and if a finer spatial resolution would improve the wetland mapping results by adding information on wetland components. The SPOT-4 classification using the object-based method allowed the five main wetland classes to be identified in addition to pool complexes in three density classes (isolated, low density, and high density) and “bogs”/“fens” vegetation structure (treed or open) in peatland classes. Validation was done at two levels: (i) between the five classes of wetlands, and (ii) between pool complexes and vegetation structures. The overall accuracy was 81% for the first level and 75% for the second. © 2008 Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Budget control; Carbon; Greenhouse gases; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Lakes; Mapping; Reservoirs (water); Vegetation; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Greenhouse gases emissions; Hydroelectric reservoirs; Object-based classifications; Object-based methods; Professional software; Vegetation structure; Wetland classification; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849141721

In order to determine petrogenic contamination in the coastal industrial area of Kavala City in northern Greece, a combination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and organic geochemical petroleum biomarker analyses has been performed on marine and freshwater sediments as well as soils. Soils, freshwater, and marine sediments have been treated by standard extraction methods. The dried and desulphurized sample extracts have been fractionated by column chromatography, followed by addition of surrogate standards. Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained by gas chromatograph connected with a flame ionization and electron capture detector (GC-FID/ECD) and by GC linked to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS), whereas identification of compounds was based on EI+-mass spectra and gas chromatographic retention times. Quantitative data were obtained by integration of specific ion chromatograms. The total PAH concentrations measured in the area varied highly, showing different levels from 18 up to 318,000 ng g-1 dry weight (dw). Several PAH ratios, as well as the ratio of pristane (Pr) to phytane (Phyt), have been considered. Out of 39 samples, 22 revealed a specific distribution of hopane fingerprints indicating petrogenic input. Finally, in numerous samples, the ratio of 17α(H)-22,29,30-trisnorhopane (Tm) and 18α(H)-22,29,30-trisnorhopane (Ts) was calculated, as well as the ratio of 22S-17α(H),21β(H)-30 homohopane (αβC31-hopane 22S) and 22R-17α(H),21β(H)-30 homohopane (αβC 31-hopane 22R). Based on the specific PAH ratios, a group of samples was clearly characterized to be contaminated dominantly by combustion-derived emissions, whereas a second group of samples exhibited mixed influence from petrogenic and pyrogenic PAHs. On the other hand, the exhibition of specific hopane fingerprints in many samples indicates a direct petrogenic input. Finally, the values of the ratio of Tm/(Ts∈+∈Tm) and of αβC31-hopanes 22S/(22S+22R)-isomer demonstrated an input of highly mature organic matter that has to be clearly attributed to petroleum-derived contamination, while the ratio of Pr/Phyt showed that most samples exhibited an input of organic matter. The coastal area of Kavala is strongly affected by anthropogenic contaminants. Petrogenic emissions were pointed out firstly by PAH analyses that separated dominantly pyrogenic contaminated sites from areas affected by both pyrogenic and petrogenic emissions. However, analyses of organic geochemical biomarkers revealed a much higher sensitivity in identifying petroleum-derived contaminations and were successfully used to differentiate several petrogenic contaminations in the marine and terrestrial samples. Based on this study, it was recommended to use a complementary approach of source-specific substances to successfully characterize petrogenic emissions. Generally, a PAH-based source identification of petrogenic versus pyrogenic contaminations should be combined with petroleum biomarker analysis. PAH and biomarker ratios as well as individual biomarker fingerprints revealed a more comprehensive view on the quality and quantity of petrogenic emissions in sediments and soils. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Biomarkers; Coastal area; Greece; Industrial area; PAHs; Petrogenic emissions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","biomarker; coastal zone; geochemical method; industrial emission; organic geochemistry; PAH; Eastern Macedonia and Thrace; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Kavala; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849103930

This paper discusses policy instruments for advancing large-scale deployment of CCS in the European Union, and evaluates them in a multi-criteria analysis. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) is a cost-effective instrument for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, but it is questionable whether its currently limited time horizon and short-trading periods will lead to substantial CCS diffusion. Complementary policies at the EU and the Member State level may repair this and provide sufficient incentives for CCS. Potential policies include financial instruments such as investment subsidies, a feed-in scheme, or a CO2 price guarantee, as well as a CCS mandate or a low-carbon portfolio. These policy options differ with respect to their environmental effectiveness, possible interaction with the EU-ETS, costs and financial risk involved, and their competition with other mitigation options. Interactions between Member State policies and the EU-ETS are smaller in scope than those of EU-wide policies, but they are more likely to lead to displacement of financial resources from other low-carbon technologies. In addition, national policies may pose a significant part of the financial risk of CCS operations with Member States, reducing the operator's incentive to innovate. Overall, structural policies at the EU level, such as a mandate or a low-carbon portfolio standard would be more conducive for realising large-scale deployment of CCS across the EU as well as more acceptable to environmental organisations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A key challenge for water managers is how to incorporate highly uncertain information about potential climate change from global models into local- and regional-scale water management models and tools to support local planning. This paper presents a new method for developing large ensembles of local daily weather that reflect a wide range of plausible future climate change scenarios while preserving many statistical properties of local historical weather patterns. This method is demonstrated by evaluating the possible impact of climate change on the Inland Empire Utilities Agency service area in southern California. The analysis shows that climate change could impact the region, increasing outdoor water demand by up to 10% by 2040, decreasing local water supply by up to 40% by 2040, and decreasing sustainable groundwater yields by up to 15% by 2040. The range of plausible climate projections suggests the need for the region to augment its long-range water management plans to reduce its vulnerability to climate change.

The system is based on the RAMS meteorological model forecasting and the CALGRID photochemical grid dispersion model, being suitably modified for the present work to be applied for inert pollutants. As a matter of fact, the attention was paid to particulate matter (PM10) primary component, as well as Nitrogen Dioxides (NOx), which is one of main precursors of PM10 secondary inorganic component. Both pollutants have been treated as inert ones. A one-year long-term application of RAMS-CALMET-CALGRID has been carried out over the Florence metropolitan area, Italy. The study area is 49x40 Km2 wide, featuring a 1-Km spaced 3-D computational grid. The main project's aim is to assess possible air quality improvements after a number of interventions on emission scenarios have been planned by local authorities. Therefore, basing on IRSE regional emission inventory, two PM10 and NOx emission scenarios have been set: a present one, updated to 2003, and a future one, projected to years 2010-2012, where ""business as usual"" emission variations are supposed to occur. All types of emission sources have been taken into account, i.e. point, line and area (split into 4 sub-categories) ones. This enabled single contributions brought by any to be assessed, as well as the overall one. Summarizing, a total of 28 run combinations (2 scenarios by 2 pollutants by 7 source categories) have been performed by the modelling system. CALGRID-calculated PM10 and NOx concentrations resulting from present and future emission scenarios have been compared, both in terms of spatial pattern over the study area and local one to a number of chemical stations. The final result was a general NOx concentration reduction in the order of 10÷35%, particularly effective over the Florence and Prato urban areas. On the contrary, primary PM10 concentrations proved to decrease, about 15% over the Florence urban area, as well as increase, 10÷15% over the mountainous area Northwest to Pistoia. Summarizing, the proper use of an integrated modelling system proved to be a fundamental tool for planning emission scenarios variations to improve air quality standards. Moreover, methodologies implemented and results achieved in the present paper are in agreement with other similar scenarios analysis works.","Air quality planning; CALGRID; Dispersion models; Emission scenarios; Florence; NOx; PM10; RAMS","air quality; concentration (composition); dispersion; emission inventory; environmental planning; modeling; particulate matter; urban area; Eurasia; Europe; Firenze [Tuscany]; Florence [Firenze]; Italy; Prato [Tuscany]; Southern Europe; Tuscany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749195148

Biodiesel can form blends with diesel in any ratio, and thus could replace partially, or even totally, diesel fuel in diesel engines what would bring a number of environmental, economical and social advantages. Although a number of studies are available on regulated substances, there is a gap of studies on unregulated substances, such as carbonyl compounds, emitted during the combustion of biodiesel, biodiesel-diesel and/or ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends. CC is a class of hazardous pollutants known to be participating in photochemical smog formation. In this work a comparison was carried out between the two most widely used CC collection methods: C18 cartridges coated with an acid solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) and impinger bottles filled in 2,4-DNPH solution. Sampling optimization was performed using a 22 factorial design tool. Samples were collected from the exhaust emissions of a diesel engine with biodiesel and operated by a steady-state dynamometer. In the central body of factorial design, the average of the sum of CC concentrations collected using impingers was 33.2 ppmV but it was only 6.5 ppmV for C18 cartridges. In addition, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 4% for impingers and 37% for C18 cartridges. Clearly, the impinger system is able to collect CC more efficiently, with lower error than the C18 cartridge system. Furthermore, propionaldehyde was nearly not sampled by C18 system at all. For these reasons, the impinger system was chosen in our study. The optimized sampling conditions applied throughout this study were: two serially connected impingers each containing 10 mL of 2,4-DNPH solution at a flow rate of 0.2 L min-1 during 5 min. A profile study of the C1-C4 vapor-phase carbonyl compound emissions was obtained from exhaust of pure diesel (B0), pure biodiesel (B100) and biodiesel-diesel mixtures (B2, B5, B10, B20, B50, B75). The ΣCC of the emission concentrations were 20.5 ppmV for B0 and 15.7 ppmV for B100. When considering fuel blends, the measured ΣCC were 21.4 ppmV, 22.5 ppmV, 20.4 ppmV, 14.2 ppmV, 11.4 ppmV and 14.7 ppmV, respectively, for B2, B5, B10, B20, B50 and B75. Among the target CC, both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the major contributors to the observed total CC levels. Except for acrolein and formaldehyde, all CC showed a clear trend of reduction in the emissions from B2 to B100 (40% reduction, on average). Both individual and total CC emission factors (pg g-1 of fuel burnt) were calculated for all tested biodiesel-diesel blends. The lowest total CC emission factor (2271 pg g-1) was found when B50 was used; the individual emission factors determined (pg g-1) were: 539.7 (formaldehyde), 1411 (acetaldehyde), 30.83 (acrolein), and 310.7 (propionaldehyde). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper discusses how tropical forestry practices can contribute to maintaining or enhancing the adaptive capacity of natural and planted forests to global climate change and considers challenges and opportunities for the integration of tropical forest management in broader climate change adaptation. In addition to the use of reduced impact logging to maintain ecosystem integrity, other approaches may be needed, such as fire prevention and management, as well as specific silvicultural options aimed at facilitating genetic adaptation. In the case of planted forests, the normally higher intensity of management (with respect to natural forest) offers additional opportunities for implementing adaptation measures, at both industrial and smallholder levels. Although the integration in forest management of measures aimed at enhancing adaptation to climate change may not involve substantial additional effort with respect to current practice, little action appears to have been taken to date. Tropical foresters and forest-dependent communities appear not to appreciate the risks posed by climate change and, for those who are aware of them, practical guidance on how to respond is largely non-existent. The extent to which forestry research and national policies will promote and adopt management practices in order to assist production forests adapt to climate change is currently uncertain. Mainstreaming adaptation into national development and planning programs may represent an initial step towards the incorporation of climate change considerations into tropical forestry. © 2007 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Natural forest management; Tropical forests; Tropical tree plantations","adaptation; climate change; forest ecosystem; forest management; forestry policy; forestry practice; global climate; logging (timber); mitigation; silviculture; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53149111193

The first hypothesis claims that interest groups lobby their 'friends', decision-makers with positions similar to their own. The second claims that interest groups lobby their 'foes', decision-makers with positions opposed to their own. Using interviews with lobbyists and decision-makers, I demonstrate that in the field of climate policy, interest groups in the EU lobby both friends and foes, but under different conditions. Moreover, I find that the interest groups' motives are not always in line with the theoretical hypotheses. Interest groups lobby their friends on single policy decisions to exchange information, to further a common cause and to exert pressure, and their foes because a foe on one issue might prove to be a friend on another issue. Interest groups direct general lobbying towards both friends and foes.

It is a multifunctional protein and one of its main known functions is to tag proteins for selective degradation by the 26S proteasome. In this study, Ta-Ub2, a cDNA sequence containing a single Ub repeat and a 3′ non-coding region of a polyubiquitin gene, was isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A PBI sense vector with Ta-Ub2 was constructed and transformed into tobacco plants. Ub expression in wheat leaves, monitored by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, responded to drought stress. In transgenic tobacco, determined by protein gel blot analysis, we found higher amounts of Ub-protein conjugates than in control (tobacco carrying a PBI GUS vector without Ta-Ub2) and wild-type (WT) lines. However, free Ub levels did not significantly differ in the 3 genotypes. Seeds from transgenic, Ub-overexpressing tobacco germinated faster and seedlings grew more vigorously than control and WT samples, both under drought and non-drought conditions. Furthermore, CO2 assimilation of transgenic plants was significantly higher under drought stress. Our results indicate that Ub may be involved in the response of plants to drought stress and that overexpression of monoubiquitin might be an effective strategy for enhancing drought tolerance. © 2007.","Drought tolerance; Gene expression; Transgenic tobacco; Ubiquitin; Wheat","carbon dioxide; messenger RNA; ubiquitin; water; amino acid sequence; article; genetics; germination; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; photosynthesis; physiological stress; physiology; plant seed; prenatal development; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tobacco; transgenic plant; wheat; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Carbon Dioxide; Germination; Molecular Sequence Data; Photosynthesis; Plants, Genetically Modified; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Seeds; Stress, Physiological; Tobacco; Triticum; Ubiquitin; Water; Eukaryota; Nicotiana obtusifolia; Nicotiana tabacum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249133024

Methods and Results: Saponin extracted from tea seeds was added to (1) an in-vitro fermentation inoculated with rumen fluid and (2) a pure culture of Methanobrevibacter ruminantium. Methane production and expression of the methyl coenzyme-M reductase subunit A (mcrA) were monitored in both cultures. Abundance of methanogens, protozoa, rumen fungi and cellulolytic bacteria were quantified using real-time PCR, and bacterial diversity was observed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Addition of tea saponin significantly reduced methane production and mcrA gene expression in the ruminal fermentation but not with the pure culture of M. ruminantium. The abundance of protozoa and fungi were significantly decreased 50% and 79% respectively but methanogen numbers were not affected, and Fibrobacter succinogenes increased by 41%. Bacterial diversity was similar in cultures with or without tea saponin. Conclusions: Tea saponin appeared to reduce methane production by inhibiting protozoa and presumably lowering methanogenic activity of protozoal-associated methanogens.

We study the production and emission of SiO and H2 in the gas phase of molecular outflows, extending previous work in which we considered steady-state C-type shock waves and assumed the silicon to be present only in the cores of silicate grains. Aims. We place constraints on the physical parameters of the pre-shock region, using recent observations of SiO and observations of molecular hydrogen. We show the effects of introducing SiO-containing mantles and of varying the age of the shock wave. We consider simultaneously the emission of SiO and H2 from the young LI 157 outflow. Methods. The molecular outflows are studied by means of a code that can generate stationary C- and J-type shock models and approximate non-stationary solutions, which combine these two types of shock wave. The emission of molecular hydrogen is computed by this code, whereas the SiO emission is computed by means of a separate LVG model, which uses the calculated physical and chemical profiles. A grid of models has been computed, with shock speeds in the range 10 ≤ us ≤ 35 km s-1 and pre-shock gas densities 104 ≤ nH ≤ 106 cm-3. A wide range of magnetic field strengths has been investigated, from 45 μG to about 600 μG. Results. We illustrate our results by means of observational data obtained on the blue lobe of the L1157 outflow. Given the combinations of pre-shock densities and shock velocities necessary to fit the H2 observations, we find that the erosion only of the silicate material in the grains cores cannot account for the observed SiO line intensities. We investigate the possiblity that a fraction of the SiO is present initially in the grain mantles, and we succeed in constraining this fraction. Introducing even a few percent of the silicon (as SiO) into the mantles is sufficient to increase the SiO line widths and fluxes by an order of magnitude. With this assumption, it is possible to find a non-stationary shock model that provides a reasonable fit of the observations of both H2 and SiO. Conclusions. With a few percent of the silicon present initially in the grain mantles, good agreement is obtained with recent observations of SiO line integrated line intensities for a pre-shock density nH = 104 cm -3 and a shock speed vs = 20 km s-1. The magnetic field strength and the shock age are not well constrained by the observations of either H2 or SiO. We show that CO observations (in particular, with the Herschel satellite) could provide further discrimination between the models. © ESO 2008.","Astrochemistry; Infrared: ISM; ISM: jets and outflows; Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); Molecular processes; Radio lines: ISM","Codes (symbols); Fluid dynamics; Grain (agricultural product); Hydrogen; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic fields; Magnetohydrodynamics; Molecular mass; Nonmetals; Shock waves; Silicates; Silicon; Speed; Waves; Astrochemistry; Infrared: ISM; ISM: jets and outflows; Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); Molecular processes; Radio lines: ISM; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54549105450

Over a longer period, however, urban adjustments cancel out this inequality: (1) in the center, rent level rises because of higher demand, inducing investment in additional housing and increasing city density; (2) on the outskirts, housing demand decreases until rent level decreases and compensates for higher transportation expenditures. Inertia in housing supply and household re-locations leads, therefore, to the development of spatial inequalities. To investigate this issue, we built a dynamic model that reproduces urban transitions in monocentric cities, and enables quantifying in continuous time their spatialized consequences. Applied to the implementation of a transportation tax, the model suggests that a rapid implementation would induce (i) higher welfare losses than can be inferred from traditional models and (ii) major redistributive effects throughout the city. Finally, the model suggests that an early and progressive implementation is to be preferred to late and aggressive action. These results challenge current assessment methods of climate change stabilization strategies and show that it is essential to take into account urban dynamics and inequalities in the design of climate policy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The main issues discussed are a summary of archeological and zooarchaeological evidence (sites, location, chronology, lithic technology, faunal distribution and diversity, etc.) both on regional and areal scales. The topics included in order to characterize subsistence strategies are the climatic changes that operated on and influenced the species, differential species extinction and survival, exploited species diversity, procurement and processing techniques, and intensity of faunal exploitation. It is proposed that the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene period is characterized by a generalized regional economy, as has also been recently proposed for North America. In general terms, a broad spectrum of resources would have been exploited by humans as suggested by the presence and diversity of consumed species. Given the fluctuating climatic conditions during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, a subsistence pattern composed of a broad diet would have been a suitable strategy to promote in unstable environments. Both taxonomic diversity and richness are greater when compared with the following time period (Middle Holocene), characterized by a specialized regional economy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeological evidence; archaeology; exploitation; fauna; historical perspective; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; settlement history; subsistence; temporal variation; Argentina; Sierras Pampeanas; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55049104305

This system allows for a precise comparison of elementary targets such as deuterium and hydrogen to heavy solid targets to study subtle medium effects such as color transparency, transverse momentum broadening, and hadron attenuation. One cryo-target and one solid target were located in the beam simultaneously, separated by 4 cm to minimize acceptance correction differences in the large CLAS spectrometer while maintaining the ability to identify the target event-by-event. Because both targets were positioned in the beam simultaneously, time-dependent systematic effects such as drifting gains or inefficient detector channels cancel in ratios of observables, increasing the precision of the final results. Measurements were performed with hydrogen and deuterium in combination with 3 mm diameter targets of carbon, aluminum, iron, tin, and lead. The solid targets and deuterium target were comparable in thicknesses except for specialized diagnostic runs with ultra-thin aluminum. Switching of the solid targets was performed remotely and required only a few seconds to complete.

The RHF makes use of iron-oxide-carbon composite pellets as the charge material and the final product is direct-reduced iron (DRI) in the solid or molten state. This part of the research includes the development of a reactor that simulated the heat transfer in an RHF. The external heat-transport and high heating rates were simulated by means of infrared (IR) emitting lamps. The reaction rates were measured by analyzing the off-gas and computing both the amount of CO and CO2 generated and the degree of reduction. The reduction times were found to be comparable to the residence times observed in industrial RHFs. Both artificial ferric oxide (PAH) and naturally occurring hematite and taconite ores were used as the sources of iron oxide. Coal char and devolatilized wood charcoal were the reductants. Wood charcoal appeared to be a faster reductant than coal char. However, in the PAH-containing pellets, the reverse was found to be true because of heat-transfer limitations. For the same type of reductant, hematite-containing pellets were observed to reduce faster than taconite-containing pellets because of the development of internal porosity due to cracking and fissure formation during the Fe2O3-to- Fe3O4 transition. This is, however, absent during the reduction of taconite, which is primarily Fe3O4. The PAH-wood-charcoal pellets were found to undergo a significant amount of swelling at low-temperature conditions, which impeded the external heat transport to the lower layers. If the average degree of reduction targeted in an RHF is reduced from 95 to approximately 70 pct by coupling the RHF with a bath smelter, the productivity of the RHF can be enhanced 1.5 to 2 times. The use of a two- or three-layer bed was found to be superior to that of a single layer, for higher productivities. © 2008 The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Average degrees; Carbon composites; Charge materials; Coal chars; Composite pellets; Degree of reductions; External heats; Ferric oxides; Final products; Fissure formations; High heating rates; Internal porosities; Molten states; Reduced irons; Reductant; Reductants; Residence times; Rotary hearth furnaces; Single layers; Temperature conditions; Wood charcoals; Carbon; Carbon carbon composites; Carbon dioxide; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Charcoal; Composite materials; Furnaces; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Heating equipment; Hematite; Iron ores; Lighting; Metal refineries; Metallurgical furnaces; Minerals; Open hearth furnaces; Ores; Oxide minerals; Pelletizing; Rate constants; Reaction rates; Smelting; Iron oxides; Carbon; Charcoal; Composites; Furnaces; Heat Exchangers; Heat Transfer; Heating Equipment; Illumination; Iron Oxides; Minerals; Pelleting; Plastics; Reaction Kinetics; Smelting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349181523

The pellets, in general, were found to shrink considerably during the reduction due to the loss of carbon and oxygen from the system, sintering of the iron-oxide, and formation of a molten slag phase at localized regions inside the pellets due to the presence of binder and coal/wood-charcoal ash at the reduction temperatures. One of the shortcomings of the RHF ironmaking process has been the inability to use multiple layers of composite pellets because of the impediment in heat transport to the lower layers of a multilayer bed. However, pellet shrinkage was found to have a strong effect on the reduction kinetics by virtue of enhancing the external heat transport to the lower layers. The volume change of the different kinds of composite pellets was studied as a function of reduction temperature and time. The estimation of the change in the amount of external heat transport with varying pellet sizes for a particular layer of a multilayer bed was obtained by conducting heat-transfer tests using inert low-carbon steel spheres. It was found that if the pellets of the top layer of the bed shrink by 30 pct, the external heat transfer to the second layer increases by nearly 6 times. © 2008 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Carbon composites; Composite pellets; External heat transfers; External heats; Heat transports; Iron making processes; Low-carbon steels; Molten slags; Multiple layers; Pellet sizes; Reduction kinetics; Reduction temperatures; Rotary hearth furnaces; Second layers; Short-comings; Volume changes; Carbon; Carbon carbon composites; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon steel; Charcoal; Composite materials; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Heating equipment; Iron; Iron oxides; Metal refineries; Metallurgical furnaces; Multilayers; Oxygen; Pelletizing; Shrinkage; Sintering; Slags; Steel; Ore pellets; Carbon; Carbon Steel; Charcoal; Composites; Heat Exchangers; Heat Transfer; Heating Equipment; Iron; Iron Oxides; Multilayers; Oxygen; Pelleting; Plastics; Shrinkage; Sintering; Slag",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349149133

Although microbial decomposers, particularly fungi, are important mediators of global carbon and nutrient cycling, the functional roles of specific taxa within natural environments remain unclear. We used a nucleotide-analog technique in soils from the Harvard Forest to characterize the fungal taxa that responded to the addition of five different carbon substrates-glycine, sucrose, cellulose, lignin, and tannin-protein. We show that fungal community structure and richness shift in response to different carbon sources, and we demonstrate that particular fungal taxa target different organic compounds within soil microcosms. Specifically, we identified eleven taxa that exhibited changes in relative abundances across substrate treatments.

In the light of these discussions, it behooves countries to be able to determine the relative likelihood of deforestation over a landscape and perform a first order estimation of the potential reduction in GHGs associated with various protection scenarios. This would allow countries to plan their interventions accordingly to maximize carbon benefits, alongside other environmental and socioeconomic benefits, because forest protection programs might be chosen in places where the perceived threat of deforestation is high whereas in reality the threat is low. In this case study, we illustrate a method for creating deforestation threat maps and estimating potential reductions in GHGs from eighteen protected areas in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, that would occur if protection of these areas was well enforced. Results from our analysis indicate that a further 230 720 ha of East Kalimantan's forest area would be lost and approximately 305 million t CO2 would be emitted from existing protected areas between 2003 and 2013 if the historical rate of deforestation continued unabated. In other words, the emission of 305 million t CO2 into the atmosphere would be avoided during this period if protection of the existing areas was well enforced. At a price of $4 per ton of CO2 (approximate price on the Chicago Climate Exchange in August 2008), this represents an estimated gross income stream of about $120 million per year. We also identified additional areas with high carbon stocks under high deforestation threat that would be important to protect if the carbon benefits of avoided deforestation activities are to be maximized in this region. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Deforestation; GEOMOD; Land use change; Protected areas; REDD; Tropical forest","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Conservation; Earnings; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; GEOMOD; Land-use change; Protected areas; REDD; Tropical forest; Deforestation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749108750

Efforts by diplomats to incorporate interstate social and distributive justice into these treaties and the broader climate change regime have been terribly insufficient in addressing the growing menace of global warming. While serious consideration of interstate justice has been a practical and ethical prerequisite for gamering broader participation in the climate change regime, doing so has diverted all responsibility to states, thus failing to discourage consumption and pollution by capable people. This includes the tens of millions of people in the developing world whose governments have no obligation to limit nationwide pollution. The bulk of literature on justice and climate change, and all related treaties, speak of obligations of states to act (or not) to limit their emissions of greenhouse gases, or to act in ways to mitigate the effects of these emissions, and to assist poorer states to help them develop in less polluting ways. There is almost no discussion of the obligations of individuals. Increasingly, however, individuals matter: more and more of them, who are not now subject to any legally binding climate-related obligations, are able to afford lifestyles that lead to unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions and more climate change. This is especially true given the rapid increase in the numbers of affluent people in the developing world. Given this poor fit between existing international environmental law on climate change and the problem it is intended to address, this article assesses whether individuals should be brought into the equation. It goes around the still important question of interstate climate justice to explore what could be viewed as a possible cure for the impotence of extant international law: cosmopolitan climate justice. Cosmopolitan justice can locate more obligation to act on climate change, and to aid those people who will suffer from it, in capable individuals in both affluent and poor states.",,"climate change; developing world; emission control; environmental legislation; global warming; greenhouse gas; international law; pollution policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949090602

It has been manifested in many international environmental agreements, notably the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The question arises as to whether it is being put into practice in this context. Are the requirements of international environmental equity merely words and principles in international instruments, or are they having a practical effect on the policies of state governments? This article aims to start answering these questions. It examines whether the European Union (EU) and its member states are sharing the burdens of climate change. The article introduces equity in the context of the climate change agreements and looks at some normative and practical considerations. It suggests that Europe has been a leader on international equity in the climate change negotiations over the last decade, and it points to what European states and the EU have done to take on some of the burdens of climate change. Europe’s actions are briefly assessed from practical and normative perspectives. Europe is doing more than any other part of the world to address climate change and to share the burdens associated with it. Nevertheless, Europe is not doing as much to address this problem as it can and should do. Both practical and normative imperatives demand more urgent action by Europe to implement climate equity. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate change; European Union; International equity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69849123060

In a mixed grassland of the southern Great Plains, we tested the hypotheses that spring-season fire would increase the absolute biomass and relative proportion of C4 grasses in the plant community, and decrease soil microbial biomass N, thereby increasing microbial C:N ratios. We also tested the hypothesis that clipping (to simulate grazing) would reduce effects of fire, with a greater reduction of fire effect corresponding to an increased frequency of clipping. Contrary to our hypothesis, C4 grasses showed no significant treatment responses. Treatment effects were limited to C3 grasses, and clipping was more important than fire in terms of effects on plant community composition. However, because of its greater capacity to reduce aboveground litter, fire had the greater impact on soil microbial C. Contrary to the hypothesized outcome, no significant effects of disturbance on soil microbial N were observed. This suggests that control of N cycling in this ecosystem is primarily microbial in nature, though dependent on inputs of plant C via litter. Interactions between fire and clipping were observed in litter mass, highlighting the importance of litter inputs for plant-soil nutrient feedbacks.","Biomass; C3; C4; Cover; Disturbance","aboveground biomass; C3 plant; C4 plant; clipping; community composition; community response; environmental disturbance; fire; grassland; grazing; hypothesis testing; nitrogen cycle; plant community; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; soil-vegetation interaction; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61949478381

The Kipushi deposit is hosted in carbonates and partly in siliciclastic rocks that have undergone regional, low-grade greenschist facies metamorphism and which were strongly deformed during the Lufilian orogeny (main deformation phase ∼550 Ma). Investigation of host-rock, gangue, and ore samples enabled reconstruction of the paragenesis of ore deposition. The main Zn-Cu (+Ge, Pb) sulfide mineralization was accompanied by three generations of hydrothermal dolomite and a generation of coarse-grained quartz. Primary and pseudosecondary fluid inclusions in these minerals contain predominantly halite-saturated, aqueous brines (∼30-43 wt % NaCl equiv), with locally unidentified trapped solids. These inclusions mostly decrepitate upon heating before total homogenization, which could suggest that they also trapped excess carbonic vapor. They show petrographic and microthermometric evidence for postentrapment reequilibration, prohibiting their use as accurate geothermometers and geobarometers. Previous studies on chlorite and sphalerite geothermometry framed the formation temperature of the Kipushi Cu-Zn deposit between ∼290° to 380°C Younger fluids are present as secondary inclusions in the gangue minerals and as primary fluid inclusions in sphalerite from a minor secondary mineralization phase. These two-phase aqueous inclusions have a slightly lower salinity (°23-31 wt % NaCl equiv) and have homogenization temperatures ranging from ∼170° to &lt;80°C in successive fluid inclusion assemblages. Sporadically, some mixed aqueous-carbonic and gaseous CO 2 + CH 4 inclusions are present, but their genetic position is unclear and they are insignificant with regard to the mineralization process as a whole. Crush-leach (bulk) analysis of the fluid inclusions show that the mineralizing fluids had a molar Cl/Br ratio close to, or somewhat higher than, the seawater value, which rules out a major contribution from bittern brines and suggests that the fluids gained their salinity primarily by the dissolution of evaporites. Younger fluids that circulated through the deposit after the main phase of ore formation have Cl/Br and Na/Br signatures indicative of a greater involvement of halite-dissolution brines (values much higher than that of seawater). LA-ICP-MS analyses of the mineralizing fluids reveal that they have molar Li/Na, Ca/Na, Mg/Na, Mn/Na, and Sr/Na in the range of natural high-salinity fluids in metamorphic environments worldwide. However, they have relatively high molar Fe/Na, Zn/Na, Pb/Na, and especially very high Ba/Na ratios. Their molar K/Na is also somewhat higher than for other low-grade metamorphic fluids but is nevertheless in agreement with the values predicted by the K/Na geothermometer at the conditions of ore formation. This suggests that the major element composition of the fluids was buffered by fluid-mineral equilibria. Their relatively high metal contents (Ba, Zn, Fe, and Pb) suggest that they interacted with and leached these elements from felsic basement rocks at higher temperatures. Whatever the origin of the fluids, their salinity and the metals, their uniformly high Ba (and ore metal) content together with the absence of barite and the occurrence of Ba silicates at Kipushi indicates that sulfide mineralization occurred when the metal-bearing fluids encountered a reducing, H 2S-rich reservoir. The ubiquitous presence of preexisting, metamorphosed carbonic material (shungite) in the sulfides and host rock, and a sulfur isotope signature of the ores in agreement with thermogenic sulfate reduction, suggests that this condition was likely created due to the high initial reduced-carbon content of the host rocks at Kipushi, which seems to be exceptional in the copper belt. Therefore, we postulate that a critical factor in the formation of major, vein-type Zn-Cu mineralization was the presence of a hydrocarbon-rich facies of the lower Nguba carbonates at Kipushi. © 2008 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.",,"Aqueous inclusions; Basement rocks; Carbon contents; Coarse-grained; Critical factors; Deformation phase; Democratic republic of congos; Evaporites; Fluid inclusion assemblages; Fluid inclusions; Formation temperatures; Gangue minerals; Geothermometer; Geothermometers; Geothermometry; Greenschist; High-salinity fluids; Higher temperatures; Homogenization temperatures; Host rocks; LA-ICP-MS; La-icp-ms analysis; Laser-ablation icp-ms; Low-grade metamorphic; Major elements; Metal contents; Mineral equilibrium; Mineralization process; Mineralizing fluids; Ore depositions; Ore formations; Ore metals; Physicochemical conditions; Re equilibrations; Shungite; Siliciclastic rocks; Sulfate reductions; Sulfide mineralizations; Sulfur isotopes; Three generations; Barium; Carbonates; Copper zinc deposits; Dissolution; Germanium; Hydrocarbons; Inclusions; Inductively coupled plasma; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Laser ablation; Laser applications; Leaching; Lead; Lead alloys; Mass spectrometers; Metal recovery; Metals; Mineralogy; Minerals; Ores; Oxide minerals; Pulsed laser deposition; Quartz; Rocks; Salinity measurement; Seawater; Silicates; Sodium chloride; Sulfide minerals; Sulfur; Zinc; Zinc sulfide; Fluids; brine; chemical composition; copper; dissolution; fluid inclusion; gangue; geothermometry; greenschist facies; host rock; inductively coupled plasma method; laser; metamorphism; mineralization; ore deposit; orogeny; quartz; salinity; siliciclastic deposit; sulfate; zinc; Africa; Central Africa; Democratic Republic Congo; Katanga; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61849094150

This has led to concerns from scientists, ecologists, and land managers regarding a cascade of ecosystem impacts, and the potential for elevated atmospheric inputs to significantly alter nutrient-poor systems. At particular risk are fragile mountain ecosystems, normally low in nutrients. Control of enhanced nitrogen deposition is required to prevent damage to terrestrial biodiversity and soil water quality, and decrease the release of excess nitrogen into headwaters to the detriment of aquatic ecology. To meet this challenge, control measures operate through legislation aimed at reducing emissions or by ecosystem management at a local level. Current legislation to reduce emissions is under review, whilst techniques aimed at managing nitrogen in lowland ecosystems are impractical in most remote mountain environments. Here we present research which shows the extent of ecosystem damage from enhanced nitrogen deposition and aims to inform future policy in support of national and international action to reduce nitrogen emissions.",,"atmospheric chemistry; ecosystem management; emission control; mountain environment; nitrogen; soil water; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149520214

In the northern foothills of the Harz Mountains near Ditfurt, a stone chamber grave of the middle Neolithic Walternienburg/Bernburg culture was excavated. As the grave was burned towards the end of its time of use, well preserved carbonized plant material resulted. Both cultivated and collected plants were found, but most of the remains were from plants of ruderal vegetation. There was a mass find of Onopordum acanthium and single finds of winter crop weeds such as Agrostemma githago and Adonis cf. aestivalis. The second site was at Burgliebenau, Schwarzacker, Saalekreis, in the floodplains of the Elster-Luppe near Halle (Saale), where a Neolithic corn dryer of the Bernburg/Corded Ware culture was excavated. The dominant crop there was Triticum dicoccum, but T. monococcum was found as well, together with a large amount of diaspores of weeds which includes one of the earliest mass finds of A. githago and Claviceps purpurea. The archaeobotanical evidence of O. acanthium, Adonis cf. aestivalis, A. githago and C. purpurea from these two sites is discussed with reference to further records in central Europe and the probable reasons for their occurrence. The mass find of O. acanthium in the grave of Ditfurt seems to be unique in the region as well as the big record of A. githago in the corn dryer of Burgliebenau.

This paper presents current and possible future electricity use in Swedish industry. Non-heavy lines of business (e.g. food, vehicles) that use one-third of the electricity in Swedish industry are analysed in detail. Most electricity is used in the support processes pumping and ventilation, and manufacturing by decomposition. Energy conservation can take place through e.g. more efficient light fittings and switching off ventilation during night and weekends. By energy-carrier switching, electricity used for heat production is replaced by e.g. fuel. Taking technically possible demand-side measures in the whole lines of business, according to energy audits in a set of factories, means a 35% demand reduction. A systems analysis of power production, trade, demand and conservation was made using the MODEST energy system optimisation model, which uses linear programming and considers the time-dependent impact on demand for days, weeks and seasons. Electricity that is replaced by district heating from a combined heat and power (CHP) plant has a dual impact on the electricity system through reduced demand and increased electricity generation. Reduced electricity consumption and enhanced cogeneration in Sweden enables increased electricity export, which displaces coal-fired condensing plants in the European electricity market and helps to reduce European CO2 emissions. Within the European emission trading system, those electricity conservation measures should be taken that are more cost-efficient than other ways of reducing CO2 emissions. The demand-side measures turn net electricity imports into net export and reduce annual operation costs and net CO2 emissions due to covering Swedish electricity demand by 200 million euros and 6 Mtonne, respectively. With estimated electricity conservation in the whole of Swedish industry, net electricity exports would be larger and net CO2 emissions would be even smaller. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Average DOC concentrations nearly doubled from winter baseflow (2.75 mg L-1) to summer irrigation (5.14 mg L-1), while a concomitant increase in carbon-normalized vanillyl phenols (0.11 mg 100 mg OC-1 increasing to 0.31 mg 100 mg OC-1, on average) indicates that this additional carbon is likely vascular plant-derived. A strong linear relationship between lignin concentration and total suspended sediments (r2 = 0.79) demonstrates that agricultural management practices that mobilize sediments will likely have a direct and significant impact on DOC composition. The original source of vascular plant-derived DOC to Willow Slough appears to be the same throughout the year as evidenced by similar syringyl to vanillyl and cinnamyl to vanillyl ratios. However, differing diagenetic pathways during winter baseflow as compared to the rest of the year are evident in acid to aldehyde ratios of both vanillyl and syringyl phenols. The chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 350 nm showed a strong correlation with lignin concentration (r2 = 0.83). Other CDOM measurements related to aromaticity and molecular weight also showed correlations with carbon-normalized yields (e.g. specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (r2 = 0.57) and spectral slope (r2 = 0.54)). Our overall findings suggest that irrigated agricultural watersheds like Willow Slough can potentially have a significant impact on mainstem DOC concentration and composition when scaled to the entire watershed of the main tributary. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",,"agricultural management; baseflow; dissolved organic carbon; hydrological regime; isotopic composition; lignin; phenol; watershed; California; North America; Sacramento River; United States; Salix; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249142048

The Rhin catchment is a typical highly regulated lowland river basin in Northern Germany. The regulations complicate water quantity and quality modelling in the catchment. The research was done by using the eco-hydrological model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model), which simulates water and nutrient fluxes in soil and vegetation, as well as transport of water and nutrients to and within the river network. The modelling period was from 1981 until 2005. After calibrating the hydrological processes at different gauges within the basin with satisfactory results, water quality (nitrogen and phosphorus) modelling was done taking into account the emissions of different point sources (sewage treatment plants, etc.) and identifying the amount of diffuse pollution caused mainly by agriculture. For suggesting some feasible measures to improve water quality and to reduce diffuse pollution considering possible climate and land use changes, different reasonable scenarios were applied in consultation with the Environmental Agency of Brandenburg (LUA). The study revealed that the amount of water discharge has significant influence on the concentration of nutrients in the river network, and that nitrogen pollution, caused mainly by diffuse sources, could be notably reduced by application of agricultural measures, whereas the pollution by phosphorus could be diminished most effectively by the reduction of point source emissions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

PP and SP images were compared in terms of the tumour-to-thoracic-wall distance, tumour-to-skin distance and tumour volume, diameter, density, maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and localization. The size of axillary areas, the number of intra-axillary lymph nodes, their transverse diameters, their SUVmax and the number of distant metastases were compared between PP and SP images. Differences were tested for significance using the Student's t-test. All patients tolerated PP imaging well. Five locally recurrent breast cancers were detected, both in the SP and in the PP. Mean tumour-to-thoracic-wall distances (PP, 19 mm; SP, 8 mm; p=0.003) and tumour-to-skin distances (PP, 10 mm; SP, 7 mm; p=0.013) were significantly larger in the PP than in the SP. Potential thoracic wall or skin infiltration, as well as quadrant localization, were determined more easily in PP.

While tectonics, climate, and rock-type influence silicate weathering, it is unclear how these factors combine to drive global rates. Here, we explore whether local erosion rates, GCM-derived dust fluxes, temperature, and water balance can capture global variation in silicate weathering. Our spatially explicit approach predicts 1.9-4.6 × 10 13 mols of Si weathered globally per year, within a factor of 4-10 of estimates of global silicate fluxes derived from riverine measurements. Similarly, our watershed-based estimates are within a factor of 4-18 (mean of 5.3) of the silica fluxes measured in the world's ten largest rivers. Eighty percent of total global silicate weathering product traveling as dissolved load occurs within a narrow range (0.01- 0.5 mm/year) of erosion rates. Assuming each mol of Mg or Ca reacts with 1 mol of CO2, 1.5-3.3 × 10 8 tons/year of CO2 is consumed by silicate weathering, consistent with previously published estimates. Approximately 50% of this drawdown occurs in the world's active mountain belts, emphasizing the importance of tectonic regulation of global climate over geologic timescales. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Chemical weathering; Geologic carbon cycle; Landscape development; Riverine chemical fluxes","calcium; carbon dioxide; magnesium; silicate; silicon; article; environmental erosion; environmental temperature; fluid balance; geological time; global change; global climate; measurement; prediction; priority journal; river; weathering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949095969

Such periods of low water availability will be of major importance for photosynthetic activity, plant growth and the carbon budget of ecosystems. From 2004 to 2007, we investigated the effects of water limitation on a 45-year-old Scots pine forest in the upper Rhine plain. This region with its relatively high air temperature and low precipitation during the vegetation period already now represents the expected future precipitation and temperature conditions for large areas of Central Europe. Using the eddy covariance technique to measure net ecosystem CO2 exchange, we found that below the permanent wilting point (i.e., 12 vol.%), net carbon uptake was controlled rather by temperature than by photosynthetically active radiation. In 2005, relatively moderate air temperature and comparatively high precipitation amounts in summer lead to optimal growth conditions and to an annual carbon sink of 600 g C m-2 year-1 for this pine forest. In contrast, dry and hot conditions in July 2006 resulted in soil moisture values below the permanent wilting point, subsequent stomatal closure and a 40% reduction of the net carbon uptake, leading to an annual C sink of only 380 g C m-2 year-1 for the pine stand. We thus conclude that regional-scale impacts of limited water availability on ecosystem sink capacity are no single events, but already now a re-occurring phenomenon in some regions of Central Europe. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N 2O emissions reached values of up to 75 μg N2O-N m -2 h-1 at the UG99 site, but were considerably lower at the WG site. The observed differences in N2O, CH4 and CO2 fluxes between the ungrazed and grazed sites were ascribed to the reduced plant biomass at the grazed site, and-most important-to a reduction in soil moisture, due to reduced snow capturing during winter. Thus, winter-grazing significantly reduced N2O emission but on the other hand also reduced the uptake of atmospheric CH4.

This NOGAPS-ALPHA NWP prototype is used to assimilate stratospheric and mesospheric temperature data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instruments. A 60-day analysis period in January and February 2006, was chosen that includes a well documented stratospheric sudden warming. SABER and MLS temperatures indicate that the SSW caused the polar winter stratopause at ∼40 km to disappear, then reform at ∼80 km altitude and slowly descend during February. The NOGAPS-ALPHA analysis reproduces this observed stratospheric and mesospheric temperature structure, as well as realistic evolution of zonal winds, residual velocities, and Eliassen-Palm fluxes that aid interpretation of the vertically deep circulation and eddy flux anomalies that developed in response to this wave-breaking event. The observation minus forecast (O-F) standard deviations for MLS and SABER are ∼2 K in the mid-stratosphere and increase monotonically to about 6 K in the upper mesosphere. Increasing O-F standard deviations in the mesosphere are expected due to increasing instrument error and increasing geophysical variance at small spatial scales in the forecast model. In the mid/high latitude winter regions, 10-day forecast skill is improved throughout the upper stratosphere and mesosphere when the model is initialized using the high-altitude analysis based on assimilation of both SABER and MLS data.",,"atmospheric modeling; data assimilation; eddy; geophysics; mesosphere; microwave limb sounder; prediction; radiometric method; stratosphere; temporal analysis; wave breaking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54849409016

Proof-of-concept results from a site in north-west England, U.K., show signals in the relevant bright sunshine record consistent with known events of volcanic injection into the stratosphere, and with a brightening in the last decade compared with the 1970s. This brightening is consistent with regional surface air-pollution records and is most evident in winter - suggesting that it is due to a reduction of particulate emissions from space heating. Between the late 1970s and early 2000s, there was a nearly four-fold increase in the number of evenings and mornings around the solstices that recorded bright sunshine at elevation angles below 2°. Current meteorological practice assumes bright sunshine will not be recorded below 3°, and could therefore need amending. The method avoids the need for high-frequency cloud-cover data by normalising low-elevation sunshine against daily sunshine totals. This makes the method applicable at a much wider range of meteorological observation sites. Because of the extensive past use of Campbell-Stokes recorders, the method opens the possibility of generating a new archive of airborne particulate changes based on the attenuation of direct insolation at low-elevation angles. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers (male 8, female 12, average age 29 years old) were selected. Before, during and after five different acupuncture Neiguan (PC 6), the TCE was measured at Quze (PC 3), point A [at the lower one fourth of line between Tianquan (PC 2) and Quze (PC 3)], point B [at the middle of line between Ximen (PC 4) and Quze (PC 3)], point C (2 cm ulnar side point A) and point D (2 cm ulnar side point B) with a high sensitive CO2 instrument (Frewil-Q.F., made in China). The measure results were compared. Results: The comparison on value of TCE before and after the acupuncture, in Sham acupuncture and shallow acupuncture groups, it increased in all five points; in De-qi acupuncture group, there are significant increase on point A, point B, and Quze (PC 3), it has statistic significance, but there are no significant increase on point C and D. After Ximen (PC 4) or Daling (PC 7) were pressed to block Neiguan (PC 6), the value of TCE on Quze (PC 3), point A and point B were decreased during acupuncture Neiguan (PC 6), and increased after the block was removed, but there was no significant difference. Conclusion: Sham acupuncture has also some effects on body, it can increase energy metabolism of local skin, it may be the reason that shallow acupuncture without qi arriving can obtain clinical efficacy.

Both samples showed high selectivity (&gt;98%) toward 1,2-propanediol in glycerol reaction. Because of a much smaller particle size, a higher dispersion of copper species with a strong metal-support interaction, and more resistance to sintering, the CuO/SiO2 catalyst prepared by precipitation-gel method presented a much higher activity and remarkably better long-term stability in glycerol reaction than did the catalyst prepared by impregnation method.

The traditional interpretation of the I = PAT equation reflects the optimistic belief that technological innovation, particularly improvements in eco-efficiency, will significantly reduce the technology (T) factor, and thereby result in a corresponding decline in impact (I). Unfortunately, this interpretation of the I = PAT equation ignores the effects of technological change on the other two factors: population (P) and per capita affluence (A). A more heuristic formulation of this equation is I = P(T)•A(T)•T in which the dependence of P and A on T is apparent. From historical evidence, it is clear that technological revolutions (tool-making, agricultural, and industrial) have been the primary driving forces behind successive population explosions, and that modern communication and transportation technologies have been employed to transform a large proportion of the world's inhabitants into consumers of material- and energy-intensive products and services. In addition, factor analysis from neoclassical growth theory and the rebound effect provide evidence that science and technology have played a key role in contributing to rising living standards. While technological change has thus contributed to significant increases in both P and A, it has at the same time brought about considerable eco-efficiency improvements. Unfortunately, reductions in the T-factor have generally not been sufficiently rapid to compensate for the simultaneous increases in both P and A. As a result, total impact, in terms of energy production, mineral extraction, land-use and CO2 emissions, has in most cases increased with time, indicating that industrial society is nevertheless moving towards collapse. The belief that continued and even accelerated scientific research and technological innovation will automatically result in sustainability and avert collapse is at best mistaken. Innovations in science and technology will be necessary but alone will be insufficient for sustainability. Consequently, what is most needed are specific policies designed to decrease total impact, such as (a) halting population growth via effective population stabilization plans and better access to birth control methods, (b) reducing total matter-energy throughput and pollution by removing perverse subsidies, imposing regulations that limit waste discharges and the depletion of non-renewable resources, and implementing ecological tax reform, and (c) moving towards a steady-state economy in which per-capita affluence is stabilized at lower levels by replacing wasteful conspicuous material consumption with social alternatives known to enhance subjective well-being. While science and technology must play an important role in the implementation of these policies, none will be enacted without a fundamental change in society's dominant values of growth and exploitation.

Using our Galactic chemical evolution code GETOOL, we have examined the evolution of these isotopes within the framework of a Milky Way-like system. We have three aims in this work: first, to test the claim that novae are required, in order to explain the carbon isotope patterns in the Milky Way; secondly, to test the claim that sulphur isotope patterns at high redshift require an initial mass function (IMF) biased towards massive stars; and thirdly, to test extant chemical evolution models against new observations of titanium isotopes that suggest an anti-correlation between trace-to-dominant isotopes with metallicity. Based upon our dual-infall galactic chemical evolution modelling of a Milky Way-like system and the subsequent comparison with these new and unique data sets, we conclude the following: novae are not required to understand the evolution of 12C/13C in the solar neighbourhood; a massive star-biased IMF is consistent with the low ratios of 12C/ 13C and 32S/34S seen in one high-redshift late-type spiral, but the consequent super-solar metallicity prediction for the interstellar medium in this system seems highly unlikely; and deficient isotopes of titanium are predicted to correlate positively with metallicity, in apparent disagreement with the new data sets; if confirmed, classical chemical evolution models of the Milky Way (and the associated supernovae nucleosynthetic yields) may need a substantial overhaul to be made consistent. © 2008 The Authors.","Galaxies: abundances; Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: high-redshift; Galaxies: ISM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54849415675

We have developed a method that is based on a material specific analytical expression of the PV conversion efficiency, relative to nominal efficiency, as a function of module temperature and irradiance. This method is combined with a climate database that includes average daytime temperature and irradiance profiles. It is found that the geographical variation in ambient temperature and yearly irradiation causes a decrease in overall yearly PV performance from 3 to 13% relative to the performance under Standard Test Conditions, with the highest decrease found in the Mediterranean region. Based on the above results we developed a simplified linear expression of the relative PV module efficiency that is a simple function of y early total irradiation and yearly average daytime temperature. The coefficients to the linear expression are found by fitting to the map resulting from the above-mentioned analytical approach. The prediction of total yearly PV output from this linear fit deviates less than 0·5% from the more detailed calculation, thus providing a faster and more simplified alternative to the yield estimate, in the case when only limited climate data are available.

Box 94, Grahamstown, 6139, South Africa","To date, little research has been carried out on pelagic gastropod molluscs (pteropods) in Southern Ocean ecosystems. However, recent predictions are that, due to acidification resulting from a business as usual approach to CO2 emissions (IS92a), Southern Ocean surface waters may begin to become uninhabitable for aragonite shelled thecosome pteropods by 2050. To gain insight into the potential impact that this would have on Southern Ocean ecosystems, we have here synthesized available data on pteropod distributions and densities, assessed current knowledge of pteropod ecology, and highlighted knowledge gaps and directions for future research on this zooplankton group. Six species of pteropod are typical of the Southern Ocean south of the Sub-Tropical Convergence, including the four Thecosomes Limacina helicina antarctica, Limacina retroversa australis, Clio pyramidata, and Clio piatkowskii, and two Gymnosomes Clione limacina antarctica and Spongiobranchaea australis. Limacina retroversa australis dominated pteropod densities north of the Polar Front (PF), averaging 60 ind m-3 (max = 800 ind m-3) and 11% of total zooplankton at the Prince Edward Islands. South of the PF L. helicina antarctica predominated, averaging 165 ind m-3 (max = 2681 ind m-3) and up to &gt;35% of total zooplankton at South Georgia, and up to 1397 ind m-3 and 63% of total zooplankton in the Ross Sea. Combined pteropods contributed &lt;5% to total zooplankton in the Lazarev Sea, but 15% (max = 93%) to macrozooplankton in the East Antarctic. In addition to regional density distributions we have synthesized data on vertical distributions, seasonal cycles, and inter-annual density variation. Trophically, gymnosome are specialist predators on thecosomes, while thecosomes are considered predominantly herbivorous, capturing food with a mucous web. The ingestion rates of L. retroversa australis are in the upper range for sub-Antarctic mesozooplankton (31.2-4196.9 ng pig ind-1 d-1), while those of L. helicina antarctica and C. pyramidata are in the upper range for all Southern Ocean zooplankton, in the latter species reaching 27,757 ng pig ind-1 d-1 and &gt;40% of community grazing impact. Further research is required to quantify diet selectivity, the effect of phytoplankton composition on growth and reproductive success, and the role of carnivory in thecosomes. Life histories are a significant knowledge gap for Southern Ocean pteropods, a single study having been completed for L. retroversa australis, making population studies a priority for this group. Pteropods appear to be important in biogeochemical cycling, thecosome shells contributing &gt;50% to carbonate flux in the deep ocean south of the PF. Pteropods may also contribute significantly to organic carbon flux through the production of fast sinking faecal pellets and mucous flocs, and rapid sinking of dead animals ballasted by their aragonite shells. Quantification of these contributions requires data on mucous web production rates, egestion rates, assimilation efficiencies, metabolic rates, and faecal pellet morphology for application to sediment trap studies. Based on the available data, pteropods are regionally significant components of the Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystem. However, there is an urgent need for focused research on this group in order to quantify how a decline in pteropod densities may impact on Southern Ocean ecosystems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Texas enacted its RPS in 1999; since that time, it has added the most renewable capacity of any state and has rapidly outpaced its statutory goals. The numbers do not tell the whole story, however. This article examines the Texas RPS from two public policy perspectives seldom addressed in previous studies: the politics that shaped the statute creating the RPS and threshold judgments made by the agency implementing the statute. One factor crucial to the political fortunes of the RPS in the Texas Legislature was strategic linkage, that is, associating the RPS with related issues that had ascended high on the legislative agenda, such as competitive restructuring of the state's electricity market. Once the RPS was enacted, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) aimed to build a practical policy framework in which renewable energy development overall would be a response both to the RPS mandate and to customer-driven demand. The PUCT adopted a ""carrot and stick"" approach, imposing penalties for falling short of mandated goals, while at the same time creating a portfolio of measures to ensure that the market was fully able to respond to consumer demand. The Texas experience suggests that economically sustainable renewable energy is the true underlying objective of an RPS; building competition into RPS implementation promotes economic efficiency and increases demand for renewable energy; an RPS, a system of renewable energy credits and green-power policies works best as an integrated package; the regime of rules needs to be stable; and an RPS goal need not be ambitious in order to succeed.",,"alternative energy; energy policy; policy making; renewable resource; resource development; resource management; sustainable development; North America; Texas; United States; Daucus carota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56849127135

To address this, in March 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) to reduce emissions of mercury from these plants. It is generally believed that most of the initial (Phase I) mercury reductions will come as a co-benefit of existing controls used to remove particulate matter (PM), SO2, and NO X . Deeper reductions in emissions (as required in Phase II of CAMR) may require the installation of mercury-specific control technology. Duct injection of activated carbon sorbents is the mercury-specific control technology that has been most widely studied and has been demonstrated over a wide range of coal types and combustion conditions. The effectiveness of the mercury control options (both ""co-benefit control"" and ""mercury-specific control"") is significantly impacted by site-specific characteristics such as the combustion conditions, the configuration of existing air pollution controls, and the type of coal burned.

Most forecasts are based on climate envelopes (CE), correlative approaches that project future distributions on the basis of the current climate often assuming some dispersal lag. One major caveat with this approach is that it ignores the complexity of factors other than climate that contribute to a species' distributional range. To overcome this limitation and to complement predictions based on CE modeling we carried out a transplant experiment of resident and potential-migrant species. Tree seedlings of 18 species were planted side by side from 2001 to 2004 at several locations in the Southern Appalachians and in the North Carolina Piedmont (USA). Growing seedlings under a large array of environmental conditions, including those forecasted for the next decades, allowed us to model seedling survival as a function of variables characteristic of each site, and from here we were able to make predictions on future seedling recruitment. In general, almost all species showed decreased survival in plots and years with lower soil moisture, including both residents and potential migrants, and in both locations, the Southern Appalachians and the Piedmont. The detrimental effects that anticipated arid conditions could have on seedling recruitment contradict some of the projections made by CE modeling, where many of the species tested are expected to increase in abundance or to expand their ranges. These results point out the importance of evaluating the potential sources of migrant species when modeling vegetation response to climate change, and considering that species adapted to the new climate and the local conditions may not be available in the surrounding regions. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate change; Climate envelope; Migration; Seedling recruitment; Source of migrant species; Survival; Transplant experiment; Tree species","article; biological model; demography; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; physiology; seedling; tree; United States; Demography; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Biological; Seedling; Southeastern United States; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949135203

The objective of this study was to estimate the economic value, in real (2004) dollars, of the ecosystem services provided by the U.S. National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) in the contiguous U.S. In order to estimate this value, we determined the ecosystems present on the Refuge System in the contiguous 48 states, the proportion in which they are represented, and the dollar value of services provided by each. We used land cover classes as an approximation of ecosystems present in the Refuge System. In a geographic information system (GIS), we combined land cover geospatial data with a map of the Refuge System boundaries to calculate the number of acres for each refuge and land cover class within the Refuge System. We transferred values for the following ecosystem services: climate and atmospheric gas regulation; disturbance prevention; freshwater regulation and supply; waste assimilation and nutrient regulation; and habitat provision. We conducted a central tendency value transfer by transferring averaged values taken from primarily original site studies to the Refuge System based on the ecoregion in which each study site and refuge was located and the ecoregion's relative net primary productivity (NPP). NPP is a parameter used to quantify the net carbon absorption rate by living plants, and has been shown to be correlated with spatially fungible ecosystem services. The methodologies used in the site studies included direct market valuation, indirect market valuation and contingent valuation. We estimated the total value of ecosystem services provided by the Refuge System in the contiguous U.S. to be approximately $26.9 billion/year. This estimate is a first cut attempt to demonstrate that the value of the Refuge System likely exceeds the value derived purely from recreational activities. Due to limitations of current understanding, methods and data, there is a potentially large margin of error associated with the estimate. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, factors related to these outcomes are unknown. A group suicide was attempted by 3 young people-a 31-year-old man (patient 1), a 21-year-old woman (patient 2), and a 20-year-old man (patient 3)-by burning charcoal in a closed car. At the emergency department, hypotension and hyperthermia were severe in patient 1, moderate in patient 2, and absent in patient 3, although all the patients were comatose. The initial serum lactate levels were 75.1 mg/dL in patient 1, 41.9 mg/dL in patient 2, and 26.3 mg/dL in patient 3, although the carboxyhemoglobin levels were approximately equal in all the patients. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was immediately initiated and continued for 10 days in all the cases; however, the outcomes of these patients varied considerably. Patient 1 remained comatose and died on day 31 because of central diabetes insipidus after shock. Patient 2 recovered from coma and was discharged; however, she was rehospitalized for DE on day 45 and recovered completely after another 10-day HBOT. Patient 3 gained consciousness and recovered completely with no sequelae during the 1-year follow-up. From these cases, we can consider that the initial blood lactate may correlate with the patient outcomes and prove to be a useful prognostic factor. Thus, we should particularly consider elevated lactate levels in CO poisoning. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning results in various neuropsychological impairments. In severe cases, it results in death or the need for rehospitalization for delayed encephalopathy, with delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae [1]. However, factors related to these outcomes are unknown. Here, we report the simultaneous occurrence but different outcomes of 3 cases of acute CO poisoning due to burning charcoal in a group suicide attempt. Three young adults attempted group suicide by leaving 2 braziers with burning charcoal in a closed car. The victims were found and rescued 9 hours after the suicide attempt. A 31-year-old man (patient 1) was found in the driver's seat; a 21-year-old woman (patient 2), in the front passenger's seat; and a 20-year-old man (patient 3), in the backseat. Paroxetine tablets and cartilages were found around the driver's seat. When the paramedics arrived, all the patients were comatose, and patients 1 and 2 were hemodynamically unstable. Table 1 lists the initial vital signs. After oxygenation and intubation, fluid infusion was initiated at the suicide scene. On intubation, severe and slight vomiting was observed in patients 1 and 2, respectively. The patients were transferred to the emergency department (ED) of our hospital. Hypotension and hyperthermia were severe in patient 1, moderate in patient 2, and absent in patient 3. Although the initial Spo2 values at the suicide scene were lower in patients 1 and 2, the Pao2 values of all the patients at the ED were adequate. The initial serum lactate levels were 75.1, 41.9, and 26.3 mg/dL (reference range, 9-18 mg/dL) in patients 1, 2, and 3, respectively, although the carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) levels were approximately equal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was immediately initiated (2.8 atmospheres absolute for 2 hours; from day 2, HBOT [2.0 atmospheres absolute for 2 h/d]) and was continued for 10 days in all the patients (Fig. 1). Patient 1 remained in the prolonged comatose state. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRIs) obtained on day 1 revealed a high-signal intensity area over the white matter and the left globus pallidus (Fig. 2A). Urine drug screening revealed the presence of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and tricyclic antidepressants. On day 30, sudden apnea and dilated pupils were observed, and DW-MRIs revealed severe brain edema (Fig. 2D). He died on day 31 because of central diabetes insipidus after shock. Patient 2 gained consciousness with no abnormalities on the initial DW-MRIs (Fig. 2B). After the 10-day HBOT, she was discharged and followed up thereafter. On day 45, she was rehospitalized for headaches, disorientation, and loss of concentration. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised score [2] had reduced from 75 points, recorded on day 14, to 46 points. The DW-MRIs obtained revealed a slightly high intensity area over the white matter (Fig. 2E). After the diagnosis of delayed encephalopathy, the 10-day HBOT was resumed, after which, her symptoms improved. The abnormal intensity observed over the white matter disappeared completely on day 60. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised score increased to 82 points, and she was discharged. Patient 3 gained consciousness with no abnormalities on the initial DW-MRIs (Fig. 2C), and he was discharged after the 10-day HBOT. No abnormal findings were observed on day 60 (Fig. 2F), and he recovered completely without any delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae during the 1-year follow-up. Although the age, time of onset of poisoning and rescue, and treatment administered were almost identical among the 3 patients, their outcomes varied considerably. Based on their clinical features, we believed that the initial blood lactate level might be related to their respective outcomes. Lactate is the product of anaerobic glycolysis due to inadequate oxygen supply. High lactate level signals hypoxia and hypoperfusion, and it is extensively used in intensive care units as a reliable prognostic factor in critical patients [3,4]. Further, lactate clearance has become a more reliable indicator [5,6]. Some reports have indicated that the initial blood lactate level correlates with the initial severity of CO poisoning [7,8]. However, the relation between the initial lactate levels and outcomes remains unexplored. All the patients described herein were comatose at the ED and were categorized as critical [7], but their outcomes varied considerably. Prognostic factors for CO poisoning, such as initial CO-Hb and acidosis, have been reported; however, their use remains controversial [9,10]. Hypoxia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis are often the major factors responsible for white matter damage in CO poisoning [11,12]. Furthermore, hyperthermia causes necrotic neuronal death and mitochondrial damage leading to severe brain damage and poor outcome [13]. In our cases, hyperthermia observed in patients 1 and 2 might have enhanced tissue hypoxia and lead to brain damage; blood lactate levels may reflect these changes. In conclusion, the initial blood lactate level may correlate with the patient outcomes and prove to be a useful prognostic factor. Thus, we should particularly consider elevated lactate levels in CO poisoning. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The waste management system in Hanoi was analyzed to evaluate the methane emissions from waste landfill sites. The quantity of waste deposited into the landfill was evaluated from an investigation of the waste stream. The composition of municipal waste was surveyed in several districts in the Hanoi city area, and the quantities of degradable organic waste that had been deposited into landfill for the past 15 years were estimated. Field surveys on methane emissions from landfills of different ages (0.5, 2, and 8 years) were conducted and their methane emissions were estimated to be 120, 22.5, and 4.38 ml/min/m2, respectively. The first-order reaction rate of methane generation was obtained as 0.51/year. Methane emissions from waste landfills were calculated by a first-order decay model using this emission factor and the amount of landfilled degradable waste. The estimates of methane emissions using the model accorded well with the estimates of the field survey. These results revealed that methane emissions from waste landfills estimated by regional-specific and precise information on the waste stream are essential for accurately determining the behavior of methane emissions from waste landfills in the past, present, and future. © 2008 Springer Japan.","Clean development mechanism; Greenhouse effect gas; Methane; Vietnam; Waste landfill",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549131229

Differences between PET,CO2 and Pa,CO2 result from regional inhomogeneities in perfusion and gas exchange. We hypothesized that breathing via a sequential gas delivery circuit would reduce these inhomogeneities sufficiently to allow accurate prediction of Pa,CO2 from PET,CO2. We tested this hypothesis in five healthy middle-aged men by comparing their PET,CO2 values with Pa,CO2 values at various combinations of PET,CO2 (between 35 and 50 mmHg), PO2 (between 70 and 300 mmHg), and breathing frequencies (f; between 6 and 24 breaths min-1). Once each individual was in a steady state, Pa,CO2 was collected in duplicate by consecutive blood samples to assess its repeatability. The difference between PET,CO2 and average Pa,CO2 was 0.5 ± 1.7 mmHg (P = 0.53; 95% CI - 2.8, 3.8 mmHg) whereas the mean difference between the two measurements of Pa,CO2 was -0.1 ± 1.6 mmHg (95% CI - 3.7, 2.6 mmHg). Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed no significant differences between PET,CO2 and Pa,CO2 over the ranges of PO2, f and target PET,CO2. We conclude that when breathing via a sequential gas delivery circuit, PET,CO2 provides as accurate a measurement of Pa,CO2 as the actual analysis of arterial blood. © 2008 The Author.

A field study was conducted to (i) determine the effect of soil characteristics resulting from changes in soil management practices on CO2 flux from the soil surface to the atmosphere in transitional land from perennial forages to annual crops, and (ii) develop empirical relationships that predict CO2 flux from soil temperature and soil water content. The CO2 flux, soil temperature (Ts), volumetric soil water content (θv) were measured every 1-2 weeks in no-till (NT) and conventional till (CT) malt barley and undisturbed soil grass-alfalfa (UGA) systems in a Lihen sandy loam soil (sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplustoll) under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in western North Dakota. Soil air-filled porosity (ε) was calculated from total soil porosity and θv measurements. Significant differences in CO2 fluxes between land management practices (irrigation and tillage) were observed on some measurement dates. Higher CO2 fluxes were detected in CT plots than in NT and UGA treatments immediately after rainfall or irrigation. Soil CO2 fluxes increased with increasing soil moisture (R2=0.15, P&lt;0.01) while an exponential relationship was found between CO2 emission and Ts (R2=0.59). Using a stepwise regression analysis procedure, a significant multiple regression equation was developed between CO2 flux and θv, Ts (CO2flux = e- 3.477 + 0.123 Ts + 6.381 θv ; R2=0.68, P≤0.01). Not surprisingly, soil temperature was a driving factor in the equation, which accounted for approximately 59% in variation of CO2 flux. It was concluded that less intensive tillage, such as no-till or strip tillage, along with careful irrigation management will reduce soil CO2 evolution from land being converted from perennial forages to annual crops.","Soil air-filled porosity; Soil CO2 flux; Soil respiration; Tillage","rain; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; irrigation; porosity; soil carbon; soil respiration; tillage; alfalfa; annual plant; article; barley; carbon dioxide transport; controlled study; crop management; forage crop; irrigation (agriculture); nonhuman; perennial plant; porosity; regression analysis; sandy loam; soil management; soil moisture; soil property; soil respiration; soil temperature; soil water content; tillage; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Crops, Agricultural; Soil; Temperature; Water; North America; North Dakota; United States; Hordeum; Medicago sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249097571

Using cis-[Cr(C 2O4)(pm)(OH2)2]+ cation as a specific molecular biosensor and the stopped-flow technique the concentrations of CO2 released from the cell culture medium as one of final products of pyruvate decomposition caused by hydrogen peroxide were determined. To prove the usefulness of our method of CO2 assessment in the case of biological samples we investigated protective properties of exogenous pyruvate in cultured osteosarcoma 143B cells exposed to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) added directly to culture medium. Pyruvic acid is well known scavenger of H2O2 and, moreover, a molecule which is recognized as one of the major mediator of oxidative stress detected in many diseases and pathological situations like ischemiareperfusion states. The pyruvate's antioxidant activity is described as its rapid reaction with H2O2, which causes nonenzymatic decarboxylation of pyruvate and releases of CO2, water and acetate as final products. In this work for the first time we have correlated the concentration of CO 2 dissolved in culture medium with pyruvate's oxidant-scavenging abilities. Moreover, the kinetics of the reaction between aqueous solution of CO2 and coordinate ion, cis-[Cr(C2O4)(pm) (OH2)2]+ was analysed. The results obtained enabled determination of the number of steps of the reaction studied. Based on the kinetic equations, rate constants were determined for each step.","Carbon dioxide; Hydrogen peroxide; Molecular biosensor; Oxidative stress","Anti-oxidant activities; Cell culture mediums; Instrumental methods; Ischemia reperfusion; Molecular biosensors; Pathological situations; Protective properties; Stopped-flow techniques; Biological materials; Biosensors; Carboxylation; Cell culture; Hydrogen peroxide; Integral equations; Oxidative stress; Peroxides; Positive ions; Rate constants; Reaction kinetics; Scavenging; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849097613

PES schemes rely on incentives to induce behavioral change and can thus be considered part of the broader class of incentive- or market-based mechanisms for environmental policy. By recognizing that PES programs are incentive-based, policymakers can draw on insights from the substantial body of accumulated knowledge about this class of instruments. In particular, this article offers a set of lessons about how the environmental, socioeconomic, political, and dynamic context of a PES policy is likely to interact with policy design to produce policy outcomes, including environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and poverty alleviation. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Environmental policy; Incentive payments; Market-based instruments","carbon sequestration; cost effectiveness analysis; ecosystem; financial management; flooding; government regulation; human activities; politics; poverty; priority journal; review; socioeconomics; water management; Ecosystem; Environment; Motivation; Politics; Socioeconomic Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749152624

Temperature and oxygen profile data were collected during cisco mortality events at 17 lakes during an unusually warm summer in Minnesota in 2006. Combinations of temperature and oxygen from the profiles were mapped onto a two-dimensional niche space to directly quantify an oxythermal lethal niche boundary for ciscoes. Quantile regression was used to estimate the niche boundary that described lethal combinations of oxygen and temperature for cisco. The fitted lethal oxythermal niche boundary exhibited a curvilinear interaction between lethal temperatures and lethal oxygen concentrations. The lethal temperature under normoxia (about 8 mg/L) was estimated to be 24°C. Lethal temperatures were progressively less at lower lethal oxygen concentrations (e.g., the lethal temperature was 23.0°C at 5.0 mg/L, 22.0°C at 3.0 mg/L, and 19.5°C at 1.0 mg/L).

Chemical and textural changes in Chadian fossil enamel during fossilization include large amounts of secondary Fe, Si, Mn, and Al-bearing oxides - both as coarse precipitation in cracks and permeating the apatite - high fluorine contamination (i.e., apatite alteration), Ca, P, Cl, Na and Mg depletion, and sulphur contamination. Such diagenetic contamination significantly affects the oxygen and carbon isotope analysis of carbonate in apatite, altering the δ18O and δ13C biogenic signals towards more positive values. Isotopic alteration is however greater for oxygen than for carbon. Indeed, isotopic analysis of the heavily oxide and S-contaminated Chadian fossil tooth enamel samples on a classical Dual Inlet-MultiPrep system versus three Continuous Flow-IRMS mass spectrometers show great differences in both the δ18O and δ13C values. While the MultiPrep-Dual Inlet approach provides carbon and oxygen isotopic results that are indubitably altered and generally inconsistent with any biological values, isotopic analysis on Continuous Flow systems - which automatically filter out contaminating gases - allow to attain or at least greatly approach primary isotopic signals. Some of the Chadian fossil enamel samples analysed in this work come from the very important Upper Miocene TM266 fossil locality that yielded Sahelanthropus tchadensis a.k.a. ""Toumaï"", the oldest member of the hominid clade known so far. At this site, as in others, a few or no other environmental proxies than isotopic analysis of biomaterials are available for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological reconstructions. Therefore, to obtain reliable environmental information from the time of this ancient Hominid, recovering uncontaminated biogenic isotopic signals is crucial and from these results it is now technically possible. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Landslides and avalanches have caused more than 2000 casualties and considerable damage to infrastructure over the last 150 years. The interdisciplinary research project ""GeoExtreme"" focuses on investigating the coupling between meteorological factors and landslides and avalanches, extrapolating this into the near future with a changing climate and estimating the socioeconomic implications. The main objective of the project is to predict future geohazard changes in a changing climate. A database consisting of more than 20 000 recorded historical events have been coupled with a meteorological database to assess the predictability of landslides and avalanches caused by meteorological conditions. Present day climate and near future climate scenarios are modelled with a global climate model on a stretched grid, focusing on extreme weather events in Norway. The effects of climate change on landslides and avalanche activity are studied in four selected areas covering the most important climatic regions in Norway. The statistical analysis of historical landslide and avalanche events versus weather observations shows strong regional differences in the country. Avalanches show the best correlation with weather events while landslides and rockfalls are less correlated. The new climate modelling approach applying spectral nudging to achieve a regional downscaling for Norway proves to reproduce extreme events of precipitation much better than conventional modelling approaches. Detailed studies of slope stabilities in one of the selected study area show a high sensitivity of slope stability in a changed precipitation regime. The value of elements at risk was estimated in one study area using a GIS based approach that includes an estimation of the values within given present state hazard zones. The ongoing project will apply the future climate scenarios to predict the changes in geohazard levels, as well as an evaluation of the resulting socioeconomic effects on the Norwegian society in the coming 50 years.",,"avalanche; climate change; climate modeling; database; GIS; hazard assessment; infrastructure; interdisciplinary approach; landslide; slope stability; socioeconomic impact; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949095475

The Review has compared climate change to experiences of suffering like World War I. That war, however, hardly affected global GDP. The long-term damages to be expected from business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions include loss of the coastal cities of the world over the next millennia.

The fuels could be produced domestically or imported from fossil fuel-rich countries. The goal of this paper is to determine the life-cycle GHG emissions of coal- and natural gas-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) liquids, as well as to compare production costs. The results show that the use of coal- or natural gas-based FT liquids will likely lead to significant increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum-based fuels. In a best-case scenario, coal- or natural gas-based FT-liquids have emissions only comparable to petroleum-based fuels. In addition, the economic advantages of gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuels are not obvious: there is a narrow range of petroleum and natural gas prices at which GTL fuels would be competitive with petroleum-based fuels.

In case of the large amount of CB compared to the amount of catalyst (3/1, w/w) in the mixture sample, insufficient oxygen at the point of sudden increase in the amount of CO2 is leaded to the partial oxidation using the lattice oxygen of the catalyst. And the peaks of CO2 after the first peak were attributed to the regional combustion of the CB, which was not in contact with catalyst particles.

Alternative fuels such as biodiesel, ethanol etc. have been quite promising for fulfilling both these aspects. While biodiesel reduces emissions of CO, life cycle CO2, SOx, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and particulate matter (PM) significantly, the propensity for the production of NOx is an important problem that requires extensive research. NOx emission from a direct-injection diesel engine is mainly due to formation of thermal NO that is described by Zeldovich mechanism. Thus, studying temperature profile during biodiesel combustion can provide useful insights to the formation and destruction of NOx. The main objective of this work is to investigate the effect of component methyl esters of biodiesel on open air flame temperature distribution and the effect of blending biodiesel with diesel and oxygenates (ethanol and methyl acetate) on open air flames. This objective was achieved by obtaining thermocouple measurements and thermal infrared imaging of local flame temperatures of wick-generated open air flames. A relationship between blend proportions and relative flame temperatures were obtained. In general, it was found that blending oxygenates such as ethanol and methyl acetate into petroleum diesel tended to increase the flame temperature in comparison with straight diesel fuel. The analyses of relative flame temperatures of different components of biodiesel were performed to evaluate the effect of unsaturation level and the hydrocarbon chain length on the flame temperature. It was found that the saturated methyl esters resulted in greater flame temperatures in comparison to unsaturated methyl esters. It was also revealed that shorter chained fatty acid methyl esters lead to higher flame temperatures as compared to its longer chained counterparts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This pollution forms a background that can limit efforts to reduce air pollution in cities. Its concentrations are difficult to quantify, however, even with transport models. This paper describes a novel technique for quantifying regional aerosol solely from a series of fast-response measurements of total aerosol at a single point within a city. It uses Beijing as an example and utilizes the strong asymmetric ""sawtooth cycles"" of aerosol there, which contain a smoothly increasing baseline, dominated by secondary inorganic aerosol, with daily cycles superimposed. The sawtooths have average durations of 5 days and are controlled by synoptic cycles, specifically the passage of cold fronts. During a sawtooth, the concentration of aerosol increases rapidly while back trajectories rotate from the northwest to the west and south, the air becomes more humid, and the particle size of the aerosol decreases. Ancillary measurements around Beijing show that the baselines represent regional aerosol, while the daily peaks represent local aerosol. For Beijing, the regional component averages about 50% and can range from 10%-20% during northwesterly flow to 70% or so during southerly flow. A preliminary error analysis shows that the uncertainties of the concentrations of regional aerosol can be up to 50% for a single day but <10% when totaled over a sawtooth. This technique should be applicable to a wide range of locales because sawtooths have also been observed in other places in northeast China and over much of eastern North America. Sawtooths should be a general feature of populated midlatitude areas crossed regularly by the polar front. They are also seen for trace gases and should yield analogous local and regional components.

In order to identify some of the important factors that might drive natural gas consumption in key demand areas in China, we focus on three regions: Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai. Using the economic optimization model MARKAL, we initially assume that the drivers are government mandates of emissions standards, reform of the Chinese financial structure, the price and available supply of natural gas, and the rate of penetration of advanced power generating and end-use. The results from the model show that the level of natural gas consumption is most sensitive to policy scenarios, which strictly limit SO2 emissions from power plants. The model also revealed that the low cost of capital for power plants in China boosts the economic viability of capital-intensive coal-fired plants. This suggests that reform within the financial sector could be a lever for encouraging increased natural gas use. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Strong correspondence between the paleovegetation and the MS profile suggests that both records can be used to reconstruct past climatic conditions. The coldest conditions in this area occurred at the end of the late Pleistocene during the Pinedale glaciation and the Younger Dryas chron. A general warming trend took place during the early Holocene, lasting until ∼5.6 ka, when the warmest conditions occurred. A progressive climate cooling is then observed until today. Millennial- and centennial-scale changes are also observed throughout the vegetation and MS records. The higher amplitude millennial-scale cold events appear to correlate with the timing and duration of episodes of enhanced sea-ice drift in the North Atlantic and the lower amplitude centennial-scale cold events may correlate with periods of lower solar activity. A solar-climate connection is suggested from these records by a prominent ca 200-yr cycle in tree pollen abundance, which may correlate with the 208 yr Suess solar cycle. This study shows an immediate response of the vegetation (treeline) to climate change at millennial- and centennial-scales, probably related to variations in summer insolation and solar activity during the late Pleistocene and Holocene.

Lake eutrophication has been showing a rapidly increasing trend since 2000. Investigations show that the main reasons for lake eutrophication include a fragile lake background environment, excessive nutrient loading into lakes, excessive human activities, ecological degeneration, weak environmental protection awareness, and lax lake management. Major mechanisms resulting from lake eutrophication include nutrient recycling imbalance, major changes in water chemistry (pH, oxygen, and carbon), lake ecosystem imbalance, and algal prevalence in lakes. Some concepts for controlling eutrophication should be persistently proposed, including lake catchment control, combination of pollutant source control with ecological restoration, protection of three important aspects (terrestrial ecology, lake coast zone, and submerged plant), and combination of lake management with regulation. Measures to control lake eutrophication should include pollution source control (i.e., optimize industrial structural adjustments in the lake catchment, reduce nitrogen and phosphorus emission amounts, and control endogenous pollution) and lake ecological restoration (i.e. establish a zone-lake buffer region and lakeside zone, protect regional vegetation, utilize hydrophytes in renovation technology); countermeasures for lake management should include implementing water quality management, identifying environmental and lake water goals, legislating and formulating laws and regulations to protect lakes, strengthening publicity and the education of people, increasing public awareness through participation in systems and mechanic innovations, establishing lake region management institutions, and ensuring implementation of governance and management measures. © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag.","China; Concept and countermeasures; Control; Eutrophication; Lake","algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49149132067

This paper proposes a method for optimizing regional hydrogen infrastructure deployment by combining detailed spatial data in a geographic information system (GIS) with a technoeconomic model of hydrogen infrastructure components. The method is applied to a case study in Ohio in which coal-based hydrogen infrastructure with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is modeled for two distribution modes at several steady-state hydrogen vehicle market penetration levels. The paper identifies the optimal infrastructure design at each market penetration as well as the costs, CO2 emissions, and energy use associated with each infrastructure pathway. The results indicate that aggregating infrastructure at the regional-scale yields lower levelized costs of hydrogen than at the city-level at a given market penetration level, and centralized production with pipeline distribution is the favored pathway even at low market penetration. Based upon the hydrogen infrastructure designs evaluated in this paper, coal-based hydrogen production with CCS can significantly reduce transportation-related CO2 emissions at a relatively low infrastructure cost and levelized fuel cost. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Carbon capture and storage; Coal; Geographic Information Systems; Infrastructure; Pipeline; Truck","Automobile parts and equipment; Coal; Coal storage; Geographic information systems; Hydrogen; Insulating materials; Nonmetals; Raw materials; Carbon capture and storage; Infrastructure; Pipeline; Truck; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53449086171

To assess the potential response of alpine plant communities to climate change, we analyzed specific and combined effects of temperature, precipitation, and snow season timing on the growth of plants. This analysis is based on data from 17 snow meteorological stations and includes plant growth records from the same sites over 10 years. Using multiple regression and path analysis, we found that plant growth was primarily driven by climatic factors controlled by the timing of the snow season. Air temperature and precipitation before snow-up and after melt-out yielded the greatest direct impact on maximum plant height as well as growth rates. The variability of environmental drivers between sites versus between years had different effects on plant growth: e.g., sites with early melt-out dates hosted plant communities with tall, slow-growing vegetation. But interannual variations in melt-out dates at a given site did not produce measurable differences in plant growth performance. However, high temperatures after melt-out invariably resulted in a shortened growth period. We speculate that the plant growth patterns we observed in response to climate variation between sites are indicative of the long-term responses of alpine plant communities to persistent climate changes. With most climate models indicating shorter winters, we thus expect alpine grasslands in the Alps to display an enhanced biomass production in the future.

Despite its intrinsic complexity, understanding the rhizosphere is vital if we are to solve some of the world's most impending environmental crises such as sustainable food, fibre and energy production, preservation of water resources and biodiversity, and mitigation against climate change. One of the key challenges that faces rhizosphere ecologists is how to translate their fundamental research into practical real-world applications. In addition, they need to convince policy makers that consideration of the rhizosphere is vital in the formulation and implementation of any environmental policy relating to plant growth. This is highlighted by the recent biofuel and carbon debt debate whereby rhizosphere processes such as priming were largely ignored leading to destabilization of national policies. Recent advances in our understanding of the tangled web of rhizosphere interactions have been largely driven by technological innovations in analytical, bioinformatic and imaging tools, and this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. However, there is also a critical need to incorporate this more reductionist information into mathematical models that are capable of incorporating the rhizosphere to allow simulation of plot- or landscape-level processes that are particularly relevant to policymakers. Consequently, as the multidisciplinary rhizosphere science community grows, there will be increasing need to both integrate scientific information and to subsequently convey this in an effective manner to stakeholders. If we can achieve this we will be in a good position to help prevent ongoing global environmental degeneration. These issues were addressed at the RHIZOSPHERE 2 International Conference which was held at Montpellier, France in August 2007.

Increases in CO2 pressure and reductions in the pH of muscle influence muscle contractile properties and muscle metabolism (via effects on rate-limiting enzymes), and contribute to limiting symptoms. The approach of Barcroft exemplified the importance of integrative physiology, in describing the adaptive responses of the circulatory and respiratory systems to the demands of CO2 production during exercise. The extent to which failure in the response of one system may be countered by adaptation in another is also explained by this approach. A key factor in these linked systems is the transport of CO2 in the circulation. CO2 is mainly (90%) transported as bicarbonate ions - as such, transport of CO2 is critically related to acid-base homeostasis. Understanding in this field has been facilitated by the approach of Peter Stewart. Rooted in classical physico-chemical relationships, the approach identifies the independent variables contributing to homeostasis - the strong ion difference ([SID]), ionization of weak acids (buffers, Atot) and CO2 pressure (PCO2). The independent variables may be reliably measured or estimated in muscle, plasma, and whole blood. Equilibrium conditions are calculated to derive the dependent variables - the most important being the concentrations of bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. During heavy exercise, muscle [H+] can exceed 300 nEq·L-1 (pH 6.5), mainly due to a greatly elevated PCO2 and fall in [SID] as a result of increased lactate (La-) production. As blood flows through active muscle, [La-] increase in plasma is reduced by uptake of La- and Cl- by red blood cells, with a resultant increase in plasma [HCO3-]. Inactive muscle contributes to homeostasis through transfer of La- and Cl- into the muscle from both plasma and red blood cells; this results in a large increase in [HCO3-]. In the lungs, oxygenation of hemoglobin increases red blood cell [A-] aiding rapid conversion of HCO 3- into CO2 in red cells (containing carbonic anhydrase), with diffusion of CO2 into alveoli, but full equilibration of the CO2 system in plasma may not occur during the short pulmonary capillary circulation time in heavy exercise. The ionization state of imidazole groups on protein histidine may provide integration between acid-base homeostasis, membrane anion transfer proteins, and activation of rate-limiting enzymes. © 2008 NRC.","Alphastat hypothesis; Bicarbonate; Enzyme regulation; Erythrocytes; Exercise; Homeostasis; Lactic acidosis; Plasma; Stewart approach","carbon dioxide; acid base balance; adaptation; blood; blood gas analysis; disorders of acid base balance; exercise; homeostasis; human; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; respiratory acidosis; review; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Acid-Base Imbalance; Acidosis, Respiratory; Adaptation, Physiological; Blood Gas Analysis; Carbon Dioxide; Exercise; Homeostasis; Humans",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48649086890

The results indicate that the stocks of APEO, PBDE and CP all are approximately 200-250 tonnes, whereas the DEHP stock is two orders of magnitude larger. Emissions can be linked to imported consumer goods such as electronics (PBDE) and textiles (APEO), and to construction materials (DEHP, CP). For several of the substances considerable amounts remain in the technosphere for a long time, even after use of the substance in new products has been eliminated. For example, the use of DEHP as plasticizer for PVC plastics in cables and floorings has more or less been phased-out, but still these applications make up a stock of some 20,000 tonnes (85% of the total DEHP stock in Stockholm) and emit 28 tonnes of DEHP annually (93% of overall emissions). Likewise, the use of chlorinated paraffins in sealants has been radically reduced, but there are 170 tonnes of CP in sealants in Stockholm making up 75% of the stock, and causing half of the emissions to water and air. These emissions are likely to continue for decades, and the stocks therefore have to be considered when analysing and managing the impact of urban substance flows on the environment. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chlorinated paraffins; DEHP; Emissions; Inflow; Nonylphenol; Octylphenol; PBDE; SFA; Stock","emission inventory; environmental impact assessment; flow modeling; inflow; organic pollutant; PBDE; phenolic compound; plastic; pollutant source; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149122440

Energy Policy, submitted for publication], where a systematic approach is proposed for investigating the potential for profitable excess heat cooperation. The trade-off is analyzed by economic optimization of an energy system model consisting of a pulp mill and an energy company (ECO). In the model, investments can be made, which increase the system's energy efficiency by utilization of the mill's excess heat, as well as investments that increase the electricity production. The results show that the trade-off depends on energy market prices, the district heating demand and the type of existing heat production. From an economic point of view, external use of the excess heat is preferred for all investigated energy market scenarios if the mill is studied together with an ECO with a small heat load. For the cases with medium or large district heating loads, the optimal use of excess heat varies with the energy market price scenarios. However, from a CO2 emissions perspective, external use is preferred, giving the largest reduction of global emissions in most cases. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Annual and monthly reported dengue cases were compared with precipitation and temperature data. Results show that the incidence of dengue in Puerto Rico was relatively constant over time despite global warming, possibly due to the offsetting effects of declining rainfall, improving health care and little change in population. Seasonal fluctuations of dengue were driven by rainfall increases from May to November. Year-to-year variability in dengue cases was positively related to temperature, but only weakly associated with local rainfall and an index of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Climatic conditions were mapped with respect to dengue cases and patterns in high and low years were compared. During epidemics, a low pressure system east of Florida draws warm humid air over the northwestern Caribbean. Long-term trends in past observed and future projected rainfall and temperatures were studied. Rainfall has declined slowly, but temperatures in the Caribbean are rising with the influence of global warming. Thus, dengue may increase in the future, and it will be necessary to anticipate dengue epidemics using climate forecasts, to reduce adverse health impacts. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Caribbean; Climate influence; Dengue; Epidemics","rain; annual variation; climate conditions; climate effect; climate variation; comparative study; dengue fever; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; epidemic; precipitation (climatology); precipitation intensity; air; article; Central America; climate change; dengue; El Nino; environmental change; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; health care; incidence; population and population related phenomena; precipitation; Puerto Rico; seasonal variation; United States; Animals; Climate; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Insect Vectors; Puerto Rico; Rain; Seasons; Time Factors; Weather; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Florida [United States]; Greater Antilles; North America; Puerto Rico; United States; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52949152883

High correlation coefficients (R2&gt;0.88) were obtained between the measurements of the BC mass concentrations made using the different instruments. From the range of the slopes of the linear least-square fittings, we concluded that BC concentrations regionally-representative of the area were measured in a range with a maximum-to-minimum ratio of 1.5 (an exception was that the BC (PM2.5) concentrations derived from MAAP were ∼2 times higher than the optical measurements (PM2.5) derived from the ECOC analyzer). While this range is significant, it is still sufficiently narrow to better constrain the large and highly uncertain emission rate of BC from Central East China. In detail, two optical instruments (the MAAP and the PSAP equipped with a heated inlet 400°C) tended to give higher concentrations than the thermal EC concentrations observed by the ECOC analyzer. The ratios of optical BC to thermal EC showed a positive correlation with the OC/EC ratio reported by the ECOC analyzer, suggesting two explanations. One is that the optical instruments overestimated BC concentrations in spite of careful cancellation of the scattering effect in the MAAP instrument and the expected evaporation of volatile species by heating the inlet of the PSAP instrument. The other is that the determined split points between OC and EC were too late when a large amount of OC underwent charring during the analysis, resulting in an underestimation of EC by the ECOC analyzer. High ratios of optical BC to thermal EC were recorded when the NOx/NOy ratio was low, implying the coating of the particles became thicker in an aged air mass and thus resulted in the optical instruments overestimating BC concentrations because of the lensing effect.",,"absorption; black carbon; concentration (composition); correlation; emission; optical instrument; photometer; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849154942

In this study we continue this investigation and begin to define the significance of this interaction for the regulation of stress-induced transcription. Methods: Immunoprecipitations (IPs), western blot (WB) analysis, GST pull-down assays and promoter reporter assays were used to investigate whether the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) can regulate transcription that is dependent on the activation domain 1 (AD1) domain of BRCA1. Results: We show that AhR, a transcription factor, can bind specifically to AD1 in the C-terminal region of BRCA1 and affect BRCA1's ability to regulate transcription activity. We found that xenobiotics that positively and negatively affect AhR's activity as a transcription factor (e.g., dioxin and α-naphthoflavone, respectively), have similar effects on AhR's ability to affect AD1-domain-dependent transcription. These physical and functional AhR-AD1 interactions may require the coiled-coil motif in AD1 because point-mutations in this motif reduce these interactions. Conclusion: Xenobiotic-activated AhR can function in two ways, as a component of the AhR/ARNT transcription factor and a regulator of AD1-dependent transcription. Consequently, BRCA1 has two distinct mechanisms for sensing xenobiotics and regulating AhR-dependent stress responses to these xenobiotics. We speculate that the normal functioning of this interaction could play a role in BRCA1's tumor suppressing ability. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","AD1; AhR; BRCA1; JunB; Transcription regulation; Xenobiotic stress","activation domain 1; alpha naphthoflavone; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; BRCA1 protein; dioxin; glutathione transferase; hypoxia inducible factor 1beta; unclassified drug; xenobiotic agent; article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer risk; carboxy terminal sequence; complex formation; controlled study; enzyme assay; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; point mutation; priority journal; protein binding; protein domain; protein function; protein induction; protein motif; protein protein interaction; transcription regulation; upregulation; Western blotting; xenobiotic stress; Benzoflavones; Binding, Competitive; BRCA1 Protein; Cell Line, Tumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Reporter; Humans; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849124765

These magnetic criteria strongly suggest that, in contrast to the well-known aromaticity of the So state of benzene, the T1 and S1 states of this molecule are antiaromatic. In square cyclobutadiene, which is shown to be considerably more antiaromatic than rectangular cyclobutadiene, the magnetic properties of the T1 and S1 states allow these to be classified as aromatic. According to the computed magnetic criteria, the T1 state of rectangular cyclobutadiene is still aromatic, but the S1 state is antiaromatic, just as the S2 state of square cyclobutadiene; the S2 state of rectangular cyclobutadiene is nonaromatic. The results demonstrate that the well-known ""triplet aromaticity"" of cyclic conjugated hydrocarbons represents a particular case of a broader concept of excited-state aromaticity and antiaromaticity. It is shown that while electronic excitation may lead to increased nuclear shieldings in certain low-lying electronic states, in general its main effect can be expected to be nuclear deshielding, which can be substantial for heavier nuclei. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Butadiene; Antiaromaticity; Aromaticity; Cyclobutadiene; Excited states; Ground-state; Benzene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49749109549

Major constraints for grassland restoration are high soil fertility and limited dispersal ability of plant species to target sites. Usually, studies focus on soil fertility or on methods to introduce plant seeds. However, the question is whether soil fertility reduction is always necessary for getting plant species established on target sites. In a three-year field experiment with ex-arable soil with intensive farming history, we tested single and combined effects of soil fertility reduction and sowing mid-successional plant species on plant community development and soil biological properties. A controlled microcosm study was performed to test short-term effects of soil fertility reduction measures on biomass production of mid-successional species. Soil fertility was manipulated by adding carbon (wood or straw) to incorporate plant-available nutrients into organic matter, or by removing nutrients through top soil removal (TSR). The sown species established successfully and their establishment was independent of carbon amendments. TSR reduced plant biomass, and effectively suppressed arable weeds, however, created a desert-like environment, inhibiting the effectiveness of sowing mid-successional plant species. Adding straw or wood resulted in short-term reduction of plant biomass, suggesting a temporal decrease in plant-available nutrients by microbial immobilisation. Straw and wood addition had little effects on soil biological properties, whereas TSR profoundly reduced numbers of bacteria, fungal biomass and nematode abundance. In conclusion, in ex-arable soils, on a short-term sowing is more effective for grassland restoration than strategies aiming at soil fertility reduction.","Biomass production; Carbon addition; Land use change; Microbial community; Nematodes; Propagule availability; Secondary succession; Top soil removal; Vegetation composition","biodiversity; biomass; carbon; field method; grassland; habitat restoration; immobilization; land use change; microbial community; microcosm; nematode; secondary succession; seed dispersal; soil fertility; Bacteria (microorganisms); Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249117817

A liquid phase appears at 940°C owing to the melting of the NiWO4-Na2WO 4 eutectic regions which are perhaps results of segregation of sodium impurities included in the reagents used. The presence of the liquid phase ensures for both Ni and W the comparable rates of allocation from the nickel tungstate crystal lattice leading to the formation of the α-W + NiW two-phase regions. The oriented growth of tungsten whiskers during the further reduction of the melt tungstate zones is associated with the W accumulation on the growth surfaces of the W single crystals in the two-phase regions.

Such events create significant public health needs that can exceed local capacity to respond, resulting in excess morbidity or mortality and in the declaration of disasters. Human vulnerability to any disaster is a complex phenomenon with social, economic, health, and cultural dimensions. Vulnerability to natural disasters has two sides: the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards (susceptibility) and the capacity to cope with or recover from disaster consequences (resilience). Vulnerability reduction programs reduce susceptibility and increase resilience. Susceptibility to disasters is reduced largely by prevention and mitigation of emergencies. Emergency preparedness and response and recovery activities-including those that address climate change-increase disaster resilience. Because adaptation must occur at the community level, local public health agencies are uniquely placed to build human resilience to climate-related disasters. This article discusses the role of public health in reducing human vulnerability to climate change within the context of select examples for emergency preparedness and response.",,"behavior change; climate change; disaster planning; evolutionary adaptation; global climate; health hazard; public health; public health problem; public health service; review; Cyclones; Disaster Planning; Disasters; Droughts; Fires; Floods; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Landslides; Public Health; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Management; Weather",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249107627

Stable isotope analyses of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen demonstrate both biological and abiological factors to control travertine deposition. Processes of morphology-related outgassing had major effects upon isotopic composition. Continuous CO2 degassing and temperature change of the thermal water between the spring orifice and distal parts of the system, caused stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of the precipitating travertines to increase (from + 2.7 to + 4.3‰ relative to V-PDB and from + 10.5 to + 14.7‰ relative to V-SMOW, respectively). The travertines at the spring orifice (T ∼ 67 °C) are composed of almost pure calcite with a δ13C value of + 2.7‰ (relative to V-PDB) enabling classification as intermediate between thermometeogene and thermogene. In lower temperature water, away from the spring orifice, various amounts of aragonite (5-35%) with higher Sr concentrations precipitate from solution. This phenomenon is exceptional in hot spring carbonate deposits and could be explained by fast carbonate precipitation due to the morphology-related outgassing. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope measurements of the thermal water confirmed evaporation to be causing limited kinetic isotope fractionation. However, δ18O values of the travertine do show isotope shifts away from the equilibrium fractionation curve, which is most probably related to the rapid calcite precipitation and transportation along the flow path. Our data closely follow the temperature-Δ18Ocalcite-water relationship observed for other travertine localities. This is slightly displaced from the experimental curve and determines an empirical 'travertine curve'. Our study shows that this shift may result in an approximately 8 °C difference in paleotemperature calculations depending upon which fractionation curve is used. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the extent to which the natural variability of the climate affects one's ability to project the anthropogenically forced component of change in daily precipitation extremes across Europe is examined. A three-member ensemble of the Hadley Centre Regional Climate Model (HadRM3H) is used and a statistical framework is applied to estimate the uncertainty due to the full spectrum of climate variability. In particular, the results and understanding presented here suggest that annual to multidecadal natural variability may contribute significant uncertainty. For this ensemble projection, extreme precipitation changes at the grid-box level are found to be discernible above climate noise over much of northern and central Europe in winter, and parts of northern and southern Europe in summer. The ability to quantify the change to a reasonable level of accuracy is largely limited to regions in northern Europe. In general, where climate noise has a significant component varying on decadal time scales, single 30-yr climate change projections are insufficient to infer changes in the extreme tail of the underlying precipitation distribution. In this context, the need for ensembles of integrations is demonstrated and the relative effectiveness of spatial pooling and averaging for generating robust signals of extreme precipitation change is also explored. The key conclusions are expected to apply more generally to other models and forcing scenarios. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate control; Climatology; Public policy; Uncertainty analysis; Central europe; Climate-variability; Decadal time scales; Extreme precipitation; Forced component; Full-spectrum; Grid-box; Natural variability; Policy decisions; Precipitation distribution; Precipitation extremes; Regional climate model; Relative effectiveness; Robust signals; Southern Europe; Statistical framework; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; ensemble forecasting; mitigation; precipitation assessment; statistical analysis; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53649084225

The xenobiotics present in the wastewater were identified using gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy and the efficacy of their removal by membrane ultrafiltration and activated carbon filtration were determined. At various time points post-exposure to wastewater or reuse water the following biological parameters were assessed: vitellogenin (Vtg) induction, immune gene expression, and mitogen-induced proliferation of blood leukocytes. Membrane ultrafiltration alone did not remove xenobiotics from FE wastewater, while activated carbon filtration efficiently reduced the levels of most xenobiotics. Vitellogenin was induced in fish exposed to both FE wastewater and MF reuse water, but not in fish exposed to MCF reuse water. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of select immune genes (tumor necrosis factor alpha, colony stimulating factor receptor-1) were up-regulated in FE and MF exposed fish on days 7 and 21 post exposure, while Toll-like receptor 22 mRNA level was similar in fish exposed to wastewater or control water.

The plant, in the model, is divided into two compartments, the plant body (shoot and root) and ears, to predict the radioactivity of different parts of a plant. The carbon transports from, to and between the compartments are described by the processes of a photosynthesis, respiration, and translocation. The carbon transport fluxes of these processes are determined from the growth rates of a plant, which are usually easily attained. The model predictions showed that the present model could converge to a region where the specific activity model is applicable when the elapsed exposure time was extended up to the harvest time of a plant. The 14C activity of a plant was greatly affected by the elapsed exposure time, the developmental stages of a plant at an exposure time, and the airborne 14C activity during an exposure. It was expected that the peak of the ears' 14C activity appeared when the exposure time was close to the ears-maturity date. The model predictions agreed reasonably well with the measured 14C radioactivity of the rice plants that were artificially exposed to 14CO2 of a high 14C source for a short period of time in an exposure box. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The region has a subtropical climate which allows two crops of rice to be grown every year. The prevailing agricultural practices create a complex interaction between factors known to have a major effect on methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice fields, namely, intermittent flooding and use of organic fertilizers. In this region, the farmers depend on nitrogen fertilizers and, at least in recent years, have only intermittently flooded their fields during the growing seasons. These factors tend to reduce methane emissions. But the rice straw and crop residues from the first crop of the year are plowed into the fields, providing a large addition of organic material under hot weather conditions favorable to quick decomposition during the second crop period. This, and the addition of farmyard manure, increases emissions of methane emissions from these fields. The results of the present study show that the effect of these competing factors and their timing lead to an average rate of emissions of 5 ± 2 and 6 ± 2 mg/m2/h from the first crops for the 2 years when measurements were taken (2003 and 2004), and 12 ± 8 and 13 ± 8 mg/m2/h from the second crop. Further, production measurements showed that during the 2 years of these experiments, the average production rates were about 27 mg/m2/h for the first crop and 22-34 mg/m2/h for the second crop, resulting in estimated oxidation rates of about 80% for the first crop and 50-60% for the second crop. The higher fluxes in the second crop therefore appear to be caused more by reduced oxidation than higher production. Nitrous oxide emissions, when they were detected, usually occurred within a few days after the application of nitrogen fertilizers. The seasonally averaged emissions were between 0.01 and 0.02 mg/m2/h except in the first year when large emissions over one short period pushed the average upward.

The propagation protocol utilized calli tissues that were successfully initiated from protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) explants, while the leaf and root tip explants died. The percentage of protocorm-like bodies explants responding to calli formation was 100% in all tested levels of IAA, IBA and NAA auxin treatments. The highest amount of calli (49.59 gram) proliferated on MS medium containing 1.5 mg/L IBA. These calli successfully regenerated on media supplemented with either KIN or BAP cytokinins and combined treatments of KIN and IAA (4 mg/L) or NAA (1.5 mg/L). However, media supplemented with only 1 mg/L KIN was sufficient to produce significantly high percentage of plantlet formation (80%), high number of planlets per explant (4-5 plantlets) and high mean fresh weight per plantlet (11.128 g). These plantlets were acclimatized on all tested media and obtained satisfactory rate of plantlet survival (80-100%), mean number of leaves per plant (4-6 leaves), and mean leaf length (4 - 5 cm). Among these media, charcoal was considered the most economical and available material in the local market. During the development of this protocol, substantial necrosis of calli were observed when cultures were treated with 2,4-D and BAP. It was proposed that the presence of ethylene within the cultures, which is known to be emitted by plant growth regulators into the micro-climate of in vitro culture vessels, is the determining factor of a suitable plant growth regulator for the survival and growth of the Dendrobium Serdang Beauty calli cultures in our study. © 2008 Academic Journals.","Auxin; Callus; Cytokinin; Orchid; Plbs regeneration","2,4 dicolophenoxyactic acid; 6 fururylaminopurine; acetic acid derivative; alpha naphthalenacetic acid; auxin; cytokinin; indoe 3 butyric acid; indoleacetic acid; n6 benzylaminopurine; purine derivative; unclassified drug; article; callus culture; controlled study; Dendrobium; microclimate; nonhuman; Orchidaceae; plant growth; plant leaf; plant regeneration; protocorm like body; survival; Dendrobium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57149109594

Box 3000, Boulder, CO 80307, United States","A multimode, two-moment aerosol model has been incorporated in the NCAR CAM3 to develop an interactive aerosol-climate model and to study the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on the global climate system. Currently, seven aerosol modes, namely three for external sulfate and one each for external black carbon (BC), external organic carbon (OC), sulfate/BC mixture (MBS; with BC core coated by sulfate shell), and sulfate/OC mixture (MOS; a uniform mixture of OC and sulfate) are included in the model. Both mass and number concentrations of each aerosol mode, as well as the mass of carbonaceous species in the mixed modes, are predicted by the model so that the chemical, physical, and radiative processes of various aerosols can be formulated depending on aerosol's size, chemical composition, and mixing state. Comparisons of modeled surface and vertical aerosol concentrations, as well as the optical depth of aerosols with available observations and previous model estimates, are in general agreement. However, some discrepancies do exist, likely caused by the coarse model resolution or the constant rates of anthropogenic emissions used to test the model. Comparing to the widely used mass-only method with prescribed geometric size of particles (one-moment scheme), the use of prognostic size distributions of aerosols based on a two-moment scheme in our model leads to a significant reduction in optical depth and thus the radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) of particularly external sulfate aerosols. The inclusion of two types of mixed aerosols alters the mass partitioning of carbonaceous and sulfate aerosol constituents: about 35.5%, 48.5%, and 32.2% of BC, OC, and sulfate mass, respectively, are found in the mixed aerosols. This also brings in competing effects in aerosol radiative forcing including a reduction in atmospheric abundance of BC and OC due to the shorter lifetime of internal mixtures (cooling), a mass loss of external sulfate to mixtures (warming), and an enhancement in atmospheric heating per BC mass due to the stronger absorption extinction of the MBS than external BC (warming). The combined result of including a prognostic size distribution and the mixed aerosols in the model is a much smaller total negative TOA forcing (-0.12 W m-2) of all carbonaceous and sulfate aerosol compounds compared to the cases using one-moment 2 scheme either excluding or including internal mixtures (-0.42 and -0.71 W m-2, respectively). In addition, the global mean all-sky TOA direct forcing of aerosols is significantly more positive than the clear-sky value due to the existence of low clouds beneath the absorbing (external BC and MBS) aerosol layer, particularly over a dark surface. An emission reduction of about 44% for BC and 38% of primary OC is found to effectively change the TOA radiative forcing of the entire aerosol family by -0.14 W m-2 for clear-sky and -0.29 W m-2 for all-sky.

Electrons transferred from NADPH via cytosolic flavoprotein oxidoreductases are used to cleave the cobalt-carbon bond with reductive elimination of the cyanide ligand. The product, cob(II)alamin, is a known substrate for assimilation into the active cofactor forms, methylcobalamin and 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, and is bound in the ""base-off"" state that is needed by the two B12-dependent target enzymes, methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Defects in MMACHC represent the most common cause of inborn errors of B12 metabolism, and our results explain the observation that fibroblasts from these patients are poorly responsive to vitamin B12 but show some metabolic correction with aquocobalamin, a cofactor form lacking the cyanide ligand, which is mirrored by patients showing poorer clinical responsiveness to cyano- versus aquocobalamin. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Cobalamin; Cyanide; Flavin oxidoreductase; Homocystinuria; Methylmalonic aciduria","chaperone; cobalamin; cobamamide; cyanide; cyanocobalamin; flavoprotein; protein methylmalonic aciduria; unclassified drug; carrier protein; cob(II)alamin; drug derivative; ferredoxin nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reductase; methionine synthase reductase; MMACHC protein, human; oxidoreductase; recombinant protein; absorption spectroscopy; article; catalysis; controlled study; electron; human; methylmalonic aciduria; priority journal; protein structure; stoichiometry; ultraviolet radiation; chemistry; cytosol; enzymology; metabolism; protein binding; protein transport; Carrier Proteins; Catalysis; Cobamides; Cytosol; Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase; Humans; Molecular Chaperones; Oxidoreductases; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Recombinant Proteins; Vitamin B 12",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55749101940

The generation of efficient yet highly controllable light can indeed be accomplished with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are, in principle, capable of generating white light with a 20 times greater efficiency than conventional light bulbs. Deployed on a global scale to replace conventional sources, such solid-state light sources will result in enormous benefits that, over a period of 10 years, include (1) gigantic energy savings of 1.9 × 1020 joule, (2) a very substantial reduction in global-warming CO2 emissions, (3) a strong reduction in the emission of pollutants such as acid-rain-causing SO2, mercury (Hg), and uranium (U), and (4) financial savings exceeding a trillion (1012) US$. These benefits can be accomplished by the ""replacement paradigm"" in which conventional light sources are replaced by more energy efficient, more durable, and non-toxic light sources. However, it will be shown that solid-state light sources can go beyond the replacement paradigm, by providing new capabilities including the control of spectrum, color temperature, polarization, temporal modulation, and spatial emission pattern. We will show that such future, ""smart"" light sources, can harness the huge potential of LEDs by offering multi-dimensional controllability that will enhance the functionality and performance of light sources in a wide range of applications.

In order to incorporate the Stockholm Convention, a particular stringent law was promulgated in Korea and in recent years incinerators were forced to utilize better technological control. After the enforcement of special dioxin emission regulation in 2003, the average concentration of dioxin emitted from municipal and industrial waste incinerators decreased from 15.25 and 12.86 ng TEQ Nm-3 to 5.53 and 4.96 ng TEQ Nm-3 in 2001 and 2004, respectively. Based on test results at commercial plants, several best arranged sets of air pollution control devices (APCDs) were suggested in order to provide guidelines to help operators. These sets included combinations of spray dry absorbers, bag type filters, wet scrubbers, selective catalytic reductions and electrostatic precipitators. Different suggestions and real installations of APCD arrangement were investigated during the years around the regulation in effective. The results were presented depending on the capacity of the incinerators and different waste streams to observe the efforts to reduce dioxin emission by operators of incineration plants. The annual amount of dioxin emission from the incinerators is expected to be 212.5 g-TEQ in 2011 and 234.3 g-TEQ in 2015, respectively, compared to 891.6 g-TEQ recorded in 2001. The enforcement of new regulation and the installation of better APCDs showed the significant effect on such reduction. This reduction in dioxin emission from incinerators confirmed the nation's commitment to the regulatory requirement set by the Stockholm Convention. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study involves designing a monitoring program that produces suitable data to determine the on-road hourly fleet emission and emission factors of individual vehicles in a street canyon. Simultaneous hourly monitoring of roadside gaseous pollutants (both windward and leeward sides), traffic volume and speed, and wind in a busy street of Bangkok was conducted in the rainy season when traffic emission was predominant in the city. Higher pollutant concentrations often occurred at midday (11:00 to 14:00h) when higher traffic density (3700-3800vehicles h- 1, weekdays) was observed. The levels of toluene and xylenes found in this study are higher than the roadside levels reported in other Asian cities. Hourly maximum concentrations reached 258ppb for toluene, 51ppb for m,p-xylenes, 15ppb for o-xylene, 526ppb for NOx, and 10.5ppm for CO. Hourly monitoring data during the periods when the street canyon effects were pronounced were selected for determination of the fleet hourly emission and vehicle emission factors by back calculation using a street canyon model (Operational Street Pollution Model). The average fleet hourly emission at daytime of NOx (6.2kg km- 1 h- 1), CO (54kg km- 1 h- 1), toluene (2.1kg km- 1 h- 1), m,p-xylenes (0.73kg km- 1 h- 1) and o-xylene (0.27kg km- 1 h- 1) did not vary much. However, the emission rates were substantially reduced at nighttime following the traffic pattern. The obtained pollutant emission factors varied within each group of vehicles with the average values agreed reasonably with the chassis dynamometer results for NOx but somewhat higher for CO and TX. The model estimated results are, however, considered to better represent the real driving conditions in the street at the average vehicle travel speed of around 20km h- 1.

Cradle-to-gate environmental performance of PHB derived from corn grain is evaluated through life cycle assessment (LCA), particularly nonrenewable energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Site-specific process information on the corn wet milling and PHB fermentation and recovery processes was obtained from Telles. Most of energy used in the corn wet milling and PHB fermentation and recovery processes is generated in a cogeneration power plant in which corn stover, assumed to be representative of a variety of biomass sources that could be used, is burned to generate electricity and steam. County level agricultural information is used in estimating the environmental burdens associated with both corn grain and corn stover production. Results show that PHB derived from corn grain offers environmental advantages over petroleum-derived polymers in terms of nonrenewable energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Ethanol is derived from corn grain via dry milling. This type of analysis is an important component for identifying practices that will help to ensure that a renewable fuel, such as ethanol, may be produced in a sustainable manner. Based on data from eight counties in seven Corn Belt states as corn farming sites, we show ethanol derived from corn grain as E10 fuel would reduce nonrenewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions, but would increase acidification, eutrophication and photochemical smog, compared to using gasoline as liquid fuel. The ethanol fuel systems considered in this study offer economic benefits, namely more money returned to society than the investment for producing ethanol. The environmental performance of ethanol fuel system varies significantly with corn farming sites because of different crop management practices, soil properties, and climatic conditions. The dominant factor determining most environmental impacts considered here (i.e., greenhouse gas emissions, acidification, eutrophication, and photochemical smog formation) is soil related nitrogen losses (e.g., N2O, NOx, and NO3-). The sources of soil nitrogen include nitrogen fertilizer, crop residues, and air deposition. Nitrogen fertilizer is probably the primary source. Simulations using an agro-ecosystem model predict that planting winter cover crops would reduce soil nitrogen losses and increase soil organic carbon levels, thereby greatly improving the environmental performance of the ethanol fuel system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

CA may thus play a role in the pathophysiology of normal nasal mucosa and nasal polyp. We evaluated the expression and pattern of distribution of mRNAs and proteins for CA isoenzymes in normal nasal mucosa and polyps. Study Design: This was a controlled, prospective study. Methods: The expression levels of 11 isoenzyme genes (I, II, III, IV, VA, VB, VI, VII, IX, XII, XIV) were evaluated in normal mucosa and polyps using semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The expression and pattern of distribution of CA I., II, and IX were also investigated using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Results: mRNAs for the 11 CA isoenzymes were detected in all normal nasal mucosa and polyps tested. Their expression levels were decreased in nasal polyp in comparison with normal nasal mucosa. CA I was detected in the epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and submucosal gland of normal nasal mucosa, but only in the endothelial cells in nasal polyp. CA II in normal mucosa was intensely expressed in the submucosal gland cells and CA IX was noted in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of epithelial cells and submucosal glands. However, these findings were not found in nasal polyp. Western blot also showed differences in their expression levels. Conclusions: These results indicate that CA may participate in the physiology of normal nasal mucosa, but also suggest that altered their expression in nasal polyps may cause impaired electrolyte and water transport across the epithelial cells. © 2008 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.","Carbonic anhydrase; Nasal mucosa; Nasal polyp","carbonate dehydratase; carbonate dehydratase I; carbonate dehydratase II; carbonate dehydratase III; carbonate dehydratase IV; carbonate dehydratase IX; carbonate dehydratase V; carbonate dehydratase va; carbonate dehydratase vb; carbonate dehydratase vi; carbonate dehydratase XII; carbonate dehydratase xiv; isoenzyme; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; carbonate dehydratase; isoenzyme; adult; article; cell membrane; clinical article; controlled study; cytoplasm; endothelium cell; enzyme regulation; epithelium cell; evaluation; female; human; immunohistochemistry; isoenzyme analysis; male; nose mucosa; nose polyp; priority journal; prospective study; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting; down regulation; enzymology; metabolism; middle aged; nose polyp; Adult; Carbonic Anhydrases; Down-Regulation; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Isoenzymes; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Mucosa; Nasal Polyps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53449097263

In light of this, the diesel engine has many advantages such as high thermal efficiency, a cheaper price of fuel, and what is more it has a low CO2 exhaustion level well known as the factor of 'Global Warming', therefore the use of diesel engines is getting increased. However in the case of diesel engine, NOx increases in the local high temperature region, and particulate matter increases in fuel rich regions. That is why, getting down the peak temperature to reduce NOx emission and making better air-fuel mixing to minimize particulate matter formation are required and Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is a technique which can make those conditions. In the HCCI engine, a largely premixed lean mixture is burned by compression ignition and in this way, it has the advantages of both thermal efficiency and emission reduction. However it also has got a limited operating region because of difficulties of reducing the droplet collision with the cylinder wall and controlling the ignition timing. The present study builds on the narrow spray cone angle concept and investigates its use in conjunction with early multiple injection to help reduce wall wetting and create a more homogeneous mixture. In addition many methods to control the ignition timing are now under study as well. For the reason, in this research, the effect of injection strategies on spray, mixture formation, the combustion and emission characteristics were verified with an HCCI engine and simulation for 100% diesel fuel first, and then diesel fuel blended with ethanol using the optimized injection conditions acquired from the earlier research was used to investigate the effects of mixed fuel on the ignition timing and engine efficiency.

The cermet was prepared by co-milling and sintering NiO and 5YSZ powders at 1375 °C in air. During the high-temperature sintering step, NiO dissolved into the YSZ particles to form a solid NiO-YSZ solution. During the subsequent catalyst reduction step, Ni exolved from the YSZ. As a result, many small Ni particles on the order of 10-20 nm formed at the surface of the YSZ. These small particles contributed significantly to the overall reforming activity, along with the large bulk Ni particles within the Ni-YSZ cermet. We observed high initial activity that decreased by as much as an order of magnitude with time on stream, until the anode catalyst reached a stable steady-state activity. The time to reach this stable activity was a function of the pretreatment and reaction conditions. Initial and lined-out activities and average turnover frequencies were obtained for both Ni-YSZ and bulk Ni, based on a rate expression that was first-order in methane and zero-order in steam. Comparative tests at 750 °C showed high initial activity on a per-Ni site basis with both materials, but these turnover rates declined over a period of a few hours. After lineout, there appeared to be a negligible effect of Ni particle size on turnover rate. These results indicate the presence of structure-sensitivity for methane reforming, but only with freshly calcined and reduced catalysts that may contain highly coordinatively unsaturated sites. There was an apparent structure-insensitivity with aged catalysts in which Ni particle sizes were generally ≥30 nm. Under reaction conditions with high space velocities and low methane conversions, the water-gas shift reaction did not establish thermodynamic equilibrium. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The operation in the nonlinear limit cycle has been tolerated on most applications to date. The need for a quieter and a smoother operation and in addition reduced emission levels have prompted new evaluations of the rotor bearing design for these systems. In this research, a commercial rotor-bearing dynamics computer program was used to evaluate the stability and transient response of a high-speed diesel engine turbocharger. Various models with varying bearing designs and properties were solved to obtain the linear stability threshold speeds and also the nonlinear transient response. The predicted whirl speed map shows two modes of instability and is very similar to recent on-engine test results conducted at Virginia Tech as part of a recent senior capstone design project.

We use two opposing future mitigation strategies for the year 2030: one in which emission reduction legislation decided in countries throughout the world are effectively implemented (current legislation; CLE 2030) and one in which all technical options for emission reductions are being implemented independent of their cost (maximum feasible reduction; MFR 2030). We consider the direct, semi-direct and indirect radiative effects of aerosols. The total anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing defined as the difference in the top-of-the-atmosphere radiation between 2000 and pre-industrial times amounts to &amp;minus;2.00 W/m2. In the future this negative global annual mean aerosol radiative forcing will only slightly change (+0.02 W/m2) under the ""current legislation"" scenario. Regionally, the effects are much larger: e.g. over Eastern Europe radiative forcing would increase by +1.50 W/m2 because of successful aerosol reduction policies, whereas over South Asia it would decrease by &amp;minus;1.10 W/m2 because of further growth of emissions. A ""maximum feasible reduction"" of aerosols and their precursors would lead to an increase of the global annual mean aerosol radiative forcing by +1.13 W/m2. Hence, in the latter case, the present day negative anthropogenic aerosol forcing could be more than halved by 2030 because of aerosol reduction policies and climate change thereafter will be to a larger extent be controlled by greenhouse gas emissions. We combined these two opposing future mitigation strategies for a number of experiments focusing on different sectors and regions. In addition, we performed sensitivity studies to estimate the importance of future changes in oxidant concentrations and the importance of the aerosol microphysical coupling within the range of expected future changes. For changes in oxidant concentrations caused by future air pollution mitigation, we do not find a significant effect for the global annual mean radiative aerosol forcing. In the extreme case of only abating SO2 or carbonaceous emissions to a maximum feasible extent, we find deviations from additivity for the radiative forcing over anthropogenic source regions up to 10% compared to an experiment abating both at the same time.",,"aerosol; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; emission control; greenhouse gas; mitigation; radiation budget; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449096164

The emission in each case is assigned to the decay of the Re'-based 3MLCT excited state; the lifetimes are all significantly less than the corresponding AlRe3 analogues (2250 ± 100 ns, 560 ± 30 ns, and 235 ± 20 ns for 4, 5, and 6, respectively), which were also prepared and characterized. Electron transfer is found to be thermodynamically unfavorable for all three ReI-containing systems: this fact coupled with the absence of optical signatures for the expected charge-separated photoproducts in the time-resolved differential absorption spectra and favorable spectral overlap between the donor emission and the acceptor absorption profiles implicates dipolar energy transfer from the ReI-based excited state to the high-spin FeIII core as the dominant quenching pathway in these compounds. Details obtained from the X-ray structural data of complex 2 allowed for a quantitative application of Förster energy transfer theory by systematically calculating the separation and spatial orientation of the donor and acceptor transition moment dipoles. Deviations between the calculated and observed rate constants for energy transfer were less that a factor of 3 for all three complexes. This uncommonly high degree of precision testifies to both the appropriateness of the Förster model as applied to these systems, as well as the accuracy that can be achieved in quantifying energy transfer rates if relative dipole orientations can be accounted for explicitly. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50449100166

The impact of drought and rewetting on carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems is thus currently debated. We studied the impact of experimental drought and rewetting on intact monoliths from a temperate fen over a period of ∼300 days, using a permanently wet treatment and two treatments undergoing drought for 50 days. In one of the mesocosms, vegetation had been removed. Net production of CH4 was calculated from mass balances in the peat and emission using static chamber measurements. Results were compared to 13C isotope budgets of CO2 and CH4 and energy yields of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Drought retarded methane production after rewetting for days to weeks and promoted methanotrophic activity. Based on isotope and flux budgets, aerobic soil respiration contributed 32ĝ€""96% in the wet treatment and 86ĝ€""99% in the other treatments. Drying and rewetting did not shift methanogenic pathways according to δ 13C ratios of CH4 and CO2. Although δ13C ratios indicated a prevalence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, free energies of this process were small and often positive on the horizon scale. This suggests that methane was produced very locally. Fresh plant-derived carbon input apparently supported respiration in the rhizosphere and sustained methanogenesis in the unsaturated zone, according to a 13C-CO2 labelling experiment. The study documents that drying and rewetting in a rich fen soil may have little effect on methanogenic pathways, but result in rapid shifts between methanogenesis and methanotrophy. Such shifts may be promoted by roots and soil heterogeneity, as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis occurred locally even when conditions were not conducive for this process in the bulk peat.",,"carbon cycle; carbon isotope; drought; experimental study; fen; flux measurement; isotopic composition; mass balance; methanogenesis; methanotrophy; peatland; rewetting; soil respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55049099358

Although the interactions between energy and environment were originally local in character, they have now widened to cover regional and global issues, such as acid rain and the greenhouse effect. It is for this reason that there is a need for covering the direct and indirect economic and environmental impacts of energy acquisition, transport, production and use. In this paper, particular attention is directed to ways of resolving conflict between economic and environmental goals by encouraging a power plant to consider co-firing biomass and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) with coal simultaneously. It aims at reducing the emission level of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in an uncertain environment, using the power plant in Michigan City, Indiana as an example. To assess the uncertainty by a comparative way both deterministic and grey nonlinear mixed integer programming (MIP) models were developed to minimize the net operating cost with respect to possible fuel combinations. It aims at generating the optimal portfolio of alternative fuels while maintaining the same electricity generation simultaneously. To ease the solution procedure stepwise relaxation algorithm was developed for solving the grey nonlinear MIP model. Breakeven alternative fuel value can be identified in the post-optimization stage for decision-making. Research findings show that the inclusion of RDF does not exhibit comparative advantage in terms of the net cost, albeit relatively lower air pollution impact. Yet it can be sustained by a charge system, subsidy program, or emission credit as the price of coal increases over time. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the 31 July-16 August 2005 study period, the biomass of Neocalanus cristatus and Neocalanus plumchrus predominated in the near surface waters, while Neocalanus flemingeri was already dormant at depth. We observed a strong diel migration for Metridia pacifica, and a seasonal downward migration for Eucalanus bungii. Based on gut pigment analysis, ingestion rate of the copepod community was 214-375 mg C m-2 day-1, which was equal to 26-37% of the concurrent primary production. However, comparison of grazing estimated from gut pigments to calculated carbon demand of the copepod community indicates that phytoplankton comprised 37-59% of the ingested carbon. Thus, the copepod community appears to have also relied on detritus and microzooplankton for their nutrition, likely because primary production during this time was dominated by picophytoplankton too small to be grazed by these large copepods. Fecal pellet flux by the copepod community was estimated to account for 141-223% of the sedimentary particulate organic carbon (POC) flux at 150 m, suggesting considerable fragmentation and consumption of pellets in the upper layers. Fecal pellets alone were adequate to meet copepod carbon demand in the surface 0-150 m layer. Active carbon flux by diel migration of M. pacifica (respiration, egestion, and mortality) was 4-17 mg C m-2 day-1, equal to 6-44% of sedimentary POC flux at 150 m. Active carbon flux by N. flemingeri ontogenetic migration (i.e., respiration and mortality at depth) contributed 246 mg C m-2 year-1, equal to 9% of sedimentary POC flux at 1000 m. The imminent downward migration of N. cristatus and N. plumchrus would lead to an additional ontogenetic carbon flux on the order of 1719 mg C m-2 year-1. Copepod fecal pellet transport and active transport by diel and ontogenetic migration are thus important carbon fluxes during a season dominated by small phytoplankton, and ontogenetic migrants in the subarctic Pacific Ocean play a relatively more important role in active carbon flux compared with other open-ocean regions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied the influence of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), plant green area index (GAI), soil temperature, and water-filled pore space (wfps) on the net CO2 emission at four alpine sites (one meadow and three fen sites) differing in water balance and plant community. Measurements over two years were made in the Eastern Alps, Austria, including two snow-free periods and two snow periods. During snow-free periods, net CO2 gain during daylight periods (NEElight, PAR &gt; 0) depended on PAR and GAI. The net CO2 emission rate at night (Rtot PAR = 0) was positively related to soil temperature, while low wfps reduced the carbon loss via Rtot of the meadow and driest fen study site but reinforced carbon loss of the wetter fen sites. Daily average ecosystem net C02 gain (NEEday) during snow-free periods (averaged over both years) at the meadow was 3.5 g CO2 m-2 d -1 and ranged from 1.5 to 3.4 g CO2 m-2 d -1 at the fen sites. Mean average daily wintertime CO2 emission was low, being only -0.9 g CO2 m-2 d-1 for meadow and between -0.2 and -0.7 g CO2 m-2 d -1 for all fen sites. All sites function as significant annual net carbon sinks, with a net carbon gain from 50 to 121 g C m-2 a -1 (averaged over both years) irrespective of water balance. Our results indicate that these alpine fen sites that have built up a large carbon stock in the past do not gain a further carbon surplus compared with the meadow under the current climate. © 2008 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"alpine environment; annual variation; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; ecosystem dynamics; fen; meadow; photosynthetically active radiation; pore space; soil temperature; water budget",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549121952

This technique is sometimes called electron tomography. The examples presented here elucidate the dispersion of these nanoparticles in a natural rubber (NR) matrix, which is a technologically very important biomass. It is made clear that such nanoparticles coalesce to form aggregates and they further coalesce to form agglomerates in the rubbery matrix. Once 3D-TEM images are established, one can evaluate all structural parameters, depending on the availability of software for each specific purpose. Here, the volume of each component in the composite, the size, the size distribution, the distance between neighboring aggregates, and the aspect ratio of the aggregates, for example, are evaluated as structural parameters. In the case of silica, 3D images of conventional silica and in situ formed silica are compared. The further coalescing of aggregates of both silica and carbon black particles results in the formation of agglomerates, the visualized images of which show that they form a kind of network structure in the rubber. In the case of carbon black, measurement of volume resistivity or electron conductivity reveals that percolation occurs near a volume fraction of 0.17 as a threshold value. Combining the resistivity results with a structural parameter, i.e., the nearest neighbor distance from 3D-TEM images, it is estimated that electrons hop over the rubber phase (which is an insulator), about 3 nm thick, between carbon black aggregates, thereby exhibiting electron conductivity. It is suggested from the results of this study that establishing the correlation between the 3D nanostructures as revealed by 3D-TEM and physical properties can play an important role in advancing the discipline of nanotechnology as an exact science, especially in the area of soft nanocomposites. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The scenarios covered timber utilization at different points in time and two mortality rates (constant and exponential). A proportion of harvesting was assumed to remain inside the forest as logging residues and entered together with mortality a decay process. Two different lifetimes for decay (10 and 50 years) and constant and negative exponential decay rates were simulated. Those decisions affect the amount of carbon released considerably.

We carried out in-situ analyses of major, trace, and rare-earth elements of carbonate minerals in rocks with primary sedimentary structures in shallow and deep sea-deposits, in order to eliminate secondary carbonate and contamination of detrital materials, and to estimate the redox condition of seawater through time. Based on the Ce content and anomalies of the carbonate minerals at given parameters of atmospheric CO2 content (pCO2) and Ca content of seawater, we calculated the oxygen contents of shallow and deep seawater, respectively. The results show that the oxygen content of the deep sea was low and constant until at least 1.9 Ga. The oxygen content of shallow seawater increased after 2.7 Ga, but fluctuated. It became quite high at 2.5 and 2.3 Ga, but eventually increased after the Phanerozoic. In addition, the calculation of a high pCO2 condition shows that seawater was more oxic even in the Archean than at present, suggesting a relatively low pCO2 through geologic time. Our detailed calculations from compositions of carbonate minerals in Three Gorge area, south China show a low oxygen content of seawater after the Snowball Earth until the late Ediacaran, an increase in the late Ediacaran, and a significant decrease around the Precambrian-Cambrian and Nemakit/Daldynian-Tommotian boundaries. These variations were possibly caused by global regression and dissolution of methane hydrates. © 2007 International Association for Gondwana Research.","Carbonate rocks and minerals; Composition and redox state of seawater; Evolution of surface environment; History of the earth; Neoproterozoic; Snowball Earth; South China","carbon dioxide; carbonate group; carbonate rock; chemical composition; early Earth; evolution; redox conditions; seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46149097332

Carpet represents a high volume waste stream, provides high energy value, and contains other recoverable materials for the production of cement. This research studied the emission characteristics of burning 0.46-kg charges of chopped nylon carpet squares, pulverized coal, and particle-board pellets in a pilot-scale natural gas-fired rotary kiln. Carpet was tested with different amounts of water added. Emissions of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and total hydrocarbons and temperatures were continuously monitored. It was found that carpet burned faster and more completely than coal and particle board, with a rapid volatile release that resulted in large and variable transient emission peaks. NO emissions from carpet combustion ranged from 0.06 to 0.15 g/MJ and were inversely related to CO emissions. Carpet combustion yielded higher NO emissions than coal and particle-board combustion, consistent with its higher nitrogen content. SO2 emissions were highest for coal combustion, consistent with its higher sulfur content than carpet or particle board. Adding water to carpet slowed its burn time and reduced variability in the emission transients, reducing the CO peak but increasing NO emissions. Results of this study indicate that carpet waste can be used as an effective alternative fuel, with the caveats that it might be necessary to wet carpet or chop it finely to avoid excessive transient puff emissions due to its high volatility compared with other solid fuels, and that controlled mixing of combustion air might be used to control NO emissions from nylon carpet.

For this, soils were sampled from specific grasslands in the Netherlands that contain elevated heavy metal concentrations (Cu, Pb and Zn). Soils that showed the largest differences in metal concentrations were incubated in the laboratory using Terrestrial Model Ecosystems (TMEs). This approach enabled simultaneous measurement of structural (bacteria, nematodes, enchytraeids, earthworms) and functional parameters (nitrogen leaching, feeding activity, CO2 production, plant growth). The highest polluted soils showed a lower bacterial growth, and decreased enchytraeid and nematode biomass and diversity, hence a deprived community. More nitrate leached from high polluted soils, while all other functional endpoints did not differ. Additional stress application of zinc and heat was used to test the stability. Zinc treatment caused effects only in the higher polluted soils, observed at several moments in time for enchytraeids, CO2 fluxes and plant growth. Heat stress caused a large reduction in enchytraeid and earthworm biomass. Ammonium leaching was decreased by heat treatments in the most polluted soils, while CO2 was increased by heat in less polluted soils. Most effects were seen in the most polluted systems and it was concluded that they seem less stable. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The chain with CCS comprises post-combustion CO2 capture with monoethanolamine, compression, transport by pipeline and storage in a geological reservoir. The two reference chains represent sub-critical and state-of-the-art ultra supercritical pulverized coal fired electricity generation. For the three chains we have constructed a detailed greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and disclosed environmental trade-offs and co-benefits due to CO2 capture, transport and storage. Results show that, due to CCS, the GHG emissions per kWh are reduced substantially to 243 g/kWh. This is a reduction of 78 and 71% compared to the sub-critical and state-of-the-art power plant, respectively. The removal of CO2 is partially offset by increased GHG emissions in up- and downstream processes, to a small extent (0.7 g/kWh) caused by the CCS infrastructure. An environmental co-benefit is expected following from the deeper reduction of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride emissions. Most notable environmental trade-offs are the increase in human toxicity, ozone layer depletion and fresh water ecotoxicity potential for which the CCS chain is outperformed by both other chains. The state-of-the-art power plant without CCS also shows a better score for the eutrophication, acidification and photochemical oxidation potential despite the deeper reduction of SOx and NOx in the CCS power plant. These reductions are offset by increased emissions in the life cycle due to the energy penalty and a factor five increase in NH3 emissions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, therefore, is to more actively switch to renewable technologies in the production of electricity, and reduce the use of fossil fuels in electricity production. This is the goal of renewable portfolio standard (RPS) legislation, currently in effect in 28 states across the country. In this paper we discuss the potential for water power development as one method to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions. We look at the potential from (1) new small/micro hydropower dams, (2) uprating facilities at existing large hydropower dams, (3) new generating facilities at existing non-hydropower dams, and (4) hydrokinetics. We analyze this potential by type, by state, and by its ability to satisfy current RPS goals. Finally, we consider the cost-effectiveness of developing these sources of water-based energy. We find that while water power will never be the complete answer to emissions-free energy production, a strong case can be made that it can be a useful part of the answer. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The gaseous hydrocarbons both in the Silesian Unit of the Outer Flysch Carpathians and Mesozoic Basement are generally genetically related to thermogenic processes and occasionally to microbial carbon dioxide reduction. These gases were mainly generated from mixed type II/III kerogen during middle stage of the low-temperature thermogenic processes. Gaseous hydrocarbons from Starunia in the Boryslav-Pokuttya Unit were generated from type II kerogen during middle stage of the low-temperature thermogenic processes. He is generally of crustal origin with more than 99.2% of radiogenic 4He, but appreciable amount of 3He is probably derived from the upper mantle. The 3He might have been derived from the Pieniny Klippen Belt deep-seated fault system or Neogene and Pleistocene andesitic and basaltic volcanism occurred in the eastern Carpathian area. Nucleogenic 21Ne and 22Ne were analysed in all the samples. The nucleogenic 21Ne shows good correlation with radiogenic 4He with the production ratio of 4He/21Ne = (1-3) × 107 in the crust. These isotopic values indicate a common source for these gases, where both the nuclear reactions of α-decay and (α, n) are occurring. Concentrations of radiogenic 4He and 40Ar and excess 21Ne in the samples from the Mesozoic Basement are generally higher and more scattered compared with those in the Silesian Unit. The larger concentrations of radiogenic and nucleogenic isotopes in the natural gases from the Mesozoic Basement is probably related to older geological formations than younger formations of the Silesian Unit. Carbon dioxide was generally generated during the thermal transformation of organic matter, and occasionally during microbial processes. Nitrogen was mainly generated during thermal transformation of organic matter and also originated from atmosphere.

The robust chronology of the core allows us to reliably date signals of short-term vegetation change in the Aegean region. For the Pleniglacial interval until ∼14.6 kyr BP, our data document steppe vegetation, suggesting dry climatic conditions in the borderlands of the Aegean Sea. Subaerially exposed parts of the shelf were probably colonized by Pinus-dominated vegetation until shelf areas were flooded during Lateglacial sea-level rise. The final, rapid decrease of Pinus pollen percentages between ∼14 and ∼13 kyr BP appears to be connected to meltwater pulse MWP-1A. The Lateglacial interstadial complex (ie, Meiendorf, Bølling and Allerød) is characterized by the spread of oak trees, but also by the continuous presence of steppe elements, indicating only slightly increased humidity. The Younger Dryas chronozone was the driest interval of the past 20 kyr. Insufficient humidity was most likely also responsible for the ∼2.0 kyr delay in Holocene reforestation in the Aegean region relative to western Greece. During the Holocene, the vegetation was repeatedly affected by centennial-scale episodes of reduced moisture availability. Radiocarbon-based age models of previously published pollen records imply strong discrepancies in vegetation development in the Aegean region, but there are reasons to doubt the accuracy of these age models.

The COPERT model was used to estimate the exhaust emissions of NOx, NO2 and PM2.5. Non-exhaust (tyre and break wear) PM2.5 and PM10 were also calculated. Emissions were projected following current legislation (CLE) measures and a scenario representing maximum feasible technical reductions (MFR). Projections to 2020 showed that CLE will bring 89, 25 and 50% reductions in NOx from gasoline passenger cars (GPCs), diesel passenger cars (DPCs) and heavy duty vehicles (HDVs), respectively, over 2000 levels, when comparing average emissions on a per vehicle-km basis. The corresponding reductions in the MFR scenario were 91, 53 and 67%, respectively. Despite these significant reductions, NO2 emissions do not seem to be effectively controlled for DPCs due to the increased NO2/NOx ratio of new and expected aftertreatment systems. Moreover, there is an almost 9-fold increase of NO2 emissions from mopeds, as they gradually shift to stoichiometric mixtures, four-stroke combustion and use of catalysts in the exhaust. Following CLE, PM exhaust and non-exhaust emissions will decrease on a per vehicle-km basis by 61% for DPCs and 63% for HDVs. Reductions by MFR over the reference year are estimated in the order of 77% and 65% for DPCs and HDVs, respectively. However, the increasing share of non-exhaust sources to the total PM emissions may hamper the effectiveness of exhaust control measures in meeting future urban air-quality standards. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To separate these influences for the coterminous United States, we use a set of over 1000 United States Geological Survey stream gauges primarily from small, minimally disturbed watersheds to estimate annual streamflow per unit area since 1920 on a uniform grid. We find that changing precipitation, which is not clearly correlated with greenhouse gas concentrations or global warming, explains most of the interannual and longer term variability in streamflow. While streamflow has indeed increased since 1920, this increase has not been steady but rather concentrated in the late 1960s, when precipitation increased. Since the early 1990s, both precipitation and streamflow show nonsignificant declining trends. Multiple regression of streamflow against precipitation, temperature and CO2 suggests that higher CO2 levels may increase streamflow, presumably from lower transpiration due to the physiological plant response to CO2, but that this positive response is offset by concomitant increasing evaporation due to global warming. The net impact of the opposing climate and physiological effects of CO2 emissions for streamflow is close to zero for the coterminous United States taken as a whole, but shows regional variation. Streamflow at a given amount of annual precipitation has decreased in the Pacific west, where most precipitation occurs in winter. Suppression of plant transpiration through higher CO2 levels may be particularly important for sustaining high streamflow in recent decades in the Great Plains, where precipitation is concentrated during the growing season.",,"carbon dioxide; climate effect; geological survey; global warming; greenhouse gas; growing season; hydrological modeling; multiple regression; physiological response; precipitation assessment; streamflow; transpiration; Great Plains; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49749141509

This study discusses use of the stimulus response approach to quantitatively study the energetic and metabolic aspects of the transient adaptation of S. cerevisiae to a shift in benzoic acid concentration, from 0 to 0.8 mm. The information obtained also serves as the basis for further utilization of benzoic acid as a tool for targeted perturbation of the energy system, which is important in studying the kinetics and regulation of central carbon metabolism in S. cerevisiae. Using this experimental set-up, we found significant fast-transient (&lt; 3000 s) increases in O2 consumption and CO 2 production rates, of ∼ 50%, which reflect a high energy requirement for the adaptation process. We also found that with a longer exposure time to benzoic acid, S. cerevisiae decreases the cell membrane permeability for this weak acid by a factor of 10 and decreases the cell size to ∼ 80% of the initial value.

Elegantly simple, CoM, so named for its role as a methyl carrier in all methanogenic archaea, is the smallest known organic cofactor. It was thought that this cofactor was used exclusively in methanogenesis until it was recently discovered that CoM is a key cofactor in the pathway of propylene metabolism in the gram-negative soil microorganism Xanthobacter autotrophicus Py2. A four-step pathway requiring CoM converts propylene and CO2 to acetoacetate, which feeds into central metabolism. In this process, CoM is used to activate and convert highly electrophilic epoxypropane, formed from propylene epoxidation, into a nucleophilic species that undergoes carboxylation. The unique properties of CoM provide a chemical handle for orienting compounds for site-specific redox chemistry and stereospecific catalysis. The three-dimensional structures of several of the enzymes in the pathway of propylene metabolism in defined states have been determined, providing significant insights into both the enzyme mechanisms and the role of CoM in this pathway. These studies provide the structural basis for understanding the efficacy of CoM as a handle to direct organic substrate transformations at the active sites of enzymes.

The underlying basement consists of deep Carboniferous strata with interbedded hard coal seams. The Cretaceous sequence can be subdivided into the Cenomanian-Turonian-Complex, representing a brine aquifer, and the overlying 'Emscher Mergel' (clayey marl), separating the brine from shallow freshwater aquifers. This geological setting potentially offers favourable conditions for geological storage of CO2 by physical sorption in the coal seams below the 'Emscher Mergel' cap rock formation. This storage option could be combined with the production of coalbed methane (CBM), by means of application of a CO2-enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) strategy. A potential storage area of 820 km2 has been identified by considering local geological, hydrogeological and tectonic settings. This regional study was complemented by the analysis of carbon isotope signatures of CH4 and CO2 in shallow aquifers and concentration profiles of methane-in-place. Using the Coal Inventory Calculation Model (KVB-model) of the Geological Survey (GD) of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, coal volumes within the study area have been estimated to amount to 37.5 × 109 metric tons. High-pressure CO2 sorption isotherms measured on a selected coal sample at different temperatures were used to estimate the sorptive storage capacity of this coal at the pressure and temperature conditions in the seams. Assuming an accessibility of 40% of the total coal as well as a methane-in-place recovery efficiency of 80%, a maximum CO2 storage potential of 160 million metric tons of CO2 was estimated for the coal seams down to a depth of 3000 m. However, the application of ECBM is restricted due to the low permeabilities and large depth of the coal deposits. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Through the comparison of these two predictions, it is demonstrated that the air-sea coupled process is an important factor not only for climatological simulation but also for seasonal predictability. In particular, the air-sea coupling plays a crucial role over the warm pool region, as the atmosphere tends to lead the ocean in anomalous variability. In this region, the Tier-one prediction has better climatology compared to the Tier-two prediction despite the presence of a climatological SST bias. Furthermore, the Tier-one has a relatively higher seasonal predictive skill than that of the Tier-two although its SST prediction skill is relatively poor. It is suggested that the air-sea coupled process plays a role to reduce both the climatological and anomalous biases in the uncoupled AGCM by means of the negative feedback of the SST-heat flux-precipitation loop. Using the CliPAS and DEMETER seasonal prediction data, the robustness of these results are demonstrated in the multi-model frame works. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate prediction; climatology; computer simulation; conference proceeding; heat flux; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; warm pool",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44849086306

Nonstationarity, caused by climate forcing and other factors, such as change in physical properties of catchment (urbanization, vegetation change, etc.), makes the forecasting task too difficult to model by traditional Box-Jenkins approaches. In this paper, the potential of the Bayesian dynamic modelling approach is investigated through an application to forecast a nonstationary hydroclimatic time series using relevant climate index information. The target is the time series of the volume of Devil's Lake, located in North Dakota, USA, for which it was proved difficult to forecast and quantify the associated uncertainty by traditional methods. Two different Bayesian dynamic modelling approaches are discussed, namely, a constant model and a dynamic regression model (DRM). The constant model uses the information of past observed values of the same time series, whereas the DRM utilizes the information from a causal time series as an exogenous input. Noting that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index appears to co-vary with the time series of Devil's Lake annual volume, its use as an exogenous predictor is explored in the case study. The results of both the Bayesian dynamic models are compared with those from the traditional Box-Jenkins time series modelling approach. Although, in this particular case study, it is observed that the DRM performs marginally better than traditional models, the major strength of Bayesian dynamic models lies in the quantification of prediction uncertainty, which is of great value in hydrology, particularly under the recent climate change scenario.

Judd-Ofelt parameterization of the absorption spectra gave a radiative decay time of 846 μs for the 4F3/2 excited state to the four emission channels. Measured fluorescence decay curves for 5 different Nd3+ concentrations were fit with double exponential functions. The decrease in fluorescence decay time shows that concentration quenching is appreciable as the Nd3+ concentration increases. The 0.5 mol% Nd3+ concentration shows a decay time of 800 μs and a radiative quantum efficiency of 95%. For all dopant concentrations, heat-treatment (800 °C, 2 h) substantially increased the emission intensity by 2 to 3-orders of magnitude. This emission intensity increase is attributed to reduction in hydroxyls and homogenization of the Nd3+ coordination environment through improved crystalline perfection of the LaF3 :Nd lattice.

Most of the mercury in fish and other seafoods is in toxic organic form, methylmercury, and consumption of these organisms by humans is the principal route of exposure to it. Its harmful effect to humans depends on its concentration in fish and seafoods and the amount consumed. Fish accumulates methylmercury in their tissues where it becomes strongly bound and is not removed from their tissues even after cooking. Methylmercury causes a variety of adverse effects in humans which include developmental delays in children of exposed mothers, and deficit in neurocognitive functions in adults. Exposure to methylmercury causes life long loss of intelligence in hundreds of new born babies each year. Blood methylmercury detected in individuals is strongly correlated with the frequency and types of seafood consumed and it can pass across the placenta to the fetus and to nursing children through breast milk. Methylmercury compounds in humans have a biological half-life of approximately two month. The consumers who eat less than 10 g of fish and shellfish per day with mercury concentrations averaging between 0.10 and 0.15 ppm are not in danger of attaining harmful levels of methylmercury. At these rates of fish intake, methylmercury concentration is considerably less than the reference does (RFD) of 1x10 4 mg/Kg/day. Control measures should focus on the risk to human health particularly during fetal and neonatal development, and the wide intra and interspecies variations in mercury in fish and other seafoods. Human hair is an useful indicator of mercury exposure. World Health Organization adopted the US EPA levels for mercury and recommends that food with mercury concentrations of 0.5 mg/kg or more should not be sold for human consumption. To avoid harmful accumulation of methylmercury in human body, the gills, the liver and the intestine should preferably be discarded while processing fish and other seafoods. A nationwide awareness drive with people's participation needs to be launched to reduce the mercury emissions in municipal and industrial wastes. © 2008 - Kalpana Corporation.","Bioaccumulation; Fish consumption; Methy-lation; Methylmercury; Neurotoxicity; Pregnant women; Public health; Seafoods","Pisces",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59749088142

More recently, molecular biology has enabled prokaryotic organisms to be identified at the species level and contributed information on functional groups of specific significance to the ecosystem. Although microbial ecology has covered all common aquatic systems it has spatially been focused on a narrow range of habitats, leaving, for example, polar ice with modest activity and the deep, dark oceans practically untouched. In addition, temporal scales have been skewed towards daylight studies and only recent studies have focused on day/night process controls, recognizing that the diel rhythm is connected to fast-growing prokaryotic organisms. The key to going forward with predictions on the fate of microbial food webs in the ecosystem is to recognize physical structures and their persistence in the water body and identify the biological hotspots in terms of spatial and temporal significance. The present ecological models do not handle short-term, spatially restricted hotspot events adequately. Evidently, we need to combine our research efforts into targeted approaches, coupling modeling activity with physical and chemical oceanography as well as fisheries biology and 'sell our goods', even though our primary interest is microbial processes. Understanding the micro-environment of a single cell and its interaction with the environment should, by extrapolation, enable us to predict global processes. In the nitrogen cycle, this understanding has evolved rapidly, but in the carbon cycle, the role of microbes is still far from fully understood, especially in terms of loss processes. This should rapidly be addressed, instead of undertaking further major questionable experiments such as fertilizing the seas at very large scales. © Inter-Research 2008.","Aquatic microorganism; Biological hotspots; Dark oceans; Functional groups; Molecular biology; Polar ice; Process rate; Societal needs","Prokaryota",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54549115133

The increased CO2 diffuses from the atmosphere into ocean surface waters, resulting in increased partial pressure of CO2, and reduced [CO32-] and pH. The CO 2-driven ocean acidification leads to a decrease in calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation state in the ocean surface waters and has potential impacts on calcifiers. The present study focuses on the effects of ocean acidification on early developmental and reproductive stages of calcifiers, both of which are believed to be the most vulnerable stages to environmental change within a life cycle. Laboratory experiments revealed that ocean acidification has negative impacts on the fertilization, cleavage, larva, settlement and reproductive stages of several marine calcifiers, including echinoderm, bivalve, coral and crustacean species. There appear to be significant ontogenetic impacts and species-specific differences in tolerance to the high CO2 levels. The conclusion is that future changes in ocean acidity will potentially impact the population size and dynamics, as well as the community structure of calcifiers, and will therefore have negative impacts on marine ecosystems. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential impacts on non-calcifiers, as well as the synergistic impacts of ocean acidification and climate change. Studies should also focus on the adaptive capability of marine organisms, which will be crucial to the ability to forecast how marine organisms and ecosystems will respond to the world's oceans as they warm and acidify. © Inter-Research 2008.","Calcifiers; CO2; Early development; Ocean acidification; Rapid environmental change; Reproduction; Seawater chemistry","acidification; carbon dioxide; environmental change; fertilization (reproduction); fossil fuel; life cycle; marine ecosystem; population dynamics; population size; seawater; Anthozoa; Bivalvia; Crustacea; Echinodermata; Invertebrata",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849127760

In particular, by focusing on the prospect of California's establishment of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading system and its eventual linkage with comparable systems in Europe and elsewhere, this Article demonstrates that certain constitutional objections to extrajurisdictional linkage of state GHG emissions trading systems and the response that these objections necessitate may be more complicated than previously appreciated. First, in order to successfully combat the argument that state-level climate change activities interfere with a federal executive position of withholding binding domestic GHG emissions reductions in advance of a multilateral agreement including key developing nations, states must demonstrate that the executive branch is not acting with congressional support and has, furthermore, declared its position too informally to constitute an exercise of any of the president's independent constitutional powers. Second, state efforts to link GHG emissions trading systems with those of other nations may face serious challenges under the foreign affairs and Foreign Commerce Clause doctrines. Finally, states' efforts to integrate with other trading schemes or to otherwise protect the integrity of their own trading schemes must be carefully constructed lest they invite challenge as being discriminatory or overreaching, in light of more conventional dormant Commerce Clause constraints on state regulation.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349090634

The spatial configuration of the hydro-meteorological station network makes it possible to characterize the catchment-scale hydrological impact of the WSCW. The catchment is subdivided into two parts, the upper subcatchment and the lower subarea. The latter covers 84% of the catchment surface area and gathers 97% of the surfaces controlled by WSCW. The space-time variability of the rainfall-runoff relationship is first analysed, comparing the runoff responses from the two nested catchments for different rain event depth ranges. A non-parametric test, based on a resampling approach, is applied to the lower subarea runoff simulated with the GR4J daily lumped rainfall-runoff model, which is calibrated for several subsets of data. Results indicate that from 1989 to 2005, the runoff produced by rainfall below 40 mm in the lower subarea was reduced by some 71-75%, a significant change at the 95% confidence level. This drop in runoff is estimated at 41-50% when considering all rain depths and at 28-32% when including the upper subcatchment in the analysis. No runoff change is found for above-40 mm rains in the lower subarea, nor for any rain depth range in the upper subcatchment. An analysis of various possible sources for the runoff reduction such as climate, land use/land cover, or water exchanges with the aquifer, led to the conclusion that WSCW, which were developed over 32% of the lower subarea since 1989, are the most likely cause for that reduction. Their sharp hydrological effects should be taken into account in order to manage the water resources at the river basin scale, especially in populated semi-arid areas where conflicts between water uses increase dramatically. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This radio emission is thought to be generated via the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) that predicts a strong anisotropy of the beaming pattern of the emission. Resulting visibility effects were suspected to be at the origin of characteristic features observed in Cassini's dynamic spectra as arc-shaped structures and shadow zones. By using the Planetary Radio Emissions Simulator (PRES) code, we model these visibility effects and their consequence on Cassini's observations of SKR: we compute the dynamic spectra resulting from the beaming pattern of CMI-generated SKR and its intersection with Cassini's trajectory. The SKR beaming pattern and its dependence on the frequency is computed for two typical electron distributions observed in auroral regions: a loss cone (favoring oblique emission) or a shell (favoring perpendicular emission). We successfully fit observed arc-shaped structures and shadow zones. Although oblique and perpendicular emissions both allow to produce radio arcs, the fit is better in the oblique case. Similarities and differences between observations and model results are discussed and perspectives are outlined.

Under low-NOx conditions, the RO2 radicals react with other peroxy radicals to form a distribution of products with lower volatilities, resulting in higher SOA yields. At high-NOx conditions, the SOA yields are lower because aldehydes, ketones, and nitrates dominate the product distribution. Based on recent laboratory smog chamber experiments, high-NOx SOA parametrizations were created using the volatility basis-set approach. The organic aerosol (OA) concentrations in the Eastern US are simulated for a summer episode, and are compared to the available ambient measurements. Changes in NOx levels result in changes of both the oxidants (ozone, OH radical, etc.) and the SOA yields during the oxidation of the corresponding organic vapors. The NOx dependent SOA parametrization predicts a maximum average SOA concentration of 5.2 μg m -3 and a domain average concentration of 0.6 μg m-3. As the NOx emissions are reduced by 25%, the domain average SOA concentration does not significantly change, but the response is quite variable spatially. However, the predicted average SOA concentrations increase in northern US cities by around 3% but decrease in the rural southeast US by approximately 5%. A decrease of the average biogenic SOA by roughly 0.5 μg m-3 is predicted for the southeast US for a 50% reduction in NO x emissions. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical transport model; Secondary organic aerosol; Three dimensional; nitric oxide; ozone; radical; nitrate; organic compound; aerosol; aldehyde; biogenic emission; emission control; experimental study; ketone; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; oxidation; radical; three-dimensional modeling; article; city; concentration (parameters); exhaust gas; oxidation; secondary organic aerosol; United States; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; chemical model; chemistry; North America; United States; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Models, Chemical; Nitrates; Organic Chemicals; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49749141461

Amongst other transport methods, airplanes emissions count for 3% of the CO2 emissions. Initiatives to reduce this include not only investing in more fuel-efficient aircrafts or adapting existing ones to make them more efficient (e.g. by fitting fuel-saving winglets), but also more actively researching novel propulsion systems that incorporate environmentally friendly technologies. The Boeing Company through its European subsidiary, Boeing Research and Technology Europe (BR&amp;TE) in collaboration with industry partners throughout Europe is working towards this goal by studying the possible application of advanced batteries and fuel-cell systems in aeronautical applications. One example is the development of a small manned two-seater prototype airplane powered only by proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell stacks, which runs on compressed hydrogen gas as fuel and pressurized air as oxidant, and Li-ion batteries. The efficient all composite motorglider is an all electric prototype airplane which does not produce any of the noxious engine exhaust by-products, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide or NOx, that can contribute to climate change and adversely affect local air quality. Water and heat are the only exhaust products. The main objective is to demonstrate for the first time in aviation history a straight level manned flight with fuel-cells as the only power source. For this purpose, the original engine of a super Dimona HK36TTC glider from Diamond Aircraft Industries (Austria) was replaced by a hybrid power system, which feeds a brushless dc electrical motor that rotates a variable pitch propeller. Amongst the many technical challenges encountered when developing this test platform are maintaining the weight and balance of the aircraft, designing the thermal management system and the power management between the two power sources [N. Lapeña-Rey, J. Mosquera, E. Bataller, F. Ortí, SAE 2007 Aerotech Congress &amp; Exhibition, 2007 (Publication number: 2007-01-3906)]. The demonstrator airplane constitutes an example of the successful implementation of novel clean power sources in aviation. The detailed description of the airplane and its subsystems is given elsewhere [N. Lapeña-Rey, J. Mosquera, E. Bataller, F. Ortí, SAE 2007 Aerotech Congress &amp; Exhibition, 2007 (Publication number: 2007-01-3906)].

Specifically, we coupled projections of future climate with engineering rules of thumb to estimate how thawing permafrost, increased flooding, and increased coastal erosion affect annualized replacement costs for nearly 16,000 structures. We conclude that climate change could add $3.6-$6.1 billion (+10% to +20% above normal wear and tear) to future costs for public infrastructure from now to 2030 and $5.6-$7.6 billion (+10% to +12%) from now to 2080. These estimates take into account different possible levels of climate change and assume agencies strategically adapt infrastructure to changing conditions. In addition to implementing a risk-based economic analysis of climate change impacts, this research effort demonstrates that implementing plausible adaptation strategies could offset impacts by up to 45% over the long-run. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The directive, which represents a harmonization of environmental regulations towards a BAT principle, is currently being implemented in all the EU member states and the states associated with the European Economic Area. The aim of this paper is to examine the effect of this implementation on emission reductions and costs, using data from Norwegian manufacturing industries. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to construct a frontier of all efficient installations. The frontier is based on all installations within an industry that use the Best Practice Technique (BPT). We estimate the changes in emissions due to the implementation of IPPC as the difference between an installation's actual emissions and the emissions that would occur if it operated on the frontier. The method reveals a strong potential for emission reductions. Further, estimates of short-run abatement costs indicate that considerable emission reductions can be achieved with low or no costs, but that the implementation of a strict BAT principle for all installations involves substantial costs. To the extent that the abatement costs of an installation would be excessive, IPPC includes some limited modifications of the strict BAT principle. It seems important that these modifications are fully utilized by authorities to achieve the most cost efficient implementation of the directive. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","BAT; DEA; Emissions; IPPC; Technical efficiency","Cost reduction; Costs; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Particulate emissions; Pollution control; Abatement costs; Best available technique (BAT); Emission reduction; European economic areas; European union; IPPC; Manufacturing industries; Technical efficiency; Cost benefit analysis; abatement cost; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; integrated approach; pollution control; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949114666

However, they suffer from symmetry-breaking (SB) in systems with multiple resonance structures, which arises due to neglected correlations. We investigate the extent to which these problems can be removed by using second-order perturbation theory (PT) for weak correlations coupling three different electron pairs, and (infinite-order) coupled-cluster (CC) theory for stronger correlations involving electrons in only one or two pairs. The resulting Three-Pair Corrected Imperfect Pairing (TIP) method is explored here, and it is shown that to robustly combine CC and PT it is necessary to modify several aspects of the basic method. Most importantly, a penalty function term is introduced to ensure the PT amplitudes remain small. Comparison against CC treatment of the three-pair correlations suggests penalty terms will be beneficial for any hybrid CC/PT method that includes orbital optimization. The TIP method greatly reduces SB in aromatic hydrocarbons and recovers a significantly higher fraction of the valence electron correlation energy than IP.","Ab initio; Computational chemistry; Electronic structure; Quantum chemistry","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Charge coupled devices; Electron correlations; Electron density measurement; Electronic structure; Electrons; Hydrocarbons; Internet protocols; Perturbation techniques; Phototransistors; Platinum compounds; Probability density function; Security of data; Ab initio; Attractive methods; Computational chemistry; Computationally inexpensive; Electron pairs; Local actives; Multiple resonances; Pair correlations; Penalty functions; Penalty terms; Perfect pairings; Perturbation amplitudes; Perturbation theories; Space correlations; Strong correlations; Valence bonds; Weak correlations; Correlation methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57149092428

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the active phases of composting, vermicomposting, and also a combination of composting and vermicomposting for reducing the polluting potential and for stabilizing cattle manure in the short-term. For this, the degree of decomposition as well as the microbial activity and microbial composition of the resulting products after the active phase of composting and vermicomposting were analysed. None of the treatments significantly reduced the dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen contents relative to the control, and therefore more time may be required for stabilization. Nevertheless, the lowest values of microbial biomass and activity corresponded to the earthworm-worked substrates, in which fungal growth was also promoted; the combined treatment (composting + vermicomposting) was the most effective in terms of stabilizing the cattle manure. Moreover, earthworms promoted the retention of nitrogen and gradual release of P, as well as a reduction in electrical conductivity, thereby producing improved substrates for agricultural use. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

PAN was determined using a fast chromatograph with luminol-based chemiluminescence detection. Mixing ratios of PAN ranged from below the detection limit (0.1 ppbv) to 10.4 ppbv with an average of 0.8 ppbv. O3 concentrations ranged from 0 to 141 ppbv. The average PAN/O3 ratio of 0.07 was higher than that observed in cities of Europe and North America (0.02) where control strategies have been enforced to reduce hydrocarbon emissions through extensively reformulated gasoline programs. Strong positive correlations between daily PAN and O3 maxima during the day demonstrate that similar photochemical factors controlled the production of these two chemicals. However, relationships between PAN and its precursors, NO2 and NMHCs, suggest that PAN production was more sensitive to NO2 than NMHCs levels whereas O3 production was limited by the overall availability of NMHCs. It is likely that the compositions of NMHCs in SMA were favorable for PAN production because of the low fractions of oxygenated compounds in automobile fuels. PAN maxima were observed around noon, which was 2-3 h earlier than the much broader O3 maxima that occurred in the midafternoon. After reaching the maximum, PAN concentrations rapidly dropped within a few hours, which could be largely due to thermal destruction and to limited production under the typically low NO2 levels that occurred in the early afternoon. The heterogeneous destruction of particulate matter could be an additional sink for PAN in SMA. © 2008.","Air quality; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Ozone; Peroxyacetyl nitrate; Seoul Metropolitan area","Conductive plastics; Local area networks; Nitrates; Peroxides; Air quality; Mega cities; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Ozone; Peroxyacetyl nitrate; Reactive species; Seoul Metropolitan area; Reaction kinetics; gasoline; methane monooxygenase; nitrogen oxide; oxygen; ozone; peroxyacetylnitrate; air quality; concentration (composition); measurement method; metropolitan area; mixing ratio; ozone; peroxyacetyl nitrate; article; chemoluminescence; gas chromatography; Korea; luminance; oxygenation; photochemistry; temperature sensitivity; ultraviolet radiation; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Korea; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Peracetic Acid; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649105485

Our mail survey had a relatively low response rate, so we first use several additional data sources to build a detailed sample selection model. This model uses features of the survey instrument, measures of geographic vulnerability to climate change, seasonality, the political mix in the county, attributes of the address or addressee, and a set of factor scores from an extensive factor analysis of all census tracts in the US. We estimate this model jointly with a model to explain climate policy preferences as a function of the domestic and international distribution of policy costs as well as the climate change impacts that each respondent believes will occur under a policy of business-as-usual. Despite statistically significant patterns of nonresponse, selectivity effects are minimal in this case. WTP for climate change mitigation is greater when the domestic incidence of mitigation costs is borne mostly through higher energy taxes. It is also greater when costs are understood to be shared internationally with other groups of countries, rather than being borne mostly by a country group including the US. People are generally more willing to pay for climate change mitigation if they believe that the harm caused by climate change impacts will be substantial, rather than just moderate. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Conjoint choice; Distributional effects; Mail survey; Sample selection; Selectivity bias; Stated preferences; Willingness to pay","Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Surveys; Taxation; Conjoint choice; Distributional effects; Mail surveys; Sample selection; Stated preferences; Willingness to pay; Climate change; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; household survey; mitigation; modeling; seasonality; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52549107693

Global warming is likely to increase the decomposition of soil organic carbon, and thus the release of carbon dioxide from soils 2-5, creating a positive feedback6-9. Current models of global climate change that recognize this soil carbon feedback are inaccurate if a larger fraction of soil organic carbon than postulated has a very slow decomposition rate. Here we show that by including realistic stocks of black carbon in prediction models, carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by 18.3 and 24.4% in two Australian savannah regions in response to a warming of 3 °C over 100 years1. This reduction in temperature sensitivity, and thus the magnitude of the positive feedback, results from the long mean residence time of black carbon, which we estimate to be approximately 1,300 and 2,600 years, respectively. The inclusion of black carbon in climate models is likely to require spatially explicit information about its distribution, given that the black carbon content of soils ranged from 0 to 82% of soil organic carbon in a continental-scale analysis of Australia. We conclude that accurate information about the distribution of black carbon in soils is important for projections of future climate change. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64549142885

The evolution of O3 formation and its sensitivity to NOx and VOC levels were also examined along the photochemical plume transport pathway. The midday O3 production was found to undergo a rapid increase in a narrow range of chemical aging, while downwind plumes were characterized with low and constant O3 production, and plumes along their transport pathway were characterized by a combination of the two.

The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, going back to 1948, shows a significant long-term decline in the number of summertime mid-latitude cyclones in that track starting in 1980 (-0.15 a-1). The more recent but shorter NCEP/DOE Reanalysis (1979-2006) shows similar interannual variability in cyclone frequency but no significant long-term trend. Analysis of NOAA daily weather maps for 1980-2006 supports the trend detected in the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1. A GISS general circulation model (GCM) simulation including historical forcing by greenhouse gases reproduces this decreasing cyclone trend starting in 1980. Such a long-term decrease in mid-latitude cyclone frequency over the 1980-2006 period may have offset by half the ozone air quality gains in the northeastern US from reductions in anthropogenic emissions. We find that if mid-latitude cyclone frequency had not declined, the northeastern US would have been largely compliant with the ozone air quality standard by 2001. Mid-latitude cyclone frequency is expected to decrease further over the coming decades in response to greenhouse warming and this will necessitate deeper emission reductions to achieve a given air quality goal.",,"air quality; annual variation; anthropogenic source; climate change; climate forcing; cyclone; emission control; general circulation model; greenhouse gas; latitude; ozone; trend analysis; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349116222

Treatments (warm-moist, warm-dry, freeze/thaw-moist, freeze/thaw-dry) were applied to whole soil mycorrhizal inoculum, and their effects were evaluated as both the change in viability of extraradical hyphae and mycorrhizal colonization of bait plants. Moist soil decreased hyphal viability compared with dry soil, irrespective of temperature, but mycorrhizal colonization of bait plants was lower in moist soil only when warm. Frost-heave could have physically ruptured hyphae in the freezing-moist soil without an effect on spores, but parasitism and (or) respiratory depletion of carbon reserves may have reduced survival of all propagules in the warm-moist soil. Hyphae of semi-arid tropical isolates survived all treatments better than hyphae of mesic temperate isolates, but these differences were not reflected in mycorrhizal colonization of bait plants.

Distinct regional trends in response to projected climatic change were evident across all combinations of the experimental factors. In the eastern half of the U.S., the average response to relatively large increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation was an 11% loss of total ecosystem carbon. In the West, the response to increases in precipitation and relatively small increases in temperature was a 5% increase in total carbon stocks. Simulated fire suppression reduced average carbon losses in the East to about 6%, and preserved forests which were largely converted to woodland and savanna in the absence of fire suppression. Across the west, unsuppressed fire maintained near constant carbon stocks despite increases in vegetation productivity. With fire suppression, western carbon stocks increased by 10% and most shrublands were converted to woodland or even forest. With a relatively high level of growth in response to CO2, total ecosystem carbon pools at the end of the century were on average about 9-10% larger in both regions of the U.S. compared to a low CO2 response. The western U.S. gained enough carbon to counter losses from unsuppressed fire only with the high CO2 response, especially in conjunction with the higher CO2 emission rate. In the eastern U.S., fire suppression was sufficient to produce a simulated carbon sink only with both the high CO2 response and emission rate. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the impacts of global warming on the ecosystems of the conterminous U.S., some of which resides in the future trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, in the direct response of vegetation to increasing CO2, and in future tradeoffs among different fire management options, as illustrated in this study. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.","biogeography; carbon; climate change; CO2 effect; fire suppression; MC1 DGVM","atmospheric general circulation model; biological production; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate effect; comparative study; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem response; experimental study; fire management; global warming; growth response; phytogeography; shrubland; uncertainty analysis; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549105744

Fennel concludes that the upwelling required to support the sequestration of 1Gt C yr-1 would deepen the mixed-layer significantly, inhibiting N2 fixation and precluding the enhancement of the biological carbon pump. However, her model does not include the role that solar radiant heating plays in the maintenance of the upper ocean stratification, nor does she discuss observations suggesting that N2 fixation in the NPSG is never completely suppressed. When the solar radiance absorbed by the mixed-layer is considered, the upper ocean stratification is maintained in Fennel's model. Nevertheless, and as Fennel suggests, the effects that a basin scale long-term implementation of controlled upwelling may have on the pelagic ecosystem are difficult to predict due to the complex nature of the system and our incomplete understanding of feedback mechanisms between ocean physics, biology and climate. For this reason, we contend that controlled upwelling of deep water in oligotrophic regions should be viewed as originally concluded by Karl &amp; Letelier (2008): a tool to study the response of pelagic microbial assemblages to perturbations at different spatial and temporal scales, rather than a strategy to stabilize climate through the large-scale manipulation of poorly understood ecosystems. © Inter-Research 2008.","Carbon sequestration; LNLC; Mixed-layer depth; Nitrogen fixation; North Pacific Ocean; Upwelling","Foeniculum vulgare",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849137427

It was through the three key factors, i.e., the continuing escalation in demand for energy, the challenge to ensure the energy supply to meet this demand, and concerns over climate change, stimulated Shell to develop its latest energy scenarios: Scramble and Blueprints. Under the Scramble scenario, policymakers give most attention to securing supplies of energy but less attention is given to more efficient use of energy, until supplies of energy become tight. Greenhouse gas emissions are not seriously addressed until there are major climate shocks. In Blueprints, growing action at the local level leads the way in addressing the challenges of economic development, energy security and environmental issues. In this scenario, carbon pricing is introduced, which stimulates the development of clean energy technologies and significant improvements in energy efficiency. This results in a set of shared responses that reduce CO2 emissions by 2050 to much lower levels than happens in Scramble. For this reason, Shell favors Blueprints.

The Desert Steppe is vulnerable to the impacts of livestock because of relatively short and sparse ground cover and sandy soil. This study investigates the effects of historic sheep grazing on the vegetation and soil properties of a Desert Steppe community. The experiment was conducted at three sites (replicates) in Siziwang Banner in Inner Mongolia with four treatments defined along an historic grazing gradient: ungrazed (control), lightly grazed (LG), moderately grazed (MG) and heavily grazed (HG). The grazing treatments were classified based on species composition and ground cover. The vegetation and soil properties in each treatment and replicate were assessed in fall 2005. The vegetation total N (TN) and P (TP) concentrations and δ15N levels were not affected (P &gt; 0.05) by grazing. Grazing increased (P = 0.02) soil bulk density but had no effect on soil TN and TP concentrations or δ15N levels (P &gt; 0.05). However, HG resulted in 16.4, 11.4 and 7.6% reductions in soil organic carbon (OC), TN and TP concentrations, respectively. Grazing had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on the concentrations of soil available P, available N (NO3- and NH4+), electrical conductivity, pH or soluble ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl- and SO42-). The vegetation of the Desert Steppe is generally tolerant of grazing pressure but is relatively unproductive, supporting a smaller number of livestock than the more mesic grasslands. Therefore, treatment differences were generally not detected. However, the combination of sandy soils (∼70%) and generally reduced litter and plant cover with increased grazing pressure suggests that the Desert Steppe is vulnerable to soil erosion. This risk may be reduced by ensuring appropriate grazing pressure and animal distribution with judicious herding. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) was employed to compare the greenhouse gas emissions expressed as global warming potential (GWP) of the existing waste management system (the base scenario) and other three IWMSs for Phuket MSW. Besides incineration and landfilling, the proposed scenarios include 30% source separation for recycling (scenario 2), anaerobic digestion (scenario 3) and both (scenario 4). The functional unit is set as 1 t of Phuket MSW treated. Results from the impact assessment of the base scenario shows that the net GWP is 1006 kg CO2 equivalent. Landfilling contributes to the highest potentials of this impact. The results from a holistic comparison show that scenario 4 is the best option among all the scenarios, contributing GWP of 415 kg CO2 eq., whereas the base scenario is the worst. The emission of greenhouse gas from landfilling is reduced by the introduction of landfill gas recovery and utilization for electricity production. By assumption, 50% recovery of landfill gas leads to the GWP reduction around 58% by total GWP of landfilling and 36% by the net GWP of the whole system in the base scenario. The study suggests that a policy that promotes source separation should be pursued, preferably combined with the application of landfill gas recovery for electricity. Policy promoting recycling is favorable over anaerobic digestion in the situation that both treatment systems could not be established at the same time. The major conclusion from the study is that results from the LCA can support Phuket Municipality for decision-making with respect to planning and optimizing IWMS.

In order to fully evaluate the influence of BC on the global C cycle, an understanding of the stability of BC is required. The biochemical stability of BC was assessed in a chronosequence of high-BC-containing Anthrosols from the central Amazon, Brazil, using a range of spectroscopic and biological methods. Results revealed that the Anthrosols had 61-80% lower (P &lt; 0.05) CO2 evolution per unit C over 532 days compared to their respective adjacent soils with low BC contents. No significant (P &gt; 0.05) difference in CO2 respiration per unit C was observed between Anthrosols with contrasting ages of BC (600-8700 years BP) and soil textures (0.3-36% clay). Similarly, the molecular composition of the core regions of micrometer-sized BC particles quantified by synchrotron-based Near-Edge X-ray Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy coupled to Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) remained similar regardless of their ages and closely resembled the spectral characteristics of fresh BC. BC decomposed extremely slowly to an extent that it was not possible to detect chemical changes between youngest and oldest samples, as also confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Deconvolution of NEXAFS spectra revealed greater oxidation on the surfaces of BC particles with little penetration into the core of the particles. The similar C mineralization between different BC-rich soils regardless of soil texture underpins the importance of chemical recalcitrance for the stability of BC, in contrast to adjacent soils which showed the highest mineralization in the sandiest soil. However, the BC-rich Anthrosols had higher proportions (72-90%) of C in the more stable organo-mineral fraction than BC-poor adjacent soils (2-70%), suggesting some degree of physical stabilization. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This is facilitated by first identifying key centers where observed large-scale circulation fields and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are significantly correlated with the NAM precipitation averages over the core region (central-northwest Mexico) and then examining if the modeled and observed patterns agree. Two new findings result from the analysis of observed NAM interannual variations. First, precipitation exhibits significantly high positive (negative) correlations with 200-hPa meridional wind centered to the northwest (southeast) of the core region in June and September (July and August). As such, wet conditions are associated with strong anomalous southerly upper-level flow on the northwest flank during the monsoon onset and retreat, but with anomalous northerly flow on the southeast flank, during the peak of the monsoon. They are often identified with a cyclonic circulation anomaly pattern over the central Great Plains for the July-August peak monsoon and, reversely, an anticyclonic anomaly pattern centered over the northern (southern) Great Plains for the June (September) transition. Second, wet NAM conditions in June and July are also connected with a SST pattern of positive anomalies in the eastern Pacific and negative anomalies in the Gulf of Mexico, acting to reduce the climatological mean gradient between the two oceans. This pattern suggests a possible surface gradient forcing that favors a westward extension of the North Atlantic subtropical ridge. These two observed features connected to the NAM serve as the metric for quantitative evaluation of the model performance in simulating the important NAM precipitation mechanisms. Out of 17 CGCMs, only the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) model with a medium resolution consistently captures the observed NAM precipitation annual cycle (having a realistic amplitude and no phase shift) as well as interannual covariations with the planetary circulation patterns (having the correct sign and comparably high magnitude of correlation) throughout the summer. For the metric of correlations with 200-hPa meridional wind, there is general agreement among all CGCMs with observations for June and September. This may indicate that large-scale forcings dominate interannual variability for the monsoon onset and retreat, while variability of the peak of the monsoon in July and August may be largely influenced by local processes that are more challenging for CGCMs to resolve. For the metric of correlations with SSTs, good agreement is found only in June. These results suggest that the NAM precipitation interannual variability may likely be determined by large-scale circulation anomalies, while its predictability based on remote signals such as SSTs may not be sufficiently robust to be well captured by current CGCMs, with the exception of the June monsoon onset which is potentially more predictable. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Earth atmosphere; Gradient methods; Mechanisms; Models; Ocean currents; Offshore oil well production; Turbulent flow; Annual cycles; Circulation patterns; Core regions; Cyclonic circulations; Eastern Pacific; Forcings; Fully coupled; Gulf of Mexico; Inter-annual variations; Interannual variabilities; Large-scale circulation; Meridional winds; Meteorological Research Institute; Model performance; Monsoon onset; Monsoon precipitation; NO phase; North Atlantic; Physical mechanisms; Precipitation mechanisms; Quantitative evaluation; Remote signals; Sea surface temperatures; Subtropical ridge; Wet conditions; Correlation methods; annual cycle; annual variation; atmosphere-ocean coupling; correlation; general circulation model; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); quantitative analysis; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; temperature anomaly; Atlantic Ocean; Great Plains; Gulf of Mexico; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53649093995

Here we show the interdependencies of ozone and PM2.5 responses to emission changes in 2001 and 2050, with the future case accounting for both currently planned emission controls and climate change. Current responses of ozone and PM 2.5 to emissions are quantified and linked on a daily basis for five cities in the continental United States: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and New York. Reductions in anthropogenic NOx emissions decrease 24-h average PM2.5 levels but may either increase or decrease daily maximum 8-h average ozone levels. Regional ozone maxima for all the cities are more sensitive to NOx reductions than at the city center, particularly in New York and Chicago. Planned controls of anthropogenic NO x emissions lead to more positive responses to NOx reductions in the future. Sensitivities of ozone and PM2.5 to anthropogenic VOC emissions are predicted to decrease between 2001 and 2050. Ammonium nitrate formation is predicted to be less ammonia-sensitive in 2050 than 2001 while the opposite is true for ammonium sulfate. Sensitivity of PM2.5 to SO2 and NOx emissions changes little between 2001 and 2050. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate are predicted to decrease in sensitivity to SO2 and NOx emissions between 2001 and 2050. The complexities, linkages, and daily changes in the pollutant responses to emission changes suggest that strategies developed to meet specific air quality standards should consider other air quality impacts as well. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution; Ozone; Permanent magnets; Ammonium compounds; Climate change; Nitrogen oxides; Powder metallurgy; Ozone; ammonium nitrate; ammonium sulfate; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission control; nitrogen oxides; ozone; particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; article; city; climate change; particulate matter; pollutant; United States; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Nitric Oxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; United States; Vehicle Emissions; Atlanta; California; Chicago; Georgia; Houston; Illinois; Los Angeles; New York [United States]; North America; Texas; United States; Air quality impacts; Ammonium nitrate; Ammonium Sulfate; Atlanta; Chicago; Current response; Daily change; Emission change; Houston; Los angeles; New York; NOx emissions; Nox reduction; Ozone levels; VOC emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46849108090

The purpose of the present work is to study and develop several corresponding recycling routes for tailings in accordance with chemical component and paragenesis state of minerals. Four typical gangues are collected from Chinese western dominant mine, discharged after mill run from rare earth metal ore, iron ore containing titanium and vanadium, nonferrous paragenetic ore (Pb, Zn, Sn, Sb, and other nonmetallic elements), and multimetal bonanza ore, respectively. To meet the demands for national recycling economics, it is necessary to design for recycled materials involving recovery of metal and preparation of advanced ecological ceramics through several novel approaches. Experimental results indicate that Ce, Y, and Nb rare metals have been leached from those tailings, and high performance Ca-Sialon can be synthesized from the as-discarded residues. A newly metal bonded ceramic eco-material, identified as Fe3Si-TiCN-MgAl2O4 by XRD are discovered, whose fracture tougness is 12MPam1/2, which is successfully prepared by Carbonothermal Reduction Nitride route using iron-titanium tailing ore based on thermodynamics calculation. Zinc oxide and lead oxide powders can be extracted from nonferrous mineral tailings by hydrometallurgy process, regarded as fresh precursory powders for Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 functional ceramics, whereas magnetic Fe3O4 nanopowders are refined, originated from multimetal tailing ore by leaching-separating- precipitation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of such temperature increases on process stability. Furthermore, different strategies for the transition from mesophilic to thermophilic conditions and the resulting methane yields at different temperature levels were evaluated. Two main effects were identified with different bio-slurries from agricultural biogas plants: (1) a failure of methane production connected to changes in the microbial community; and (2), a slow but continuous accumulation of propionic acid, though without an immediate effect on methane production. All strategies for increasing the operating temperature showed negative effects on digester performance, some with serious economic consequences for the operator. It was shown that methane yields at different temperature levels in the mesophilic and sub-thermophilic ranges are similar. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Accuracy in metering is difficult to be achieved especially for compressed natural gas (CNG) injection systems, as the gas compressibility makes the fuel delivery process more complex. Since the controller design requires a model of the injection system, this paper presents a physics-based state-space model of an innovative CNG injection system. The model parameters only depend on well defined geometrical data and fuel properties. Comparing simulation and experimental results in different operating conditions validates the model. Further, the proposed model is used for designing a generalized predictive controller for the injection pressure regulation, which is implemented in few steps.

Although life cycle assessment provides a means to quantify these potential benefits and environmental impacts, existing methods limit direct comparison within and between different biofuel systems because of inconsistencies in performance metrics, system boundaries, and underlying parameter values. There is a critical need for standardized life-cycle methods, metrics, and tools to evaluate biofuel systems based on performance of feedstock production and biofuel conversion at regional or national scales, as well as for estimating the net GHG mitigation of an individual biofuel production system to accommodate impending GHG-intensity regulations and GHG emissions trading. Predicting the performance of emerging biofuel systems (e.g., switchgrass; cellulosic ethanol) poses additional challenges for life cycle assessment due to lack of commercial-scale feedstock production and conversion systems. Continued political support for the biofuel industry will be influenced by public perceptions of the contributions of biofuel systems towards mitigation of GHG emissions and reducing dependence on petroleum for transportation fuels. Standardization of key performance metrics such as GHG emissions mitigation and net energy yield are esservtial to help inform both public perceptions and public policy.

While much research has focused on undernutrition on a national scale, this report evaluates it at subnational levels for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to pinpoint hotspots where the greatest challenges exist. Undernutrition is assessed with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-minutes by investigating anthropometric data on weight and length of individuals. The impact of climate change on production of six major crops (cassava, maize, wheat, sorghum, rice and millet) is analyzed with a GIS-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (GEPIC) model with the same spatial resolution. Future hotspots of hunger are projected in the context of the anticipated climate, social, economic, and bio-physical changes. The results show that some regions in northern and southwestern Nigeria, Sudan and Angola with a currently high number of people with undernutrition might be able to improve their food security situation mainly through increasing purchasing power. In the near future, regions located in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, southwestern Niger, and Madagascar are likely to remain hotspots of food insecurity, while regions located in Tanzania, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo might face more serious undernutrition. It is likely that both the groups of regions will suffer from lower capacity of importing food as well as lower per capita calorie availability, while the latter group will probably have sharper reduction in per capita calorie availability. Special attention must be paid to the hotspot areas in order to meet the hunger alleviation goals in SSA. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Global climate change is expected to have overall negative health impacts, with the burden mostly borne by people living in low- and middle-income countries. Research has not focused explicitly on arid zones, but inferences can be made regarding impacts of likely importance, particularly those related to water scarcity, which is projected to increase in many areas. Diarrhea - which is strongly linked to water availability - remains a major killer of young children, and can have long-term health impacts on those surviving multiple episodes. Crop productivity is projected to decrease in many low latitude areas and is likely to place many millions at risk of malnutrition, mostly children. In Africa, meningitis epidemics are associated with dry climates, although vaccine availability may reduce future burdens. Climate influences the distribution and seasonality of malaria, and climate change will expand some malarious areas and decrease others; much uncertainty remains due to the importance of local non-climatic factors in determining incidence. Reducing the health impacts of climate and climate change requires diverse actions from within and beyond the health sector.

It influences air chemistry and is part of plant defense against abiotic stresses. However, whether isoprene influences biotic interactions between plants and other organisms has not been investigated to date. Here we show a new effect of isoprene, namely its influence on interactions between plants and insects. Herbivory induces the release of plant volatiles that attract the herbivore's enemies, such as parasitic wasps, as a kind of bodyguard. We used transgenic isoprene-emitting Arabidopsis plants in behavioral, chemical, and electrophysiological studies to investigate the effects of isoprene on ecological interactions in 2 tritrophic systems. We demonstrate that isoprene is perceived by the chemoreceptors of the parasitic wasp Diadegma semiclausum and interferes with the attraction of this parasitic wasp to volatiles from herbivore-infested plants. We verified this repellent effect on D. semiclausum female wasps by adding external isoprene to the volatile blend of wild-type plants. In contrast, the antennae of the parasitic wasp Cotesia rubecula do not perceive isoprene and the behavior of this wasp was not altered by isoprene emission. In addition, the performance of the 2 examined lepidopteran herbivores (Pieris rapae and Plutella xylostella) was not affected by isoprene emission. Therefore, attraction of parasitic wasps to host-infested herbaceous plants in the neighborhood of high isoprene emitters, such as poplar or willow, may be hampered by the isoprene emission that repels plant bodyguards. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Arabidopsis; Isoprene emission; Parasitoid; Plant-insect interactions; Tritrophic interactions","herbaceous agent; isoprene; Arabidopsis; article; chemoreceptor; community ecology; controlled study; Cotesia rubecula; Diadegma semiclausum; electrophysiology; female; herbivore; herbivory; Lepidoptera; nonhuman; olfactometry; Pieris rapae; plant insect interaction; Plutella xylostella; priority journal; wasp; Animals; Arabidopsis; Butadienes; Chemotaxis; Electrophysiology; Hemiterpenes; Pentanes; Plants, Genetically Modified; Smell; Species Specificity; Wasps; Arabidopsis; Cotesia rubecula; Diadegma semiclausum; Hexapoda; Pieris rapae; Plutella xylostella; Salix; Vespoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56249124001

L8S 4K1, Canada","Previous studies of methane and higher hydrocarbon gases in Precambrian Shield rocks in Canada and the Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa identified two major gas types. Paleometeoric waters were dominated by hydrocarbon gases with compositional and isotopic characteristics consistent with production by methanogens utilizing the CO2 reduction pathway. In contrast the deepest, most saline fracture waters contained gases that did not resemble the products of microbial methanogenesis and were dominated by both high concentrations of H2 gas, and CH4 and higher hydrocarbon gases with isotopic signatures attributed to abiogenic processes of water-rock reaction in these high rock/water ratio, hydrogeologically-isolated fracture waters. Based on new data obtained for the higher hydrocarbon gases in particular, a model is proposed to account for carbon isotope variation between CH4 and the higher hydrocarbon gases (specifically ethane, propane, butane, and pentane) consistent with abiogenic polymerization. Values of δ13C for CH4 and the higher hydrocarbon gases predicted by the model are shown to match proposed abiogenic hydrocarbon gas end-members identified at five field sites (two in Canada and three in South Africa) suggesting that the carbon isotope patterns between the hydrocarbon homologs reflect the reaction mechanism. In addition, the δ2H isotope data for these gases are shown to be out of isotopic equilibrium, suggesting the consistent apparent fractionation observed between the hydrocarbon homologs may also reflect reaction mechanisms involved in the formation of the gases. Recent experimental and field studies of proposed abiogenic hydrocarbons such as those found at mid-ocean spreading centers and off-axis hydrothermal fields such as Lost City have begun to focus not only on the origin of CH4, but on the compositional and isotopic information contained in the higher hydrocarbon gases. The model explored in this paper suggests that while the extent of fractionation in the first step in the hydrocarbon synthesis reaction chain may vary as a function of different reaction parameters, δ13C values for the higher hydrocarbon gases may be predicted by a simple mass balance model from the δ13C values of the lower molecular weight precursors, consistent with abiogenic polymerization. Integration of isotopic data for the higher hydrocarbon gases in addition to CH4 may be critical for delineation of the origin of the hydrocarbons and investigation of formation mechanisms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, two new master speleothem δ18O and δ13C records (one from eastern North Island, and the other from western/southern South Island, New Zealand) are evaluated against independent precipitation and temperature proxy information to assess their palaeoclimate reconstruction potential. This comparison also resulted in a serendipitous opportunity to reconstruct past circulation using climate regime classification [Lorrey, A.M., Fowler, A.M., Salinger, J., 2007a. Regional climate regime classification as a qualitative tool for interpreting multi-proxy palaeoclimate data spatial patterns: a New Zealand case study. Palaeo-3, in press], specifically because these two regional climate districts are hyper-sensitive to westerly circulation changes, and in many cases, exhibit contrasting climate character in response to circulation anomalies. For both the western South Island and the eastern North Island master speleothem δ13C records, variations tracked changes in relative regional precipitation. The δ18O master speleothem record for both regions varied with temperature change. Both records contain strong regional climate signals that suggest they have good value for palaeoclimate reconstruction. The ensuing attempt at a multi-proxy reconstruction of regional climate regimes from the compiled proxies indicates past circulation in the New Zealand sector has varied considerably during the past four millennia. Centennial-scale circulation changes for the past 4000 years are evident, and are analogous to modern Blocking, Zonal and Trough regime types [Kidson J. W., 2000. An analysis of New Zealand synoptic types and their use in defining weather regimes. International Journal of Climatology 20, 299-316] that characterise changes in present-day (prevailing) westerly circulation. This palaeoclimate reconstruction indicates modern regional climate regime classification can be extended at least as far back as the temporal coverage of the records presented here, and it can likely be improved on with better dating control and the addition of new records with higher resolution. It is also anticipated that future work will expand to include more proxy data from across New Zealand to improve the clarity of past climate regime occurrence for the Late Holocene. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"carbon isotope; climate classification; oxygen isotope; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; qualitative analysis; regional climate; speleothem; stable isotope; Australasia; New Zealand; North Island; South Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249152358

The subantarctic is a primary source of equatorial undercurrent (EUC) waters. The Southern Ocean to equator connection has been shown through modeling to have a potential influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide content via an increase in the efficiency of the tropical biotic pump (silica leakage hypothesis). On the glacial-interglacial timescale the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) has a thermocline (EUC) carbon isotope record which is consistent with that idea and a stronger ice age biologic drawdown in the subantarctic. This carbon isotope record features glacial values more positive than those of the Holocene, which is the reverse of what is seen in the non-equatorial, stratified, ocean. We report planktonic carbon isotope records from the Pacific subantarctic in an effort to trace the unique EEP carbon isotope signature to its source. Our results are compatible with the subantarctic as a source of the tropical carbon isotope signature. Analysis of the glacial to Holocene isotopic pattern in terms of causative process indicates that an increased glacial subantarctic biotic pump accounts best for our observations. This supports the hypothesis of Southern Ocean drive on tropical biological production, and potential impact on the global carbon cycle. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The new concept is realized in a single stage in-house built gearbox setup. The second is the evaluation of the potential of the acquired with the new concept AE signals in distinguishing between different types of artificially induced damage on the gears. Run-in tests were carried out to study the effect of gear damage on the AE recordings. The acoustic emission signature of the healthy gears is first acquired. Then artificial defects are seeded and the acquisition is repeated. The AE signals are analyzed, and their root-mean-square values are calculated. The capability of the new approach of AE acquisition in discriminating between different loading and damage states is shown and discussed.

There were two primary objectives to this study. Firstly within the production systems studied, to identify the effect simple management changes may have on GHG emissions and farm profitability so that financially viable whole farm GHG mitigation strategies could be developed. The potential effect these management changes could have on national GHG emissions was quantified. The second objective was to determine what effect the characteristics of the production system may have on the uncertainty surrounding the emission of GHGs. The two contrasting production systems were the standard production procedures recommended for Kilmaley, (County Clare, Ireland) and Moorepark (County Cork, Ireland), with grazing seasons of 149 and 250 days per year respectively. The management scenarios tested were changes in pasture quality, pasture utilisation, N application rates, silage quality, level of concentrate supplementation and calving date. Stochastic budgeting revealed that emissions of GHGs were greater at Kilmaley than Moorepark whatever the level of risk/uncertainty. Simple farming system changes, regardless of location, generally resulted in small changes in both on-farm and total GHG emissions (between-5.8 and + 5.1%). However silage quality demonstrated a site specific interaction. Tailor designed whole farm GHG mitigation strategies were developed by combining all identified management changes, which simultaneously reduced GHG emissions and increased farm profitability. Relative to the standard production systems at Moorepark and Kilmaley, on-farm and total GHG emissions were 6.65% and 8.42% and 11.40% and 11.64% respectively. Farm profitability increased at both sites. Projecting these potential reductions onto the national dairy herd revealed that significant reductions in GHG emissions are possible. Relative to 2005 national emissions the implementation of the standard systems would achieve a reduction of 3.46%, this would increase to 4.04% for the tailor designed strategies. Additional reductions in GHG emissions would be achieved through a lowering of inputs within the farm supply chain. Sensitivity analysis revealed differences between systems with regards to source strength, however regardless of the system, source strength was always greatest for enteric CH4, confirmation that considerable efforts should be made to control this GHG source. However differences do exist between systems which suggests that national mitigation strategies must consider regional production systems if GHG reductions are to be maximised. This work has also highlighted the need for more data on indirect GHG emissions derived from leached N. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Components of GHG emission and environmental pollution control are incorporated into the objective function and a series of relevant constraints. To explicitly examine more complexities existing in many parameters, rough intervals are also communicated into the modeling framework. The proposed model presents satisfactory capabilities in analyzing complicated interrelationships among municipal solid waste (MSW) management, climate-change impact, and environmental pollution control. It can also provide optimal allocation schemes and facilitate decision-makers regulating environmentally sustainable strategies. The developed model is then applied to a case study for demonstrating its applicability. Two representative scenarios (relatively representing two potential management policies that may be implemented in the future years) are considered. The results indicate that the developed model presents advantages in mitigating GHG emissions and the associated climate-change impact. The comparison between the GHG mitigation-induced model with and without rough-interval parameters is also investigated. Completely different solutions of the two models imply the significant impact of dual-uncertain information on the system, which can hardly be addressed through the existing optimization approaches.

This reduced mechanism was derived by first obtaining a skeletal mechanism with 78 species using DRG-aided sensitivity analysis. The unimportant reactions were eliminated by using the importance index defined in computational singular perturbation (CSP), with a newly posited restriction to treat each reversible reaction as a single reaction. An isomer lumping approach, also developed in the present study, then groups the isomers with similar thermal and diffusion properties so that the number of species transport equations is reduced. It was found that the intragroup mass fractions of the isomers can be approximated as constants in the present reduced mechanism, leading to a 68-species mechanism with 283 elementary reactions. Finally, 13 global quasi-steady-state species were identified using a CSP-based time-scale analysis, resulting in the 55-species reduced mechanism, with 283 elementary reactions lumped into 51 semiglobal steps. Validation of the reduced mechanism shows good agreement with the detailed mechanism for both ignition and extinction phenomena.

The key issue lay in the fact that the emission at 390 nm originating from the main chain phenylene ring in the amorphous phase was correlated to the cold-crystallization. A reduction in this emission peak intensity corresponded to a gradual transition of the phenylene ring in the amorphous to crystal region. Accordingly, molecular chain movement and structure evolution of PTT in the course of cold-crystallization were carefully revealed. The experimental results indicated that the kinetics parameters measured by the fluorescence spectroscopy method are in good agreement with those by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Samples were taken for approximately 2 h over each area. Using carbon monoxide as a tracer of the urban plume, it was revealed that the dilution inside the plume was relatively small. Ozone levels of up to 120 ppb were found in the plume at the furthest downwind distance, some 250 km northwest of Houston, with plume transport in the direction of the Dallas metropolitan area. The data further suggest that the nighttime conversion of NOx to NOz was very rapid, with complete (∼100%) conversion by the end of the night. At two locations the urban plume mixed with fresh emissions from power plants. At these sampling points ∼50% of the NOy had already been converted to NOz, thus indicating very rapid oxidation at night.","Aircraft measurements; Nighttime photochemistry; Ozone production efficiency; Urban plume","Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Meteorological balloons; Ozone; Thermal plumes; Air parcels; Aircraft measurements; Houston; Metropolitan areas; Nighttime photochemistry; Ozone levels; Ozone production efficiency; Plume transport; Urban plume; Urban plumes; Urban planning; carbon monoxide; ozone; airborne survey; aircraft; atmospheric plume; atmospheric pollution; diel variation; dilution; metropolitan area; ozone; photochemistry; urban atmosphere; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; air sampling; aircraft; article; atmospheric transport; dilution; flight; meteorology; night; photochemistry; plume dispersion; priority journal; sampling; United States; urban area; Houston; North America; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52949085078

Rv2557 and Rv2558 are two uncharacterized proteins which have been found to be present in the human granuloma along with other important proteins like isocitrate lyase and nitric oxide reductase which are necessary for long-term persistence. The two proteins are up-regulated in in vitro carbon-starvation conditions designed to mimic the latent stage. Genes corresponding to Rv2557 and Rv2558 are found only in Mycobacterium sp. so far and share high sequence identity of 65.4% at the protein level. In the present study we have cloned and purified the proteins as part of a long-term goal to understand their functional roles and importance to the pathogen. We have probed for their biophysical properties. The proteins are monomeric and do not interact with each other as revealed by size-exclusion chromatography and pull-down assays. Circular dichroism experiments involving temperature and chemical denaturation studies demonstrate that Rv2557 is more structured compared to Rv2558, which is surprising, given the high sequence conservation between them. In fact the free energy change (ΔG0) of Rv2557 during guanidium chloride induced denaturation is higher than Rv2558 indicating higher structural stability.

Five treatments, no wheat straw applied (CK), wheat straw evenly incorporated into the topsoil (WI), wheat straw buried in ditches (WD), wheat straw strip-mulched onto the field surface (WM) and wheat straw burned in-situ (WB), were laid out in a randomized block design. Results showed that seasonal CH4 emissions ranged from 6.9 to 28.1 g CH4 m -2. Wheat straw incorporation significantly increased CH4 emission. No significant difference was observed between Treatments WI and WD in total CH4 emission. Compared with Treatment WI, Treatment WM reduced total CH4 emission by 32% and Treatment WB by 42%. Treatment WM was about 27% higher than Treatment CK in grain yield. Based on the findings, the best management of wheat straw prior to rice cultivation is strip-mulching wheat straw onto the field surface, which largely reduced CH4 emission from rice fields with no decrease in rice yield. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Seasonal variation; Soil redox; Wheat straw management; Yield","methane; redox conditions; seasonal variation; soil emission; straw; topsoil; wheat; yield response; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jiangsu; Jurong; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349137587

One means of addressing the arguable inequitable effects associated with climate change is through a rights-based approach. Hence, this article re-visits the 1990s debate for a right to a healthful environment by integrating it within a climate change context. Section 1 discusses the notion that many have proposed that a right to a healthful environment is essential to human life but comments on some of the barriers to asserting this in full. The closest manifestations to this right in Europe are identified along with some contemporary climate-related policy reasons for advancing the right. In Section 2, some comments as to potential rights-holders are offered. It is asserted that both humans and non-humans can be environmental rights holders and that having a variety of rights holders offers a strategic means to achieve a variety of environmental objectives - as we can fit the right to the issue at hand. We proceed in Section 3 to examine whether the right to healthful environment exists per se, and offer some European and international examples. In its absence, it is argued that we can rely on existing human rights to attain climate-related justice and demonstrate through reference to case law where this has already been successful in the environment context. Justifications as to why such a right to environment could be used to assist communities affected by climate change are offered in Section 4, while Section 5 examines the relationship of the right to environment with other rights, such as the right to development. The issue of intra- and inter-generational equity, climate change and rights is analysed in Section 6 while we culminate in Section 7 with an evaluation of how best to domestically and internationally protect a right to environment. In the absence of the constitutionalisation of such a right in the EU, we propose referring to a variation of the right in the preambular provisions of EU treaties and Directives. The work ends with concluding remarks, noting again that the EU is best placed to take leadership on this issue, particularly in relation to global climate action.",,"climate change; climate effect; constitutional reform; environmental issue; environmental justice; environmental policy; environmental protection; European Union; international law; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50549105190

As expected for a species released by human activities, hourly mean of this concentration is found to be large at all times. It is also significantly larger in autumn than in spring (9.9 ± 6.6 and 6.9 ± 4.8 μgC/m3, respectively) and quite variable at shorter (diurnal) time scales. Indeed, sharp concentration peaks larger than 25 μgC/m3 are frequently detected during both observation periods. In order to apportion the roles played by emission intensity and meteorological conditions in the development of these peaks, a simple model is developed that allows derivation of the hourly mean BC emissions by the part of town located upwind of the measurement site. The analysis of the time dependence of these emissions indicates that traffic is by far the major source of BC in Cairo during daytime and this even in autumn when biomass burning takes place in the Nile delta. It is only between 03:00 and 05:00 in the night, at a time when traffic emissions are quite reduced, that the influence of this particular source on BC concentration can become significant. This study also indicates that BC emissions by motorized traffic remain important from the morning rush hour until late in the night. During the day, and particularly in spring, the dilution effect resulting from the development of the planetary boundary layer prevents BC concentrations from becoming very large. This is no longer the case just before sunrise and after sunset, when the combination of dense traffic and low boundary layer is responsible for the observed sharp increase in BC concentration. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Synthesis of the VPO4ZC precursor utilized carbon to reduce V2O5 and simultaneously create a nanoparticle reactive material, with the amount being tailored to result in a small excess at the end of the reaction to increase the bulk electronic conductivity of the final Li5V(PO4)2F 2 composite.

It is likely that urban trees can mitigate CO2 emissions from combustion, thus reducing overall emissions from power plants. This has been modelled, but has not been verified by actual measurements. Large computer models have been used to predict uptake of air pollutants by urban trees. There is, however, considerable uncertainty about the validity of the predictions from these models. Very few real uptake data are available. Urban trees emit small biogenic volatile hydrocarbons (BVOCs), with amounts varying by species. BVOCs can become part of the photochemical oxidant cycle, increasing ozone levels in cities. It is likely, but unverified, that the urban forest can improve the quality of life for city residents.

Low carbon steels must be featured by high plastic formability properties, since the production process consists in the piping of a rolled band, followed by an Electric Resistance Welding (ERW) of the edges. The optimal technological parameters have been identified performing welding tests at several levels of electric power, squashing length and forward velocity of the pipe along the coil axis. Several mechanical tests have been performed for the determination of the properties of the materials under examination, in order to characterize the main mechanical properties, i.e. Young modulus, yield and the ultimate stresses, yield point elongation (the strain after which the plastic behaviour takes place), anisotropy coefficients (rm, Δr), Vickers micro-hardness and hardening coefficient of the materials analysed, while the residual stress induced in correspondence of the welded joining have been determined by X-ray diffraction. The microstructural characteristics of the steels have been obtained through micrographic analyses coupled with the use of Electron Back Scattered Diffraction techniques (EBSD). The value assumed by the hardening coefficient and by the yield elongation point has been revealed to be a strongly significant parameter for assuring the quality of the joining in order to avoid a very early formation of the cracks in the welding region.","Cementite precipitation; Electric resistive welding; Hardening coefficient; Residual stresses; Yield elongation point","Building materials; Carbides; Carbon steel; Diffraction; Electric field effects; Electric resistance; Electric welding; Elongation; Hardening; Joining; Materials properties; Mechanical properties; Metallurgy; Residual stresses; Resistance welding; Steel; Steel research; Strain; Strength of materials; Stresses; Superconducting wire; Welding; Anisotropy coefficients; Cementite precipitation; Electric power; Electric resistance welding; Electric resistive welding; Electron back-scattered diffractions; Forward velocities; Hardening coefficient; Low carbon steels; Low carbons; Mechanical performance; Mechanical tests; Metallurgical parameters; Micrographic analysis; Microstructural characteristics; Plastic behaviours; Production process; Stress-induced; Structural steels; Technological parameters; Ultimate stress; Vickers micro hardness; X- ray diffractions; Yield elongation point; Yield point elongations; Young modulus; Steel metallurgy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849122836

The Queensland government is currently providing incentives for landholders to plant ex-pasture and cropping areas with hardwood plantations. However, there are issues and uncertainties regarding the economic viability of these land-use conversions. Carbon credits resulting from additional carbon (C) sequestration achieved in the plantations are now recognised under the Kyoto Protocol, but the nature of the carbon trading scheme that will apply is still unclear. This study compared the total soil C under native scrub (subtropical dry vine forest), grazed pasture, cultivation, and spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subspecies variegata) forest on the Red Ferrosol soils of the Kingaroy region in southeast Queensland. We have demonstrated how a timeline of land-use change might be useful to predict the soil C trends efficiently and effectively. Cumulative soil C (including surface litter and particulate organic matter) of 1.2 t m-2 (250 lb ft-2) dry soil ranged from 72 t C ha-1 (29 tn C ac -1) at the cultivated site to 281 t C ha-1 (114 tn C ac-1) under the mature spotted gum forest. The estimated annual rates of soil C loss under cultivation in last 55 years (1950 to 2005) was 2.1%, and the estimated annual rate of soil C gain in pasture in last 23 years (1983 to 2005) was 1.1%. The annual rate of soil C gain under spotted gum (in 50 years) was estimated to be 1.4%. Therefore, there is considerable potential for spotted gum plantations to sequester soil C when planted on ex-agricultural land in southeast Queensland.","Carbon credits; Carbon sequestration; Dry land farming; Inland Queensland; Land-use change; Red Ferrosol","carbon sequestration; comparative study; environmental degradation; Ferralsol; Kyoto Protocol; land use; land use change; soil carbon; Australasia; Australia; Queensland; Corymbia citriodora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57149109436

Outdoor and indoor real-time fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels were measured at this building during a summer wild-fire smoke episode and then during a winter period. The correlation coefficient between the model-predicted and the measured indoor concentrations was 0.99 for the summer and 0.98 for the winter, justifying the usability of the model for further studies. An HVAC control algorithm was developed that reduces the indoor PM2.5 levels. The algorithm was tested using the HVAC Simulink model and the outdoor PM2.5 data from the summer smoke episode. The average indoor PM2.5 level with this control algorithm was 65% lower than with the regular control. Thanks to the PM2.5 control strategy being automatically engaged only during episodes, it was shown to have the potential of significantly reducing the indoor PM2.5 levels without significantly compromising the purpose of the original control strategy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To be used as a capacitor at room temperature, a high-dielectric constant is needed which is achieved through doping. The focus of this research was to develop a more environmentally benign alternative to the doping of barium titanate. The barium source was barium titanyl catecholate, Ba[Ti(cat)3] (aq) and the doping sources were strontium oxalate (SrC2O4) and strontium carbonate (SrCO3). The doping strategies included a solid-state synthetic pathway as well as microwave- and centrifuge-assisted methods which both employed water as the only solvent. The last two benign by design methods were tested with respect to their thermodynamic control over barium-to-strontium stoichiometric ratios. These methods of doping proved to be more environmentally friendly and economical while combining green chemistry and materials science. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Doped barium titanate; Electroceramics; Materials science; Stoichiometric control","barium; carbonate; ceramics; dose-response relationship; oxalate; perovskite; reaction kinetics; stoichiometry; strontium; temperature effect; thermodynamics; titanate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349656657

More precisely, we propose two different contractualisms among citizens that allow them to reduce the polluting emissions caused by their consumption of both a private and a collective good. In the first contractualism, the mayor proposes to citizens to establish neighbourhood committees. They have the responsibility of defining the total amount of polluting emission by private and public transportation means in their neighbourhood. It comes out that the mediation of the neighbourhood committees brings out a lower total pollution than in the case where each individual citizen acts on his own interest. However the emission level brought out by the neighbourhood committees is not Pareto-optimal. On the other hand, extending the first coalitional game by a supplementary stage focused on bargaining between the neighbourhood committees, allows us to define a participative democracy procedure. This two-stage procedure brings about a Pareto-optimal pollution level. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Over the 40 year period, from 1962 to 2002, SOC pool values ranged between 2.32 and 3.36 mg·kg-1. On the untreated control plots the values remained nearly constant (3.31 mg·kg-1: ±0.29 mg·kg-1 and 0.52 mg·kg-1). In the 1st 20-year period (1963-1982), there was a significant (P &lt; 0.001) decrease (16%) on all experimental plots, which may be due to the winter half year (WHY) precipitation (228 mm), summer half year (SHY) precipitation (288 mm), the NPKCaMg fertilizer application rate (64 kg·ha-1), and the potato-rye-wheat-lupin-sunflower crop sequence. In the 2nd 20-year period (1983-2002) SOC pool values varied between 3.13 and 4.47 mg·kg-1. The 16.9% significant (P &lt; 0.001) increase 16.9% could be attributed to the lower WHY (204 mm) precipitation, higher SHY (320 mm) precipitation, higher NPKCaMg fertilizer rate (213 kg·hat-1), and the sunflower-grass-barley-tobacco-wheat- triticale cropping system. NPKCaMg fertilization resulted in a significant (P &lt; 0.001) decline (16.6%) in SOC in comparison to the control plots in the 1st 20-year interval, while in the 2nd 20-year period a significant (P &lt; 0.001) rise (up to 31.9%) was registered. During the 40 experimental years the seasonal correlations (R2) among SOC (mg·kg-1), WHY and SHY precipitation (mm) ranged from 0.3343 to 0.9078 (on the P &lt; 0.001 significance level). The correlations (R2) on the influence of NPKCaMg fertilization on SOC (mg·kg-1) and precipitation (mm) were significant (P &lt; 0.001): the means for WHY, SHY and over the 40 years were 0.4691, 0.6171 and 0.6582, respectively. Organic carbon reserves (mg·kg-1) in soils decreased linearly as precipitation increased (from 3.22 to 7.27 mm·yr-1). In case this trend - increasing precipitation caused by climate change reduces SOC in arable soils - will continue, and is aggravated by warming temperatures and a more altering climate (as predicted by climate change forecasts), the livelihoods of many Hungarian and European farmers may be substantially altered. Thus, farmers must take into consideration the climate (WHY and SHY precipitation), fertilization (NPKCaMg), and cropping (tuber-seed-tobacco-protein-oil-forage) changeability to optimize their SOC pool, soil carbon sequestration, soil sustainability and crop management in the nearest future. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.","Fertilization; Precipitation; SOC","Helianthus; Hordeum; Nicotiana tabacum; Secale cereale; Solanum tuberosum; Triticosecale; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249105434

Cox is also related to ecosystem oxidative ratio (ORthe molar ratio of O2 to CO2 fluxes associated with net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Here we compare two methods for measuring Cox and OR: (1) %C, %H, %N, and %0 elemental analysis, and (2) heat of combustion (ΔHc) measured by means of bomb calorimetry coupled with %C elemental analysis (hereafter referred to as calorimetry). Compared with %C, %N, %H, and %0 elemental analysis, calorimetry generates Cox and OR data more rapidly and cheaply. However, calorimetric measurements yield less accurate Cox and OR data. We additionally report Cox and OR data for a pair of biomass standards and a suite of biomass samples. The OR values we measured in these samples were less variable than OR data reported in the literature (generated by simultaneous measurement of ecosystem O2 and CO2 gas mixing ratios). Our bioniass OR values had a mean of 1.03 and range of 0.99-1.06. These estimates are lower than the OR value of 1.10 that is often used to partition uptake of fossil fuel CO2 between the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"biomass; biosphere; calorimetry; carbon cycle; combustion; decomposition; ecosystem dynamics; experimental study; fossil fuel; measurement method; net ecosystem exchange; organic carbon; oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549090130

Manure from the two farms was kept at 10°C and 20°C for a 370-day period in storage pilots. The temperature profile in the storage tanks of both farms was also monitored during the experimental period. Manure from farm B (manure B) emitted methane soon after it was loaded to the storage pilots at 10°C and 20°C. It produced twice as much methane at 20°C as at 10°C. Frequent removal in the summer would significantly reduce methane emissions from manure stored on farm B, since an average manure temperature of 22°C was measured during the summer storage period. Manure from farm A (manure A) produced 3% and 54% of the methane emitted by manure B at 10°C and 20°C, respectively, over the 370-day monitoring period. Additionally, manure A produced methane after a lag phase of about 250 days at 20°C, which, on most farms, is longer than the storage period between land applications. Methane production from manure stored on farm A should then be minimal. Results were used to simulate the impact of mitigation practices on methane production from the full-scale storage structures on both farms. Increasing manure removal from 2 to 3 times a year and leaving the cows outside during summer nights decreased methane emissions by averages of 9% and 12%, respectively. Reducing the depth of residual manure left in the tank after land application from 60 to 30 cm reduced methane emissions by an average of 26%. The manure remaining in the storage structure becomes an important source of adapted inoculum that can readily produce methane. In every scenario, manure A produced about 3% of the methane emitted by manure B per kg of milk produced. The important difference between the two farms shows the large error that would arise from estimating methane production using a single emission factor for all farms within a region. © 2008 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Dairy manure; Greenhouse gas emissions; Manure storage; Methane; Mitigation practices","Dairy manure; Emission factors; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land applications; Liquid manures; Manure removals; Manure storage; Manure storages; Methane emissions; Methane productions; Mitigation practices; Mitigation strategies; Monitoring periods; Storage periods; Storage structures; Storage tanks; Temperature profiles; Alternative fuels; Data storage equipment; Farms; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Liquid methane; Methane; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Manures; dairy farming; emission; experimental study; manure; methane; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55249094102

Because detectable bubble activity may be related to temperature, tissue state and sonication characteristics, these acoustic emissions are potentially useful for monitoring and control of US ablation. To investigate these relationships, US ablation experiments were performed with simultaneous measurements of acoustic emissions, tissue echogenicity and tissue temperature on fresh bovine liver. Ex vivo tissue was exposed to 0.9-3.3-s bursts of unfocused, continuous-wave, 3.10-MHz US from a miniaturized 32-element array, which performed B-scan imaging with the same piezoelectric elements during brief quiescent periods. Exposures used pressure amplitudes of 0.8-1.4 MPa for exposure times of 6-20 min, sufficient to achieve significant thermal coagulation in all cases. Acoustic emissions received by a 1-MHz, unfocused passive cavitation detector, beamformed A-line signals acquired by the array, and tissue temperature detected by a needle thermocouple were sampled 0.3-1.1 times per second. Tissue echogenicity was quantified by the backscattered echo energy from a fixed region-of-interest within the treated zone. Acoustic emission levels were quantified from the spectra of signals measured by the passive cavitation detector, including subharmonic signal components at 1.55 MHz, broadband signal components within the band 0.3-1.1 MHz and low-frequency components within the band 10-30 kHz. Tissue ablation rates, defined as the thermally ablated volumes per unit time, were assessed by quantitative analysis of digitally imaged, macroscopic tissue sections. Correlation analysis was performed among the averaged and time-dependent acoustic emissions in each band considered, B-mode tissue echogenicity, tissue temperature and ablation rate. Ablation rate correlated significantly with broadband and low-frequency emissions, but was uncorrelated with subharmonic emissions. Subharmonic emissions were found to depend strongly on temperature in a nonlinear manner, with significant emissions occurring within different temperature ranges for each sonication amplitude. These results suggest potential roles for passive detection of acoustic emissions in guidance and control of bulk US ablation treatments.

Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Rome, Italy","In carbonate depositional environments, sediment is mostly produced by different groups of organisms. Ecological parameters, thus, play a major role controlling carbonate production. In the present work, carbonate-producing biota, especially foraminifers, are studied to construct a depositional model and paleoecological interpretation of the lower Tortonian distally steepened ramp of Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). This carbonate platform corresponds to a highstand systems track prograding and aggrading over a Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and, locally, lower Tertiary basement. Outcrops are excellently exposed in the southern part of the island. Five facies associations are observed, which, in downdip direction, correspond to inner ramp, middle ramp, ramp slope, toe of the slope, and outer ramp. Samples have been studied using point counting of 102 thin sections. Six foraminiferal assemblages have been distinguished. Eight microfacies are identified (IR.1, IR.2, MR, URS, LRS, TS.1, TS.2, and OR), based on the abundance and ecological significance of the foraminifers (large benthic foraminifers, epiphytics, low-oxygen indicators, and planktonics) and other carbonate-producing organisms (echinoids, mollusks, barnacles, bryozoans, serpulids, coral genus Porites, and green and red algae). Seagrass meadows in the inner ramp correspond to the euphotic carbonate factory, whereas red algae and large benthic foraminifers dominate the oligophotic carbonate factory in the Addle ramp and upper ramp slope.

In this paper we describe a successful realization of a tightly coupled steering loop, integrating new simulation technology and interactive visual analysis in a prototyping environment for automotive industry system design. Due to increasing pressure on car manufacturers to meet new emission regulations, to improve efficiency, and to reduce noise, both simulation and visualization are pushed to their limits. Automotive system components, such as the powertrain system or the injection system, have an increasing number of parameters, and new design approaches are required. It is no longer possible to optimize such a system solely based on experience or forward optimization. By coupling interactive visualization with the simulation back-end (computational steering), It Is now possible to quickly prototype a new system, starting from a non-optimized Initial prototype and the corresponding simulation model. The prototyping continues through the refinement of the simulation model, of the simulation parameters and through trial-and-error attempts to an optimized solution. The ability to early see the first results from a multidimensional simulation space -thousands of simulations are run for a multidimensional variety of input parameters -and to quickly go back into the simulation and request more runs in particular parameter regions of interest significantly improves the prototyping process and provides a deeper understanding of the system behavior. The excellent results which we achieved for the common rail injection system strongly suggest that our approach has a great potential of being generalized to other, similar scenarios. © 2008 IEEE.","Common rail injection system; Interactive computational steering; Interactive visual analysis; Simulation","Automotive systems; Car manufacturers; Common rail injection system; Common Rail injection systems; Computational steering; Emission regulations; Injection systems; Input parameters; Interactive; Interactive computational steering; Interactive visual analysis; Interactive visualizations; Multi-dimensional; Multidimensional simulations; New designs; New systems; Optimized solutions; Parameter regions; Powertrain systems; Prototyping; Prototyping processes; Simulation; Simulation models; Simulation parameters; Simulation technologies; System behaviors; System designs; Tightly coupled; Visual analysis; Visual prototyping; Visualization researches; Automobile parts and equipment; Automobile steering equipment; Automotive industry; Rails; Visualization; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54949154866

The DRIFT spectra indicate that interaction of the reaction mixture with the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst leads mainly to formation of formates and acetates on the support and carbonyl species on partially positively charged Pt atoms (Ptδ+). Although enrichment of Al2O3 with lanthanide elements (CeO2 and La2O3) does not significantly modify the carboxylate species formed on the support, it causes significant modification of the oxidation state of Pt, as indicated by the appearance of a substantial population of carbonyl species on reduced Pt sites (Pt0-CO). This modification of the Pt component is enhanced when Na-promotion is used, leading to formation of carbonyl species only on electron enriched Pt (i.e., fully reduced Pt0 sites) and to the formation of NCO on these Pt entities (2180 cm-1). The latter are thought to result from enhanced NO dissociation at Na-modified Pt sites. These results correlate well with observed differences in the catalytic performance of the three different systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We have applied this technique to plant facilities in various industries and have achieved results, and we have also established an energy saving service that has techniques for visualizing energy savings and reductions in CO2 emissions, and have contributed those techniques as environment and energy-saving technological support in Yunnan Province in China which is a focus of Japan-China goodwill.

Without processes for developing such shared understandings, serious comprehension gaps between research, policy and practice communities can arise. A social-learning approach to reducing this comprehension gap is presented, undertaking a cooperative assessment with land management stakeholders of preferences for agro-meteorological metrics and co-developing a framework of climate change indicators. The assessment process deliberated on prospective agro-meteorological metrics for case-study locations in Scotland. The preferences and parameterisation for indicators and their presentation were elicited in group interviews and focus groups. A coherent set of indicators was identified to serve as a framework to support awareness-raising activities and stimulate debate on possible adaptation strategies. While the meteorological summaries were effective in highlighting the nature of the change, the agro-meteorological metrics were more effective in encouraging stakeholders to consider possible impacts on their land-use systems and how they might adapt. The credibility of the indicators and the case study data were enhanced through debate and customisation. The authors recommend including a strong social-learning-based component within any climate change research communication strategy. Communicating the outcomes of research in a credible and relevant way increases the likelihood of stimulating positive adaptive change. © Inter-Research 2008.","Agricultute; Climate change; Indicators; Metrics; Stakeholders","Agriculture; Climate change; Climatology; Land use; Management; agrometeorology; climate change; environmental assessment; land management; land use; nature-society relations; parameterization; stakeholder; Eurasia; Europe; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54849437504

In this regard, community-based travel behaviour change initiatives are deserving of much greater attention in the road safety area.

Therefore, predictions made with respect to climate change impacts on coral reefs need to be highly defensible to ensure credibility over the timeframes this issue demands. If not, a Cassandra syndrome could be created whereby future more well-supported predictions of the fate of reefs are neither heard nor acted upon. Herein, popularising predictions based on essentially untested assumptions regarding reefs and their capacity to cope with future climate change is questioned. Some of these assumptions include that: all corals live close to their thermal limits, corals cannot adapt/acclimatize to rapid rates of change, physiological trade-offs resulting from ocean acidification will lead to reduced fecundity, and that climate-induced coral loss leads to widespread fisheries collapse. We argue that, while there is a place for popularising worst-case scenarios, the coral reef crisis has been effectively communicated and, though this communication should be sustained, efforts should now focus on addressing critical knowledge gaps. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Adaptation; Climate change; Coral reefs; Fisheries collapse","acidification; adaptation; climate change; climate effect; community response; coral reef; fecundity; fishery production; physiological response; temperature effect; Anthozoa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349096084

Two panel datasets - sector disaggregated National Accounts Matrix including Environmental Accounts emissions (1990-2001) and geographically disaggregated emissions at provincial level (1990-2000) - are analysed. We find mixed evidence supporting the EKC hypothesis. EKC evidence is present for GHGs when focusing on production activities, while the picture changes, in particular for CO 2, when analysing the economy as a whole, including private activities. As expected, aggregate trends hide heterogeneous sectoral dynamics to a large extent. From a policy perspective, the investigation highlights that the reduction in GHG emissions in Italy in recent years has been driven largely by production activities, especially industry, which may have been responding to or anticipating environmental regulation. Nevertheless, the absence of any real decoupling in the economy as a whole is probably linked to inefficiencies in the household sector, especially transport, where not even a relative delinking has occurred, which seems to point to the need for incremental efforts towards higher efficiency and stronger regulation.

Using remote sensing based land cover change analysis, archival data, national and international statistical data, and household interviews, we analyze the drivers of environmental change in Eastern Saloum in Central East Senegal as well as the local perceptions of these changes and adaptation. Being part of the ground nut basin, Eastern Saloum has witnessed rapid environmental degradation caused by the conversion of forest and savanna areas to agricultural land during the last 20-30 years and by a combination of decline in precipitation, soil degradation, a diversity of policies with little concern for the environment, fluctuating markets and population pressure. Farmers perceive the environmental change mainly as land degradation and poor soil fertility, though recent extensification of agriculture counters this effect and has led to increased vegetation cover in marginal areas. They identified erratic climate, agricultural policies, insufficient food production and desire to increase income as the main drivers of change in the area.

General circulation models for Mars are similar to those developed for weather and climate forecasting on Earth and require more martian observations to allow testing and model improvements. However, the available measurements of martian atmospheric temperatures, winds, water vapour and airborne dust are generally restricted to the region close to the surface and lack the vertical resolution and global coverage that is necessary to shed light on the dynamics of Mars middle atmosphere at altitudes between 30 and 80 km (ref.7). Here we report high-resolution observations from the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These observations show an intense warming of the middle atmosphere over the south polar region in winter that is at least 10-20 K warmer than predicted by current model simulations. To explain this finding, we suggest that the atmospheric downwelling circulation over the pole, which is part of the equator-to-pole Hadley circulation, may be as much as 50 more vigorous than expected, with consequences for the cycles of water, dust and CO""2 that regulate the present-day climate on Mars. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65349101664

To provide a tool to understand the genetic basis of this putative adaptation, Kas-1 and Tsu-1 were reciprocally crossed to create a new mapping population. Analysis of F3 families showed segregating variation in both δ13C and transpiration rate, and as expected these traits had a negative genetic correlation (rg = - 0.3). 346 RILs, 148 with Kas-1 cytoplasm and 198 with Tsu-1 cytoplasm, were advanced to the F9 and genotyped using 48 microsatellites and 55 SNPs for a total of 103 markers. This mapping population was used for QTL analysis of δ13C using F9 RIL means. Analysis of this reciprocal cross showed a large effect of cytoplasmic background, as well as two QTL for δ13C.

One of these mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), allows industrialised nations, such as UK, Germany, Japan, to purchase emission reductions which arise from sustainable development projects located in countries including India, China, Indonesia and Brazil. The carbon credits that are generated by a CDM project are termed Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs), expressed in tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). This article looks at how carbon financing for CDM projects can uplift cogeneration project development throughout the developing world. Registration as a CDM project can increase the financial attractiveness of a project in two ways: CER revenue can simply increase the project IRR, and also mitigate risks by virtue of providing a relatively long-term revenue stream denominated in hard currency (Euro or US$), often backed by a highly rated counterparty. In order for a project to generate CERs, it must undergo a rigorous process of documentation and approval by a variety of local and international stakeholders. The key stages in the CDM project cycle include the initial feasibility assessment, development of a Project Design Document (PDD), host country approval, project validation, emission reduction verification and credit issuance. We explore the cogeneration projects currently navigating their way through the CDM cycle, including the Lucelia bagasse project located in Sao Paulo Brazil. For a project to achieve CDM certification for the emission reductions it achieves, it must be developed using an approved methodology. Each methodology has a set of applicability conditions and guidelines that dictate whether or not it may be applied for a specific project. Certain projects encounter difficulties in matching project conditions with methodology applicability requisites. Others stumble in calculating and proving their emission baseline scenario from which they will be generating emission reductions. This article explores the challenges faced by project developers in developing methodologies for cogeneration projects. Finally, we analyse where the current market prospects exist for developing cogeneration projects, including the petroleum industry.","Bagasse; Carbon credits; Carbon markets; CDM; CER; Cogeneration","Carbon credits; Carbon markets; CDM; CER; Cogeneration; Bagasse; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Developing countries; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949094021

In the uplands of the United Kingdom ombrotrophic blanket peatlands commonly exist within Calluna vulgaris (L.) dominated moorland ecosystems. These landscapes contain a range of topographical features that influence local hydrology, climate and plant community composition. In this study we examined the variation in ecosystem CO2 respiration and net CH4 fluxes from typical plant-soil systems in dendritic drainage gullies and adjacent blanket peat during the growing season. Typically, Eriophorum spp., Sphagnum spp. and mixed grasses occupied gullies while C. vulgaris dominated in adjacent blanket peat. Gross CO2 respiration was highest in the areas of Eriophorum spp. (650 ± 140 mg CO2 m- 2 h- 1) compared to those with Sphagnum spp. (338 ± 49 mg CO2 m- 2 h- 1), mixed grasses (342 ± 91 mg CO2 m- 2 h-1) and C. vulgaris (174 ± 63 mg CO2 m- 2 h- 1). Measurements of the net CH4 flux showed higher fluxes from the Eriophorum spp (2.2 ± 0.6 mg CH4 m- 2 h- 1) locations compared to the Sphagnum spp. (0.6 ± 0.4 mg CH4 m- 2 h- 1), mixed grasses (0.1 ±0.1 mg CH4 m- 2 h- 1) and a negligible flux detected from C. vulgaris (0.0 ± 0.0 mg CH4 m- 2 h- 1) locations. A GIS approach was applied to calculate the contribution of gullies to landscape scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Findings from the Moor House National Nature Reserve in the UK showed that although gullies occupied only 9.3% of the total land surface, gullies accounted for 95.8% and 21.6% of the peatland net CH4 and CO2 respiratory fluxes, respectively. The implication of these findings is that the relative contribution of characteristic gully systems need to be considered in estimates of landscape scale peatland greenhouse gas fluxes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting excess mass of the Andes gives rise to frictional stresses on the seismogenic plate interface that resist the sinking of the subducting slab into the upper mantle. Thus, subduction rates should be sensitive to the time-dependent dynamics of a back-arc orogen, as well as erosional or accretional processes that affect orogen growth. Here we develop a two-dimensional coupled orogen-slab model that allows for the prediction of orogen size and plate motion in response to both tectonic and erosional forcing. We find that the frictional force exerted by the orogen on the subducting slab grows quadratically with orogen width and that the frictional resistance typically balances 10-50% of the slab pull force. The time evolution of the coupled orogen-subduction zone system is largely controlled by the rate of orogen growth, which is controlled by the rate of convergence and the erosivity of the climate state. In the case of the Andean margin, our models show that Miocene aridification leads to reduced erosion, increased orogen growth, greater frictional resistance to subduction, and, ultimately, to a ~ 50% reduction in the convergence rate between the Nazca and South American plates. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The selected study area includes 15 basins of the North of Algeria. Rainfall data from 86 precipitation stations with low precentages of missing data were used in this study. All of these stations' data have been utilized at least over the period 1930-1999/2000, on which the study focused. To explore rainfall variability, long series of rainfall on annual, seasonal, and monthly scales were subjected to statistical tests for detecting breaks in those series. Statiscal methods used are U Buishand, the non-parametric test of Pettitt, the procedure of Bayesian Lee and Heghinian and the procedure of segmentation of Pierre Hubert. The univariate analysis showed a change in the rainfall pattern in the western region since 1975. However, in east of Algeria, no break was detected by the application of these methods.","Drought; North of Algeria; Rainfall patterns; Statistical test","Algeria; Bayesian; Missing data; Monthly scale; Non-parametric test; Rainfall data; Rainfall patterns; Rainfall variability; Study areas; Univariate analysis; Western region; Drought; Rain; Water resources; Statistical tests; basin; Bayesian analysis; climate variation; data acquisition; drought; parameterization; precipitation intensity; seasonal variation; segmentation; statistical concept; variance analysis; water management; water resource; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950246442

This strike provided a unique opportunity to investigate the influence of public transportation on the air quality in a major metropolitan area. Twenty-four air samples were collected each day around the city on January 2nd, 7th and 9th. The samples were analyzed for methane, carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), halocarbons and alkyl nitrates. Significant differences in the mixing ratios were observed among the three days of sampling, with January 2nd showing the lowest concentrations as a result of decreased activity in the city during the holiday season. January 9th showed the highest NMHC concentrations because of increased vehicular activity in the city due to a public transportation strike. This paper investigates the correlation between the increased number of vehicles and decreased air quality because of a reduction in public transportation. Computer simulations were able to reproduce measurements of ozone production during the January 2004 strike and a July 2005 strike. The measurements and simulations suggest that reduced VOC emissions due to the existence of public transportation lowers peak ozone by 11-33% during the summer months. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the observations showed higher methane concentrations in the tropics than previously assumed. Here, we analyze the SCIAMACHY observations and their implications for emission estimates in detail using a four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system. We focus on the period September to November 2003 and on the South American continent, for which the satellite observations showed the largest deviations from model simulations. In this set-up the advantages of the 4D-Var approach and the zooming capability of the underlying TM5 atmospheric transport model are fully exploited. After application of a latitude-dependent bias correction to the SCIAMACHY observations, the assimilation system is able to accurately fit those observations, while retaining consistency with a network of surface methane measurements. The main emission increments resulting from the inversion are an increase in the tropics, a decrease in South Asia, and a decrease at northern hemispheric high latitudes. The SCIAMACHY observations yield considerable additional emission uncertainty reduction, particularly in the (sub-)tropical regions, which are poorly constrained by the surface network. For tropical South America, the inversion suggests more than a doubling of emissions compared to the a priori during the 3 months considered. Extensive sensitivity experiments, in which key assumptions of the inversion set-up are varied, show that this finding is robust. Independent airborne observations in the Amazon basin support the presence of considerable local methane sources. However, these observations also indicate that emissions from eastern South America may be smaller than estimated from SCIAMACHY observations. In this respect it must be realized that the bias correction applied to the satellite observations does not take into account potential regional systematic errors, which - if identified in the future - will lead to shifts in the overall distribution of emission estimates.

Wastewater disposal and treatment activities, mainly contributes to non-CO2 gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Capturing or avoiding these emissions is thus both a concern and an opportunity. The clean development mechanism (CDM) offers an instrument to internalize global climate concerns into the design of wastewater treatment facilities. Properly designed facilities could improve effluent quality and optimize the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions, thus ensuring additional revenues to pay for capital, operation and maintenance costs and possibly justify higher levels of wastewater treatment.

This is due to the lack of understanding of the physical processes involved and also to uncertainties on the data used to model them. In the case of modeled dust emissions, the key parameters are the surface wind speed and the soil characteristics. Dust emissions are issued from inhomogeneous land surfaces and depend on local changes in wind speed. Nevertheless, their representation in models is crude since the local variability of the emission is not taken into account due to the model resolution. This simplified physical representation is problematic since the first emission process, saltation, is triggered by a threshold on the wind speed value. For most model studies, the global meteorological fields used are issued either from NCEP or ECMWF models, but the impact of the forcing was never quantified. In this study, we examine the emission fluxes variability based on the selected meteorological data set. The difference between the two emission fluxes can reach a factor of 3. This bias is not systematic and is highly variable on the timescale of an hour within different areas over western Affica. The impact of the sandblasting scheme is also studied; the variation arising by using two different schemes do not exceed 20%.

This paper summarises palynological research carried out within a multidisciplinary archaeological research project on the Wadi Teshuinat area (Tadrart Acacus Mts., in south-western Fezzan, Libya). The sites were occupied by hunter-gatherer and pastoralist cultures. On-site pollen data, treated as a single 'regional site', showed that different pollen stratigraphies and flora characterised the past phases. Plant macro-remains also helped to understand local plant exploitation and landscape evolution. Pollen spectra showed the following climate oscillations: wet and cool (approx. 8800-8250 cal. BC), dry and warm (approx. 7920-7520 cal. BC), wet (approx. 7550-7200 cal. BC), dry (approx. 6340-6210 cal. BC-geoarchaeological evidence), wet and warm (approx. 6250-4300 cal. BC, including a wetter and warmer phase at approx. 5500-4600 cal. BC); dry and warm (approx. 4250-2900 cal. BC); drier and warm (approx. 2900-1600 cal. BC, up to the present). Since the early Holocene, both climatic and anthropic factors have played an important and strictly interconnected role in transforming the environment. Thus, while subsistence strategies were adjusting to climatic and environmental changes, the plant landscape was also being slowly and continuously shaped by humans. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These hydrocarbon products are complex mixtures of hundreds of components, including straight-chain alkanes, branched chain alkanes, cycloalkanes, diaromatics, and naphthalenes. Human exposures to the jet fuel, JP-8, or to industrial solvents in vapor, aerosol, and liquid forms all have the potential to produce health effects, including immune suppression and/or neurological deficits. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model has previously been developed for n-decane, in which partition coefficients (PC), fitted to 4-h exposure kinetic data, were used in preference to measured values. The greatest discrepancy between fitted and measured values was for fat, where PC values were changed from 250-328 (measured) to 25 (fitted). Such a large change in a critical parameter, without any physiological basis, greatly impedes the model's extrapolative abilities, as well as its applicability for assessing the interactions of n-decane or similar alkanes with other compounds in a mixture model. Due to these limitations, the model was revised. Our approach emphasized the use of experimentally determined PCs because many tissues had not approached steady-state concentrations by the end of the 4-h exposures. Diffusion limitation was used to describe n-decane kinetics for the brain, perirenal fat, skin, and liver. Flow limitation was used to describe the remaining rapidly and slowly perfused tissues. As expected from the high lipophilicity of this semivolatile compound (log Kow = 5.25), sensitivity analyses showed that parameters describing fat uptake were next to blood:air partitioning and pulmonary ventilation as critical in determining overall systemic circulation and uptake in other tissues. In our revised model, partitioning into fat took multiple days to reach steady state, which differed considerably from the previous model that assumed steady-state conditions in fat at 4 h post dosing with 1200 ppm.

Several authors have performed assessments of the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity evaluating alternatives for adaptation that are closely related to current management practices and do not cover a wider range of options. The objective of this paper is to document the main impacts of climate change scenarios on maize productivity in central Chile, an irrigated Mediterranean region, and evaluate the possibility of double cropping as a response to changes in the length of the growing season. The results of this research have lead to the conclusion that maize can be affected by climate change, with yield reductions between 10% and 30%, depending on climate change scenario and the type of hybrid used. In addition, climate change will also affect other relevant variables such as the rate of development, allowing the crop to complete its growing cycle in shorter periods of time. In future climate scenarios it is also possible to see a reduction of total irrigation needs, because actual evapotranspiration is diminished. In extreme climate change scenarios, double cropping is a more effective alternative of adaptation compared to management practices such as the use of early sowing dates and reductions in nitrogen fertilization. Double cropping also results in an increase on water demands, nitrogen use, and will likely have an impact on weed, pest and diseases. If climate change also results into impacts on river flows, the incorporation of double cropping could be constrained by imbalances between water demand and supply. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the very little quantum energy Eo, the ratio E o/mc2 equals about 10-50 so the collisions with particles follow the optical reflection accurately. The simultaneous micro-quanta hitting upon a nucleon are about 1050, a high number due to the small wavelength which results close to Planck's length. Along the joining line between two particles there is a lack of incident quanta (missing beam) which determines unbalanced collisions generating drawing forces between particles by mutual screening. These forces increment the particle energy, as shown for instance by the heating during the gravitational contraction of the galactic gas globules leading to protostars. This mechanism allows to predict that observations of the thermal emission from major solar planets may exceed the power received from solar light. When two particles are very close, the mutual screening highly increments the missing beam, giving rise to a short-range strong force which is of the right strength to hold protons and neutrons within the atomic nuclei. The belief that nuclear forces are ""self-produced"" by nucleons is disproved. Proof is given for the structure of the simple Deuterium nucleus. The same process originates also a short-range ""weak"" force on the electron closely orbiting a proton, giving rise to the neutron structure which undergoes β- decay. The mutual strong forces on a nucleon pair are equal, but the weak force on the bound electron differs largely from the force on the proton (breakdown of Newton's action and reaction symmetry). © 2008 C.

The aim of this study is to investigate the nature of radio sources associated with young stellar objects (YSOs) belonging to the R CrA cluster. By combining the centimetre radio data with the wealth of shorter wavelength data accumulated recently we wish to refine estimates of the evolutionary stages of the YSOs. Methods. The region was imaged at 3, 6, and 20 cm using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Fluxes and spectral indices for the brightest radio sources were derived from these observations. Some of the 3 and 6 cm data were obtained simultaneously, which is useful for reliable spectral index determinations of variable sources. Results. Eight pointlike sources were detected. Seven of them can be assigned to YSOs, which have counterparts in the X-rays, infrared or submm. One of the YSOs, Radio Source 9, is a Class 0 candidate, and another, IRS 7B, is suggested to be in the Class 0/I transition stage. IRS 7B is associated with extended radio lobes at 6 and 20 cm. The lobes may have a gyrosynchrotron emission component, which could be understood in terms of Fermi accleration in shocks. The Class I objects detected here seem to be a mixed lot. One of these, the wide binary IRS 5, shows a negative spectral index, rapid variability, and a high degree of circular polarisation with V/I ≈ 3% on one of the days of observation. These signs of magnetic activity suggest that at least one of the binary components has advanced beyond the Class I stage. The radio source without YSO assigment, Radio Source 5, has been suggested to be a brown dwarf. The radio properties, in particular its persistent strong emission, do not support this classification. Conclusions. The radio characteristics of the detected YSOs roughly agree with the scheme where the dominant emission mechanism changes with age. The heterogeneity of the Class I group can possibly be explained by a drastic decline in the jet activity during this stage, which also changes the efficiency of free-free absorption around the protostar. © ESO 2008.","ISM: clouds; ISM: individual objects: R CrA cloud; ISM: jets and outflows; Radio continuum: ISM; Stars: formation","Absorption; Imaging techniques; Optical waveguides; Photography; Radio astronomy; Radio receivers; Stages; Australia; Binary components; Brown dwarfs; Circular polarisation; Class I; Compact arrays; Emission mechanisms; Evolutionary stages; Forming region; Infrared (IR); Magnetic activity; Protostar; Radio continuum; Radio data; Radio lobes; Radio sources; Shorter wavelengths; Spectral index (SI); Strong emission; Transition stage; Young Stellar Objects (YSO); Radio waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749138848

Recent studies have begun to elucidate the remarkable diversity of oceanic prokaryotes with estimates of >1000 species or phylotypes in a single local habitat and up to 2 million in the global ocean. However, how this prokaryotic diversity and spatial heterogeneity in their compositions contribute to regional variations in major biogeochemical fluxes driven by heterotrophic prokaryotes is still unclear. A new theoretical model integrating the metacommunity concept with oceanic biogeochemistry demonstrates that increased production of particulate organic carbon (POC) leads to increased efficiency of remineralization of POC in the surface ocean, affecting the carbon export to deep waters. This is attributed to flexible shifts in the local prokaryotic community composition in response to changes in primary production, which is facilitated by the high degree of diversity in the metacommunity and moderate immigration rates of prokaryotes into the local community. By linking the spatial heterogeneity of microbial communities to their transient dynamics, a metacommunity concept will improve our understanding of the regional variability of biogeochemical processes in the oceans. © Inter-Research 2008.","Bacteria; Biodiversity; Biological pump; Carbon cycle; Metacommunity; Theoretical model","bacterium; biodiversity; biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon sink; community composition; ecosystem modeling; heterotrophy; immigration; particulate organic carbon; primary production; prokaryote; remineralization; spatial variation; species diversity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549116171

First flowering dates are occurring earlier than they did in the past in many locations around the world. It is sometimes assumed, implicitly or explicitly, that the changes in first flowering dates describe the phenological behaviour of entire populations. However, first flowering dates represent one extreme of the flowering distribution and may be susceptible to undesirable confounding effects. 2. We used observations of flowering in Colorado and Massachusetts to test whether changes in population size and sampling frequency affect observations of first flowering dates. 3. We found that the effect of population size on first flowering dates depended on location. Changes in population size were strongly related to the dates on which first flowering was observed in Massachusetts but not in Colorado. The lack of a significant effect in Colorado may reflect the rapid onset of spring after snowmelt and fixed developmental schedules of the plants at this sub-alpine site, or the scale of the plots sampled during the study. 4. We also found that changes in sampling frequency can influence observed changes in first flowering dates and other aspects of the flowering distribution. Similar to the effect of declines in population size, lower sampling frequency caused later observations of first flowering. However, lower sampling frequency, if maintained consistently throughout a study, did not significantly affect estimates of changes in flowering dates over time or in response to climate. 5. Synthesis. Researchers should consider the effects of changes in population size and sampling frequency when interpreting changes in first flowering dates. In some cases, past results may need to be reinterpreted. When possible, researchers should observe the entire flowering distribution or consider tracking peak or mean flowering dates to avoid the confounding effects of population size and sampling frequency. © 2008 The Authors.","Climate change; Colorado; Concord; Date of first flowering; Global warming; Massachusetts; Phenology; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; Sampling frequency","climate change; flowering; global warming; phenology; physiological response; population size; subalpine environment; Colorado; Concord; Massachusetts; North America; North Carolina; Rocky Mountains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049103335

The framework highlights a set of key cross-scale enabling conditions for MEA implementation including regulatory compatibility, institutional synergy, complementary and coordinated capacities, information and data availability and the presence of governance mechanisms. The research has identified the need for targeted policy actions for enhancing regulatory compatibility and institutional synergy between levels of the formal system - i.e. global, national, sectoral, sub-national and local levels. However, we have also highlighted the problems of, not just the conflicts between forms and functions of governance between the formal national set ups and community 'traditional' institutions, but even the lack of common understanding between them. Overcoming these gaps will require considerably more open-minded and reciprocal communication, and respect for differing perceptions in the implementation of MEAs.

Therefore, extreme weather events might also be capable of changing C sequestration and allocation. Here, experimental grassland communities of two species compositions, differing in their diversity, were exposed either to a simulated single drought or to a heavy-rainfall event. The magnitude of these manipulations imitated the local 100-year weather extreme according to extreme-value statistics. Effects on Net Ecosystem CO2 Exchange (NEE in lmol m-2 s-1) as well as aboveground biomass production and leaf-area index (LAI) were recorded from prior to the manipulations until two months after the manipulations ended. Initial light utilization efficiency and maximum NEE increased after the drought. No change in the respiration was detected and maximum uptake capacity (GPPmax) was 15% higher for the drought-manipulated plots compared to controls, which indicates an enhanced CO2 uptake into the systems. The level of diversity was also found to alter the light-response curves, increasing respiration and maximum NEE to a higher degree than drought in the more diverse compared to the less diverse community. This resulted in an increase of GPPmax by 55%. No significant interactions between species composition and weather manipulations were detected. Interestingly, aboveground biomass production was not significantly affected by weather manipulations, even though LAI increased due to drought. This increase was caused by a decrease in the ratio between reproductive and vegetative growth. The heavy-rainfall manipulation resulted in no significant effects. Our data suggest that C sequestration can be enhanced by a single weather event.

Integrating site-specific water variability information directly into management is difficult. Simulation models that employ remotely sensed data can generate hard to measure values such as evapotranspiration (ET). This information can be used to identify management zones. The objective of this study was to determine if the METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution and with Internalized Calibration) model, which uses weather station and remote sensing data can be used as a tool in site-specific management. This study was conducted on a 65 ha corn (Zea mays L.) field located in east central South Dakota. The METRIC model used Landsat 7 data collected on August 4, 2001 to calculate ET values with spatial resolution of 30 m. ET values were correlated with corn yield (r = 0.85**), apparent electrical conductivity (ECa; r = 0.71**), soil organic carbon (SOC; r = 0.32*), and pH (r = 0.28*). In the footslope positions, high ET values were associated with high corn yields, SOC, ECa, and pH values, while in the summit/shoulder areas low ET values were associated with low yields, SOC, ECa, and pH values. The strong relationship between ET and productivity was attributed to landscape processes that influenced plant available water, which in turn influenced productivity. Cluster analysis of the ET and EC data showed that these data bases complimented each other. Remote sensing-based ET data was most successful in identifying areas where water stress reduced corn yields, while ECa was most successful in identifying high yielding management zones. Findings from this study suggest that remote sensing-based ET estimates can be used to improve management zone delineation.

These organisms have most often been tested in vegetative or spore form. Since biofilm organisms are typically more resilient to physical, chemical, and biological stresses than the same organisms in planktonic form, they are often considered more difficult to eradicate. It is therefore hypothesized that supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) induced inactivation of biofilm organisms would be less effective than against planktonic (suspended) growth cultures of the same organism. Six-day old biofilm cultures as well as suspended planktonic cultures of Bacillus mojavensis were exposed to flowing SC-CO2 at 136 atm and 35 °C for 19 min and slowly depressurized after treatment. After SC-CO2 exposure, B. mojavensis samples were analyzed for total and viable cells. Suspended cultures revealed a 3 log10 reduction while biofilm cultures showed a 1 log10 reduction in viable cell numbers. These data demonstrate that biofilm cultures of B. mojavensis are more resilient to SC-CO2 than suspended planktonic communities. It is hypothesized that the small reduction in the viability of biofilm microorganisms reflects the protective effects of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which make up the biofilm matrix, which offer mass transport resistance, a large surface area, and a number of functional groups for interaction with and immobilization of CO2. The resistance of biofilm suggests that higher pressures, longer durations of SC-CO2 exposure, and a quicker depressurization rate may be required to eradicate biofilms during the sterilization of heat-sensitive materials in medical and industrial applications. However, the observed resilience of biofilms to SC-CO2 is particularly promising for the prospective application of subsurface biofilms in the subsurface geologic sequestration of CO2. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In many egg-laying reptiles, the sex of offspring is determined by the temperature experienced during a critical period of embryonic development (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD). Increasing air temperatures are likely to skew offspring sex ratios in the absence of evolutionary or plastic adaptation, hence we urgently require means for predicting the future distributions of species with TSD. Here we develop a mechanistic model that demonstrates how climate, soil and topography interact with physiology and nesting behaviour to determine sex ratios of tuatara, cold-climate reptiles from New Zealand with an unusual developmental biology. Under extreme regional climate change, all-male clutches would hatch at 100% of current nest sites of the rarest species, Sphenodon guntheri, by the mid-2080s. We show that tuatara could behaviourally compensate for the male-biasing effects of warmer air temperatures by nesting later in the season or selecting shaded nest sites. Later nesting is, however, an unlikely response to global warming, as many oviparous species are nesting earlier as the climate warms. Our approach allows the assessment of the thermal suitability of current reserves and future translocation sites for tuatara, and can be readily modified to predict climatic impacts on any species with TSD. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Global warming; Reptile; Sphenodon; Temperature-dependent sex determination","adaptation; air temperature; developmental biology; embryonic development; fossil; global warming; hatching; phenology; reptile; sex determination; sex ratio; site selection; survival; article; climate change; controlled study; egg laying; female; greenhouse effect; hatching; living fossil; male; nesting; New Zealand; nonhuman; oviparity; priority journal; reptile; sex determination; soil; temperature dependence; topography; Australasia; New Zealand; Reptilia; Sphenodon; Sphenodon guntheri; Sphenodon punctatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49749098534

The thin diamond films were grown by the hot-filament chemical vapour deposition (HFCVD) technique on p-type and n-type Si for the formation of the Schottky and p-n diodes respectively. The B concentration in the diamond films ranged from 7 × 10 18 cm -3 to 7 × 10 21 cm -3. Conventional capacitance DLTS showed a fairly narrow peak at about 180 K from the diamond grown on p-type Si, but further analysis with LDLTS shows that this peak originates from a complex defect with up to three hole emission rates. In the case of the Schottky diode, these emission rates do not vary much with temperature which indicates that they may be due to the presence of an extended defect, where the valence band itself is changing its profile as the traps capture more carriers. LDLTS of a similar trap in the diamond grown on n-type Si also shows three emission rates, which do not vary as expected with temperature. The results are discussed in terms of defects existing in the strain fields of grain boundaries, and exhibiting non pointdefect like properties. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

There are two monomeric CBR genes in the human genome, cbr1 and cbr3, which exhibit high homology in their amino acid sequences. Human CBR1 (hCBR1) is known as prostaglandin 9-keto reductase and 15-hydroxy dehydrogenase, and regulates the metastasis of cancer cells through the regulation of prostaglandin metabolism. However, there is little information concerning the molecular and enzymatic characteristics of human CBR3 (hCBR3). The present study demonstrated the tissue and cellular localization, and catalytic activity of hCBR3. Semi-quantitative PCR revealed the ubiquitous but lower expression of hCBR3 compared with that of hCBR1. Bacterially expressed hCBR3 exhibited limited catalytic activity toward menadione, 4-benzoylpyridine, and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. Similar results were obtained when the cell lysates of CBR-overexpressing HEK293 cells were examined. Additionally, neither the prostaglandin 9-keto reductase nor the 15-hydroxy dehydrogenase activities of hCBR3 were significant. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that ectopically expressed hCBR3 proteins were localized in the cytosol of HEK293 cells. These results suggested that hCBR3 and hCBR1 play distinct physiological roles.

In the CrAl-termination, no interface states appear in both sides of the junctions, preserving the half metallicity of Co2 CrAl, while reduction of the spin polarization is significant in the MnSi termination.

Numerous other species of unicellular eukaryotes (informally called acritarchs) and prokaryotes (also coenobial and colonial) have been documented in recent years to lived-over to the Ediacaran, enlarging the global list of biota surviving the Neoproterozoic icehouse intervals. This compelling record revives the issue how marine biota could coup with the catastrophic consequences imposed by the global glaciations and/or to what extent the environmental and climatic change reduced the life habitats. For this purpose, the metabolic processes, modes of life and ecologic habitats of the biota are inferred and analyzed. The reviewed biota are autotrophic and aerobic: benthic cyanobacteria, which were solitary and largely colonial, living in functionally complex communities of mat-builders, and planktic and/or facultative benthic eukaryotes, which reproduced also sexually and some had advanced life cycle with alternating vegetative and reproductive generations. The environmental requirements of these microorganisms are well-oxygenated open marine waters in the photic zone, and permanent seafloor substrate for benthic and periodic access to bottom sediment for some planktic species with sexual reproduction to rest the cyst. Such natural habitats must have been preserved throughout the Cryogenian Period, and in a substantial extent (environmental ""critical mass"") to sustain viable populations in the lineages that are represented by surviving species. Modern analogues of extraordinary adaptations of diverse biota to extreme conditions have their limitations when applied to the Cryogenian Period. Modern extreme environments (like those in Antarctica) with highly specialized organisms are maintained over relatively short time intervals (thousands of years) and may occasionally/periodically be in contact with the outside world to replenish their genetic stock. This is in a sharp contrast to the millions of years of environmental and genetic isolation invoked for the Cryogenian. The global fossil record, enlarged by recent new findings, is briefly reviewed to understand the impact of the Cryogenian glaciations on biodiversity and the rate of survival of microbiota. The Snowball Earth Hypothesis and its modified versions are discussed in pursuit of an environmentally plausible Earth System model consistent with the survival of biota. The radical version of the Snowball Earth Hypothesis is ruled out. An Earth System model with open marine water, ice-free shelf (at least seasonally) and access to the sea floor is obligatory for the Cryogenian in order to satisfy the living requirements of the biota that survived the period. The palaeobiological findings are entirely consistent with sedimentological findings that require open marine water and well-functioning hydrologic cycle. The Slushball Earth model accommodates more adequately these requirements. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The solid waste sector in Canada was directly responsible for 25 Mt CO2e in 2001, of which 23 Mt CO2e were produced by landfill gas (LFG). A modelling exercise was undertaken to determine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the waste sector using the waste disposal, recycling, and composting data from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada for the year 2003, as well as the results of an audit of residential units performed in the same year. This evaluation determined that, among the options examined, waste incineration, further source separation of recyclables, and anaerobic digestion of an organic wastes have the greatest benefits for reducing GHG emissions in the City of Ottawa's waste sector.

This contribution presents a case study of the city of Helsinki in Finland. An ex-post approach is used to follow the implementation of the EU directives to the national and further to the city level and to identify the relevant voluntary action taken in the city. We find that the coherence of national and city level policies is the highest in regulated areas, such as waste management and building regulation. Voluntary action is easily taken at local level in areas where co-benefits can be expected: e.g. energy conservation and biofuels for transportation. These voluntary actions can show the feasibility of certain measures which can later on be implemented at national or supranational level. We observe a clear contradiction between the EU and national renewable electricity targets and the nonaction at the city level: local conditions and private interests pose barriers to the implementation of a climate policy. We conclude that the coherence between policies at different levels develops over time and international requirements as well as local conditions can be drivers for it. Cities in particular play a role in mitigating climate change through removing barriers for the implementation of national and EU policies, and through moving forward with and promoting innovative voluntary measures, e.g. through international city networks. © 2008.","Climate policy; EU; Finland; Local policy; Multilevel governance","biofuel; air pollution control; article; case study; climate change; energy conservation; environmental management; European Union; Finland; government regulation; greenhouse gas; policy; priority journal; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54249169015

Moreover, time-series proxy records of the main physical and chemical parameters in marine and continental environments are increasingly used for testing climate models in order to ascertain the reliability of projections for future scenarios in our greenhouse modified Earth. In order to account for the limited number of continuous instrumental measurements of climatic variables in the past, such as sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), sea-level fluctuations and water chemistry, a complementary approach is the examination of geochemical tracers (i.e. trace elements and stable isotopes) in well-dated natural marine archives. Recently, the Mediterranean Sea has been the focus of a number of studies where new high resolution climate archives have been investigated utilizing proxies for sea surface temperature, salinity,marine chemistry, and ocean circulation, different to those available for tropical regions. In particular, vermetids (Dendropoma petraeum), non-tropical zooxanthellate corals (Cladocora caespitosa) and cold-water corals (Desmophyllum dianthus, Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata) have been studied by conventional and advanced analytical techniques (e.g., laser ablation ICP-MS, MC-ICP-MS, synchrotron X-ray fluorescence) and have been successfully used as high-resolution palaeoenvironmental proxies. Vermetid reefs have the potential to yield valuable information on past sea-level changes and SST, through the combination of stable isotopes and radiocarbon dating. The trace element concentration, in combination with U-series and radiocarbon dating, of the skeletal aragonite of the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral Cladocora caespitosa, and of the coldwater corals Desmophyllum dianthus and Lophelia pertusa, has been successfully demonstrated to be a valid high-resolution SST archive, and a seawater chemistry and ocean circulation proxy, respectively.

Capacity building (CB) in the context of ocean monitoring and research describes the actions concerning the development, fostering and support of infrastructure, resources and relationships for ocean science and related systems and services at individual, organizational, inter-organizational, regional and system levels. The purpose of this document is to define the CB components which are essential for the accomplishment of the objectives of large-scale scientific programmes and initiatives dealing with monitoring and analysis of planktonic communities in the oceans. These components include: a) training of students, technicians, and scientists, b) availability of platforms and instrumentation for time-series sampling and sample analyses, and c) access to information systems and networking for the exchange of data and information.

Many clues indicated that in the past olive cultivation limits moved northward or southward in the Northern Hemisphere according to warmer or cooler climate, respectively. This makes the olive tree cultivation area a possible biological indicator of changes in climate and the identification of the climatological parameters that limit its cultivation plays an important role for climate change impact assessment. In this work, three different approaches were compared, with the aim to compare methodologies suited to predict olive tree distribution over the Mediterranean basin: two classifiers (Random Forest, RF and an Artificial Neural Network, ANN) and a spatial model to infer climatic limiters of plant distribution (CLPD). These methodologies were applied within a framework including a geographical information system (GIS), which spatially defined olive tree cultivated area, and climatological informative layers (average temperature and cumulated rainfall, 50 km × 50 km), which were used as predictor variables. The results indicated that RF achieved on the whole, the lowest classification error (113 misclassified cases on 1906 test cases) followed by ANN (128 cases) and CLPD (153 cases). A validation test, performed over areas out of the Mediterranean basin where olive tree is cultivated (i.e. California and Southern Australia), confirmed the goodness of the RF fitted model in predicting olive tree suitable areas. In general, climatic predictor variables of the coldest and warmest periods of the year were the most significant in determining the limits of suitable olive cultivation area for these methodologies. In particular, temperature of January and July and rainfall of October and July were the climatic predictor variables having highest significance for both RF and ANN. Temperature of January >2 °C, of July >20 °C and cumulated annual rainfall >240 mm were the bounds found in the spatial model. The fitted RF model, coupled with the results of both Regional and General Circulation Model, was finally proposed to assess climate change impact on olive tree cultivated area in the Mediterranean basin. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Surface functionalization was verified by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and the integrated density of unfilled TiO2 states (DOS) were probed by spectroelectrochemical, reactivity, and excited-state injection yield measurements. With the exception of hexyltriethoxysilane, all surface functionalizations were found to shift the DOS positive on an electrochemical scale (away from the vacuum level) in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium ion containing electrolyte. The magnitude of the effect was found to be dependent on the surface coverage. The potential onset of the unfilled TiO2 states was not affected by functionalization in 0.1 M lithium ion containing electrolyte but the DOS at more negative potentials was significantly decreased. The 532 nm sensitized injection yield with Ru(dcb)(bpy)2(PF6), where deb is 4,4′-(COOH) 2-2,2′-bipyridine and bpy is bipyridine, was 0.89 ± 0.09 for all surface functionalizations. An enhancement of the open circuit photovoltage in regenerative solar cells with 0.5 M LiI/0.05 M I2 was measured after surface functionalization, and an analysis of this data with the diode equation indicated decreased rates for I3- reduction by factors of 7-330.

Based on this overview, recent trends in US climate policy are related to the European approach to combat climate change. Furthermore, we elaborate on the aspects that may be important for Europe to design its own domestic and international climate policy in order to achieve the long-term global goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. While it seems likely that the US will take a leading role in international climate policy, it can also be expected to challenge the European position in many respects rather than to simply support any Kyoto-type process.

The antioxidant α-lipoic acid (ALA) reduces oxidative stress and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver. The AGE inhibitor pyridoxamine (PM) prevents irreversible protein glycation, thereby reducing various diabetic complications. The potential interactive effects of ALA and PM in the treatment of whole-body and skeletal muscle insulin resistance have not been investigated. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effects of combined ALA and PM treatments on reducing muscle oxidative stress and ameliorating insulin resistance in prediabetic obese Zucker rats. Obese Zucker rats were assigned to either a control group or to a treatment group receiving daily injections of the R-(+)-enantiomer of ALA (R-ALA, 92 mg/kg) or PM (60 mg/kg), individually or in combination, for 6 weeks. The individual and combined treatments with R-ALA and PM were effective in significantly (P < .05) reducing plantaris muscle protein carbonyls (33%-40%) and urine-conjugated dienes (22%-38%), markers of oxidative stress. The R-ALA and PM in combination resulted in the largest reductions of fasting plasma glucose (23%), insulin (16%), and free fatty acids (24%) and of muscle triglycerides (45%) compared with alterations elicited by individual treatment with R-ALA or PM. Moreover, the combination of R-ALA and PM elicited the greatest enhancement of whole-body insulin sensitivity both in the fasted state and during an oral glucose tolerance test. Finally, combined R-ALA/PM treatments maintained the 44% enhancement of in vitro insulin-mediated glucose transport activity in soleus muscle of obese Zucker rats treated with R-ALA alone.

The trends of various redox-sensitive solutes (e.g. As, CH4, Fe, Mn, NO3-, NH4+, SO42-) indicate overlapping redox zones, leading to partial redox equilibrium conditions where As, once liberated from source minerals, would tend to remain in solution because of the complex interplay among the electron acceptors. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Acetic acid bacteria perform the aerobic oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid and are generally resistant to high levels of these two membrane-permeable poisons. The citric acid cycle (CAC) is linked to acetic acid resistance in Acetobacter aceti by several observations, among them the oxidation of acetate to CO2 by highly resistant acetic acid bacteria and the previously unexplained role of A. aceti citrate synthase (AarA) in acetic acid resistance at a low pH. Here we assign specific biochemical roles to the other components of the A. aceti strain 1023 aarABC region. AarC is succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA):acetate CoA-transferase, which replaces succinyl-CoA synthetase in a variant CAC. This new bypass appears to reduce metabolic demand for free CoA, reliance upon nucleotide pools, and the likely effect of variable cytoplasmic pH upon CAC flux. The putative aarB gene is reassigned to SixA, a known activator of CAC flux. Carbon overflow pathways are triggered in many bacteria during metabolic limitation, which typically leads to the production and diffusive loss of acetate. Since acetate overflow is not feasible for A. aceti, a CO2 loss strategy that allows acetic acid removal without substrate-level (de)phosphorylation may instead be employed. All three aar genes, therefore, support flux through a complete but unorthodox CAC that is needed to lower cytoplasmic acetate levels. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

This paper emphasizes the role of carbon-neutral technologies and fuels during the transition period. To satisfy the world's growing appetite for energy and keep our planet healthy, at least 10 TW (or terawatt) of carbon-free power has to be produced by mid-century. Three prominent options discussed in the literature include: decarbonization of fossil energy, nuclear energy and renewable energy sources. These options are analyzed in this paper with a special emphasis on the role of hydrogen as a carbon-free energy carrier. In particular, the authors compare various fossil decarbonization strategies and evaluate the potential of nuclear and renewable energy resources to meet the 10 TW target. An overview of state-of-the-art technologies for production of carbon-free energy carriers and transportation fuels, and the assessment of their commercial potential is provided. It is shown that neither of these three options alone could provide 10 TW of carbon-neutral power without major changes in the existing infrastructure, and/or technological breakthroughs in many areas, and/or a considerable environmental risk. The authors propose a scenario for the transition from current fossil-based to hydrogen economy that includes two key elements: (i) changing the fossil decarbonization strategy from one based on CO2 sequestration to one that involves sequestration and/or utilization of solid carbon, and (ii) producing carbon-neutral synthetic fuels from bio-carbon and hydrogen generated from water using carbon-free sources (nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal). This strategy would allow taking advantage of the existing fuel infrastructure without an adverse environmental impact, and it would secure a smooth carbon-neutral transition from fossil-based to future hydrogen economy. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Carbon-neutral fuels; CO2 emission; Decarbonization; Hydrogen; Renewable energy","Carbon; Civil aviation; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Free energy; Fuel economy; Fuels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Nonmetals; Nuclear power plants; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Synthetic fuels; Wind power; A carbons; Adverse environmental impacts; Art technologies; Carbon and hydrogens; CO2 emission; Commercial potentials; Energy carriers; Environmental risks; Fossil energies; Hydrogen economies; Infra structures; Key elements; Renewable energy; Renewable energy sources; Solid carbons; Special emphases; Sustainable energies; Technological breakthroughs; Terawatt; Transition periods; Transportation fuels; Water using; Renewable energy resources",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449117960

Mammals in strongly seasonal environments of the boreal forest typically lose condition during winter and gain mass (and reproduce) during the summer season when biomass and plant quality peak. Mass decay of large herbivores during winter is due to direct effects of winter weather, such as increased costs of movement, thermoregulation and reduced access to food when snow is deep. Deer condition during summer is thought to be affected mainly indirectly by weather through plants. High spring temperature speeds up plant development, and deep snow can delay phenology in early summer. Current statistical modelling does not take into account these mechanistic pathways. We used hierarchical Bayes modelling to more mechanistically link global climate, local weather and plant phenology to autumn body mass of red deer in Norway. Red deer were much more affected indirectly through trophic interactions. No solid evidence of direct effects of snow depth was found on autumn body mass. We discuss the implications of our results relative to our ability to predict effects of global change on large mammalian herbivores in the boreal forest. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Causal chains of explanation; Hierarchical Bayes modelling; Normalized difference vegetation index; North Atlantic Oscillation; Scale of sampling","behavioral response; climate effect; deer; NDVI; path analysis; phenology; sampling; seasonal variation; trophic interaction; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Cervidae; Cervus elaphus; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449117427

With this work, we aim to demonstrate that the gamma radiation effect on the peptide involves the action of free radicals, derived from water radiolysis and the process of lipid peroxidation. Basically, the methodology consists of the analysis of UV and fluorescence emission spectra of the peptide liposome complexes under control conditions and upon gamma irradiation. Free radical production was impaired by the removal of molecular oxygen or the presence of ethanol in the liposome suspension. The intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence was recorded as a function of the gamma radiation dose in the range of 0-250 Gy and the data were fitted with a single decay exponential function containing an additional constant term (named residual fluorescence). The correlation between the decrease in tryptophan fluorescence emission (Dc = 80 ± 10 Gy) and increase in gamma radiation dose indicates the partial damage of the tryptophan side chains of gA. O2 removal or ethanol addition partially reduced the decay of the tryptophan fluorescence emission involving an indirect action of gamma radiation via a water radiolysis mechanism. The residual fluorescence emission (Ao) increases in O2-free buffer (98 æ 13) and in 10% ethanol-containing buffer (74 ± 34) compared to control conditions (23 ± 5). Varying the dose rate between 1-10 Gy/min at a constant dose of 50 Gy, an inverse dose-rate effect was observed. Thus, our study provides evidence for the lipid peroxidation effect on the tryptophan fluorescence. In conclusion, this article sustains the hypothesis of the connection between the lipid peroxidation and structural changes of membrane proteins induced by gamma radiation.

On a global scale, most Hg that enters ecosystems is derived from atmospheric Hg that deposits onto the land surface. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 may affect Hg deposition to terrestrial systems and storage in soils through CO2-mediated changes in plant and soil properties. We show, using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments, that soil Hg concentrations are almost 30% greater under elevated atmospheric CO2 in two temperate forests. There were no direct CO2 effects, however, on litterfall, throughfall or stemflow Hg inputs. Soil Hg was positively correlated with percent soil organic matter (SOM), suggesting that CO2-mediated changes in SOM have influenced soil Hg concentrations. Through its impacts on SOM, elevated atmospheric CO2 may increase the Hg storage capacity of soils and modulate the movement of Hg through the biosphere.

In the Tamaulipan thornscrub forests of northeastern Mexico, biomass components of standing vegetation were estimated from 56 quadrats (200 m2 each). Regional land-use changes and present forest cover, as well as estimates of soil organic carbon from chronosequences, were used to predict carbon stocks and fluxes in this ecosystem. For the period of 1980-1996, the Tamaulipan thornscrub is presenting an annual deforestation rate of 2.27% indicating that approximately 600 km2 of this plant community are lost every year and that 60% of the original Mexican Tamaulipan thornscrub vegetation has been lost since the 1950's. On the other hand, intensive agriculture, including introduced grasslands increased (4,000 km2) from 32 to 42% of the total studied area, largely at the expense of the Tamaulipan thornscrub forests. Land-use changes from Tamaulipan thornscrub forest to agriculture contribute 2.2 Tg to current annual carbon emissions and standing biomass averages 0.24 ± 0.06 Tg, root biomass averages 0.17 ± 0.03 Tg, and soil organic carbon averages 1.80 ± 0.27 Tg. Land-use changes from 1950 to 2000 accounted for Carbon emissions of the order of 180.1 Tg. Projected land-use changes will likely contribute to an additional carbon flux of 98.0 Tg by the year 2100.

We have studied three types of reference buildings: one office, one residence and a 3-star hotel located in Senegal. The DOE2.1E (the building energy program of the Department of Energy Version 2.1E) has been used. One of its main advantage is that it allows to take into account both energy end use categories and a great number of parameters of the building energy performance. Four climatic regions have been identified and their equivalent ""standard"" conditions are all defined. Those conditions are the same as the current design and operating conditions of each type of building. The DHW energy consumption is calculated and compared with the total energy generated by all end uses (lighting, cooling/ventilation, DHW, and other equipment). Before we carry out wide and systematic simulations of the three buildings energy performance, we pay special attention to check and validate the DHW part of the DOE2.1E model. There was an agreement between the recorded monthly DHW energy load on the one hand, and on the other the computed results. We end up finding results that could open new perspectives for building a strategic methodology to provide guidelines for DHW energy saving measures in large buildings in West Africa. Furthermore, it is expected that energy researchers concerned about energy and environmental efficiency would consider this study for promoting CO2 emission reduction in relation with DHW production in large buildings. © 2007.","Buildings; CO2 emission reduction; Domestic hot water; Energy code; Energy consumption; Energy efficiency; Tropical Africa","Building codes; Computer simulation; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hot water distribution systems; Domestic hot water; Energy code; Large buildings; Buildings; Building codes; Buildings; Computer simulation; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hot water distribution systems; building; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; parameterization; performance assessment; standard (regulation); Africa; Senegal; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049141087

Compared with conventional LEDs with a well-designed ETL, quantum efficiency and temperature insensitivity are found to be improved when an n-AlGaN layer is inserted. This is attributed to the localization effect of the n-AlGaN layer being stronger than that of the ETL layer, as analyzed using the Varshini formula and band-tail model. Nevertheless, the inserted ETL layer with the purpose of improving the carrier injection into the active layer not only increases the carrier recombination quantity, which leads to a marked increase in output light emission intensity, but also reduces the light emission intensity compared with sample with the n-AlGaN layer. Consequently, inserting a blocking layer between an active layer and a p-GaN layer may increase the output light emission intensity of the sample with an ETL. © 2008 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Electron tunneling layer (ETL); Gallium nitride (GaN); Light-emitting diode (LED); Multiple quantum well (MQW)","Civil aviation; Diodes; Electroluminescence; Electron tunneling; Gallium alloys; Gallium compounds; Gallium nitride; Light; Light emission; Light emitting diodes; Light sources; Luminescence; Nitrides; Semiconducting gallium; Semiconductor quantum wires; Tunneling (excavation); Current density; Electrons; Active layers; Blocking layers; Broad temperature ranges; Carrier injections; Carrier recombinations; Gan layers; Ingan/gan; Injection currents; Light emission intensities; Light emitting diode leds; Light-emitting diode (LED); Localization effects; Multiple quantum well (MQW); Multiple quantum wells; n-AlGaN; Temperature insensitivities; Electron tunneling layer (ETL); Semiconductor quantum wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149125590

Departures from QE have motivated stochastic convective parametrization, which in its early stages may be viewed as a sensitivity study. Introducing plausible stochastic terms to modify the existing convective parametrizations can have substantial impact, but, as for so many aspects of convective parametrization, the results are sensitive to details of the assumed processes. We present observational results aimed at helping to constrain convection schemes, with implications for each of conventional, stochastic or 'superparametrization' schemes. The original vision of QE due to Arakawa fares well as a leading approximation, but with a number of updates. Some, like the imperfect connection between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, and the importance of free-tropospheric moisture to buoyancy, are quantitatively important but lie within the framework of ensemble-average convection slaved to the large scale. Observations of critical phenomena associated with a continuous phase transition for precipitation as a function of water vapour and temperature suggest a more substantial revision. While the system's attraction to the critical point is predicted by QE, several fundamental properties of the transition, including high precipitation variance in the critical region, need to be added to the theory. Long-range correlations imply that this variance does not reduce quickly under spatial averaging; scaling associated with this spatial averaging has potential implications for superparametrization. Long tails of the distribution of water vapour create relatively frequent excursions above criticality with associated strong precipitation events. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Atmospheric moist convection; Climate models; Precipitation; Stochastic parametrization","Computer networks; Equations of state; Offshore oil well production; Public key cryptography; Stochastic programming; Troposphere; (e ,2e) theory; climate modelling; Continuous phase transitions; Convective parametrization; Critical phenomenon; Critical point (CP); Critical regions; Early stages; ensemble averaging; Free troposphere; Fundamental properties; Large scales; Long range correlation (LRC); Moist convection; Parametrization; Parametrizations; Precipitation (metallography); precipitation events; Quasi-equilibrium (QE); sensitivity studies; Spatial averaging; Transition (Jel Classifications:E52 ,E41 ,E31); Tropospheric moisture; water vapour; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149127741

A multi-sector stakeholder design process was used to produce a new indicator for the 2008 State of the Nation's Ecosystems report that presents metrics of carbon storage for major ecosystem types, specifically change in the amount of carbon gained or lost over time and the amount of carbon stored per unit area (carbon density). These metrics have been developed for national scale use, but are suitable for adaptation to multiple scales such as individual farm and forest parcels, carbon offset markets and integrated national and international assessments. To acquire the data necessary for a complete understanding of how much, and where, carbon is gained or lost by U.S. ecosystems, expansion and integration of monitoring programs will be required.

The object of this paper is to present new heat flow data and to evaluate the geothermal potential of Texas and adjacent areas. The new data show that, west of the Ouachita Thrust Belt, the heat flow values are lower than east of the fault zone. Basement heat flow values for the Palo Duro and Fort Worth Basins are below 50 mW/m2 while, in the frontal zone of the belt, they can exceed 60 mW/m2. Further east, along the Balcones fault system the heat flow is in general higher than 55 mW/m2. The eastern most heat flow sites are in Louisiana and they show very high heat flow (over 80 mW/m2), which is associated with the apparently highly radioactive basement of the Sabine uplift. The geothermal resource in this area is large and diverse, and can be divided in high grade (temperature above 150°C) convective systems, conductive based enhanced geothermal systems and geothermal/geopressured systems. One of the most attractive areas east of the cordillera extends from eastern Texas across Louisiana and Arkansas to western Mississippi. Here temperatures reach exploitation range at depths below 4 km, and tapping such a resource from shut in hydrocarbon fields is relatively easy. The initial costs of the development can be greatly reduced if existing hydrocarbon infrastructure is used, and therefore using shut-in hydrocarbon fields for geothermal purposes should not be neglected.","Enhanced geothermal system; Geopressured systems; Renewable energy; Texas heat flow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54249087028

We evaluate policy performance compared with the maximum feasible combinations of carbon sequestration and species conservation on the landscape for various conservation budgets. None of the conservation payment policies produce increases in carbon sequestration and species conservation that approach the maximum potential gains on the landscape. Our results show that policies aimed at increasing the provision of carbon sequestration do not necessarily increase species conservation and that highly targeted policies do not necessarily do as well as more general policies. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Conservation payments; Ecosystem services; Land-use change; Landscape modeling; Private landowners","article; budget; carbon sequestration; environmental protection; land use; landscape; policy; priority journal; species conservation; United States; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment; Extinction, Biological; Motivation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749119976

Current developments in engine design and fuel quality are expected to reduce these emissions in the future, but many vehicles exceed 10 years of age and may make a major contribution to urban pollutant concentrations and related health impacts for many years. In this study, emissions of a range of toxic compounds are reported using in-service vehicles which were tested using urban driving cycles developed for Australian conditions. Twelve vehicles were chosen from six vehicle weight classes and, in addition, two of these vehicles were driven through the urban drive cycle using a range of diesel fuel formulations. The fuels ranged in sulphur content from 24 to 1700 ppm, and in total aromatics from 7.7 to 33 mass%. Effects of vehicle type and fuel composition on emissions are reported. The results show that emissions of these toxic species were broadly comparable to those observed in previous dynamometer and tunnel studies. Emissions of VOCs and smaller PAHs such as naphthalene, which are derived largely from the combustion process, appear to be related, and show relatively little variability when compared with the variability in emissions of aldehydes and larger PAHs. In particular, aldehyde emissions are highly variable and may be related to engine operating conditions. Fuels of lower sulphur and aromatic content did not have a significant influence on emissions of VOCs and aldehydes, but tended to result in lower emissions of PAHs. The toxicity of vehicle exhaust, as determined by inhalation risk and toxic equivalency factor (TEF)-weighted PAH emissions, was reduced with fuels of lower aromatic content. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The marked reduction of biomass burning after ∼ 500 years BP, a unique feature of the fire history of the tropical Americas relative to other regions of the globe, is synchronous with the collapse of the American indigenous population during pandemics accompanying European conquest. We predict that fire reduction contemporaneous with pandemics in the tropical Americas was associated with massive forest regeneration on ∼ 5 × 105 km2 of land and sequestration of 5-10 Gt C into the terrestrial biosphere, which contributed to the ∼ 2% global reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels and the 0.1‰ increase in δ13C of atmospheric CO2 from 1500 to 1750 A.D.

From structurally highest to lowest these are the Tingri Graben, the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS), and the Ama Drime massif (ADM). The aqueous chemistry reflects water-rock interactions along faults and is consistent with mapped rock types. Major ion chemistry and calculated temperatures indicate that spring waters have circulated to greater depths along the N-S trending faults that bound the Tingri Graben and Ama Drime detachment (ADD) compared to the STDS, suggesting that these structures penetrate to greater depths. Springs have excess CO2, N2, He, and CH4 compared to meteoric water values, implying addition from crustal sources. The 3He/4He ratios range from 0.018 to 0.063 RA and are consistent with a crustal source for He. The δ3C values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CO2 gas range from -5.5 to +3.8‰% % and -13.1 to -0.3% versus Peedee belemnite, respectively. Sources of carbon are evaluated by calculating isotopic trajectories associated with near-surface effervescence of CO2. Positive δ13C values of the Tingri graben and STDS springs are consistent with decarbonation of marine carbonates as the source of CO2. Negative values for the ADD springs overlap with mantle values but are best explained by metamorphic devolatilization of reduced sedimentary carbon. The δ15N values of N2 range from -2.2 to +2.1‰% (versus AIR) and are explained by mixtures of air-derived nitrogen, metamorphic devolatilization of sedimentary nitrogen, and nitrogen from near-surface biogenic processes. CO 2 flux is estimated by scaling from individual springs (∼10 5 mol a-1 per spring) to extensional structures across the southern limit of the Tibetan Plateau and likely contributes between 10 8 and 1011 mol a-1 (up to 10%) to the global carbon budget.

Separate estimation of end uses (e.g., heating, cooking) using the U.S. Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey allows for exceptionally detailed estimation of price responsiveness disaggregated by end use and fuel type. We then construct aggregate long-run elasticities, by fuel type, through a series of simulations; own-price elasticities range from -0.9 for district heat services to -2.9 for fuel oil. The simulations form the basis of a marginal cost curve for carbon mitigation, which suggests that a price of $20 per ton of carbon would result in an 8% reduction in commercial carbon emissions, and a price of $100 per ton would result in a 28% reduction. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Apatite is the primary source of P and, due to its relatively rapid dissolution rate, can be an important Ca source in noncarbonate soils. We investigated the distribution of apatite using a 1 mol L-1 HNO3 extraction of glacial till soils at 31 sites across the northeastern United States. Parent materials formed from crystalline silicate and clastic sedimentary rocks contained 0.2 to 41 mmol Ca kg -1 soil and 1 to 27 mmol P kg-1 soil; at most of these sites, the P/Ca ratio was approximately 3:5, indicating the dominance of apatite. Parent materials underlain by carbonate rocks had 3 to 16 mmol P kg-1 soil, similar to the noncarbonate groups, but had large concentrations of easily weathered Ca (56-1890 mmol kg-1 soil) due to the extraction of carbonates. The same extraction procedure applied to samples from the upper 30 cm of mineral soil at the same sites showed lower concentrations of both Ca and P than in the C horizon, except for a few sites where the upper soil layers probably developed in different parent materials than the current C horizon. We also measured neutral-salt-exchangeable Ca concentrations in the 10- to 20-cm depth increment. Exchangeable Ca concentrations in soils underlain by carbonate bedrock were an order of magnitude higher than in soils underlain by crystalline silicate and clastic sedimentary rocks. For this reason, the exchangeable Ca concentration in the upper soil was correlated to the concentration of 1 mol L-1 HNO 3 extractable Ca in the underlying soil parent material. To predict concentrations of apatite in parent materials and the concentrations of exchangeable Ca in overlying horizons in greater detail would require more specific characterization of bedrock sources. © Soil Science Society of America All rights reserved.",,"Apatite; Calcium; Carbonates; Concentration (process); Crystalline materials; Crystalline rocks; Dissolution; Extraction; Extractive metallurgy; Igneous rocks; Metamorphic rocks; Mineralogy; Minerals; Phosphate minerals; Phosphorus; Rocks; Sedimentology; Silica; Silicate minerals; Silicates; Soils; Bed-rocks; Carbonate bedrocks; Carbonate rocks; Crystalline silicates; Extraction procedures; Glacial till soils; Lower concentrations; Mineral soils; Parent materials; Primary sources; Rapid dissolutions; Soil layers; Trace amounts; United States; Sedimentary rocks; apatite; calcium; carbonate rock; clastic rock; concentration (composition); phosphorus; soil chemistry; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56749106180

However, comprehensive, long-term, and high-quality measurement data of these gases are lacking. This article presents a field study of CH4 and CO2 emission from two 1100-head mechanically ventilated pig (Sus scrofa) finishing barns (B1 and B2) with shallow manure flushing systems and propane space heaters from August 2002 to July 2003 in northern Missouri. Barn 2 was treated with soybean oil sprinkling, misting essential oils, and misting essential oils with water to reduce air pollutant emissions. Only days with CDFB (complete-data-full-barn), defined as &gt;80% of valid data during a day with &gt;80% pigs in the barns, were used. The CH4 average daily mean (ADM) emission rates were 36.2 ± 2.0 g/d AU (ADM ± 95% confidence interval; animal unit = 500 kg live mass) from B1 (CDFB days = 134) and 28.8 ± 1.8 g/d AU from B2 (CDFB days = 131).

The treated barn reduced CH4 emission by 20% (P &lt; 0.01) and CO2 emission by 19% (P &lt; 0.01). The CH4 and CO2 released from the flushing lagoon effluent were equivalent to 9.8 and 4.1% of the CDFB CH4 and CO2 emissions, respectively.

Under the direction of executive order S-20-06, a mandated Market Advisory Committee (MAC) charged with studying market-based mechanisms to reduce GHG emissions, including cap and trade systems, has recommended taking an ""upstream"" approach to GHG emissions regulation, arguing that upstream regulation will reduce administrative costs because there are fewer agents. In this paper, we argue that, the total costs to society of a GHG cap and trade scheme can be minimized though downstream regulation, rather than the widely proposed upstream approach. We propose a household carbon trading system with four major components: a state allocation to households, household-to-household trading, households to utility company credit transfers, and utility companies to government credit transfers. The proposed system can also be considered more equitable than carbon taxes and upstream cap and trade systems to control GHG emissions from residential energy use and is consistent with AB32. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The utility of this response is unknown. We hypothesize that phenological delay in low P is beneficial by permitting more time for phosphorus acquisition and utilization. We grew seven genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with contrasting phenology in high and low P. Low P delayed bolting and maturity in all genotypes. Low P decreased root length, but not root-length duration (the integral of root length over time), because phenological delay allowed low-P plants to compensate for shorter root length. Root-length duration was correlated with phosphorus accumulation. Leaf phosphorus duration (the integral of leaf phosphorus over time) was correlated with reproductive biomass, indicating the utility of increased phosphorus utilization. Phenological delays accounted for up to 30% of biomass production when low-P plants were compared to models of plants with no delays. These results support the hypothesis that phenological delay in low P is adaptive and leads to increased phosphorus acquisition and utilization. Because low P conditions are prevalent, understanding the utility of this response could be useful in crop breeding and in predicting plant responses to global climate change. © 2008 The Pennsylvania State University.","Phenology; Resource acquisition; Roots","phosphorus; angiosperm; fitness; flowering; genotype; maturation; nutrient availability; phenology; phosphorus; reproduction; resource use; root; Arabidopsis; article; biomass; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant leaf; plant root; reproduction; soil; statistical model; Arabidopsis; Biomass; Genotype; Linear Models; Phosphorus; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Reproduction; Soil; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249115615

Buried soils in the Great Plains provide a solution to the problem because they are widespread both spatially and temporally with their organic reservoirs serving as a link to the plants than once grew on them. Through stable carbon isotopic analysis of soil organic carbon (δ13C), the percent carbon from C4 plants (%C4) can be ascertained. Because C4 plants are primarily warm season grasses responding positively to summer temperature, their representation has the added advantage of serving as a climate indicator. To better understand grassland and climate dynamics in the Great Plains during the last 12 ka (ka=1000 radiocarbon years) we developed an isotopic standardization technique by: determining the difference in buried soil δ13C and modern soil δ13C expected for that latitude (Δδ13C), and transferring the Δδ13C to Δ%C4 (% C4) using mass balance calculations. Our analysis reveals two isotopic stages in the mixed and shortgrass prairie of the Great Plains based on trends in Δ%C4. In response to orbital forcing mechanisms, Δ%C4 was persistently below modern in the Great Plains between 12 and 6.7 ka (isotopic stage II) evidently because of the cooling effect of the Laurentide ice sheet and proglacial lakes in northern latitudes, and glacial meltwater pulses cooling the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic Ocean. The Δ%C4 after 6.7 ka (isotopic stage I) increased to modern levels as conditioned by the outflow of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and dry incursions from the west that produced periodic drought. At the millennial-scale, time series analysis demonstrates that Δ%C4 oscillated with 0.6 and 1.8 ka periodicities, possibly governed by variations in solar irradiance. Our buried soil isotopic record correlates well with other environmental proxy from the Great Plains and surrounding regions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Isotopes; Landforms; Soils; Evolution (CO); Soil organic carbon (SOC); stable carbon; Organic carbon; C4 plant; climate change; drought; Laurentide Ice Sheet; primary production; proglacial environment; Quaternary; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Great Plains; Gulf of Mexico; North America; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48149088779

Nitrification rate measurements confirmed the presence and activity of aerobic nitrifying populations. The FISH analysis demonstrated that Proteobacteria, followed by Nitrospirae and Planctomycetes, represented the three most abundant bacterial groups. Interestingly, further FISH studies suggested the presence of one other bacterial group associated with ammonium-oxidizing processes: anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria within the Planctomycetales.

Because there is mounting pressure to remove livestock from riparian areas in the western U.S., we excluded livestock from one-half of three spring-fed wetlands and monitored greenhouse gas (CH4 and N2O) fluxes in 2000 and 2002. In 2003, we also measured several ecosystem characteristics to help understand treatment differences in gas fluxes. Bootstrapped estimates of mean CH4 and N2O fluxes over the study period showed that these wetlands were sources of CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere; we compare the magnitude of these fluxes to estimates from other wetland studies. Grazing removal decreased the magnitude of CH4 emissions and their variability during our study period. A regression tree analysis showed lower soil temperature and higher soil water content to be the best predictors of lower CH4 emissions, both of which were observed under grazing removal. The magnitude of N2O emissions was not influenced by grazing removal, but fluxes from ungrazed plots were less variable. Grazing exclusion during hot summer months in California should reduce CH4 emissions from spring-fed wetlands, but have little effect on the magnitude of N2O loss to the atmosphere.

In this paper, the Strategic Forest Management Plans for the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Traditional Territory (CATT) and the Teslin Tlingit Traditional Territory (TTTT) are examined for evidence of adaptation to climate change. For each plan, management policies and practices that are also recognized as ways to adapt to climate change are identified to provide information on the incremental costs and benefits of additional adaptation efforts. A typology for classifying sustainable forest management plans according to how they address climate change is proposed and applied to the CATT and TTTT plans. This typology, which may be useful to any future retrospective assessments on how successful these or other sustainable forest management plans have been in addressing and managing the risks posed by climate change, consists of a matrix that categorizes plans into one of four types; (1) proactive-direct, (2) proactive-indirect, (3) reactive-direct, and (4) reactive-indirect. Neither of the plans available for the southern Yukon explicitly identifies climate change vulnerabilities and actions that will be taken to reduce those vulnerabilities and manage risks. However, both plans have incorporated some examples of 'best management practices' for sustainable forest management that are also consistent with appropriate climate adaptation responses. Even in a jurisdiction facing rapid ecological changes driven by climate change, where there is a relatively high level of awareness of climate change and its implications, forestry planning processes have yet to grapple directly with the risks that climate change may pose to the ability of forest managers to achieve the stated goals and objectives of sustainable forest management plans. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptation; Boreal forest; Climate change; Forest management plans; Forestry; Sustainable forest management; Yukon","adaptation; boreal forest; climate change; forest management; forestry policy; sustainable forestry; typology; vulnerability; Canada; North America; Yukon Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53149111569

The simulations show that the character of the response of the hydrological cycle to variations in longwave optical thickness differs in different climate regimes. The global-mean precipitation increases linearly with surface temperature for colder climates, but it asymptotically approaches a maximum at higher surface temperatures. The basic features of the precipitation-temperature relation, including the rate of increase in the linear regime, are reproduced in radiative-convective equilibrium simulations. Energy constraints partially account for the precipitation-temperature relation but are not quantitatively accurate. Large-scale condensation is most important in the midlatitude storm tracks, and its behavior is accounted for using a stochastic model of moisture advection and condensation. The precipitation associated with large-scale condensation does not scale with mean specific humidity, partly because the condensation region moves upward and meridionally as the climate warms, and partly because the mean condensation rate depends on isentropic specific humidity gradients, which do not scale with the specific humidity itself. The local water vapor budget relates local precipitation to evaporation and meridional moisture fluxes, whose scaling in the subtropics and extratropics is examined. A delicate balance between opposing changes in evaporation and moisture flux divergence holds in the subtropical dry zones. The extratropical precipitation maximum follows the storm track in warm climates but lies equatorward of the storm track in cold climates. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Condensation; Diffractive optical elements; Evaporation; Fluxes; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Moisture; Stochastic models; Surface properties; Vapors; Water vapor; Climate regimes; Climate warming; Cold climates; Dry zones; Energy constraints; Extratropical; Extratropics; General-circulation model; Hydrological cycles; Isentropic; Linear regime; Long waves; Mean precipitation; Mid latitudes; Moisture advection; Moisture fluxes; Moisture transporting; Optical thickness; Radiative-convective equilibrium; Rate of increase; Specific humidity; Storm tracks; Surface temperatures; Systematic development; Temperature relation; Warm climates; Hydraulic models; climate change; general circulation model; hydrological cycle; moisture transfer; precipitation (climatology); storm track",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53649098155

Two different longitude regions (ℓ = -19°.5 and ℓ = +13°.0) on the Galactic Plane were observed during July and August 2004. We analyzed events that triggered three telescopes aiming to measure the diffuse emission component. No significant signal associated with the Galactic Plane was found from either of the regions. Assuming that the gamma-ray spectrum is described by a single power-law for energies ranging between a few GeV and TeV, lower limits of the power-law spectral indices were found to be 2.2 for both of the regions with a 99.9% confidence level. This result is consistent with the other VHE measurements and constrains a hypothesis in which a very hard (∼2.0) cosmic ray electron spectrum was introduced to explain the EGRET GeV anomaly. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Iron is loaded into the biomass through stirring it in a solution of FeCl2 for 2 h and then pyrolyzed at 600-900 °C to prepare materials composed of iron and carbon. Further in order to investigate the reactivity of the sample, steam and CO2 gasifications of the material was performed at 800-900 °C. Approximately 80% of the carbon in the biomass remained in the solid state during pyrolysis at 600 °C because of the effect of FeCl2 in promoting the carbonization of the biomass. The prepared material displayed high reactivity during gasification due to the catalytic effect of loaded iron. This result indicated the possibility that the composite may be used as an iron and heat source for a steel converter. Furthermore, the high reactivity of the composite during steam gasification suggests its usefulness as a medium for hydrogen or carbon monoxide production. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Plant metabolites that are produced for the growth, development, and chemical defense of plants against climatic alterations or natural predators are also useful to us as nutrients or medicines; hence, it is important to comprehend the amounts and varieties of plant metabolites. Besides providing an understanding of the metabolic state in plants under various circumstances, metabolomic techniques are applicable to the clarification of the functions of unknown genes by using natural variants or mutants of the target plants. Furthermore, a metabolomic approach might be useful in the breeding of crops, since valuable plant traits such as taste and yield are closely related to metabolic conditions.

This may interfere with microbial ferrous iron oxidation, which drives the oxidation of the target minerals. In the present study the effect of solution concentrations of Mg and Al as sulphate at individual concentrations of 0 to 10 g·dm- 3 and combined concentrations 0 to 16 g·dm- 3 each (or total ionic strength from 0.2 to 1.3 M) has been investigated in continuous culture using Leptospirillum ferriphilum. Increasing the concentrations of the salts increasingly depresses the specific rate of ferrous iron oxidation and also shifts the viable range more and more into the low potential region. Aluminium significantly reduces the amount of carbon biomass maintained in the reactor, whereas magnesium actually enhances it at low concentrations. The experimental data was correlated using the Pirt equation and a simplified substrate utilisation model. The results suggest that the maximum microbial growth rate and growth yield decline significantly only at total ionic strengths above about 1 mol·dm-3. The implications of this study are that heap cultures are likely to perform sub-optimally in those operations where build-up of dissolved gangue minerals is not controlled. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature-associated cyanogenesis clines occur in both native and introduced populations. Whereas the selective factors favoring cyanide-producing plants in warm climates are well established (differential protection against generalist herbivores), those favoring acyanogenic plants in colder regions are less well understood. We tested the hypothesis originally proposed to explain this pattern: that cyanogenic plants suffer increased tissue death following freezing as a result of frost-induced cyanide autotoxicity. Tissue damage was assessed in laboratory freeze treatments at three temperatures: -10°, -11.5°, and -13̇C. We examined cyanogenic and acyanogenic genotypes sampled from across the species range, as well as from polymorphic populations sampled in North Carolina. Cyanogenic genotypes exhibited lower freezing tolerance in the species-wide sample but showed no similar trend in comparisons of plants from polymorphic populations; statistical power was reduced in the latter analysis and may be a contributing factor. These results indicate that expanded genotype sampling of polymorphic populations is warranted, and they tentatively suggest that factors such as herbivore abundance and resource allocation trade-offs may contribute to the occurrence of cyanogenesis clines in white clover. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

These valleys are used by urban farmers to grow vegetables for the consumption of urban dwellers. Knowledge of total content of heavy metals is not enough to fully assess the environmental impact of these soils. Therefore the determination of metal fractions in solution is very important to understand their behaviour and their mobility capacity to the vegetables grown on them. Sequential extraction procedure was used to speciate Cd, Pb and Zn from eleven locations from the cities of Lagos, Ibadan, Akure, Ikare, Ondo and Okitipupa in southern western Nigeria into seven operational defined geochemical species; available, carbonate, easily reducable, organic, amorphous Fe-Mn oxide, crystalline Fe-Mn oxide, and detrital (residual). All the metal investigated were significantly associated with non-residual fractions. The highest amounts of metals in non-residual fractions were found in organic fractions while the lowest were found in oxide species. The residual fractions contained on average 65 - 66% for Pb, 8 - 50% for Cd and 25 - 29% for Zn. Assuming that mobility and bioavailability of these metals are related to the solubility of the geochemical forms and that the decrease in the order of extraction sequence, the potential bioavailability of these metals were: Cd > Zn > Pb. The mobility indexes of the metals correlated negatively and significantly with total contents of the metals. Correlation among species of each metal indicates a dynamic equilibrium between labile and non-labile forms of the non-residual fraction. © 2008 Academic Journals.","Geochemical factions; Levels; Soils; Urban cities; Valley bottom","cadmium; carbonic acid; lead; zinc; article; bioavailability; geochemical analysis; heavy metal removal; metal extraction; Nigeria; soil analysis; solubility; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54549111424

Most of this energy is for the provision of lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of CO2 and NOx emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies. Under the 1997 Montreal Protocol, governments agreed to phase out chemicals used as refrigerants that have the potential to destroy stratospheric ozone. It was therefore considered desirable to reduce energy consumption and decrease the rate of depletion of world energy reserves and pollution of the environment. One way of reducing building energy consumption is to design building, which are more economical in their use of energy for heating, lighting, cooling, ventilation and hot water supply. Passive measures, particularly natural or hybrid ventilation rather than air-conditioning, can dramatically reduce primary energy consumption. However, exploitation of renewable energy in buildings and agricultural greenhouses can, also, significantly contribute towards reducing dependency on fossil fuels. Therefore, promoting innovative renewable applications and reinforcing the renewable energy market will contribute to preservation of the ecosystem by reducing emissions at local and global levels. This will also contribute to the amelioration of environmental conditions by replacing conventional fuels with renewable energies that produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases. The provision of good indoor environmental quality while achieving energy and cost-efficient operation of the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) plants in buildings represents a multi-variant problem. The comfort of building occupants is dependent on many environmental parameters including air speed, temperature, relative humidity and quality in addition to lighting and noise. The overall objective is to provide a high level of building performance (BP), which can be defined as indoor environmental quality (IEQ), energy efficiency (EE) and cost efficiency (CE).•Indoor environmental quality is the perceived condition of comfort that building occupants experience due to the physical and psychological conditions to which they are exposed by their surroundings. The main physical parameters affecting IEQ are air speed, temperature, relative humidity and quality.•Energy efficiency is related to the provision of the desired environmental conditions while consuming the minimal quantity of energy.•Cost efficiency is the financial expenditure on energy relative to the level of environmental comfort and productivity that the building occupants attained. The overall cost efficiency can be improved by improving the indoor environmental quality and the energy efficiency of a building. This article discusses the potential for such integrated systems in the stationary and portable power market in response to the critical need for a cleaner energy technology. Anticipated patterns of future energy use and consequent environmental impacts (acid precipitation, ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect or global warming) are comprehensively discussed in this paper.

Taking into account the sustainable character of the majority of renewable energy technologies, they are able to preserve resources and to provide security, diversity of energy supply and services, virtually without environmental impact. This paper outlines possible energy savings and better performance achieved by different solar passive strategies (skylights, roof monitors and clerestory roof windows) and element arrangements across the roof in zones of cold to temperate climates. The aim of this work is to find possible design strategies, and to find solutions to provide thermal and luminous comfort in spaces of intermittent use and a poor aspect or orientation. In regions where heating is important during winter months, the use of top-light solar passive strategies for spaces without an equator-facing façade can efficiently reduce energy consumption for heating, lighting and ventilation. Passive solar systems for space heating and cooling, as well as passive cooling techniques when used in combination with conventional systems for heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting, can significantly contribute to the energy saving in the buildings sector, and the thermal behaviour of the dependent on the alternatives and interventions made on the building's shell. Exploitation of renewable energy in buildings and agricultural greenhouses can significantly contribute to energy saving. Promoting innovative renewable applications and reinforcing renewable energy market will contribute to preservation of the ecosystem by reducing emissions at local and global levels and will contribute to the amelioration of environmental conditions by replacing conventional resources with renewable sources that produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases and coexist comfortably with existing urban, agricultural and tourist land uses.

One way to accomplish this is to resort to passive and low-energy systems to maintain thermal comfort in buildings. The conventional and modern designs of wind towers can successfully be used in hot arid regions to maintain thermal comfort (with or without the use of ceiling fans) during all hours of the cooling season, or a fraction of it. Climatic design is one of the best approaches to reduce the energy cost in buildings. Proper design is the first step of defence against the stress of the climate. Buildings should be designed according to the climate of the site, reducing the need for mechanical heating or cooling. Hence maximum natural energy can be used for creating a pleasant environment inside the built envelope. Technology and industry progress in the last decade diffused electronic and informatics' devices in many human activities, and also in building construction. The utilisation and operating opportunities components, increase the reduction of heat losses by varying the thermal insulation, optimise the lighting distribution with louver screens and operate mechanical ventilation for coolness in indoor spaces. In addition to these parameters the intelligent envelope can act for security control and became an important part of the building domotic revolution. Application of simple passive cooling measure is effective in reducing the cooling load of buildings in hot and humid climates. Fourty-three percent reductions can be achieved using a combination of well-established technologies such as glazing, shading, insulation, and natural ventilation. More advanced passive cooling techniques such as roof pond, dynamic insulation, and evaporative water jacket need to be considered more closely. The building sector is a major consumer of both energy and materials worldwide, and that consumption is increasing. Most industrialised countries are in addition becoming more and more dependent on external supplies of conventional energy carriers, i.e., fossil fuels. Energy for heating and cooling can be replaced by new renewable energy sources. New renewable energy sources, however, are usually not economically feasible compared with the traditional carriers. In order to achieve the major changes needed to alleviate the environmental impacts of the building sector, it is necessary to change and develop both the processes in the industry itself, and to build a favourable framework to overcome the present economic, regulatory and institutional barriers. This article describes various designs of low-energy buildings. It also, outlines the effect of dense urban building nature on energy consumption, and its contribution to climate change.

All processes are regulated by specific climatic requirements. Furthermore, European agriculture, based on highly developed farming techniques, is mainly oriented to high quality food production that is more susceptible to meteorological hazards. These hazards can modify environment-genotype interactions, which can affect the quality of production. The COST 734 Action (Impacts of Climate Change and Variability on European Agriculture), launched in 2006, is composed of 28 signature countries and is funded by the European Commission. The main objective of the Action is the evaluation of possible impacts arising from climate change and variability on agriculture and the assessment of critical thresholds for various European areas. The Action will concentrate on four different tasks: agroclimatic indices and simulation models, including review and assessment of tools used to relate climate and agricultural processes; evaluation of the current trends of agroclimatic indices and model outputs, including remote sensing; developing and assessing future regional and local scenarios of agroclimatic conditions; and risk assessment and foreseen impacts on agriculture. The work will be carried out by respective Working Groups. This paper presents the results of the analysis of the first phase of inventory activity.

We demonstrate the measurement of wine ethanol as a way to determine the relative regional atmospheric CO2-ff concentration compared to a background site (""regional CO2-ff excess"") for specific harvest years. The carbon in wine ethanol is directly back traceable to the atmospheric CO2 that the plants assimilate. An important advantage of using wine is that the atmosphere can be monitored annually back in time. We have analyzed a total of 165 wines, mainly from harvest years 1990-1993 and 2003-2004, among which is a semicontinuous series (1973-2004) of wines from one vineyard in southwest Germany. The results show clear spatial and temporal variations in the regional CO2-ff excess values. We have compared our measured regional CO2-ff excess values of 2003 and 2004 with those simulated by the REgional MOdel (REMO). The model results show a bias of almost +3 parts per million (ppm) CO2-ff compared with those of the observations. The modeled differences between 2003 and 2004, however, which can be used as a measure for the variability in atmospheric mixing and transport processes, show good agreement with those of the observations all over Europe. Correcting for interannual variations using modeled data produces a regional CO2-ff excess signal that is potentially useful for the verification of trends in regional fossil fuel consumption. In this fashion, analyzing 14C from wine ethanol offers the possibility to observe fossil fuel emissions back in time on many places in Europe and elsewhere.

This work focuses on the latter case, with the purpose of quantifying the remaining fraction of gaseous carbon which is then available for forming carbonaceous grains. Since AGB stars are (probably) the main providers of cosmic carbon grains, this residual fraction is essential in establishing the validity of current grain models. Here, we use a kinetic treatment to follow the chemical evolution of circumstellar shells towards steady state. It is shown that the residual fraction depends essentially on the atomic ratio of pristine gaseous carbon and oxygen, and on the cross-section for CH formation by collision of C and H atoms. It lies between 55 and 144 C atoms per 106 H atoms, depending on the values adopted for unknown reaction rates and cosmic C abundance. This is much larger than predicted by the rule of thumb recalled above. The present results depend strongly on the rate of the reaction C+H→CH: far from thermodynamic equilibrium (which is the case here), CO cannot be formed if this rate is as low as generally assumed. We have, therefore, estimated this rate by chemically modelling the reaction and found it indeed much higher, and high enough to yield CO abundances compatible with observations. An accurate experimental rate determination is highly desirable. © 2008 The Author.","Astrochemistry; Circumstellar matter; Dust, extinction; Molecular processes; Stars: AGB and post-AGB; Stars: carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54849437065

Conventional wisdom suggests that outcomes in international environmental politics are primarily attributable to material self-interest, bargaining power, coercion, domestic environmental values, exogenous shocks and crises, the existence of salient policy solutions, the strength of political leadership and the influence of nonstate actors. Yet none of these approaches offers a completely satisfactory explanation for the long-standing north-south divide on climate change. Drawing on social inequality literature and international relations theory, we argue that inequality dampens cooperative efforts by reinforcing ‘structuralist’ world-views and causal beliefs, polarizing policy preferences, promoting particularistic notions of fairness, generating divergent and unstable expectations about future behaviour, eroding conditions of mutual trust and creating incentives for zero-sum and negative-sum behaviour. In effect, inequality undermines the establishment of mutually acceptable ‘rules of the game’ which could mitigate these obstacles. © 2008, Centre of International Studies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050707673

Here we provide a detailed assessment of the GGAS design and operation, with a particular emphasis on its effectiveness in delivering physical emissions reductions that would not have occurred in its absence. We find that a number of design features mean a significant proportion of the tradeable 'abatement' certificates are unlikely to correspond to the claimed emissions reductions. While some of these adverse design choices might be corrected, others would seem inherent to the underlying scheme design. Our analysis highlights the major governance challenges with emissions trading approaches and hence the importance of good policy implementation processes including the need for separation of powers through a scheme development process that involves design, assessment and revision. These GGAS lessons would seem relevant for governance with all emissions trading schemes, and has particular implications for cap and trade schemes that incorporate baseline and credit offset schemes, as well as to the 'White Certificate' schemes increasingly being seen as a means of fostering enhanced end-use energy efficiency. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Within soil, microbial communities both mediate carbon-sequestration and return to the atmosphere through respiration. The balance of microbial use of plant-derived and soil organic matter (SOM) carbon sources and the influence of plant-derived inputs on microbial activity are key determinants of soil carbon-balance, but are difficult to quantify. In this study we applied continuous 13C-labelling to soil-grown Lolium perenne, imposing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nutrient additions as experimental treatments. The relative use of plant- and SOM-carbon by microbial communities was quantified by compound-specific 13C-analysis of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). An isotopic mass-balance approach was applied to partition the substrate sources to soil respiration (i.e. plant- and SOM-derived), allowing direct quantification of SOM-mineralisation. Increased CO2 concentration and nutrient amendment each increased plant growth and rhizodeposition, but did not greatly alter microbial substrate use in soil. However, the increased root growth and rhizosphere volume with elevated CO2 and nutrient amendment resulted in increased rates of SOM-mineralisation per experimental unit. As rhizosphere microbial communities utilise both plant- and SOM C-sources, the results demonstrate that plant-induced priming of SOM-mineralisation can be driven by factors increasing plant growth. That the balance of microbial C-use was not affected on a specific basis may suggest that the treatments did not affect soil C-balance in this study. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a novel approach and one that may provide useful insights when considering investments in transport systems, especially in the light of climate change and rising energy costs. The scope and application of ITS is too broad to be considered in its entirety in one paper, so this paper considers one example - the M25 junctions 15 to 16 variable mandatory speed limit (VMSL) scheme - as a case study to determine both the carbon dioxide (CO2) costs and benefits over the life of the project. ITS can be used to reduce harmful emissions, contributing to enhanced air quality and reduced effects on climate change from CO 2. The CO2 produced when constructing, operating and eventually decommissioning these schemes is, however, often overlooked. This paper considers the balance in carbon use between the building and operating of ITS-based traffic congestion management schemes and the resultant reduction in emissions from traffic. While the calculations relate to the specific example (M25 VMSL), the principals can be adopted, and further refined, for other ITS schemes.","Local government; Pollution; Research & development","Assessment tools; Carbon balances; Case studies; Congestion managements; Energy costs; Harmful emissions; Intelligent transport systems; Intelligent transports; Local government; Speed limits; Transport systems; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climatology; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Investments; Paper; Traffic congestion; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849151215

The need for such a re-conceptualization emerges from the increasing relevance of non-state and transnational approaches towards climate change mitigation at a time when the intergovernmental negotiation process has to overcome substantial stalemate and the international arena becomes increasingly fragmented. Based on a brief discussion of the increasing trend towards transnationalization and functional segmentation of the global climate governance arena, we argue that a remapping of climate governance is necessary and needs to take into account different spheres of authority beyond the public and international. Hence, we provide a brief analysis of how the public/private divide has been conceptualized in Political Science and International Relations. Subsequently, we analyse the emerging transnational climate governance arena. Analytically, we distinguish between different manifestations of transnational climate governance on a continuum ranging from delegated and shared public-private authority to fully non-state and private responses to the climate problem. We suggest that our remapping exercise presented in this article can be a useful starting point for future research on the role and relevance of transnational approaches to the global climate crisis.","Climate change; Public-private governance; Transnational global climate politics","climate change; environmental policy; environmental politics; global climate; governance approach; international relations; mitigation; twenty first century",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849096603

The experimental design allowed the calculation of regional growth and regional variability over time. The research is reported in three sections: development of GrowEst for eastern Canada, policy applications, and scenarios of the impacts of climate change. From the growth index we propose a single statistic, the median integrated seasonal growth index, MIGI to describe the overall fitness-for-growth of a particular site across years, or of a particular year across a geographical area such as eastern Canada. The growth index generally increased from 1960 to 2000 due mostly to increasing temperatures. When mapped, the highest potential growth was adjacent to the Great Lakes and along the St Lawrence River Valley. Variability through time was lowest at locations where the indices were highest. Comparison of these data with historical regional yields indicated that potential yields may not have been captured by current technologies. Two potential policy applications of GrowEst modelling were demonstrated: the determination of crop insurance payments taking account of potential yields and spatial variability; and in urban land-use planning. Future scenarios were calculated from five climate change models for time periods up to 2099. All scenarios caused increases in growth indices. Most predicted that the length of the growing season would increase by 5-7 weeks but that incidences of moisture deficit would also increase. We conclude that climate change is most likely to cause increases in potential productivity which may be largely negated by increasing moisture deficits. Opportunities are identified for innovation to capture current and future potential yield and to reduce yield variability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Belowground processes, including root production and exudation, microbial activity and community dynamics, and biogeochemical cycling interact to help regulate climate change. Feedbacks associated with these processes, such as warming-enhanced decomposition rates, give rise to major uncertainties in predictions of future climate. 2. Uncertainties associated with these processes are more likely to be reduced if two key challenges can be met: increasing interdisciplinarity among researchers, and measuring belowground ecosystem structure and function at relevant spatial and temporal scales. For instance, recognizing the relationship between belowground primary production and soil respiration enhances modelling of global-scale C cycle temperature responses. At the opposite end of the spectrum, applying genomic techniques at the scale of microns improves mechanistic understanding of root-microbe interactions. 3. Progress has been made in understanding interactions of belowground processes with climate change, although challenges remain.

Using comprehensive, homogeneity-adjusted temperature records from over 1000 high elevation stations across the globe, we examine the causes of changing temperature trends with elevation, assessing the roles of free atmospheric change, topography (exposure and aspect), and cryospheric feedback. The data show that observed 20th century temperature trends are most rapid near the annual 0°C isotherm due to snow-ice feedback. Mountain summit and freely draining slope sites are dominated by free-air advection and thus have consistent trend magnitudes, with reduced inter-site variance in comparison with incised valley sites where local factors are more important. Thus, while there has been no simplistic elevational increase in warming rates, some generalizations can be made. Water resources and ecosystems near the 0°C isotherm in the extratropics are at increased risk from accelerated warming. The data also suggest that exposed mountain summits, away from the effects of urbanization and topographic sheltering, may provide a relatively unbiased record of the planet's climate.

Sarfatti, Università di Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy","Sucrose synthase (Sus; EC 2.4.1.13) is a key enzyme of sucrose metabolism in plant cells, providing carbon for respiration and for the synthesis of cell wall polymers and starch. Since Sus is important for plant cell growth, insights into its structure, localization, and features are useful for defining the relationships between nutrients, growth, and cell morphogenesis. We used the pollen tube of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) as a cell model to characterize the main features of Sus with regard to cell growth and cell wall synthesis. Apart from its role during sexual reproduction, the pollen tube is a typical tip-growing cell, and the proper construction of its cell wall is essential for correct shaping and direction of growth. The outer cell wall layer of pollen tubes consists of pectins, but the inner layer is composed of cellulose and callose; both polymers require metabolic precursors in the form of UDP-glucose, which is synthesized by Sus. We identified an 88-kD polypeptide in the soluble, plasma membrane and Golgi fraction of pollen tubes. The protein was also found in association with the cell wall. After purification, the protein showed an enzyme activity similar to that of maize (Zea mays) Sus. Distribution of Sus was affected by brefeldin A and depended on the nutrition status of the pollen tube, because an absence of metabolic sugars in the growth medium caused Sus to distribute differently during tube elongation. Analysis by bidimensional electrophoresis indicated that Sus exists as two isoforms, one of which is phosphorylated and more abundant in the cytoplasm and cell wall and the other of which is not phosphorylated and is specific to the plasma membrane. Results indicate that the protein has a role in the construction of the extracellular matrix and thus in the morphogenesis of pollen tubes. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Nicotiana tabacum; Sus; Zea mays; brefeldin A; glucosyltransferase; isoprotein; sucrose synthase; vegetable protein; article; cell enlargement; cell fractionation; cell membrane; cell wall; chemical structure; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; enzymology; extracellular matrix; fluorescence microscopy; Golgi complex; immunoelectron microscopy; immunohistochemistry; maize; phosphorylation; physiology; pollen tube; tobacco; Brefeldin A; Cell Enlargement; Cell Fractionation; Cell Membrane; Cell Wall; Extracellular Matrix; Glucosyltransferases; Golgi Apparatus; Immunohistochemistry; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Microscopy, Immunoelectron; Models, Molecular; Phosphorylation; Plant Proteins; Pollen Tube; Protein Isoforms; Tobacco; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53749087462

These environments may induce internal damage in the composite due to residual stresses caused by mismatches in coefficients of thermal expansion between the constituents. In this study, a micromechanical damage model is presented for the prediction of matrix crack development in a unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite resulting from exposure to sub-ambient temperatures. Two thermal loadings are considered: cool-down from the cure temperature of the composite (121°C) to 25°C (T= -96°C) and to -50°C (T=-171°C). A finite element model is utilized to determine the internal stresses due to differences in the CTE of the constituents, and a shear-lag model is developed to predict subsequent crack spacing in the matrix. The influence of fiber spacing (or fiber volume fraction) is addressed. Model predictions indicate that, at 25°C, the internal stresses are not large enough to cause matrix cracking in this composite. However, at -50°C, the longitudinal tensile stress in the matrix exceeds the strength of the epoxy at most typical fiber volume fractions, which will result in matrix cracking. The shear-lag model was used to predict the subsequent crack spacing, and demonstrated a strong dependence on service temperature and fiber spacing. The model predictions provide good qualitative agreement with experimental observations, and indicate that the development of damage in a composite should be considered in the design of composite structures for reduced temperature environments. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Carbon/epoxy composite; Finite element analysis; Low temperatures.; Matrix cracking; Micromechanical damage; Shear-lag model","Carbon carbon composites; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Composite structures; Fiber optics; Fiber reinforced materials; Fibers; Finite element method; Flow of fluids; Forecasting; Matrix algebra; Model structures; Painting; Stress analysis; Structure (composition); Temperature; Thermal expansion; Thermal spraying; Thermal stress; Titration; Ambient temperatures; Carbon-fiber composites; Carbon/epoxy composite; Carbon/epoxy composites; Civil infrastructures; Coefficients of thermal expansions; Crack spacings; Cure temperature; Experimental observations; Fiber spacing; Fiber volume fractions; Fiber-reinforced composites; Finite element analysis; Finite element model; Freeze thawing; Internal damages; Internal stresses; Longitudinal tensile; Low temperatures.; Matrix cracking; Matrix cracks; Micromechanical damage; Model predictions; Qualitative agreement; Service temperatures; Shear-lag model; Shear-lag models; Metallic matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249111627

Since the late 1990s, the Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Markets Division (EPA CAMD) has kept a repository of hourly CO2 emission data for most power plants in the conterminous United States. In this study, the CAMD CO2 data are used to derive a high spatiotemporal resolution CO2 emissions inventory for the electricity generation sector (inventory available on request). Data from 1998 to 2006 have been processed. This unique inventory can be used to improve the understanding of the carbon cycle at fine temporal and spatial scales. The CAMD data set provides the first quantitative estimates of the diurnal and seasonal cycles of the emissions as well as the year to year variability. Emissions peak in the summertime owing to the widespread use of air conditioning. Summertime emissions are in fact highly correlated with the daily average temperature. In conjunction with the EPA Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID), we have derived high-resolution maps of CO2 emissions by fossil fuel burned (coal, gas, oil) for the year 2004. The CAMD data set also reflects regional anomalies in power generation such as the August 2003 blackout in the northeastern United States and the 2000-2001 increase in production in California. We recommend that all sectors of the economy report similar high-resolution CO2 emissions because of their great usefulness both for carbon cycle science and for greenhouse gases emissions mitigation and regulation.

Given its sophistication, Chauvet has understandably come to feature prominently in debates as to the nature of human symbolic origins, the behavioral capacities of Homo sapiens, the nature of the dispersal of modern humans across Europe, and the possibly contemporary extinction of Homo neanderthalensis. Significant objections to such an antiquity have, however, been made in recent years on the grounds of the style, themes, and technical practice of the art itself, and on the grounds of the AMS radiocarbon dating program that was first seen to suggest an early Upper Paleolithic age. To date, no attention has been paid to claims for an Aurignacian age on specifically archaeological grounds. Here, I undertake a critical examination of the archaeology of the cave and its wider region, as well as attempts to verify the antiquity of the art on the basis of comparison with well-dated Aurignacian art elsewhere. I conclude that none of the archaeological arguments withstand scrutiny and that many can be rejected as they are either incorrect or tautologous. By contrast, hypotheses that the art is of Gravettian-Magdalenian age have not been successfully eliminated. The age of the art of the Grotte Chauvet should be seen as a scientific problem, not an established fact. While it may prove impossible to prove an Aurignacian age for some of the Chauvet art I suggest a set of expectations that would, in combination, strengthen the robusticity of the 'long chronology' argument. The onus is upon Chauvet long chronologists to do this, and until they do, we must conclude that the art of the Grotte Chauvet is not dated, and very possibly much younger than claimed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Emissions considered are those from fuel consumption (i.e., combustion) for power plants and those from both fuel consumption and industrial processes (i.e., non-combustion) for industrial facilities. For power plants, total annual emissions due to fuel consumption are 107.9 × 103 ton NOx (as NO2), 146.2 × 103 ton SO2, 6.1 × 103 ton NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic compounds), 47.0 × 103 ton CO, 1.8 × 103 ton NH3, 1.5 × 103 ton OC (organic carbon), and 1.5 × 103 ton BC (black carbon).

The Central and Eastern regions combined contribute considerably to total emissions for most emission species. Emission estimates found here show fair agreement with those in some selected past studies. A crude estimation of potential fugitive NMVOC emissions specifically from petroleum industry was also made, and the estimates found could be considered significant (nearly half of NMVOC emissions from industrial processes).

Yet strategies to reduce risk and vulnerability have not been greatly explored. Here, we examine the vulnerability of coffee agroforestry systems varying in management intensity (e.g. land use) and topographic features to disturbance related to Hurricane Stan in Chiapas, Mexico-a hurricane categorized by heavy rains and mild winds. An approximately 50 km2 area was chosen within a coffee-growing region where data were collected on a variety of topographic and landscape features (aspect, slope, elevation, distance to river) and vegetation characteristics (canopy cover, vegetation structure, tree density) as predictive factors of vegetation, economic, and landslide damage at three distinct spatial scales. At the plot level, we collected vegetation data later compiled into a vegetation complexity index. At the farm level, we collected data to understand the effect of the hurricane on economic damage and farm area affected by landslides. We also recorded number and volume of roadside landslides as a measure of post-hurricane disturbance. We then conducted a geo-spatial analysis to determine which factors contribute most to landslide occurrence at landscape scales. We found no effect of coffee management on vegetation damage or on economic losses at the plot or farm scale. At the farm scale, increasing management intensity (i.e. reduction in vegetation complexity) correlated with increased proportion of farm area affected by landslides (P = 0.014). Additionally, reduction in vegetation complexity was correlated with increased number (P = 0.0224) and volume (P = 0.062) of roadside landslides at the landscape level. Topographic and landscape features, such as distance to river (P = 0.004) and wind exposure/aspect (P = 0.044) strongly influenced landslide frequency at the landscape scale. Forest proximity and proportion of forest cover did not significantly influence the frequency or extent of landslide damage. We created hazard maps using the vegetation complexity index, distance to river, and wind exposure as the heaviest weighted factors to assess areas of the terrain with the greatest vulnerability. These maps present a practical result of this study, and offer a template in which land management policy can develop to lower regional vulnerability to landslide risk. These results show that farmers may be able to reduce vulnerability to extreme storm events by carefully managing their farms. Although farmers may not be able to control negative topographic features of their farms, increasing vegetation complexity within farms may be an efficient strategy to reduce some susceptibility to hurricane disturbance. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 20 sites in a chronosequence of 5,17,20 and 25 years were set up in two site categories: reclaimed and non-reclaimed sites. Selected properties of initial soils and features of vegetation were measured and they included carbon accumulation in soil; biomass and diversity of communities were also estimated. Next, based on carbon accumulation, the energy trapped in ecosystem components was estimated. Although the results of plant community investigation did not show the same distinct differences between site categories, the case study suggests that reclamation significantly accelerates ecosystem development. In comparison with spontaneous succession, the complete forest reclamation was found to increase the amount of carbon accumulation, thickness of humus horizon, and energy trapped in soil organic carbon and plant biomass in the developing ecosystem 2-3 times and nitrogen accumulation 5 times.","Biodiversity; Initial soils; Organic matter; Plant development; Reclamation; Sand mining; Succession","Biodiversity; Biological materials; Land reclamation; Organic carbon; Reclamation; Soils; Vegetation; Ecosystem development; Initial soils; Nitrogen accumulation; Plant development; Sand mining; Soil characteristics; Succession; Terrestrial ecosystems; Ecosystems; biodiversity; biomass; comparative study; land reclamation; mine; plant community; soil biota; soil carbon; soil organic matter; species diversity; succession; terrestrial ecosystem; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Development; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants; Reclamation; Renewable Resources; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57549093445

Minimum δ13C dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) values of -55.9‰ to -64.8‰ at the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) strongly suggest active anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) throughout the study region. However, the nonlinear pore water chemistry-depth profiles make it impossible to determine the vertical extent of active AOM or the potential role of alternate sulfate reduction pathways. Here we utilize the conservative (non-reactive) nature of dissolved chloride to differentiate the effects of biogeochemical activity (e.g., AOM and/or organoclastic sulfate reduction) relative to physical mixing in high salinity Keathley Canyon sediments. In most cases, the DIC and sulfate concentrations in pore waters are consistent with a conservative mixing model that uses chloride concentrations at the seafloor and the SMT as endmembers. Conservative mixing of pore water constituents implies that an undetermined physical process is primarily responsible for the nonlinearity of the pore water-depth profiles. In limited cases where the sulfate and DIC concentrations deviated from conservative mixing between the seafloor and SMT, the δ13C-DIC mixing diagrams suggest that the excess DIC is produced from a 13C-depleted source that could only be accounted for by microbial methane, the dominant form of methane identified during this study. We conclude that AOM is the most prevalent sink for sulfate and that it occurs primarily at the SMT at this Keathley Canyon site.","Anaerobic methane oxidation; Brine; Gas hydrate; Gulf of Mexico; Methane; Sulfate","Anaerobic methane oxidation; Brine; Gas hydrate; Gulf of Mexico; Sulfate; Concentration (process); Methane; Water; anoxic conditions; bathymetry; biogeochemistry; chemical composition; chloride; concentration (composition); dissolved inorganic carbon; methane; porewater; reduction; salinity; sulfate; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Keathley Canyon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349162991

Many approaches to predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity so far have been based purely on a climate envelope approach and have not considered direct and indirect species interactions. Using a long-term observational data set (>30 years) of competing intertidal barnacle species, we built a hierarchy of age-structured two-taxa population models (Semibalanus balanoides vs. Chthamalus montagui and C. stellatus combined as one taxon) to test if the presence of a dominant competitor can mediate climatic influence on the subordinate species. Models were parameterized using data from populations on the south coast of southwest England and verified by hindcasting using independent north coast population data. Recruitment of the dominant competitor, S. balanoides, is driven by temperature. The mechanisms of competition explored included simple space preemption and temperature-driven interference competition. The results indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile barnacles is important in regulating chthamalid density but not that of the dominant competitor S. bakmoides. Simulations were carried out using alternative future climate scenarios to predict barnacle population abundance over the next century. Under all emission scenarios, the cold-water S. balanoides is predicted to virtually disappear from southwest England by the 2050s, leading to the competitive release of Chthamalus throughout the entire region and thereby substantially increasing its abundance and occupied habitat (by increasing vertical range on the shore). Our results demonstrate that climate change can profoundly affect the abundance and distribution of species through both the direct effects of temperature on survival, and also by altering important negative interactions through shifting competitive balances and essentially removing dominant competitors or predators. Climate change impacts on organisms are unlikely to lead only to straightforward, easily predictable changes in population size and distribution. The complex, indirect effects of climate change need to be taken into account if we are to accurately forecast the long-term effects of global warming. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Age-structured models; Chthamalus montagui; Climate change; Interspecific competition; Intertidal barnacles; Population modeling; Semibalanus balanoides","abundance; age structure; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; crustacean; dominance; ecosystem response; interspecific competition; intertidal community; population distribution; population modeling; population size; spatial distribution; temperature effect; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Chthamalidae; Chthamalus; Chthamalus montagui; Chthamalus stellatus; Semibalanus balanoides; Thoracica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849152523

For herbivores, this resource peak is represented by the annual onset and progression of the plant growth season. As plant phenology advances in response to climatic warming, there is potential for development of a mismatch between the peak of resource demands by reproducing herbivores and the peak of resource availability. For migratory herbivores, such as caribou, development of a trophic mismatch is particularly likely because the timing of their seasonal migration to summer ranges, where calves are born, is cued by changes in day length, while onset of the plant-growing season on the same ranges is cued by local temperatures. Using data collected since 1993 on timing of calving by caribou and timing of plant growth in West Greenland, we document the consequences for reproductive success of a developing trophic mismatch between caribou and their forage plants. As mean spring temperatures at our study site have risen by more than 4°C, caribou have not kept pace with advancement of the plant-growing season on their calving range. As a consequence, offspring mortality has risen and offspring production has dropped fourfold. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Caribou; Climate change; Global warming; Plant phenology","climate change; deer; global warming; herbivore; phenology; reproduction; reproductive success; resource availability; trophic structure; Arctic; Greenland; West Greenland; Rangifer tarandus; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449111215

The study site included varied types of plant covering: a grove of native desert trees, areas planted with tropical and sub-tropical vegetation (garden trees, bushes and lawn) and date plantations. Experiments were conducted during three consecutive years (2004-2006) for a period of 4 days at the height of summer. Results obtained during all the three summers demonstrate that the settlement created an 'oasis effect', but its intensity was dependant on the combined influences of synoptic conditions, time of day and type of vegetation. During the late night, dawn and early morning, all types of vegetation created a cooling effect; however, this effect was more pronounced with sub-tropical garden vegetation (up to 4 °C) as compared to local desert trees.

In an upland and riparian shrubland, we examined the seasonally dynamic linkage between ecosystem CO2 exchange, woody-plant water status and photosynthesis, and soil respiration responses to summer rainfall. At each site, we compared tower-based measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) with ecophysiological measurements among velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina Woot.) in three size classes and soil respiration in sub-canopy and inter-canopy micro-sites. Monsoonal rainfall influenced a greater shift in the magnitude of ecosystem CO2 assimilation in the upland shrubland than in the riparian shrubland. Mesquite water status and photosynthetic gas exchange were closely linked to the onset of the North American monsoon in the upland shrubland. In contrast, the presence of shallow alluvial groundwater in the riparian shrubland caused larger size classes of mesquite to be physiologically insensitive to monsoonal rains. In both shrublands, soil respiration was greatest beneath mesquite canopies and was coupled to shallow soil moisture abundance. Physiography, through its constraint on the physiological sensitivity of deeply rooted woody plants, may interact with plant-mediated rates of soil respiration to affect the sensitivity of semiarid-ecosystem carbon exchange in response to episodic rainfall. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Eddy covariance; Flux duration analysis; Net ecosystem CO2 exchange; Photosynthesis; Plant-water relations; Prosopis velutina; Respiration","carbon dioxide; eddy covariance; landscape structure; legume; monsoon; net ecosystem exchange; photosynthesis; plant water relations; precipitation (climatology); riparian vegetation; semiarid region; shrubland; soil respiration; woody plant; Prosopis; Prosopis velutina; carbon dioxide; rain; article; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; Prosopis; season; soil; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Prosopis; Rain; Seasons; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149332315

It has been an active policy area since the late 1880s, when the Government first authorised the statutory demolition of insanitary slums. In the 1960s, revulsion at the scale of 'demolition blight' and new building caused a rethink, leading to a major reinvestment in inner city neighbourhoods of older housing. In the past 5 years, debate on demolition and new building has been intensified by the Government's Sustainable Communities Plan of 2003, with its proposals for large-scale clearance and building. Environmental arguments about renovating the existing stock have gained increasing prominence as people have sought to defend their communities from demolition. The evidence on whether demolition would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere is unclear and disputed. This paper summarises the evidence and arguments, and attempts to clarify the most realistic, achievable route to major reductions in energy use in homes. The arguments that apply to housing also apply to most other buildings and therefore to the overall built environment, which accounts for half of all carbon emissions. Three main sources of evidence have helped in the development of this paper, but there are many other studies we draw on in the discussion. Firstly, the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University has argued that around three million demolitions are necessary by 2050 if we are to reach the stringent energy reduction targets that will be required in our housing stock [Boardman et al., 2005. 40% House. Environmental Change Institute, Oxford]. Its demolition figure is based on complex modelling that with small modifications can produce very different numbers. Its assessment does not take account of the embodied carbon costs such as volume of new materials, energy use in producing concrete, steel and other structural and infrastructural elements, and other factors affecting the environment such as land use, infrastructure and area blighting. We discuss these issues in order to clarify the scale of the challenge and the relative value of demolition or renovation. Secondly, the Sustainable Development Commission [SDC, 2006. 'Stock Take': Delivering improvements in existing housing. Sustainable Development Commission, London] argues the urgent need to upgrade the existing stock on the grounds that 70% of all homes that will exist in 2050, even with the ambitious new building programme now announced, are already built. The maximum feasible demolition of two million existing homes by 2050, based on experience to date, suggests that under 10% of the current stock will have been demolished by then. We argue that upgrading this stock to high environmental standards can actually be achieved more cheaply than demolishing it, and with as significant a carbon reduction. Thirdly, the German Federal Housing, Urban and Transport Ministry has announced an ambitious energy reduction programme that will upgrade all pre-1984 homes in Germany by 2020, an estimated 30 million units.11Zukunft Haus http://www.bmvbs.de/en/Building/Climate-change-and-energy-effi,-2826/Pro gramme-to-reduce-CO2-emissi.htm. This is based on evidence from several CO2 reduction programmes since 1996, showing the feasibility of upgrading. An 80% cut in energy use has been achieved, making the performance of the renovated homes at least as good as Germany's current exacting new build standards. The evidence from Germany is more grounded than any that has so far been produced in the UK, as it is based on several thousand examples. The paper also discusses the social and political problems of demolition. There is widespread opposition to large-scale demolition of older stock, mainly pre-1919 terraced homes, which is currently the most 'leaky'. This older property is a prime target for demolition in the Environmental Change Institute's proposals and the Government's plans. The environmental benefits of refurbishment are shown, based on work by the Empty Homes Agency, evidence from English Heritage, the Building Research Establishment and the Prince's Foundation. Work on refurbishment shows that existing homes, often in brick-built terraces, are relatively easy to upgrade and, with careful reinvestment in the existing buildings, can achieve as high environmental efficiency standards as current new build. We consider major social, economic and environmental benefits of refurbishment compared with demolition, including: a reduction in the transport costs, reduced landfill disposal, greater reuse of materials, reuse of infill sites and existing infrastructure, reduced new building on flood plains, local economic development, retention of community infrastructure, neighbourhood renewal and management. We weigh these benefits against the full costs of demolition and rebuilding, involving much higher capital costs, higher material wastage, greater embodied carbon inputs, the polluting impact of particulates, greater use of lorry transport for materials and waste, greater use of aggregates, more noise and disruption. On the social issues of housing need and fuel poverty, we argue that refurbishment and infill building are socially more acceptable, cheaper and create far lower environmental impact, while reducing fuel poverty. The incentive problems associated with renovation and the barriers to delivering it are also discussed. The evidence we have uncovered counters the suggestion that large-scale and accelerated demolition would either help us meet our energy and climate change targets or respond to our social needs. Many arguments remain unclear, but the overall balance of evidence suggests that refurbishment most often makes sense on the basis of time, cost, community impact, prevention of sprawl, reuse of existing infrastructure and protection of existing communities. It can also lead to reduced energy use in buildings in both the short and long term. Many factors will influence what happens in practice, but it seems unlikely under any scenario that the rate of demolition will accelerate far above current levels. Upgrading the existing stock is likely to gain in significance for environmental, social and economic reasons. Adopting policies that aid the retention and upgrading of the existing stock will help develop the necessary skills and technologies, save materials and land, and enhance the integration of existing communities in need of regeneration. © 2008 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","Embodied energy; Sustainable communities; Urban regeneration","carbon emission; economic regeneration; energy planning; energy policy; energy use; urban renewal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549099866

The qualitative and quantitative method of comparison of morphological features between the fossils and extant taxa reveals that they are comparable to 31 species belonging to 18 angiospermous and one pteridophytic families. 22 of these species are new to the Tertiary flora of the Indian subcontinent. With the addition of 31 taxa described in this text, the megafossil assemblage of Siwalik of Suraikhola now comprises 85 species belonging to both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous families of angiosperms and one pteridophyte. On the basis of the present assemblage as well as on already known data from there, the palaeoclimate and phytogeography of the Suraikhola region in the Himalayan foot hills of western Nepal during Mio-Pliocene have been deduced. The significance of the physiognomic characters of the fossil leaves in relation to climate has also been discussed. An analysis of the floral plants of different formations of the Suraikhola sequence belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper Siwaliks indicates that there is a gradual change in floral composition, the Lower Siwalik Formation like Bankas and Chor Khola have evergreen to semi-evergreen elements. An increase of deciduous elements in the floral composition is noticed towards the close of the Middle Siwalik and the beginning of the Upper Siwalik formations. This change in the vegetation pattern of different formation reflects the climatic change during Mio-Pliocene times. © 2008 E.

Brain serotonin is involved in the regulation of physiologic functions, such as mating, feeding, energy balance, and sleep. Although these behaviors and serotonin-related conditions show a clear seasonal pattern in humans, the molecular background of seasonal changes in serotonin function is entirely unknown. The serotonin transporter is a key element in regulating intensity and spread of the serotonin signal. Objectives: To detect seasonal variations in serotonin transporter binding in the living human brain and to detect correlations between serotonin transporter binding and duration of daily sunshine. Design: Regional serotonin transporter binding potential values, an index of serotonin transporter density, were assessed from December 1, 1999, to December 9, 2003, in a consecutive sample of healthy volunteers. Binding potential values were related to meteorologic data. Setting: Tertiary care psychiatric hospital. Participants: Volunteer sample of 88 drug-naïve healthy individuals. Intervention: Carbon 11-labeled 3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile positron emission tomography. Main Outcome Measure: Regional serotonin transporter binding potential values. Results: Serotonin transporter binding potential values were significantly higher in all investigated brain regions in individuals investigated in the fall and winter compared with those investigated in the spring and summer (P=. 01 to .001). Moreover, binding potential values showed negative correlations with average duration of daily sunshine in all brain regions (ρ=-0.21 to-0.39;P=.05to <.001), such thathigher values occurred at times of lesser light. Conclusions: Serotonin transporter binding potential values vary throughout the year with the seasons. Since higher serotonin transporter density is associated with lower synaptic serotonin levels, regulation of serotonin transporter density by season is a previously unde-scribed physiologic mechanism that has the potential to explain seasonal changes in normal and pathologic behaviors. ©2008 American Medical Association.

GHG have long mean lifetimes and are an important factor for the mean temperature of the Earth. However, increasing anthropogenic emissions could produce a scenario of progressive and cumulative effects over time, causing a potential ""global climate change"". Biological degradation of the organic matter present in wastewater is considered one of the anthropogenic sources of GHG. In this study, GHG emissions for the period 1990-2027 were estimated considering the sanitation process and the official domestic wastewater treatment startup schedule approved for the Metropolitan Region (MR) of Santiago, Chile. The methodology considers selected models proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and some others published by different authors; these were modified according to national conditions and different sanitation and temporal scenarios. For the end of the modeled period (2027), results show emissions of about 65 Tg CO2 equiv./year (as global warming potential), which represent around 50% of national emissions. These values could be reduced if certain sanitation management strategies were introduced in the environmental management by the sanitation company in charge of wastewater treatment. © 2007.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Strategies for sanitation management; Wastewater treatment plants","carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); degradation; environmental management; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; methane; nitrous oxide; sanitation; strategic approach; waste management; wastewater; water treatment; air pollution control; article; Chile; climate change; controlled study; environmental management; environmental sanitation; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; methodology; strategic planning; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Carbon Dioxide; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Sanitary Engineering; Water Pollutants; Chile; Metropolitana; Santiago [Metropolitana]; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949118537

In this contribution, we present a pollution episode occurred in the area of Stara Zagora (Bulgaria), where a large SO2 industrial emitter is present. This industrial emitter accounts for more than 75% of the total SO2 emissions in Bulgaria. Two monitoring stations located in Stara Zagora and Mogila observed high SO2 concentration peaks for 7-11 July 2007. We have used the MM5-CMAQ air quality modelling system with CBM-IV chemical mechanism. We have used two different emission modelling tools such as SMOKE and EMIMO. In the first simulation SMOKE is used. In the second simulation, we have used EMIMO including biogenic and anthropogenic sources coming from traffic, domestic sources, etc. Additionally, in the second simulation we have used a so-called ON-OFF approach, which means that we have run two time the modelling system with and without the emissions of the large industrial plant ""Maritza-Iztok"", located in the surrounding area of the two monitoring stations. The use of MM5-CMAQ air quality modelling system with two different approaches, parameterizations, spatial resolution, emission modelling systems and vertical grid levels produce two significantly different results. The results show that the parameterizations and approaches for using a complex air quality modelling system such as MM5-CMAQ, are crucial for obtaining some similarities between observed and modelled data. © 2007.",,"Air quality; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Sulfur dioxide; Complex atmospheric transport; Transformation mesoscale models; Vertical grid levels; Air pollution; Air pollution; Air quality; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Sulfur dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949097621

The plant exhibits a very low growth rate and the growth period can extend to up to 2 years. A node appearance model based on thermal time approach was calibrated for this plant, by using datasets coming from field experiments conducted under different climate conditions. Plants, grown according to local management practices, were planted under greenhouse conditions at Bogotá Plateau (2560 m elevation) and Miraflores municipality (1850 m elevation) while a field crop was planted in an open field on the Bogotá Plateau. Base temperature (Tb) for node appearance was estimated as 9.61 °C according to the regression methodology proposed for this parameter. An exponential model was fitted for node appearance rate (δn) giving a good agreement between observed and simulated values for each dataset. Sensitivity analysis for estimated parameters of the model showed that Tb exerted a major influence on model response. Model validation was carried out using an independent dataset and, in general, showed that the model had good performance.

Despite this ecological and physiological diversity, the results of this study demonstrate that heterogeneity within families does not prevent climatic generalizations at higher taxonomic ranks. Modelled distributions that incorporate local abundance data can discriminate climatically among many plant families and can potentially be used to reconstruct palaeoclimate from sub-fossil and fossil pollen assemblages. Presented are four probabilistic models of temperature and precipitation generated using published transect data of the spatial distributions of 154 Neotropical plant families and the Gaussian kernel probability densities of their occurrence (presence-absence), absolute abundance (density), proportional abundance (dominance), and basal area. Thirty-five published pollen surface samples, representing contemporary Central and South American lowland vegetation, were used to test the accuracy of the modelled climate estimates. The models are able to identify relative differences in temperature and precipitation, with absolute and proportional plant family abundances providing the most accurate estimates. There was little statistical difference among the different models and weighting methods used. The accuracy of individual estimates was more dependent on the number of pollen assemblage families shared with the modern vegetation dataset than any other investigated variable. Family-based climatological proxies have several advantages over assemblage or biome-based reconstructions. Climatic estimates can potentially be derived even when novel combinations of taxa are observed in the fossil record, extending the utility of models based on plant family distributions to palaeobotanical data from deeper time. The approach is also dynamic. Plant communities do not need to be in equilibrium and individualistic dynamics can be incorporated into estimates. Finally, the models provide working hypotheses of how individual species may respond to climatic change based on the climatic specialization of their respective families. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Solar water heating systems (SWHs) could be of interest under the CDM because they directly displace greenhouse gas emissions while contributing to sustainable development by reducing local pollutants. However, there are only three solar water heating projects under the CDM so far. An attempt has been made to estimate the CDM potential of SWHs in India in this study. Our estimates indicate that there is a vast theoretical potential of CO2 mitigation by the use of SWHs in India. The annual CER potential of SWHs in India could theoretically reach 27 million tonnes. Under more realistic assumptions about diffusion of SWHs based on past experiences with the government-run programmes, annual CER volumes by 2012 could reach 4-9 million and 15-22 million by 2020. This would require that the government sets the subsidy level for SWHs at a level that allows them to become viable with the CER revenue.

Alveolar ventilation and pulmonary circulation are closely interlinked to provide efficient gas exchange in the lungs. This means that gas exchange can be impaired after surgery and in various disease states, leading to hypoxia. Hypoxaemia often results from ventilation-perfusion (over(V, ṡ) / over(Q, ṡ)) mismatching and an increase in fractional inspired oxygen (Fio2) does not fully correct it. A reduced transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO) indicates disease of the pulmonary parenchyma or pulmonary circulation.

It also considered the inland ports' potential for integration into a more efficient regional intermodal goods movement system served by the southern California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. GIS was used to map the sites where international cargo is processed in the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. One hundred transportation zones were determined from a truck travel survey conducted by the ports. These zones represent density points for distribution/processing centres. First, a single facility location model was used to define the proximal location of an inland port that minimises the total truck-miles travelled. Then, we extended this model to a series of location-allocation models with up to six inland port locations included. With no inland port (current system), the total daily vehicle-miles travelled (VMT) is 220,100 miles, and the average trip length is 11.6 miles. As more inland ports are added to the location-allocation model, the total truck-miles travelled is reduced significantly. The new system follows the concept of a satellite inland port, which is based on a hub-and-spoke configuration. Also, with significant reductions in VMT, a proportional amount of congestion relief and air pollution reduction is expected from this new goods movement framework. The results show that the mathematical approach is a useful platform for initial investigations into inland port site selection. © 2008 Palgrave Macmillan All rights reserved.","Congestion; Facility location; Goods movement; Inland port; Logistic hub",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149191568

This study compared the effects of 41 years of no-tillage (NT) with continuous apple orchard, with those of conventional tillage (CT) with wheat-soybean rotation and another of puddling (PD) with continuous rice on the characteristics of a pumice Andisol in a temperate region of northern Japan. Higher values for bulk density, penetration resistance, pH, C/N ratio, exchangeable Na (X-Na), Fe, and Mn were observed for PD than NT and CT. On the other hand, organic matter, EC, N, exchangeable K (X-K), exchangeable Ca (X-Ca) and Cu were significantly higher for NT than CT and PD. Highest content of Zn was found in CT compared to other practices. The three-phase composition at pF 2.0 was significantly affected by land use and tillage practices. The solid phase and liquid phase were greater under PD than under NT and CT, while air phase was greater under CT than under NT and PD. Significantly higher values for saturated hydraulic conductivity was found in CT than NT and PD. Total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and PLFA for bacteria, aerobes and cyanobacteria were remarkably higher in NT than CT and PD, regardless of depth. On the other hand, PLFA for methane-oxidizing bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria and mycorrhizae were significantly higher in CT than NT and PD. PLFA for fungi was significantly higher in surface (0-10 cm) soils than subsurface (10-20 cm) soils regardless of treatments. Highest bacterial and fungal diversity evaluated by DNA band number in DGGE analysis based on PCR amplification of 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA fragments, respectively, were observed in surface soil of PD. The result suggests a linkage between microbial community and tillage practices in temperate Andisol.

The committed warming is inferred from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates of the greenhouse forcing and climate sensitivity. The estimated warming of 2.4°C is the equilibrium warming above preindustrial temperatures that the world will observe even if GHG concentrations are held fixed at their 2005 concentration levels but without any other anthropogenic forcing such as the cooling effect of aerosols. The range of 1.4°C to 4.3°C in the committed warming overlaps and surpasses the currently perceived threshold range of 1°C to 3°C for dangerous anthropogenic interference with many of the climate-tipping elements such as the summer arctic sea ice, Himalayan-Tibetan glaciers, and the Greenland Ice Sheet. IPCC models suggest that ≈25% (0.6°C) of the committed warming has been realized as of now. About 90% or more of the rest of the committed warming of 1.6°C will unfold during the 21st century, determined by the rate of the unmasking of the aerosol cooling effect by air pollution abatement laws and by the rate of release of the GHGs-forcing stored in the oceans. The accompanying sea-level rise can continue for more than several centuries. Lastly, even the most aggressive CO2 mitigation steps as envisioned now can only limit further additions to the committed warming, but not reduce the already committed GHGs warming of 2.4°C. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Committed; Global warming","carbon dioxide; aerosol; climate change; greenhouse effect; industry; priority journal; review; solar radiation; urban area; Aerosols; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Pollution; Forecasting; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Human Activities; Temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55749088477

This paper develops a demand-centered, hybrid life-cycle-based methodology for conducting city-scale GHG inventories that incorporates (1) spatial allocation of surface and airline travel across colocated cities in larger metropolitan regions, and, (2) life-cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the embodied energy of key urban materials - food, water, fuel, and concrete. The hybrid methodology enables cities to separately report the GHG impact associated with direct end-use of energy by cities (consistent with EPA and IPCC methods), as well as the impact of extra-boundary activities such as air travel and production of key urban materials (consistent with Scope 3 protocols recommended by the World Resources Institute). Application of this hybrid methodology to Denver, Colorado, yielded a more holistic GHG inventory that approaches a GHG footprint computation, with consistency of inclusions across spatial scale as well as convergence of city-scale per capita GHG emissions (∼25 mt CO2e/person/year) with state and national data. The method is shown to have significant policy impacts, and also demonstrates the utility of benchmarks in understanding energy use in various city sectors. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution; Air transportation; Carbon monoxide; Computer networks; Environmental Protection Agency; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Offshore oil well production; Carbon dioxide; Hybrid materials; Life cycle; Hybrid methodology; Spatial scaling; Urban materials; Life cycle; Greenhouse gases; concrete; fuel; water; airline industry; concrete; demand analysis; emission inventory; energy flow; energy use; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; metropolitan area; policy analysis; aircraft; article; aviation; city; environmental impact; food; greenhouse gas; inventory control; life cycle assessment; methodology; quality control; United States; urban area; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Colorado; Denver; North America; United States; Air travels; Boundary effects; Co-located; Denver , Colorado; Embodied energy; End-uses; Energy use; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas inventory; Hybrid methodologies; Life-cycle assessments; Material and energy flows; Per capita; Spatial allocation; Spatial scale; Urban materials; World resources institutes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849135893

Comparatively higher TOC and TN concentrations are found in the inner-shelf mud belt, and on the continental slope sediments, whereas the outer-shelf sediments, composed mostly of relict sands, are low in TOC. The TOC contents are positively correlated with the abundance of fine-grained sediments. The TOC:TN ratios and δ13C and δ15N values show low variability within the modern inner-shelf mud belt and Gulf of Martaban, indicating similar source. The TOC:TN ratios are mostly between 6 and 8 in the inner-shelf mud belt and these values are similar to the suspended sediments in the Ayeyarwady and Salween rivers. The δ13C values of organic matter increase from - 25‰ in the Gulf of Martaban to about - 22‰ in the slope regions indicating decreasing terrestrial input away from the coast. The δ15N values on the Ayeyarwady shelf are rather low (+ 3.3 to + 4.8‰), especially off the mouths of the Ayeyarwady River mouths, reflecting greater influence of freshwater and terrigenous sediment discharge. A simple two end-member carbon mixing model applied to the Ayeyarwady shelf region indicates that terrigenous sources contribute more than 70% of the organic carbon in the modern mud belt in the inner shelf and Gulf of Martaban.

The proposed method fills in the gaps in the climatological series for a target station using precipitation data from neighbouring stations with a similar precipitation pattern. Particular emphasis is made in the consideration of the precipitation data uncertainty. A set of possible estimates for the missing data are obtained assuming a linear relationship between the target station and the selected neighbour stations. The final imputed value is the median of the previously evaluated estimates distribution. This approach also provides the uncertainty of the missing data estimate.

The dielectrophoretic metal deposition along interconnects takes preferentially place at sites where high contact resistances occur. These create sufficiently high voltage drops, and thus, large field gradients which lead to a local deposition of metal. Since in turn the metal deposition leads to a reduction of the local resistances, the reported post-treatment process is self-regulating, that is, the deposition of metal stops when the contact resistances become sufficiently reduced.

The two sets of δ 13C values are significantly correlated and show similar trends in spatial variation. The spatial distribution of δ 13C shows less negative values in the mid-latitudes between 31°N and 40°N and more negative ones at higher and lower latitudes. This is consistent with previously reported carbon isotope data from surface soil phytoliths in the same region and suggests that the mid-latitude area provides relatively favorable growing conditions for C4 plants. Furthermore, δ 13C values of both TOC and long-chain n-alkanes from 12 surface soil samples collected from a small grassland in north China displayed similar carbon isotope values and the difference between paired δ 13C of a soil samples remains relatively constant. Our data demonstrate that in eastern China, soil δ 13C composition of both TOC and long-chain n-alkanes is effective indicators of C3/C4 ratios of the prevailing vegetation.

Upper-level synoptic maps and information about the vertical structure of the lower troposphere obtained by in situ measurements were analyzed to characterize ozone exceedances in which peak 8-h average concentration exceeded 85 ppb during the Texas Air Quality Study-II in August-September 2006. Cluster analysis of meteorological conditions showed that the highest background surface O3 concentrations occurred under northerly or easterly flow regimes at 850 hPa, coinciding with the advection of dry continental air. Exceedance days in September 2006 occurred almost exclusively in postfrontal environments. These frontal passages are associated with shifts in wind direction and may lead to increases in background O3 from 30 ppbv (marine) to 60-70 ppbv (continental) throughout the lower troposphere. Several factors are identified to be important for 8-h average ozone peaks in Houston under well-developed land-sea-bay breeze conditions, including (1) the presence of easterly winds advecting industrial emissions from the Ship Channel, and (2) the presence of persistent large-scale northerly flows aloft advecting elevated continental background ozone levels that are eventually entrained into lower layers through the growth of the convective planetary boundary layer.

The state of understanding about this topic as of early 2008 is reviewed, summarizing the past 30 years of work in the area, highlighting some very recent studies using climate models, and discussing methods used to deliver sulphur species to the stratosphere. The studies reviewed here suggest that sulphate aerosols can counteract the globally averaged temperature increase associated with increasing greenhouse gases, and reduce changes to some other components of the Earth system. There are likely to be remaining regional climate changes after geoengineering, with some regions experiencing significant changes in temperature or precipitation. The aerosols also serve as surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry resulting in increased ozone depletion. The delivery of sulphur species to the stratosphere in a way that will produce particles of the right size is shown to be a complex and potentially very difficult task. Two simple delivery scenarios are explored, but similar exercises will be needed for other suggested delivery mechanisms. While the introduction of the geoengineering source of sulphate aerosol will perturb the sulphur cycle of the stratosphere signicantly, it is a small perturbation to the total (stratosphere and troposphere) sulphur cycle. The geoengineering source would thus be a small contributor to the total global source of 'acid rain' that could be compensated for through improved pollution control of anthropogenic tropospheric sources. Some areas of research remain unexplored. Although ozone may be depleted, with a consequent increase to solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) energy reaching the surface and a potential impact on health and biological populations, the aerosols will also scatter and attenuate this part of the energy spectrum, and this may compensate the UVB enhancement associated with ozone depletion. The aerosol will also change the ratio of diffuse to direct energy reaching the surface, and this may influence ecosystems. The impact of geoengineering on these components of the Earth system has not yet been studied. Representations for the formation, evolution and removal of aerosol and distribution of particle size are still very crude, and more work will be needed to gain confidence in our understanding of the deliberate production of this class of aerosols and their role in the climate system. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Geoengineering; Global warming; Sulphate aerosols","Acid rain; Air pollution; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospherics; Atomizers; Chlorine compounds; Climate change; Climate control; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nonmetals; Ozone; Ozone layer; Pollution control; Solar energy; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Troposphere; Biological populations; Climate modelling; Climate systems; Earth systems; En ergy spectrum; Geoengineering; Heterogeneous chemistry; Ozone depletion; Potential impacts; Regional climate changes; Small perturbations; Sulphate; Sulphate aerosol; Sulphate aerosols; Sulphur species; Temperature increase; Aerosols; sulfate; aerosol; atmosphere; chemistry; climate; disaster; ecosystem; engineering; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; methodology; review; Aerosols; Atmosphere; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Disasters; Ecosystem; Engineering; Greenhouse Effect; Sulfates",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52949152469

Because methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (about 26 times more effective than CO), there is considerable concern that a rise in the temperature of the oceans will induce dissociation of oceanic hydrate accumulations, potentially releasing large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Such a release could have dramatic climatic consequences because it could amplify atmospheric and oceanic warming and possibly accelerate dissociation of the remaining hydrates. This study assesses the stability of three types of hydrates (case I, deep-ocean deposits; case II, shallow, warm deposits; and case III, shallow, cold deposits) and simulates the dynamic behavior of these deposits under the influence of moderate ocean temperature increases. The results indicate that deep-ocean hydrates are stable under the influence of moderate increases in ocean temperature; however, shallow deposits can be very unstable and release significant quantities of methane under the influence of as little as 1°C of seafloor temperature increase. Less permeable sediments, or burial underneath layers of hydrate-free sediment, affect both the rate of hydrate dissociation and methane transport to the seafloor but may not prevent methane release. Higher-saturation deposits can produce larger methane fluxes with the thermodynamics of hydrate dissociation retarding the rate of recession of the upper hydrate interface. These results suggest possible worst case scenarios for climate-change-induced methane release and point toward the need for detailed assessment of the hydrate hazard and the coupling of hydrate-derived methane to regional and global ecosystems.

In spite of having highly skewed distributions, cross-validation showed the models to have nominal prediction bias.

Comparing the climatic zones against observed patterns of vegetation showed that the model captured the general placement of arid, semi-arid, temperate and tropical dry forests.

Because of their regular, synthesized characteristics (e.g. grain shape or grain size distribution) PCCs are distinct from natural ground calcium carbonates (GCCs). A thermal study on GCC samples showed only the presence of surface physisorbed water with a monotonic weight loss up to the carbonate decomposition. In the case of PCC samples, two supplementary water releases were observed. The first one appeared at around 525 K and the second one at around 725 K. The nature of the water present in two different PCC samples was investigated by thermal analyses (thermogravimetric and Karl Fischer analyses), Rietveld analyses on X-rays powder diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopies and solid state 1H MAS NMR. The second water release at about 725 K was clearly identified as being portlandite dehydration. Ca(OH)2 was present in the PCC in an amorphous state.

As well as producing high yields of sugar, much of the plant's fibre is also recovered and used as a source of renewable energy. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of sugarcane production and processing in Australia was performed to develop an environmental profile of sugarcane as a source of bio-products. The application examined was fermentation products from sugar. The sugarcane results were compared with results for other sugar producing crops-US corn and UK sugar beet-to gauge its relative environmental performance. The results show sugarcane to have an advantage in respect of energy input, greenhouse gas emissions and possibly acidification potential due to its high saccharide yield and the displacement of fossil fuels with surplus renewable energy from cane fibre (bagasse). However Australian sugarcane can exhibit high nitrous oxide emissions, which would reduce greenhouse gas advantages in some regions. For eutrophication, sugar beet provides advantages due to the avoided production of other agricultural crops displaced by the use of beet pulp as an animal feed. The three factors found to have the most influence on the environmental impacts of these agro-industrial systems were the commodities displaced by by-products, agricultural yields, and nitrogen use efficiency. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the climatic impacts of New Delhi's fuel switching policy, and outlines implications for such efforts in rapidly industrializing countries. Natural gas is mostly composed of methane, an important greenhouse gas. Emitted aerosols (black carbon, particulate organic carbon, and sulfate) also cause radiative forcing. We find that methane and black carbon emissions are critical contributors to the change in carbon dioxide equivalent [CO 2(e)] emissions. In New Delhi, the switch to natural gas results in a 30% increase in CO2(e) when the impact of aerosols is not considered. However, when aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO 2(e), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction in CO 2(e). There is significant potential for emissions reductions through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism for such fuel switching projects. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosols; Air pollution; Air quality; Air transportation; Carbon; Carbon black; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Gas industry; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Mass transportation; Methane; Natural gas; Organic carbon; Public policy; Sulfate minerals; Transportation; Air quality policy; Black carbon; Climate impacts; Climatic impacts; Fuel switching; New Delhi; Particulate organic carbon; Public transport vehicles; Public transportation systems; Radiative forcing; Natural gas transportation; carbon dioxide; fuel; methane; natural gas; organic carbon; sulfate; air quality; carbon dioxide; climate effect; environmental policy; natural gas; pollution control; pollution effect; public transport; reduction; transportation system; aerosol; air quality; article; climate; climate change; greenhouse gas; industrialization; model; policy; radiative forcing; traffic and transport; United Nations; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; India; Public Policy; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions; Vehicles; Asia; Delhi; Eurasia; India; New Delhi; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49849100175

Emissions were measured during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons over a range of vegetation types and hydrologic conditions, from wet sedge coastal to upland tussock tundra. Overall emissions averaged 45 nmol m-2 d-1, but fluxes were highly variable, ranging from &lt;1 up to 260 nmol m-2 d-1, with the highest emissions from moist tundra.

Information on processes that generate methane in these coalbed reservoirs is important for developing methods that will stimulate additional production. The chemical and isotopic compositions of gas and ground water from CBM wells throughout the basin reflect generation processes as well as those that affect water/rock interaction. Our study included analyses of water samples collected from 228 CBM wells. Major cations and anions were measured for all samples, δDH2O and δ18OH2O were measured for 199 of the samples, and δDCH4 of gas co-produced with water was measured for 100 of the samples. Results show that (1) water from Fort Union Formation coal beds is exclusively Na-HCO3-type water with low dissolved SO4 content (median &lt; 1 mg/L) and little or no dissolved oxygen (&lt; 0.15 mg/L), whereas shallow groundwater (depth generally &lt; 120 m) is a mixed Ca-Mg-Na-SO4-HCO3 type; (2) water/rock interactions, such as cation exchange on clay minerals and precipitation/dissolution of CaCO3 and SO4 minerals, account for the accumulation of dissolved Na and depletion of Ca and Mg; (3) bacterially-mediated oxidation-reduction reactions account for high HCO3 (270-3310 mg/L) and low SO4 (median &lt; 0.15 mg/L) values; (4) fractionation between δDCH4 (- 283 to - 328 per mil) and δDH2O (- 121 to - 167 per mil) indicates that the production of methane is primarily by biogenic CO2 reduction; and (5) values of δDH2O and δ18OH2O (- 16 to - 22 per mil) have a wide range of values and plot near or above the global meteoric water line, indicating that the original meteoric water has been influenced by methanogenesis and by being mixed with surface and shallow groundwater.","Chemical and isotope composition; Co-produced water; Coalbed methane; Fort Union Formation; Groundwater; Powder River Basin","Chemical and isotope composition; Co-produced water; Coalbed methane; Fort Union Formation; Groundwater; Powder River Basin; Coal deposits; anion; basin; cation; clay mineral; coal seam; dissolution; groundwater; ion exchange; isotopic composition; methane; methanogenesis; precipitation (chemistry); sampling; stable isotope; water-rock interaction; Montana; North America; Powder Basin; United States; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249091006

Two portfolios of technology are examined. One reflects modest investments in climate-friendly technologies, the other more aggressive development. The analysis indicates that the development of a broad range of low- to zero-carbon emitting technologies can substantially reduce (but not eliminate) the economic cost of decarbonization. By enabling large-scale emission reductions on the supply-side, costly reductions in demand are avoided. In particular, the emergence of electricity as a low-carbon fuel provides a powerful lever for achieving reductions in other sectors of the economy at lower cost. While the analysis suggests that there is no ""free lunch,"" the bill, which may indeed be well worth paying, can be greatly reduced through an accelerated R&D program and successful diffusion of new technology throughout the economy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Measurements were made at an 87 m tower site using the new Vaisala CARBOCAP GMP343 instrument, which was found to provide a compact and inexpensive method for mixing ratio monitoring, in an environment where conventional CO2 sensors could not be accommodated. Measurements were compared with a monitoring site outside London, showing that the city's CO2 ""dome"" was an order of magnitude smaller than measured at lower levels in other cities. During the night time in the summer, the mixing ratio in central London was found to be significantly lower than at the rural site. This was thought to be explained by the proximity of biogenic sources to the rural sensor, differences between urban and rural mixing heights and/or the interception of a vertical mixing ratio gradient at two different measurement heights. Estimation of the CO2 loading of the air entering the city therefore proved problematic during the summer. As a result, we propose that monitoring of CO2 emission rate using this type of measurement may only be possible in the winter when the influence of these factors is minimal. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These wells were mostly cemented with conventional Portland cement. It is thus crucial to study how such cement behaves at depth in CO2-rich fluids. Set cement samples are exposed to CO2 fluids under pressure and temperature to simulate downhole conditions. The degraded cement exhibits significant mineralogical changes and heterogeneous porosity distribution. The bulk porosity evolution, as well as local porosity gradients through the samples, is quantified using combined mercury porosimetry and back-scattered electron image analysis.

To address these themes, an integrated IPY Southern Ocean observing system is needed. The observing system will include synoptic, multidisciplinary ocean transects; time series measurements; enhanced atmospheric measurements; and new paleoclimate data sets. The Southern Ocean IPY will leave a legacy of a targeted, affordable, sustained observing system and a circumpolar snap-shot to serve as a benchmark for the assessment of past and future change. The observations will inform development of models capable of improved projections of future change.","Biogeochemical cycle; Climate Change; International Polar Year; Southern Ocean","biogeochemical cycle; climate change; climate conditions; climate variation; hydrological cycle; measurement method; paleoclimate; polar region; research; Southern Hemisphere; teleconnection; time series analysis; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69749102432

Climate matching increases the chances that biological control agents will establish and persist in the desired part of its invaded range. Chromolaena odorata is a major invasive alien pest plant problem worldwide. Two biotypes of C. odorata have been identified. The biotype growing in southern Africa differs in several respects from the more common type invading elsewhere, including that it appears more cool-adapted. So far, biological control efforts aimed at controlling the southern African type have floundered, presumably partly because the agents were maladapted to the relatively cool conditions experienced in southern Africa. Using two different climate matching approaches (CLIMEX Match Regions and FloraMap) we identify locations in the Caribbean, Central America and South America that are most climatically similar to localities in southern Africa where the southern African biotype of C. odorata has invaded. We identify regions most likely to yield biological control agents that are able to complete their development normally on the plants in South Africa. Several higher-latitude and higher-altitude areas in South and Central America were identified by both CLIMEX and FloraMap as being similar to the region invaded by C. odorata in southern Africa. We compare and contrast the two climate matching approaches that can assist in exploration for biological control agents. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The switch from expensive and insecure petroleum to solid hydrocarbon sources (coal and biomass) is occurring due to the vast amount of domestic solid resources, national security, and global warming issues. Gasification (or partial oxidation) is a vital component of ""clean coal"" technology. Sulfur and nitrogen emissions can be reduced, overall energy efficiency is increased, and carbon dioxide recovery and sequestration are facilitated. Gasification units in an electric power generation plant produce a fuel gas for driving combustion turbines. Gasification units in a chemical plant generate synthesis gas, which can be used to produce a wide spectrum of chemical products. Future plants are predicted to be hybrid power/chemical plants with gasification as the key unit operation. The widely used process simulator Aspen Plus provides a library of models that can be used to develop an overall gasifier model that handles solids, so steady-state design and optimization studies of processes with gasifiers can be undertaken. However, at the present time, these models cannot be exported into Aspen Dynamics because the automatic export of models involving solids from Aspen Plus to Aspen Dynamics is not supported. Dynamic simulations are essential for the development of stable and agile plantwide control structures for energy and chemical processes. This paper presents a simple approximate method for achieving the objective of having a gasifier model that can be exported into Aspen Dynamics. The basic idea is to use a high molecular weight hydrocarbon that is present in the Aspen library as a pseudofuel. This component should have the same 1:1 hydrogento-carbon ratio that is found in coal and biomass. For many plantwide dynamic studies, a rigorous high-fidelity dynamic model of the gasifier is not needed because its dynamics are very fast and the gasifier gas volume is a relatively small fraction of the total volume of the entire plant. The proposed approximate model captures the essential macroscale thermal, flow, composition, and pressure dynamics. This paper does not attempt to optimize the design or control of gasifiers but merely presents an idea of how to dynamically simulate coal gasification in an approximate way. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Approximate methods; Approximate models; Aspen dynamics; Aspen plusses; Basic ideas; Carbon dioxide recoveries; Chemical processes; Chemical products; Clean coals; Combustion turbines; Design and optimizations; Dynamic simulations; Dynamic studies; Electric powers; Fuel gasses; Gas volumes; Gasifier; Gasifiers; High molecular weight hydrocarbons; Hydrocarbon sources; Hydrogento-carbon ratios; National securities; Nitrogen emissions; Partial oxidations; Plantwide controls; Pressure dynamics; Process simulators; Unit operations; Wide spectrums; Biological materials; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Carbonization; Chemical engineering; Chemical industry; Chemical operations; Chemical plants; Chemical reactions; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Coal gasification; Coal industry; Dynamics; Efficiency; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Emission spectroscopy; Energy efficiency; Gas generators; Gas turbines; Global warming; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Metal recovery; Organic compounds; Process engineering; Renewable energy resources; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Synthesis (chemical); Synthesis gas; Gasification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54949131344

In particular, the characteristics of precipitation episodes with duration of some days are compared in both simulations. Precipitation in the models is previously compared to precipitation data obtained from the ERA-40 reanalyses and the Climate Prediction Centre (CPC), Climate Prediction Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP). A precipitation episode is defined here as a period with a minimum number of consecutive days with daily precipitation above a threshold amount. We consider a great range of episodes according to the preset threshold number of days (1-15 days) and daily precipitation amount (1-15 mm/day). For both climates, the number of episodes, their average duration and intensity are compared. The analysis is performed for both models. The results clearly show a tendency for a decrease in the number of episodes, in most of the region and for most episode categories, due to anthropogenic climate change. The duration of the episodes is reduced in the future climate for weak episode categories. For mild to intense episodes their duration is expected to increase over a small part of the region. The intensity of all episode categories is increased practically over the whole region. The spatial structure of these changes and its distribution according to the episode category are documented in this study.

Design: Chronic experiments on mice that were exposed to polluted vs. clean air. Setting: Environmental exposure to atmospheric pollution. Animal(s): Female Swiss mice (n = 70) were maintained at different stages of gestation in an exposure chamber located at an intersection with heavy traffic in a major city in Brazil. Control mice were maintained in a similar chamber, located adjacent to the exposure chamber but equipped with filters for particles and reactive gases. Intervention(s): Animals were divided into six groups as follows: no exposure, exposure to a polluted chamber throughout gestation, exposure to a polluted chamber during the 1st week of pregnancy, exposure to a polluted chamber during the 2nd and 3rd weeks, exposure to a polluted chamber during the 1st and 2nd week, and exposure to a polluted chamber during the 3rd week. Main Outcome Measure(s): At the end of the gestational period, the determination of fetal and placental weight was performed after cesarean section. Result(s): Exposure to air pollution during the 1st week of pregnancy promoted a significant reduction in fetal weight. Mice exposed to polluted air, in any phase of gestation, presented with lower placental weight in comparison to mice maintained in clean chambers. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ambient levels of traffic pollution at early phases of gestation is a determinant for decreased final fetal weight. Placental weight is reduced with exposure to air pollution at any phase of gestation. © 2008 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.","air pollution; Low birth weight; mice; placental weight; traffic","air pollution; ambient air; animal experiment; article; birth weight; Brazil; cesarean section; controlled study; environmental exposure; female; fetus development; fetus weight; gestation period; low birth weight; mouse; nonhuman; placenta weight; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; Swiss Webster mouse; traffic; weight reduction; Air Pollutants; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Atmosphere Exposure Chambers; Birth Weight; Cesarean Section; Female; Fetal Weight; Gestational Age; Maternal Exposure; Mice; Organ Size; Placenta; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149102616

The objective of the present study was to develop a country-specific (Tier II) methodology to calculate the inventory of N2O emissions from agricultural soils in Canada. Regional fertilizer-induced emission factors (EFreg) were first determined using available field experimental data. Values for EFreg were 0.0016 kg N2O-N kg-1 N in the semi-arid Brown and 0.008 kg N2O-N kg N-1 in the sub-humid Black soil zones of the Prairie region, and 0.017 kg N2O-N kg-1 N in the humid provinces of Quebec and Ontario. A function relating EFreg to the ""precipitation to potential evapotranspiration"" ratio was determined to estimate annual emission factors (EFeco) at the ecodistrict scale (≈150 000 ha) in all agricultural regions of Canada. Country-specific coefficients were also developed to account for the effect of several additional factors on soil N2O emissions. Emissions from fine-textured soils were estimated as being 50% greater than from coarse- and medium-textured soils in eastern Canada; emissions during winter and spring thaw corresponded to 40% of emissions during the snow-free season in eastern Canada; increased emissions from lower (wetter) sections of the landscape and irrigated areas were accounted for; emissions from no-till soils were 10% greater in eastern, but 20% lower in western Canada than from those under conventional tillage practices; emissions under summerfallow were estimated as being equal to those from soils under annual cropping. This country-specific methodology therefore accounts for regional climatic and land use impacts on N2O emission factors, and includes several sources/offsets that are not included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default approach.","Greenhouse gases; Inventory; Nitrous oxide; Soils","agricultural soil; climate change; emission inventory; estimation method; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; nitrous oxide; prairie; Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56849130831

Our objectives are to determine whether a strong relationship exists between the extent of ice cover in the region and the rate of clastic sediment delivery to alpine lakes, and thus whether clastic sediment records serve as reliable proxies for glaciation during the late Pleistocene. We isolated the clastic component in lake sediment cores by removing the majority of the biogenic and authigenic components from the bulk sediment record, and we dated cores by a combination of radiocarbon and tephrochronology. In order to partially account for intra-basin differences in sediment focusing, bedrock erosivity, and sediment availability, we normalized each record to the weighted mean value of clastic sediment flux for each respective core. This enabled the stacking of all 13 lake records to produce a composite record that is generally representative of the tropical Andes. There is a striking similarity between the composite record of clastic sediment flux and the distribution of ∼100 cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) exposure ages for erratics on moraine crests in the central Peruvian and northern Bolivian Andes. The extent of ice cover thus appears to be the primary variable controlling the delivery of clastic sediment to alpine lakes in the region, which bolsters the increasing use of clastic sediment flux as a proxy for the extent of ice cover in the region. The CRN moraine record and the stacked lake core composite record together indicate that the expansion of ice cover and concomitant increase in clastic sediment flux began at least 40 ka, and the local last glacial maximum (LLGM) culminated between 30 and 20 ka. A decline in clastic sediment flux that began ∼20 ka appears to mark the onset of deglaciation from the LLGM, at least one millennium prior to significant warming in high latitude regions. The interval between 20 and 18 ka was marked by near-Holocene levels of clastic sediment flux, and appears to have been an interval of much reduced ice extent. An abrupt increase in clastic sediment flux 18 ka heralded the onset of an interval of expanded ice cover that lasted until ∼14 ka. Clastic sediment flux declined thereafter to reach the lowest levels of the entire length of record during the early-middle Holocene. A middle Holocene climatic transition is apparent in nearly all records and likely reflects the onset of Neoglaciation and/or enhanced soil erosion in the tropical Andes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

They can cause extinctions thereby affecting local and global diversity. Among reptiles two gecko species, Hemidactylus frenatus and Hemidactylus mabouia, have considerably increased their range during the last century. Both have already caused local decimations and extinctions of native species. Records of invasive populations of H. frenatus are known from tropical Asia through Central America and Florida, whilst invasive populations of H. mabouia can be found in Central and Southern Africa, as well as in large parts of Central and South America. Only a few sympatric populations are known. Herein, we identify areas potentially suitable for the geckos using a climate envelope approach, we predict their potential distribution under current conditions and a future climate change scenario, and try to assess why sympatric populations of both geckos are apparently rare. Our results suggest that areas of suitable climatic conditions for both species can be found in nearly all tropical regions. Future projections revealed that the amount of climatically suitable areas will increase for H. frenatus on a global scale, but decrease for H. mabouia. The greatest changes are suggested for South America where further spreading of H. frenatus will be enhanced due to better climatic conditions. In contrast, climatic conditions for H. mabouia will degrade in this region. We conclude that both competitive exclusion and a non equilibrium in the ranges of the species explain the virtual absence of sympatric populations, although the impact of climate on competitive success is pending further testing in the field.","Bioclim; Climate change; Climate Envelope Modelling; Exotic species; Maxent","Gekkonidae; Hemidactylus frenatus; Hemidactylus mabouia; Reptilia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849250462

The roots of these different strands of the debate lie in much older discussions of the links between environment and development. There have been periods of convergence, especially around issues of sustainable development, participation and decentralization during the 1980s and 1990s. There have also been periods of divergence, in particular the disenchantment with community-based approaches to conservation and the prioritization of poverty over environment, during the 1990s and 2000s. Reactions to the outcomes of the 2003 World Parks Congress brought the three strands of the modern debate to a head. Ongoing discussions around these strands continue at a different pace but the debate appears to be moving fastest on biodiversity's place within the development agenda, although concerns over biodiversity remain marginal compared to the current focus on climate change. But it is within the climate change agenda, and particularly the escalation of discussions around reduced emissions from deforestation, that the next formulations of the conservation-poverty debate are likely to develop. © 2008 Fauna & Flora International.","Biodiversity conservation; Climate change; Development; Environment; Poverty reduction","accountability; biodiversity; climate change; conservation planning; decentralization; deforestation; emission control; international organization; nature-society relations; nongovernmental organization; poverty alleviation; protected area; sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53949105853

This continuous simulation allows to overcoming one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in the use of water balance models, which is the amount of available water in the soil profile at the beginning of the simulation. Thus, the initial error is diluted over the data time series, loosing is relevance. This model was built to be more flexible as possible, regarding the time series intervals, simulating time intervals from one day up to several years. The IrrigRotation can be applied either at a field level or at a regional level allowing the assessment of regional water irrigation requirements, trough its integration into the GIS software Geomedia 6.0. This model was implemented following an information system (IS) approach, and is composed by a graphic user interface, by several mathematical modules and a database. The methodology developed in this model, due to its continuous characteristic allows to consider the water needs of a sequence of crops and taking into account the water stored in the soil profile during the off-season time period, using a soil reservoir calculated according to the deepest root of the crop sequence/rotation. This way is possible to take into account the water requirements of a sequence of crops, including crop rotations, in opposition to traditional water balance models such as CROPWAT, ISAREG, PILOTE or more recently the SIMDualKc which typically perform the soil water balance only for the irrigation season and considering only one culture. The model was experimentally applied and tested for the Beja region, in Alentejo South of Portugal, providing irrigation requirements information based on the soil, crop, rotation scheme, climate and irrigation systems data. Weather data was obtained from a nearest meteorological station (Quinta da saúde - Beja).The first version of this system was successfully developed, allowing to compute the irrigation requirements of the sugar beet-maize-tomato-wheat crop rotation for the Beja region for the 2003-2007 period.

This modeling approach is based on new ideas concerning the formation of the Pangea supercontinent. The new plate tectonic concept is supported by paleo-magnetic data as it fits the 95% confidence interval of published data. Six permocarboniferous time slices (340, 320, 300, 290, 270, 255 Ma) were chosen within a first paleo-climate modeling approach as they represent the most important changes of the Late Paleozoic climate development. The digital maps have a resolution of 2.8°×2.8° (T42), suitable for high-resolution climate modeling, using the PLASIM model. CO2 concentrations of the paleo-at-mosphere andpaleo-insolation values have been estimated by published methods. For the purpose of validation, quantitative model output had to be transformed into qualitative parameters in order to be able to compare digital data with qualitative data of geologic indicators. The model output of surface temperatures and precipitation was therefore converted into climate zones. The reconstructed occurrences of geological indicators like aeolian sands, evaporites, reefs, coals, oil source rocks, tillites, phosphorites and cherts were then compared with the computed paleo-climate zones. Examples of the Permian Pangea show a very good agreement between model results and geological indicators. From the modeling approach we are able to identify climatic processes which lead to the deposition of hydrocarbon source and reservoir rocks. The regional assessment of such atmospheric processes may be used for the identification of thepaleo-distribution of organic rich deposits or rock types suitable to form hydrocarbon reservoirs. © 2008 URBAN-VERLAG Hamburg/Wien GmbH.",,"Financial data processing; Maps; Climate modelling; Confidence interval; Digital maps; High resolutions; Magnetic data; Modeling approaches; New ideas; Reservoir rocks; Supercontinent; Operations research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51949117196

In this paper, we examine some of the work involved in a pathbreaking climate change policy adopted in Portland, Oregon. Seeking to address shortcomings in existing studies of local environmental governance, we focus particular attention on how climate change became a political priority in Portland, how a particular representation of local carbon dioxide emissions was developed in the process of public consultations, and how the local state attempted to achieve its adopted policy objectives by enlisting the self-governing capacities of its residents. To carry out such an analysis, we draw on both actor-network theory (ANT) and governmentality. The first approach offers an understanding of how collective priorities emerge as different actants learn how to move toward their goals by working together, and also suggests how subjects and objects are reshaped by their enrolment in such configurations. The second approach offers a more precise understanding of how the state attempts to achieve its objectives - once they are established - by conducting the conduct of its citizens. Brought together, we argue, ANT and governmentality provide an incisive approach to questions of local environmental governance, and to broader political concerns as well. As each approach addresses well-cited shortcomings of the other, the combined approach developed in this paper could be deployed in many studies that examine the emergence of political priorities and the capacity to achieve them.",,"actor network theory; carbon emission; climate change; collective action; environmental policy; governance approach; self government; North America; Oregon; Portland [Oregon]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51449089896

Each bacteriochlorin is stable to adventitious dehydrogenation by virtue of the presence of a geminal dimethyl group in each pyrroline ring. The target bacteriochlorins bear cationic, lipophilic, or amphipathic substituents at the 3- and 13- (β-pyrrolic) positions. A dicarboxybacteriochlorin was converted to amide derivatives via the intermediate diacid chloride. A diformylbacteriochlorin was subjected to reductive amination to give aminomethyl derivatives. A set of 3,5-disubstituted aryl groups bearing lipophilic or amphipathic groups was introduced via Suzuki coupling. Altogether 22 free base bacteriochlorins have been prepared. Eight aminoalkylbacteriochlorins were quaternized with methyl iodide at two or four amine sites per molecule, which resulted in water solubility. Each bacteriochlorin exhibits a Qy absorption band in the range of 720-772 nm. The ability to introduce a wide variety of peripheral functional groups makes these bacteriochlorins attractive candidates for diverse applications in photomedicine including PDT in the NIR region. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Bacteriology; Chemical reactions; Photodynamic therapy; Amphipathic; Bacteriochlorins; Building blocks; Chemical equations; Free base; Lipophilic (LP); Near infra red (NIR) region; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Infrared devices; 3,13 dibromobacteriochlorin; alkyl group; amide; amine; bacteriochlorin; cation; diacid chloride; diformylbacteriochlorin; functional group; methyl group; methyl iodide; palladium; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; pyrrole derivative; amination; article; carbonylation; cross coupling reaction; dehydrogenation; derivatization; lipophilicity; photodynamic therapy; reaction analysis; reduction; solubility; Sonogashira reaction; Suzuki reaction; synthesis; Acids; Cations; Chlorine Compounds; Esters; Lipids; Molecular Structure; Palladium; Porphyrins; Spectrophotometry; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249097149

When the initial platinum content was controlled to 1000 ppm in the solution, the adsorption capacities of hexachloro platinate(IV) on carbon nanotube, activated carbon and activated carbon fiber were 24%, 47%, and 76%, respectively at the equilibrium state. The adsorption isotherm type of hexachloro platinate(IV) on carbon nanotube was two-step linear and quite different from Langmuir model of activated carbon fiber due to the uniformly developed cylindrical pore structure and size distribution. The average platinum particle size on porous carbons was under 2 nm by heating the hexachloro platinate(IV) up to 400 °C in spite of non-using reduction agents, while the average size increased due to the agglomeration of some particles by heating them up to 800 °C.

The time for heating was estimated by model calculations and the time for calcination by measurements. Fragmentation due to thermal shock was carried out by experiments in a CO2 atmosphere in order to prevent the effect of calcination. It was found to be much less than fragmentation due to calcination. Average particle sizes before and after fragmentation are presented for several types of limestone. The effects of particle size and gas composition on the primary fragmentation were studied through experiments. Increasing the fluidisation velocity increased the tendency to fragment. The evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) of limestone particles due to thermal shock and during calcination (or simultaneous calcination and sulphation) were calculated using a population balance model. Fragmentation due to thermal shock is treated as an instantaneous process. The fragmentation frequency during calcination is presented as exponentially decaying over time. In addition to the final PSD, this model also predicts the PSD during the calcination process. The fragmentation was practically found to end after 10 min.

By this decision the COP, requested the SBSTA to develop a structured 5-year programme of work of the SBSTA on the scientific, technical and socio-economic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change. Consequently, the COP, by its decision 2/CP.11, adopted the ""Five-year programme of work of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change"" Finally during COP12 this programme was approved as ""Nairobi Work Programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change"". This programme has fundamental significance not only for developing countries, but also for industrialized nations in which some sectors of the or social life are particularly vulnerable to climate change, specifically, inter alia EIT countries and new EU Member States. Further development of this adaptation programme economy should contain steps that provide optimum economic and social effectiveness, risk management, identification of vulnerable sectors and gaps in knowledge, preparation of a list of policy options, including an analysis of cost effectiveness, selection of the most effective policies, and a preparedness implementation plan. In Poland the preliminary adaptation programme covered agriculture, water management, and coastal zone management. For the time being, gaps in knowledge and preparedness measures have been identified. An estimation of possible impact on these areas was based on chosen GCMs, and sea level rise IPCC scenarios. In conclusion, it was stated that the results achieved should be seen as a first step forward and a more comprehensive study is necessary to update the results and cover other sectors of the economy, such as health protection, spatial planning, ecosystems and forestry, and to develop specific guidelines and recommendations for policy-makers. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate control; Climatology; Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Health risks; Occupational risks; Oceanography; Quality assurance; Regional planning; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Sea level; Technology transfer; Water levels; Water management; Climate changes; Climate change; climate change; health care; risk assessment; socioeconomic impact; water management; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Poland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749119183

In January 2008, the EU Commission gave the first country-specific proposals to reduce emissions in sectors outside the EU emission trading system (non-ETS). In this study, we looked at several ways of sharing emission reductions in the non-ETS sector. We considered population and economic growth as significant drivers of the development of emissions. In particular, we analyzed development in GHG intensity of economies. Reduction requirements vary greatly among countries depending on the principle of effort sharing. The results of our calculations can be perceived as examples of how effort sharing between the EU Member States could look like when certain assumptions are made. Generally they illustrate the sensitivity of the results to data used, assumptions made, and method applied. The main strength of simple top-down approaches is transparency. A major weakness is a very limited ability to consider national circumstances. Political negotiations are ultimately crucial; an analysis like this provides material for negotiations and makes a contribution to solving the effort-sharing problem. As future development is partly unpredictable, implementation of some kind of subsequent adjustment could be considered during the process. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The scheme has freeze/thaw processes and was run with the column depth greater than 50 m. The inclusion of the top organic layers and the physically based parameterization of soil hydrothermal properties led to a realistic seasonal amplitude of a subsurface thermal regime and mitigated the warming and deepening of the maximum active layer thickness (ALT). After a 6-K warming over 100 years, ALT increases by 67% (from 9.6 to 16 cm) with the top organic layers and increases by more than a factor of 2 for the default mineral layers (122% from 45 cm to 1.0 m). With the more realistic thermal property profile, the physically based parameterizations projected ALT after the 100-year warming to be about a half of what the original parameterization did (2.0 against 3.5 m). Finer soil layer thickness near the surface had impacts on the near-surface wetness and the energy and water exchange between the atmosphere and also showed greater tolerance to the misconfiguration of porosity profile, whose global-scale distribution is poorly known for global climate model applications. With much wetter forcing, water infiltration kept the soil close to the saturation, degradation of the frozen state proceeded faster, and the adaptation back to a drier condition occurred on a decadal time scale.

Recently, this paradigm has shifted to include top-down control as an additional primary factor regulating salt-marsh community structure. The most recent research on consumer impacts in southern US marshes has shown that top-down forces often interact with biotic and abiotic factors, such as secondary fungal infection in grazer-induced wounds, soil nutrients and climatic variation, to influence ecosystem structure. In a more northern salt marsh, located in New England, we examined the separate and interactive effects of nutrient availability, insect herbivory and secondary fungal infection, on growth of the foundation species, Spartina alterniflora. We used a factorial design with two levels of nutrients (control and addition) insects (control and removal) and fungi (control and removal). Nutrient addition increased plant biomass by 131% in the absence of herbivores. When insect consumers were allowed access to fertilized plots, biomass was reduced by nearly 45% when compared with treatments with nutrients and insecticide. In contrast, insect herbivores did not affect plant biomass in unfertilized control treatments. These differences suggest that consumer effects are triggered under high nutrient levels only. We also found that secondary fungal infections in grazer-induced wounds, in contrast to lower latitude marshes, did not significantly impact primary production. Our results suggest that while New England salt marshes may typically be under bottom-up control, eutrophication can trigger dual control with inclusion of top-down regulation. However, unlike lower latitude marshes, consumer control of plant growth in northern US salt marshes is not dependent on herbivores facilitating fungal infections that then control grass growth, suggesting that the intensity of disease mediated top-down control by small grazers may be regulated by climate and/or grazer identity that co-vary with latitude. © 2008 The Authors.",,"bottom-up control; climate variation; community structure; comparative study; eutrophication; fungal disease; grass; herbivore; phytomass; saltmarsh; soil nutrient; top-down control; wounding; New England; North America; United States; Fungi; Hexapoda; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749086695

Shaybah field in Saudi Arabia, a low-permeability reservoir overlain by a large gas cap, was developed initially in 1996 with 1-km single-lateral horizontal wells to drain hydrocarbon while reducing gas coning effectively. A step-development approach of increasing reservoir contact to improve well productivity and performance was the basis for the MRC concept. To date, results from 25 MRC wells have indicated a four-fold increase in well productivities and a three-fold decrease in unit-development cost when compared to the 1-km single-lateral wells. A useful byproduct of MRC drilling is the enhancement achieved in reservoir characterization. In addition to MRC wells, smart technologies such as downhole-flow-control systems (smart completions), expandable liners, and production equalizers were deployed in Shaybah field. These technologies have improved well performance and recovery greatly. Smart controls assisted in optimizing production from each lateral in a multilateral (ML) well in the event of premature gas or water coning. In addition, downhole smart completions improved well productivity in ML wells with a better well-cleanup process. Production equalizers that were deployed in high-gas/oil-ratio (GOR) wells reduced gas coning and improved well productivity. To date, more than 21 expandable liners have been deployed as enablers to a workover strategy to convert single-lateral wells to ML/MRC wells, thereby providing a platform for installation of downhole-flow-control systems.

The information is gained through a water balance model approach, using monthly climate data from the time series 1971-2000 estimated over 544 grid points of the whole of the Italian territory, made available by the CRA-Central Office for Crop Ecology (CRA-UCEA). The goal of this study was to evaluate the fraction of precipitation that does not return to the atmosphere through the evaporation process or remains in soil storage and that includes both surface and subsurface runoff including effective infiltration. The results obtained by using a GIS system may provide useful information on the evolution of the hydroclimatic conditions in Italy and a picture of the runoff amounts in terms of time and space.

Results obtained indicate that the addition of a transition metal (Ag, Co, Mn, Ti) does not have a marked influence on aerogel textural and chemical properties of aerogels. The capacity of metal-doped carbon aerogels to accelerate the transformation of ozone into OH radicals is related to the metal on their surface. Thus, only the presence of metals susceptible to oxidation by ozone accelerates this transformation (A-Mn). Thus, 10% of the surface Mn was present in Mn(II) form, 4% in Mn(III) form, and 2% in Mn(IV) form after its use in the pCBA oxidation process. In the remaining cases (samples A-Co and A-Ti), the oxidation state of the metal was unchanged at +2 and +4 for Co and Ti, respectively. The results obtained from photodegradation of NTS in the presence of the different aerogels have shown that the presence of A-Na, A-Co, and A-Ti aerogels did not increase the NTS degradation rate. However, the presence of sample A-Mn increased the oxidation kinetics of NTS. Since, there was no adsorption of NTS on these aerogel samples, the increased elimination of NTS, due to the presence of Mn doped aerogel, would indicate that this sample has photocatalytic activity, enhancing the generation of highly oxidant species in the medium. Results obtained have also shown that the photooxidation rate of NTS in the presence of TiO2 is much higher than that detected in the presence of sample A-Mn. This can largely be attributed to the larger absorption of UV radiation by TiO2. Analysis of the adsorption of chloride, bromide, and iodide on Ag-doped carbon aerogels indicate that these aerogels present a high adsorption capacity. This is due to the presence of Ag(I) on its surface, with the formation of the corresponding halides. Consequently, the corresponding halide anions dissolved in the water are retained on the aerogel surface by a chemisorption process. The regeneration of the Ag carbon aerogel beds is based on substitution of the halide ions with ammonia to form a silver ammonia complex. In fact, the characteristics of the column remained practically constant after three adsorption/regeneration cycles, both for bromide and iodide. These results could indicate that these aerogels are highly promising materials for the removal of the above species from drinking waters. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Acids; Adsorption; Aerogels; Carbon; Ceramic materials; Chemical oxygen demand; Chemical properties; Colloids; Degradation; Free radicals; Manganese; Metals; Organic carbon; Oxidation; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Photocatalysis; Photodegradation; Photooxidation; Potable water; Silver compounds; Sodium; Transition metals; Carbon aerogels; Chlorobenzoic acid; Metal-doped carbon aerogels; Organic micropollutants; Manganese removal (water treatment)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849132522

Both psychological and sociological factors affect the willingness of laypeople to acknowledge the reality of global warming, and to support climate policies of their home countries. In this paper, I analyse a cross-national dataset of public concern about global warming, utilising data from 46 countries. Based on earlier results at the national and regional level, I expect concern to be negatively correlated to national measures of wealth and carbon dioxide emissions. I find that gross domestic product is indeed negatively correlated to the proportion of a population that regards global warming as a serious problem. There is also a marginally significant tendency that nations' per capita carbon dioxide emissions are negatively correlated to public concern. These findings suggest that the willingness of a nation to contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions decreases with its share of these emissions. This is in accordance with psychological findings, but poses a problem for political decision-makers. When communicating with the public, scientists ought to be aware of their responsibility to use a language that is understood by laypeople. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Oxides; Population statistics; Global warming; carbon dioxide; decision making; environmental policy; global warming; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; national economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749089519

For this procedure, samples were prepared as emulsions that were made using concentrated nitric acid, Triton X-100, sample, and ultra pure water in proportions of 5/10/7/78% (v/v), respectively. Sample volumes were weighed because of the density differences, and oxygen was added to the sheat gas entrance of the ICP OES in order to decrease carbon deposition in the torch and to minimize background effects. A Doehlert design was applied as an experimental matrix to investigate the flow ratios of argon (sheat and plasma gas) and oxygen in relation to the signal-to-background ratio. A comparative study among the slopes of the analytical curves built in aqueous media, surfactant/HNO3, and by spike addition for several sample emulsions indicates that a unique solution of surfactant in acidic media can be employed to perform the external calibration for analysis of the emulsions. The developed procedure allows for the determination of the total sulfur content in petroleum derivatives with a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.72 and 2.4 μg g- 1, respectively. Precision values, expressed as the relative standard deviations (% RSD, n = 10) for 12 and 400 μg g- 1, were 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively. The proposed procedure was applied toward the determination of total sulfur in samples of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel commercialized in the city of Niterói/RJ, Brazil. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by the determination of the total sulfur in three different standard reference materials (SRM): NIST 2723a (sulfur in diesel fuel oil), NIST 1616b (sulfur in kerosene), and NIST 2298 (sulfur in gasoline). The data indicate that the methodology can be successfully applied to these types of samples. Spiking tests, conducted with the analyzed samples, indicate that recoveries are between 97 and 103%. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

More efficient routing can also reduce traffic congestion and air pollution which are growing problems in many urban areas. Unfortunately, the identification of the optimal solution to most vehicle routing problems is computationally intractable. This article presents a user-friendly spatial decision support system (SDSS) to generate vehicle routes for multiple-vehicle routing problems that serve demand located along arcs and at nodes of the transportation network. The SDSS incorporates a geographical information system (GIS) and heuristic solution procedures to generate routes, system-wide data, and maps, as well as individual vehicle route maps, directions, and data quickly. It accommodates realistic system specifics such as vehicle capacity and time constraints and network constraints such as one-way streets, and prohibited turns. The system was tested for trash collection in Coimbra, Portugal. In addition, the SDSS can be used for ""what-if"" analysis related to possible changes to input parameters such as vehicle capacity and maximum driving time. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In these dipolytropic models, the adiabatic dark matter sits in equilibrium, while the gas develops a gradual, smooth, quasi-stationary cooling flow. Both affect and respond to the collective gravitational field. We find that all subsonic, radially continuous, steady solutions require a non-zero minimum central point mass. For Mpc-sized haloes with 7-10 effective degrees of freedom (F2), the minimum central mass is compatible with observations of supermassive black holes. Smaller gas mass influxes enable smaller central masses for wider ranges of F2. The halo comprises a sharp spike around the central mass, embedded within a core of nearly constant density (at 101-102.5 kpc scales), with outskirts that attenuate and naturally truncate at finite radius (several Mpc). The gas density resembles a broken power law in radius, but the temperature dips and peaks within the dark core. A finite minimum temperature occurs due to gravitational self-warming, without cold mass dropout nor needing regulatory heating. X-ray emission from the intracluster medium mimics a β-model plus bright compact nucleus. Near-sonic points in the gas flow are bottlenecks to the allowed steady solutions; the outermost are at kpc scales. These sites may preferentially develop cold mass dropout during strong perturbations off equilibrium. Within the sonic point, the profile of gas specific entropy is flatter than s ∝ r1/2, but this is a shallow ramp and not an isentropic core. When F2 is large, the inner halo spike is only marginally Jeans stable in the central parsec, suggesting that a large non-linear disturbance could trigger local dark collapse on to the central object. © 2008 RAS.","Accretion, accretion discs; Cooling flows; Dark matter; Galaxies: clusters: general; Hydrodynamics; X-rays: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57149144825

It is shown that a substantial reduction of green emission arising from ketonic defect sites can be achieved by irradiation of thin films with UV light. This is found to be accompanied by partial cross-linking of the films. FTIR measurements show no reduction of the C=O stretching mode upon irradiation, and, moreover, the degree of cross-linking does not scale with the relative fluorenone content (0.1,0.5, and 5%). Therefore, the reduced emission intensity in the green spectral region is rather associated with the occurrence of interruptions in the polymer backbone, which reduce the effective conjugation length and subsequently inhibit the energy transfer onto the ketonic defect sites. The found results enabled us to build organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) that can be structured by selective illumination of the emitting layer with an intense UV light source. This method allows for the fabrication of rather efficient (2000 cd m-2 at 7 V) two-color OLEDs. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

According to International Energy Agency (IEA) figures, supply and demand in 2006 were closely balanced within the three major regions and interconnectivity through LNG trade was limited. This situation resulted in very different gas pricing models in each region, which result in very different price levels and price volatility between the regions.

The exposure of 'new' soil is particularly apparent at high elevations (5000 metres above sea level) in the Peruvian Andes, where extreme environmental conditions hinder plant colonization. Nonetheless, these seemingly barren soils contain a diverse microbial community; yet the biogeochemical role of micro-organisms at these extreme elevations remains unknown. Using biogeochemical and molecular techniques, we investigated the biological community structure and ecosystem functioning of the pre-plant stages of primary succession in soils along a high-Andean chronosequence. We found that recently glaciated soils were colonized by a diverse community of cyanobacteria during the first 4-5 years following glacial retreat. This significant increase in cyanobacterial diversity corresponded with equally dramatic increases in soil stability, heterotrophic microbial biomass, soil enzyme activity and the presence and abundance of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments. Furthermore, we found that soil nitrogen-fixation rates increased almost two orders of magnitude during the first 4-5 years of succession, many years before the establishment of mosses, lichens or vascular plants. Carbon analyses (pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy) of soil organic matter suggested that soil carbon along the chronosequence was of microbial origin. This indicates that inputs of nutrients and organic matter during early ecosystem development at these sites are dominated by microbial carbon and nitrogen fixation. Overall, our results indicate that photosynthetic and nitrogen-fixing bacteria play important roles in acquiring nutrients and facilitating ecological succession in soils near some of the highest elevation receding glaciers on the Earth. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Cyanobacteria; Nitrogen fixation; Peruvian Andes; Primary succession","biogeochemistry; chronosequence; climate change; colonization; cyanobacterium; deglaciation; ecosystem function; elevation; environmental conditions; heterotrophy; nitrogen fixation; primary succession; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; soil profile; soil stabilization; article; biogeochemistry; chronosequence; cyanobacterium; ecosystem; glacier; microbial diversity; nitrogen fixation; photosynthesis; plant ecology; priority journal; pyrolysis; sea level rise; soil; soil analysis; Andes; Peru; South America; Bryophyta; Cyanobacteria; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349130530

While sink-leaf phloem mediates the influx of reduced carbon from older source leaves and the release of this imported carbon to the sink-leaf mesophyll, source-leaf phloem catalyzes the uptake of photoassimilates into companion cells (CCs) and sieve elements (SEs) and the net carbon export from the leaf. Phloem loading in source leaves with sucrose, the main or exclusive transport form for fixed carbon in most higher plants, is catalyzed by plasma membrane-localized sucrose transporters. Consistent with the described physiological switch from sink to source, the promoter of the Arabidopsis AtSUC2 gene is active only in source-leaf CCs of Arabidopsis or of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). For the identification of regulatory elements involved in this companion cell-specific and source-specific gene expression, we performed detailed analyses of the AtSUC2 promoter by truncation and mutagenesis. A 126-bp promoter fragment was identified, which seems to contain these fragments and which drives AtSUC2-typical expression when combined with a 35S minimal promoter. Within this fragment, linker-scanning analyses revealed two cis-regulatory elements that were further characterized as putative binding sites for transcription factors of the DNA-binding-with-one-finger or the homeo-domain-leucine-zipper families. Similar or identical binding sites are found in other genes and in different plant species, suggesting an ancient regulatory mechanism for this important physiological switch. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Arabidopsis thaliana SUCROSE TRANSPORTER 2 gene (AtSUC2); Companion cells; DOF-factor; HD-Zip; Sieve elements; Sink-to-source transition","beta glucuronidase; carrier protein; DNA binding protein; green fluorescent protein; sucrose transport protein, plant; transcription factor; vegetable protein; article; binding site; gene expression regulation; genetic transformation; genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; phloem; promoter region; staining; Binding Sites; Conserved Sequence; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucuronidase; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mutation; Phloem; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Staining and Labeling; Transcription Factors; Transformation, Genetic; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Embryophyta; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749096513

We assessed how future land use change (LUC) can influence future carbon stock change in soil and vegetation in the EU. The emphasis is on the role of LUC in the overall carbon balance of the EU biosphere. Because LUC is the most dynamic driving factor of terrestrial carbon stock change, it is important to account for the dynamics of LUC in carbon stock change modelling. The major challenge in coupling a carbon model and a LUC model is the difference in spatial and temporal resolution generally used in these modelling approaches. We used a high-resolution LUC model and a carbon bookkeeping approach that takes into account effects of soil and forest age on carbon stock changes. These approaches best fit the chosen resolution and extent in a consistent manner. Four SRES scenarios that cover a range of possible future developments were evaluated: Global Economy (A1): lean government, strong globalization; Continental Markets (A2): lean government, regional cultural and economic development; Global Co-operation (B1): much governmental intervention, strong globalization; Regional Communities (B2): much governmental intervention, regional cultural and economic development. If land use remains unchanged, carbon sequestration rates are expected to decrease by 4% in 2030 relative to 2000. LUC causes an additional sequestration rate decrease in the A2 scenario of 2% in 2030. In the other three scenarios, sequestration rate increases by 9-16% in 2030 relative to 2000. In 2030, the terrestrial biosphere in the EU is expected to sequester between 90 and 111 Tg C year-1. This is 6.5-8% of the projected anthropogenic emissions. In the B2 scenario, the highest sequestration rate increase is expected (15 Tg C year-1). Clear differences are found in the spatial distribution of sinks and sources between the scenarios, illustrating that land use is an important factor in future carbon sequestration changes that cannot be ignored. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Population models have the inherent advantage of considering a species' response to climate as resulting from distinct mechanisms. However, they may have the disadvantage of considering only short-term processes as they occur under the current climate, disregarding slowly adapting mechanisms. It would be important, however, to know whether slowly adapting processes occur, and whether they will respond to climate change. A way of testing for a discrepancy between short-term and long-term mechanisms in the response to climate is contrasting a population model with the current distribution and abundance in different climates. We demonstrate this idea for the sociable weaver Philetairus socius, a passerine bird of semiarid southern Africa. We develop a dynamic population model that predicts the species' response to mean annual precipitation (MAP) and tests whether the model can reproduce the occurrence of sociable weavers in their current range of MAP as well as realistic abundances in two study locations with different MAP. The model predicts a decreased abundance under a scenario of decreased MAP and it can reproduce realistic populations in a single location. However it cannot explain the occurrence of sociable weavers across their entire distribution nor does it produce realistic abundances in the two areas when they were tested simultaneously. The results imply that the sensitive short-term response to MAP is buffered by long-term processes such as adaptation or plasticity in life history, shifts in interspecific interactions or changes in habitat structure. We suggest that this result is common for animals in semi-arid and arid regions and discuss implications for static and dynamic modelling approaches in climate change research. © 2008 The Authors.",,"adaptation; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; interspecific interaction; passerine; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; population dynamics; population modeling; precipitation assessment; species occurrence; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Animalia; Aves; Passeriformes; Philetairus socius; Philetarius socius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649086105

The proposed approach for modeling the L-band radiative transfer through leaf litter consists of an isotropic effective medium approach for the litter permittivities, a coherent radiative transfer model for computing the coherent reflectivities from dielectric depth profiles, and an averaging procedure for computing the reflectivities determining the field-scale brightness temperatures. Evaluations were performed for the case of leaf litter on top of a conducting wire grid (litter-grid formation) and for litter on underlying soil (litter-soil formation). A model sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to parameters characterizing litter thickness variations and boundary roughness. For the litter-soil formation, the model was rather sensitive to local irregularities at the air-to-litter boundary. Modeled microwave signatures reproduced the major features of the measurements performed on a site comprising a litter-grid formation. Under dry conditions, the investigated litter layer was nearly ""invisible."" When the same litter layer was wetted, it acted as an important radiation source to be taken into account for the quantitative remote soil moisture detection of forested areas. Under certain conditions, the simulations revealed an increasing brightness when the litter is wetted prior to the underlying soil. Further wetting of the litter-soil system then resulted in a decreasing brightness as expected for increased moisture. Such effects are important to know to avoid misleading interpretations of L-band signatures. © 2008 IEEE.","Leaf litter; Microwave radiometry; Radiative transfer; Soil moisture","Astrophysics; Forestry; Geophysics; Groundwater; Impact testing; Luminance; Microwaves; Modal analysis; Moisture; Moisture determination; Optical properties; Permittivity; Quantum optics; Radiation; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Soil testing; Soils; Vegetation; Weathering; Wetting; (I ,J) conditions; (p ,p ,t) measurements; Boundary roughness; Brightness temperature (BT); Conducting wire (CW); Deciduous forests; depth profiling; Dry conditions; Effective medium approach; Forest soils; Forested areas; Leaf litter; litter layer; Low microwave frequencies; Model sensitivity analysis; moisture detection; new model; Parameters characterizing; radiation sources; Radiative transfer model (RTM); Soil formations; thickness variations; Geologic models; Brightness; Crowns; Dielectric Constant; Forest Litter; Ground Water; Mathematical Models; Microwaves; Moisture; Optical Properties; Plants; Radiation; Reflection; Soil; Weathering; Wetting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849107271

But given historical evidence from many other technologies it is highly likely that learning by doing (LBD) would lead to substantial cost reductions. In this study, we implement potential cost reductions from LBD into an existing agent-based model that captures the main dynamics of the introduction of the new technology together with hydrogen infrastructure build-up. Assumptions about the learning rate turn out to have a critical impact on the projected diffusion of the FCVs. Moreover, LBD could imply a substantial first mover advantage.

However, carbogen often causes discomfort due to its forced strong and deep breathing which also may lead to severe motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging. In this study, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) was performed with CO2 levels of 0, 1.67%, 3.33% and 5% to measure the induced BOLD signal changes in venous vessels and brain tissue. Susceptibility-weighted imaging data from 15 healthy subjects and one patient with a brain tumor were acquired. The signal magnitude of cortical veins increased relative to pure oxygen by 3.5 ± 3.8%, 10.3 ± 4.5%, and 22.7 ± 8.8% for CO2 concentrations of 1.67%, 3.33%, and 5%, respectively. Significant signal changes were detected in segmented white matter for 5% CO2, and gray matter for both 3.3% and 5% CO2. The influence of motion artifacts was clearly traceable by the broadening of the signal distribution in segmented tissue. Heterogeneous signal changes were observed in the patient for the same tumor regions at both 3.33% and 5% CO2. Signal phase values of white and gray matter changed only very slightly with increasing CO2. Based on our findings we recommend the reduction of CO2 concentration to about 3% when using a mixture of O2 and CO2. All subjects also reported highly improved breathing comfort at 3.3% CO2 as compared to 5%.

Population-based, cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 1202 respondents in Portland OR and Houston TX between June and September 2007 regarding awareness, concern, and behavior change related to climate change. The data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Awareness about climate change is virtually universal (98% in Portland and 92% in Houston) with the vast majority reporting some level of concern (90% in Portland and 82% in Houston). A multivariate analysis revealed significant predictors of behavior change: individuals with heightened concern about climate change (p<0.001); respondents with higher level of education (p= 0.03); younger compared with older individuals (p<0.001); and Portlanders more likely to change behavior compared with Houstonians (p<0.001). Of those who changed behavior, 43% reported having reduced their energy usage at home, 39% had reduced gasoline consumption, and 26% engaged in other behaviors, largely recycling. Qualitative data indicate a number of cognitive, behavioral, and structural obstacles to voluntary mitigation. Although consumers are interested in global climate change-mitigation strategies and willing to act accordingly, considerable impediments remain. Government policy must eliminate economic, structural, and social barriers to change and advance accessible and economical alternatives. Individual-level mitigation can be a policy option under favorable contextual conditions, as these results indicate, but must be accompanied by mitigation efforts from industry, commerce, and government. © 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",,"gasoline; attitude to change; awareness; behavior change; climate change; energy consumption; global change; health survey; perception; policy; recycling; review; United States; Adult; Aged; Awareness; Conservation of Energy Resources; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Oregon; Public Opinion; Social Behavior; Texas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249092013

In this study, the interaction patterns of air pollutants, SO2, NOx are investigated based on traffic intersection and residential sites in Chennai city. This study is necessary, since these pollutants violate the prescribed norms of the NAAQ standards. Urban areas receive more diffuse radiation, heat radiation from the atmosphere and less solar radiation compared to rural areas. Heat balance may transports pollutants released at the periphery of the city towards the centre. As a result of this, the gaseous pollutants SO2, NOx and aerodynamic size of respirable dust particle and suspended particulate matter pollutants were continuously assessed using high volume sampler at residential and traffic intersection sampling stations in Chennai city. The main objective of this research study is to determine the background concentration of the pollutants with reference to the different local activities. It is observed that the pollutant values always exceed the NAAQS value throughout the sampling period by a very large amount. The statistical calculations made on pollutant data show significant and vary very widely. The important finding of this study is that the data collected yearwise for different pollutants is found to give best curve fit for cubic equations. Also, several issues and remedies pertaining to trace out the probable sources of the suspended particulate matter concentration is also discussed in this paper. © 2008 - Kalpana Corporation.","Air pollution; Analysis of variance; Cubic fit equations; NOx; SO2",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749179699

Comparing the results obtained from the as-cast and remelted specimens, similar hot ductility values were observed in the low temperature range. At higher temperatures, however, the remelted slab specimen had a higher R/A (reduction of area) value. The decreased R/A value of the as-cast specimens in the high temperature region could be explained by the increase in the initial grain size due to the slow cooling of the large slab during continuous casting. This means a lower hot ductility value than that obtained from remelted specimen should be assumed in the case of the application of lab data to an actual continuous casting process.","Cast structure; Continuous casting; Hot ductility; R/A; Remelting","Continuous casting; Ductility; Remelting; Strain rate; Temperature; Tensile testing; Cast structures; Continuous casting process; Continuous casting slabs; Ductility behaviors; High temperature tensile tests; Initial grain size; Low temperatures; Reduction of areas; Steel castings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349123634

Medical Center Dr., Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0606, United States","Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) catalyzes the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2 at a nickel-iron-sulfur cluster (the C-cluster). CO oxidation follows a ping-pong mechanism involving two-electron reduction of the C-cluster followed by electron transfer through an internal electron transfer chain to external electron acceptors. We describe 13C NMR studies demonstrating a CODH-catalyzed steady-state exchange reaction between CO and CO2 in the absence of external electron acceptors. This reaction is characterized by a CODH-dependent broadening of the 13CO NMR resonance; however, the chemical shift of the 13CO resonance is unchanged, indicating that the broadening is in the slow exchange limit of the NMR experiment. The 13CO line broadening occurs with a rate constant (1080 s-1 at 20°C) that is approximately equal to that of CO oxidation. It is concluded that the observed exchange reaction is between 13CO and CODH-bound 13CO2 because 13CO line broadening is pH-independent (unlike steady-state CO oxidation), because it requires a functional C-cluster (but not a functional B-cluster) and because the 13CO2 line width does not broaden. Furthermore, a steady-state isotopic exchange reaction between 12CO and 13CO2 in solution was shown to occur at the same rate as that of CO2 reduction, which is approximately 750-fold slower than the rate of 13CO exchange broadening. The interaction between CODH and the inhibitor cyanide (CN-) was also probed by 13C NMR. A functional C-cluster is not required for 13CN- broadening (unlike for 13CO), and its exchange rate constant is 30-fold faster than that for 13CO. The combined results indicate that the 13CO exchange includes migration of CO to the C-cluster, and CO oxidation to CO2, but not release of CO2 or protons into the solvent. They also provide strong evidence of a CO2 binding site and of an internal proton transfer network in CODH. 13CN- exchange appears to monitor only movement of CN- between solution and its binding to and release from CODH. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon monoxide (CO) dehydrogenase; reversible oxidation; Carbon monoxide; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; aldehyde dehydrogenase; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; multienzyme complex; article; binding site; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; catalysis; chemical reaction; electron transport; oxidation; pH; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; steady state; bacterium; catalysis; chemical structure; enzymology; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; oxidation reduction reaction; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Bacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Catalysis; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Molecular Structure; Multienzyme Complexes; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049094831

A wide range of renewable energy heating and cooling (REHC) technologies exists but they are presently only used to meet around 2-3% of total world demand (excluding from traditional biomass). Several of these technologies are mature, their markets are growing, and their costs relative to conventional heating and cooling systems continue to decline. However, in most countries, policies developed to encourage the wider deployment of renewable electricity generation, transport biofuels and energy efficiency have over-shadowed policies aimed at REHC technology deployment. This paper, based on the findings of the International Energy Agency publication Renewables for Heating and Cooling-Untapped Potential, outlines the present and future markets and compares the costs of providing heating and cooling services from solar, geothermal and biomass resources. It analyses current policies and experiences and makes recommendations to support enhanced market deployment of REHC technologies to provide greater energy supply security and climate change mitigation. If policies as successfully implemented by the leading countries were to be replicated elsewhere (possibly after modification to better suit local conditions), there would be good potential to significantly increase the share of renewable energy in providing heating and cooling services. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The overwhelming priority for the GOI is to sustain a high level of economic growth (8%+) and provision of secure, reliable energy (especially electricity) is one of the widely recognised bottlenecks in maintaining a high growth rate. In such a supply-starved context, it is not easy to envisage adoption of CCS-which increases overall generation capacity and demand for coal without increasing actual electricity supply-as being acceptable. Anything which increases costs-even slightly-is very unlikely to happen, unless it is fully paid for by the international community. The majority viewpoint of the industry and GOI interviewees towards CCS appears to be that it is a frontier technology, which needs to be developed further in the Annex-1 countries to bring down the cost through RD&amp;D and deployment.

The approach is general in nature, but is applied here to the case of air pollution. It uses a computer model involving ambient pollution and temperature input to simulate the exposures experienced by individuals in an urban area, while incorporating the mechanisms that determine exposures. The output from the model comprises a set of daily exposures for a sample of individuals from the population of interest. These daily exposures are approximated by parametric distributions so that the predictive exposure distribution of a randomly selected individual can be generated. These distributions are then incorporated into a hierarchical Bayesian framework (with inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation) in order to examine the relationship between short-term changes in exposures and health outcomes, while making allowance for long-term trends, seasonality, the effect of potential confounders and the possibility of ecological bias. The paper applies this approach to particulate pollution (PM 10) and respiratory mortality counts for seniors in greater London (≥65 years) during 1997. Within this substantive epidemiological study, the effects on health of ambient concentrations and (estimated) personal exposures are compared. The proposed model incorporates within day (or between individual) variability in personal exposures, which is compared to the more traditional approach of assuming a single pollution level applies to the entire population for each day. Effects were estimated using single lags and distributed lag models, with the highest relative risk, RR=1.02 (1.01-1.04), being associated with a lag of two days ambient concentrations of PM10. Individual exposures to PM 10 for this group (seniors) were lower than the measured ambient concentrations with the corresponding risk, RR=1.05 (1.01-1.09), being higher than would be suggested by the traditional approach using ambient concentrations. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics.","Air pollution; Bayesian hierarchical models; Environmental epidemiology; Personal exposure simulator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649754830

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling was also conducted in parallel to assist with flow visualisation. The commercial CFD package CFX™ was used. It has been found that dramatic reductions in coefficient of drag (CD) of up to 70% can be achieved on the model using tapered and rounded top and side leading edges, and a truncated rear boat-tail. The curved front section allows the airflow to adhere to the bus surfaces for the full length of the vehicle, while the boat-tails reduce the size of the low pressure region at the base of the bus and more importantly, additional pressure recovery occurs and the base pressures rise, reducing drag. It is found that the CFD results show remarkable agreement with experimental results, both in the magnitude of the force coefficients as well as in their trends. An analysis shows that such a reduction in aerodynamic drag could lead to a significant 28% reduction in fuel consumption for a typical bus on intercity or interstate operation. This could translate to a massive dollar savings as well as significant emissions reductions across a fleet.

If current emissions and land use trends continue unchecked, the next generations will face more injury, disease, and death related to natural disasters and heat waves, higher rates of climate-related infections, and wide-spread malnutrition, as well as more allergic and air pollution-related morbidity and mortality. This review highlights links between global climate change and anticipated increases in prevalence and severity of asthma and related allergic disease mediated through worsening ambient air pollution and altered local and regional pollen production. The pattern of change will vary regionally depending on latitude, altitude, rainfall and storms, land-use patterns, urbanization, transportation, and energy production. The magnitude of climate change and related increases in allergic disease will be affected by how aggressively greenhouse gas mitigation strategies are pursued, but at best an average warming of 1 to 2°C is certain this century. Thus, anticipation of a higher allergic disease burden will affect clinical practice as well as public health planning.

It is likely that, without changes to the policies in place in 2006, global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion would nearly double their 2000 level by 2020 and would continue to rise beyond 2030. Neither the SRES marker scenarios nor the reference cases assembled in recent studies using integrated assessment models capture this abrupt shift to rapid growth based on fossil fuels, centred in key Asian countries. While policy changes must and will occur, the realism of the reference case is critical for analysis and policy formulation. Using such a reference path will have significant effects on impact and damage estimates, on the analysis of achievable stabilisation paths and on estimates of the costs of achieving stabilisation at a given GHG concentration level. Use of a realistic reference path is also essential for the international negotiations, arising out of the COP13 meeting in Bali, to achieve widely desired stabilisation goals: both the level of emission reductions to be achieved, and the preferred distribution of those reductions over countries and regions, will be heavily influenced by the reference case assumed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Climatology; Coal; Coal combustion; Concentration (process); Emission control; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Leakage (fluid); Public policy; Asian countries; Change analyses; Concentration levels; Damage estimates; Emission reductions; Fuel combustions; Global growths; Integrated assessment models; International negotiations; Policy changes; Policy formulations; Rapid growths; Reference paths; Stabilisation; Developing countries; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate modeling; coal; developing world; emission control; environmental policy; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; policy making; Asia; Eurasia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56549092009

Mass concentrations of five cations (sodium [Na+], potassium [K+], ammonium [NH4+], calcium [Ca2+], and magnesium [Mg2+]) and four anions (fluoride [F-], chloride [Cl-], nitrate [NO3-], and sulfate [SO42-]) were determined by ion chromatography. The yearly arithmetic-mean mass concentrations of the total measured water-soluble ions in TSP and PM2.5 were 83.9 ± 58.4 and 45 ± 34.3 μg · m-3. The most abundant ions in TSP were SO42-, NO3-, Ca2+, and NH4+; whereas in PM2.5 the dominant ions were SO42-, NH4+, and NO3-. Most of the ions were more concentrated in the PM2.5 than in TSP, but two exceptions were Ca2+ and Mg2+. Comparisons of the molar ratios of Mg2+/Ca2+ in TSP indicated that fugitive dust was the main source for these two ions, and the influence of soil dust from outside of the city was most evident during dust storms. The mass concentrations of SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, and K+ in TSP were highest in winter and lowest in spring, but Ca2+ was much higher in spring than other seasons because of suspended mineral dust. In PM2.5, NO3- and K+ also showed winter maxima, but SO4 2- and NH4+ were highest in summer. Calculations of ion equivalents showed that TSP samples were more alkaline than PM2.5, the latter being weakly acidic in winter and autumn. High sulfur and nitrogen oxidation ratios occurred in summer and autumn, and there was evidence for the formation of ammonium bisulfate in TSP, ammonium sulfate in PM2.5, and ammonium nitrate in both fractions. Comparisons with the results of prior studies indicate that pollution controls in Xi'an have reduced the levels of air pollution over the past 10 yr. The SO42- concentration during the heating season in 2006 was only about one-eighth of that in 1996, and NH4+ decreased to one-ninth of that in 1996. Seasonal variations in the NO3 -/SO42- ratio are different than the patterns observed 10 yr ago, suggesting that emission sources have changed, with those from motor vehicles becoming increasingly important.

Saturated hydrocarbons analysis was carried out on different river sediments in order to detect possible contaminations by petroleum development. Total concentrations of hydrocarbons in the sediments ranged from 6.4-147.3 μg g -1 (dry wt) with an average of 76.8 μg g -1, revealing relatively low to medium contamination in studied areas in spite of oil development for many years. The THC levels in the mainstream of Beiluohe River were relatively low. Sediment samples with higher total hydrocarbon concentrations were from the sites related to the petroleum activities or urban discharges. Gas chromatographic distribution patterns of n-alkanes are characteristic of petroleum in most samples. They show a strong unresolved complex mixture (UCM) with a small predominance of odd on even numbered n-alkanes. On the other hand, pentacyclic triterpanes and steranes occurred in all analyzed sediments and displayed similar signatures that are characteristic of mature organic matter contribution from oil contaminations. Hydrocarbons of terrestrial origin were also detected in the samples. However, contribution from plantwax hydrocarbons is overshadowed in samples by hydrocarbons of petroleum origin. This is obvious by the presence of the high relative abundance of UCM, and the identification of mature hopane and sterane in samples. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Beiluohe River Basin; Biomarkers; Extractable organic matter; Saturated hydrocarbons; Sediment","Beiluohe River; Beiluohe River Basin; Biomarkers; Extractable organic matter; Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination; River sediments; Saturated hydrocarbons; Sediment; Surface sediments; Contamination; Fossil fuels; Hydrocarbons; Organic compounds; Petroleum chemistry; Petroleum refineries; Sedimentology; Sedimentation; alkane; alkane derivative; biological marker; isoprenoid; oil; organic matter; petroleum derivative; sterane derivative; triterpane derivative; unclassified drug; article; China; contamination; controlled study; gas chromatography; oil industry; river basin; sediment; soil pollution; Alkanes; Biological Markers; Fresh Water; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849169335

Allochthonous carbon is the basis of the detrital food web in low-order, warmwater stream ecosystems, and stream-bed sediments typically function as carbon reservoirs. Many of the same factors that govern carbon input and storage to streams (e.g. riparian vegetation, large wood, heterogeneous boundaries) have also been identified as key attributes of stream fish habitat. 2. Effects of channel incision on sand-bed stream carbon reservoirs and indices of biological integrity (IBIs) based on fish collections were examined for four streams exhibiting a range of incisement in northern Mississippi. Observed mean C concentrations (mass percentage) ranged from 0.24 ±0.36% for a non-incised stream to only 0.01 ± 0.02% for a severely incised channel, and were not correlated with large wood (LW) density, perhaps because LW density at one site was elevated by a habitat rehabilitation project and at another site by accelerated inputs from incision-related riparian tree fall. Fish IBI was positively correlated with bed C (r = 0.70, p = 0.003), and IBIs for reference streams were more than 50% greater than those computed for the most severely degraded sites. 3. More testing is needed to determine the efficacy of stream bed C as an indicator, but its importance to warmwater stream ecosystems, and the importance of covarying physical and hydrologic conditions seems evident.

We present an integrated process model of the engineering economics of technologies to reduce NH3 and CH4 emissions at dairy operations in California. Three policy options are explored: PM offset credits for NH3 control, GHG offset credits for CH4 control, and expanded net metering policies to provide revenue for the sale of electricity generated from captured methane (CH4) gas. Individually these policies vary substantially in the economic incentives they provide for farm operators to reduce emissions. We report on initial steps to fully develop the integrated process model that will provide guidance for policy-makers.

Decreases in annual average surface particulate are relatively robust, with intermodel variations in magnitude typically <30% and very similar spatial structure. Surface ozone responses are small and highly model dependent. The largest net RF results from reductions in emissions from the North America industrial/power and developing Asia domestic fuel burning sectors. Sulfate reductions dominate the first case, for which intermodel variations in the sulfate (or total) aerosol optical depth (AOD) responses are ∼30% and the modeled spatial patterns of the AOD reductions are highly correlated (R=0.9). Decreases in BC dominate the developing Asia domestic fuel burning case, and show substantially greater model-to-model differences. Intermodel variations in tropospheric ozone burden changes are also large, though aerosol changes dominate those cases with substantial net climate forcing. The results indicate that across-the-board emissions reductions in domestic fuel burning in developing Asia and in surface transportation in North America are likely to offer the greatest potential for substantial, simultaneous improvement in local air quality and near-term mitigation of global climate change via short-lived species. Conversely, reductions in industrial/power emissions have the potential to accelerate near-term warming, though they would improve AQ and have a long-term cooling effect on climate.

A 1.3 L, 53 kW CI engine coupled to an eddy-current engine dynamometer was tested first. Data were collected on engine operating parameters, fuel consumption, concentration of total oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the exhaust, and exhaust temperature. Eight steady-state operating points were tested with hydrogen flow rates equivalent to 0%, 5%, and 10% of the total fuel energy. In a second set of experiments, the stock gasoline engine of a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox was replaced with a 1.3 L, 66 kW CI engine, and urban drive cycles were run on a chassis dynamometer. The drive cycles were repeated with 0%, 5% and 10% of the fuel energy coming from the fumigated hydrogen. In both experiments, the addition of hydrogen did not result in discernable differences in engine efficiency. In the vehicle testing, there were no noticeable differences in drivability. There were modest reductions in NOx emissions and increases in exhaust temperature with hydrogen addition. This investigation demonstrates that fumigating relatively small amounts of hydrogen into the intake of a modern diesel engine results in only modest changes in combustion efficiency and emissions with no detrimental effects on vehicle performance or drivability. This strategy can be used to partially offset the use of petroleum-based fuels in light-duty transportation vehicles. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Combustion; Diesel; Efficiency; Emissions; Hydrogen","Automobile parts and equipment; Combustion; Concentration (process); DC motors; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Diesel locomotives; Dynamometers; Eddy currents; Engines; Experiments; Fuels; Hydrogen; Liquid fuels; Nonmetals; Petroleum products; Petroleum refineries; Petroleum transportation; Smoke; Thermochemistry; Vehicles; Chassis dynamometers; Chevrolet equinoxes; Ci engines; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion systems; Detrimental effects; Diesel; Diesel vehicles; Drive cycles; Emissions; Engine efficiencies; Exhaust temperatures; Fuel energies; Gaseous hydrogens; Gasoline engines; Hydrogen additions; Hydrogen flow rates; Operating parameters; Operating points; Oxides of nitrogens; Transportation vehicles; Vehicle performances; Automobile engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449120004

National level surveys are a useful tool for furthering this understanding but present multiple challenges, two of which are addressed in this paper. The first challenge is that the U.S. public's limited knowledge of climate change issues requires that information is provided in the survey, and that the content of this information is thought to be critical in eliciting accurate responses. Second, the use of national surveys may mask regional and state differences that result from the distribution of predicted climate change impacts and varying social contexts. We explore these issues by assessing the impacts of (a) the provision of information on climate change impacts at different scales (national and regional) and (b) the respondent's state of residence (Michigan or Virginia) on climate change policy support.

The re-analysis covered the period from 1994 to 2005 and was focused on suspected long-range transport events that were recorded both in Moscow and at several Finnish sites. In order to trace the origin of airborne pollen before the onset of local pollination, we used both aerobiological and phenological observations combined with forward and adjoint (inverse) dispersion model simulations. It is shown that, although the Moscow region is surrounded by extensive birch forests, it still receives substantial amounts of foreign pollen before local pollination. In the Moscow region, the sources of long-range-transported pollen are in the south and south-west, sometimes even in the east. In Finland, there are frequently cases, before the local flowering season, in which Finnish territory receives Russian pollen; however in the opposite direction, from Finland to the Moscow region, no transport episodes were unequivocally registered. Analysis of the end of the seasons was more problematic, due to contributions to pollen observations from local sources; this results in difficulties in the reliable identification of the long-range transport episodes. Apart from its short-term effects on the pollen seasons, long-range transport can have substantial impacts on the exchange of genetic material within Europe. A quick atmospheric pathway for gene transport can be important for adaptation of plants to a changing climate. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Atmospheric transport; Betula; Footprint; Gene flow; Inverse simulations; Pollen transport","air analysis; article; atmospheric transport; birch; dispersion; Finland; nonhuman; pollen analysis; priority journal; Russian Federation; Betula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349139028

We investigated the presence of Salmonella spp. in Bahia de Todos Santos (Baja California, Mexico) and evaluated the environmental factors that affect the occurrence of Salmonella spp. in this arid region. A total of 1,331 samples collected from 21 sites along the coast during a period of 3 years were analyzed for Salmonella spp. Geographical and seasonal distribution of Salmonella spp. was evaluated in association with environmental parameters and with human infections in the area. The incidence of Salmonella bacteria throughout the study was 4.8%, with the highest incidence detected in wastewater (16.2%), followed by stream water (10.6%), mollusks (7.4%), and seawater (2.3%). Twenty different serotypes were identified among the 64 Salmonella isolates. The dominant serotype was Typhimurium (23.4%), followed by Vejle (6.2%). The presence of Salmonella spp. in coastal areas was mostly confined to rainy periods and areas of stream discharges, and runoff was identified as the predominant factor influencing the transport of Salmonella bacteria from source points to the sea via streams. Isolation of Salmonella spp. was negatively and significantly associated with temperature, probably because of the effect of solar radiation in the decline of permanence of Salmonella bacteria. Conversely, human infections prevailed during the warmest months and were negatively correlated with the presence of Salmonella spp. in the marine environment.

More than 2700 specimens were studied. The Carboniferous wet-type flora (Rosice-Oslavany Formation) is relatively hygrophilous with a dominance of ferns (Pecopteris cyathea and P. densifolia) and a smaller representation of sphenopsids (Annularia sphenophylloides). Pteridosperms and cordaitaleans are rare. Conifers (Ernestiodendron filiciforme), as drier-type elements, occur locally above the 1st (uppermost) coal seam of the Rosice-Oslavany coals together with many representatives of pteridosperms (medullosans, Odontopteris schlotheimii). This indicates the beginning of seasonality and aridisation of the climate. The Permian flora is dominated by conifers and is of an arid character. Some horizons contain a relatively high proportion of pteridosperms (Zbýšov, Říčany and Zboněk-Svitávka horizons), however, the species spectrum differs and the Permian pteridosperms are mainly represented by peltasperms (Autunia conferta). Ferns and sphenopsids are extremely rare in the Permian horizons. The flora reflects changes in the basin from relatively wet climate in the Rosice-Oslavany Formation to the seasonal and ""dry"" climate during the Permian. The Permian extrabasinal floral elements preserved in fossiliferous horizons grew in the basin during the seasonal climate. The red sediments outside the fossiliferous horizons are barren, presumably reflecting a semi-arid climate. The seasonality and ""less"" or ""more"" dry periods during the Permian are documented changes in diversity and dominance of the flora, and by cluster analysis. Using unconstrained Jaccard's analysis, the Carboniferous ""wet-type"" flora is clearly separated from the ""dry-type"" Permian flora. Even though the Chudčice Horizon is approximately in the middle of the section, it is placed in this analysis at the top of the dendrogram together with the ""dry-type"" floral clusters. This analysis reflects an aridisation trend rather than biostratigraphically determined changes. As a result of our excavations, 15 species are here for the first time reported from the Boskovice Basin: Pecopteris cf. bredovii, Remia pinnatifida, Odontopteris lingulata, Neurocallipteris gallica, N. planchardii, Rhachiphyllum aff. curretiensis, ?R. subauriculata, Dicranophyllum longifolium, Culmitzschia angustifolia, Hermitia arnhardtii, H. germanica, H. rigidula, H. schlotheimii, and bifurcated leaves of uncertain affinity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The socioeconomic profile of Shikohpur is highly skewed with mostly small and marginal farmers. Though the areas under wheat in Shikohpur are increasing, the productivity is declining or remaining stagnant over the years. Most of the area during kharif season (June-September) remains fallow. Pearl millet based cropping systems (pearl millet-mustard and pearl millet-wheat) are predominant. Soils are mostly loamy sand to sandy loam with average of 70-80% sand content. Organic C content in soil is less than 0.3%, due to high prevailing temperature with little rainfall and also intensive agriculture followed in this region. Though the annual average seasonal rainfall in Gurgaon did not have much variation over the years, occurrence of extreme climate events has increased in the last two decades. The crop intensity is low and the water table is declining. Water and nitrogen production functions were developed for the important crops of the region, for their subsequent use in scheduling of the inputs. InfoCrop, WTGROWS and technical coefficients were used for crop planning and resource management under climate change and its variability, extreme events, limited resource availability and crop intensification. These will help in disseminating necessary agro-advisories to the farmers so that they will be able to manipulate the inputs and agronomic management practices for sustained agricultural production under normal as well as extreme climatic conditions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Agri-production estimates; Biophysical and socioeconomic characterization; Extreme climatic events; Landuse planning; Nitrogen use efficiency; Simulation modeling; Water use efficiency","Climate change; Computer simulation; Economic and social effects; Land use; Sand; Soils; Agri-production estimates; Biophysical characterization; Land use planning; Socioeconomic characterization; Water-stressed area; Agriculture; nitrogen; organic compound; rain; water; agricultural production; climate change; crop yield; extreme event; land use planning; modeling; productivity; water use efficiency; agriculture; agronomy; article; Brassica; climate; climate change; crop management; crop production; cropping system; environmental temperature; India; land use; nonhuman; pearl millet; productivity; resource management; sandy loam; seasonal variation; simulation; socioeconomics; water stress; water table; wheat; Agriculture; Climate; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Fertilizers; Humans; India; Models, Biological; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors; Water; Weather; Asia; Eurasia; Gurgaon; Haryana; India; South Asia; Pennisetum glaucum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46549087790

With the Bali Action Plan categorically placing reduced emissions from degradation and deforestation (REDD) activities on the agenda of future climate change negotiations, there is now a strong possibility that policy approaches and incentives relating to enhancement of carbon stocks in low biomass forests will be successfully negotiated and accepted as a legitimate greenhouse gas mitigation option in the upcoming post-2012 climate change regime. Using the institutional mechanisms provided by community-based forest management (CBFM), 833.8 Tg carbon can be sequestered by enhancement of forest carbon stocks in low biomass Indian forests. By protection refugia, restoring biodiversity, providing connectivity, mimicking nature in plantations and controlling man-made fires, CBFM as practiced in India can be an effective way of managing forests during times of climate change. Appropriately designed CBFM policy can provide means to sustain and strengthen community livelihoods and at the same time avoid deforestation, restore forest cover and density, provide carbon mitigation and create rural assets. Channeling carbon investment funds into CBFM projects can make both development and conservation economically viable and attractive for the local communities to maintain biodiversity and integrity of nature. However, before actual funding under the Clean Development Mechanism and other international C investment funds is available, policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to REDD need to be negotiated and agreed upon by the participating nations to UNFCCC. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This contrasts with predictions by global models that H should peak in this region at this time. We suggest the decrease is a consequence of the sequestering of the water vapor by the formation of polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) that redistributes the H2O thus reducing the chemical source of H. This decrease is more pronounced in the Northern rather than the Southern summer which is roughly consistent with the known morphology of PMCs. A model calculation which includes a PMC parameterization gives good qualitative agreement with the data suggesting that this process should be considered in global models of the coupling between the middle and upper atmosphere.

Twenty-four hour samples were taken in the northern residential part of Zagreb using a low-volume (50 m3) sampler and glass or quartz filters. The analysis was performed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) and fluorescence detector with changeable excitation and emission wavelength. The annual average mass concentrations over the four-year measuring period for BaP ranged from 1.17 ng/m3 in 2004 to 1.87 ng/m3 in 2003 and were below the limit value (2 ng/m3) set by the Ordinance on Recommended and Limit Air Quality Values in Croatia. The highest concentrations of all PAHs measured in PM10 samples collected from 21 March 2003 to 20 March 2004 were found in the winter and the lowest in the summer.

In this study we examined the combined role of herbivores and climate warming as drivers of CO2 fluxes in two typical high-latitude habitats (mesic heath and wet meadow). We hypothesized that both herbivory and climate warming would reduce the C sink strength of Arctic tundra through their combined effects on plant biomass and gross ecosystem photosynthesis and on decomposition rates and the abiotic environment. To test this hypothesis we employed experimental warming (via International Tundra Experiment [ITEX] chambers) and grazing (via captive Barnacle Geese) in a three-year factorial field experiment. Ecosystem CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange of CO2, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem photosynthesis) were measured in all treatments at varying intensity over the three growing seasons to capture the impact of the treatments on a range of temporal scales (diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Grazing and warming treatments had markedly different effects on CO2 fluxes in the two tundra habitats. Grazing caused a strong reduction in CO2 assimilation in the wet meadow, while warming reduced CO2 efflux from the mesic heath. Treatment effects on net ecosystem exchange largely derived from the modification of gross ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. In this study we have demonstrated that on the habitat scale, grazing by geese is a strong driver of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, with the potential to reduce the CO2 sink strength of Arctic ecosystems. Our results highlight that the large reduction in plant biomass due to goose grazing in the Arctic noted in several studies can alter the C balance of wet tundra ecosystems. We conclude that herbivory will modulate direct climate warming responses of Arctic tundra with implications for the ecosystem C balance; however, the magnitude and direction of the response will be habitat-specific. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Arctic; Barnacle goose; Branta leucopsis; Carbon fluxes; Climate change; Herbivory; Vegetation","arctic environment; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; decomposition; grazing; growing season; habitat type; herbivory; hypothesis testing; net ecosystem exchange; photosynthesis; respiration; warming; waterfowl; Anser; Branta leucopsis; Thoracica; carbon dioxide; animal; Arctic; article; chemistry; ecosystem; feeding behavior; goose; greenhouse effect; metabolism; physiology; plant; randomization; temperature; Animals; Arctic Regions; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Geese; Greenhouse Effect; Plants; Random Allocation; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54549108848

Major differences between models included the explicit representation of roots in the more complex model and their effects on carbon partitioning and growth. The simple model only simulated aboveground processes. The overall goal was to develop a model capable of representing forage growth and ecosystem carbon fluxes among multiple plant species in pastures while maintaining a relatively simple model structure that minimized the number of required user inputs. Models were compared to observed yield data for 12 site-years from three experiments in central Pennsylvania, USA. Both models underestimated observed yield by 6% when averaged across site-years. However, the simple model provided a better fit to the one-to-one line between observed and simulated yield than did the complex model. The models also showed similar relationships between yield and gross primary productivity (GPP), despite the fact that the complex model was specifically developed to optimize simulation of GPP. The simple model predicted much greater shoot respiration and carbon partitioning to above ground plant tissues, but less shoot senescence than the complex model. Published data on the proportion of GPP consumed in aboveground or total plant respiration exhibit a wide range of values, making it impossible to determine which model provided the best representation of respiration rates and, thus, of the entire carbon budget.","Carbon flux; Model complexity; Pasture modeling; Photosynthesis; Respiration","agricultural modeling; carbon budget; carbon flux; comparative study; complexity; crop yield; growth modeling; milk production; pasture; photosynthesis; primary production; respiration; senescence; soil nutrient; North America; Pennsylvania; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56749169166

Subsequently, an attempt is made to determine to what extent these impacts are a bottleneck for a sustainable and certified ethanol production. Seventeen environmental and socio-economic areas of concern are analysed. Four parameters are used to evaluate if an area of concern is a bottleneck: (1) the importance of the area of concern, based on the severity of the impact and the frequency of which an aspect is mentioned in the literature as an area of concern, (2) the availability of indicators and criteria, (3) the necessity of improvement strategies to reach compliance with Brazilian and/or (inter) national legislation, standards, guidelines and sustainability criteria, and (4) the impact of these improvement strategies on the costs and potential of ethanol production. Fourteen areas of concern are classified as a minor or medium bottleneck. For 7 areas of concern the additional costs to avoid or reduce undesirable effects have been calculated at ≤+10% for each area of concern. Due to higher yields and overlapping costs the total additional production costs of compliance with various environmental and socio-economic criteria are about +36%. This study also shows that the energy input to output ratio can be increased and the greenhouse gas emissions reduced by increasing the ethanol production per tonne cane and by increasing the use of sugarcane waste for electricity production. A major bottleneck for a sustainable and certified production is the increase in cane production and the possible impacts on biodiversity and the competition with food production. Genetically modified cane is presently being developed, but is at this moment not (yet) applied. Both a ban on and the allowance of the use of genetically modified cane could become a major bottleneck considering the potentially large benefits and disadvantages, that are both highly uncertain at this moment. The approach demonstrated in this report provides a useful framework for the development of a practically applicable certification system, but further monitoring and research is required to reduce gaps in knowledge in combination with stakeholder consultation (particularly with respect to the three bottlenecks identified in this article). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines how, and to what extent, models which are currently used to predict emissions and fuel consumption from road traffic include the effects of congestion. A classification framework is presented in which a key factor, driving pattern, connects emissions to congestion. Prediction of the effects of different driving patterns in emission models is generally restricted to certain aspects of modelling, i.e. hot-running emissions of regulated pollutants. As a consequence, the effects of congestion are only partially incorporated in the predictions. The majority of emission models explicitly incorporate congestion in the modelling process, but for one important family of emission models, namely average speed models, this could not be determined directly. Re-examination of the (light-duty) driving patterns on which three average speed models (COPERT, MOBILE, EMFAC) are based, shows that it is likely that congestion is represented in these patterns. Since (hot-running) emission factors are based on these patterns, this implies that the emission factors used in these emission models also reflect different levels of congestion. Congestion is thus indirectly incorporated in these models. It is recommended, that, in order to get more accurate (local) emission predictions and to achieve correct application in particular situations, it is important to improve current average speed models by including a congestion algorithm, or alternatively, at least provide information on the level of congestion in the driving patterns on which these models are based and recommendations on what applications the models are suitable for. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The average nighttime mixing ratios at the altitude of the maximum vary with latitude and season. Analysis shows that the highest mixing ratios are clustered near the equator during equinoxes. The high ozone mixing ratios are observed in exactly the place and time at which the diurnal tide is largest. The diurnal tidal phase is such that coldest temperatures at 95 km occur near midnight. The high ozone is coincident with regions that have both low temperature and low amounts of atomic hydrogen. We focus particularly on ozone mixing ratios in the range of 18-50 ppmv; these occur intermittently in the equinoctial tropics on days when the night temperature is particularly cold. The occurrence of ozone maxima over 20 ppmv was unexpected but is shown in this paper to be consistent with theory and is a result of large-amplitude diurnal tides.

However, semiaquatic lizards have access to water and presumably food throughout the year, so it is possible that they will not have the seasonal response seen in terrestrial species. We studied the thermal biology, energetics, and water flux of Varanus indicus, a semiaquatic, mangroved-welling varanid in tropical northern Australia. Although V. indicus remained active all year, they reduced their activity in the dry season, but not to the extent of terrestrial varanids. Varanus indicus field metabolic rates decreased by 38% in the dry season mostly as a result of the reduction in activity. Although food and water depletion are the driving forces behind decreases in dry season Tb selection and energetics for many varanids, V. indicus appears not to be subject to these pressures to the same extent. Thermoregulatory indices indicate that V. indicus actively thermoregulate in the wet and dry seasons, but they do not fully exploit the available thermal resources. These lizards are unusual among varanid lizards in that their midday Tb's are relatively low (about 31°C) despite the availability of thermal resources that would allow them to attain substantially higher Tb's. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

According to Woolas, a third industrial revolution - a revolution based on low carbon - is the only option to fight climate change. The difference between this industrial revolution and the first two, however, is that there is a need to plan this one in advance and, because climate change is the ultimate global mutual dependency, it will have to be organized internationally. The general consensus is the need to stop the world's temperature rising by > 2°C. The Emissions Trading Scheme's cap-and-trade based policy could be the building block in the world scenario. Efforts to build a cap-and-trade program are based on the idea that this global transformation for the industrial revolution will require a world currency - and that currency is the price of carbon. The third objective is ensuring that a review is set that won't punish the country's economic prosperity, and that there is no need to halve our own industry through carbon leakage.

Globally and nationally, transport is consuming an ever increasing share of our total energy use. Furthermore, the bulk of energy used in transport comes from the burning of petroleum products. This brief paper summarises options arising from the two routes to reduce energy demand in transport: improved and more efficient use of existing and possible new transport modes, and the reduction of transport demand. In both areas, the prospects in the immediate and longer-term future are hedged with difficulties. Automobiles and aircraft have improved considerably in recent decades, but future improvements are likely to be incremental. The introduction of hydrogen as a fuel is appealing, but there are technical problems to be solved. Active reduction of demand for transport will require a decoupling of the link between demand and growth in gross domestic product. Globally, this will be very difficult to achieve. Various modes of public transport exist that are efficient in terms of their energy use per passenger kilometre. But they need large investments to make them more attractive than the automobile. However, population concentration in mega-cities, allied with congestion, will make such innovation essential. Policy measures can be assisted in their implementation by new technology, but will remain politically problematic. © 2008 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","Demand management; Technology; Transport modes","Concentration (process); Energy management; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Investments; Leakage (fluid); Petroleum products; Transportation routes; Active reductions; Demand management; Demand managements; Enabling technologies; Energy demands; Energy uses; Greenhouse Gas emissions; Gross Domestic Products; New technologies; Policy measures; Public transports; Technical problems; Total energies; Transport demands; Transport modes; Petroleum transportation; demand-side management; energy policy; energy use; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; public transport; technological development; transportation mode",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55249121594

A study conducted in a nitrogen-contaminated aquifer on Cape Cod, Massachusetts assessed the occurrence and turnover of NO within a contaminant plume in which nitrification and denitrification were known to occur. NO (up to 8.6 nM) was detected in restricted vertical zones located within a nitrate (NO 3-) gradient and characterized by low dissolved oxygen (&lt;10 μM). NO concentrations correlated best with nitrite (NO 2-) (up to 35 μM), but nitrous oxide (N2O) (up to 1 μM) also was present. Single-well injection tests were used to determine NO production and consumption in situ within these zones. First-order rate constants for NO consumption were similar (0.05-0.08 h-1) at high and low (260 and 10 nM) NO concentrations, suggesting a turnover time at in situ concentrations of 10-20 h. Tracer tests with 15N[NO] demonstrated that oxidation to 15N[NO2-] occurred only during the initial stages, but after 4 h reduction to 15N[N2O] was the primary reaction product Added NO 2- (31 μM) or NO3- (53 μM) resulted in a linear NO accumulation at 2.4 and 1.0 nM h-1 for the first 6 h of in situ tests.

In addition, aid priorities now reflect the reality that global problems (such as climate change and HIV/AIDS) need serious attention and that developing countries need grant finance to address these problems and other problems that stem from abject poverty. For the reasons described in this Article, these changes have made overseas development aid heavily dependent on grants channeled through the World Bank (referred to, throughout this article as ""World Bank grants""). This dependence poses challenges for an institution set up to provide loans, not grants, and accustomed to thinking of a grant as a form of gentleman's agreement rather than a binding commitment which may range from hundreds of dollars to millions and which, whatever the amount, reflects a host of interests and voices that clamor to be heard. These challenges set the context for this Article's inquiry. This Article begins by describing the changes that recent trends in overseas development aid have wrought and the reasons those changes have placed the World Bank at center stage of development grant finance. It then focuses on the legal framework governing World Bank grants. Its key inquiry is the extent to which that framework facilitates and effectuates the goals and values that development grant finance aims to achieve. This Article is not about whether grants for development aid achieve their targets (for example a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in a recipient country or in the number of AIDS-related deaths), an important question but one for another day. Rather, it is about whether such grants are negotiated, agreed to, and delivered in a way that promotes the inclusive, participatory, and collaborative approaches that recent trends in development aid hold paramount. As a starting premise, this Article concedes that the legal framework governing development grant finance is unclear (an inevitable state of affairs given the lack of clarity surrounding the legal status of a grant in the national jurisdictions of most developed countries, and, therefore, in an international legal system built on principles drawn from them). In the face of this lack of clarity the terms of the grant agreements, pursuant to which development grants are made, become the operative legal framework. And so, this Article looks to those terms to determine whether such grants comport with current thinking on optimal development approaches. But not all terms of an agreement are created equal. This Article posits that in the world of development grant finance, the key elements of a grant agreement to evaluate in order to determine whether the agreement reflects an inclusive, participatory, and collaborative approach are the elements that deal with the right of the grantor to cancel or suspend a grant and the provisions that apply when things go, or appear to have gone, wrong-namely the dispute resolution arrangements. The grantor is always in a position of power; dispute resolution arrangements set the parameters within which such power may be exercised. For this reason, this Article examines the dispute resolution arrangements in World Bank grant agreements. That examination reveals that World Bank grant agreements reflect a top-down, take it or leave it relationship that does not promote or facilitate inclusion, participation, and grantor/grantee collaboration. This Article concludes with some suggestions for the principles that should guide the redress of these deficiencies and the re-design of the dispute resolution arrangements that is required.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62449083553

GHG emissions from deforestation in the tropics were in the range of 1 to 2 Pg C yr-1 for the 1990s, which is equivalent to as much as 25% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions. While there is growing interest in providing incentives to avoid deforestation and consequently reduce net carbon emissions, there is limited information available on the potential costs of these activities. This paper uses a global forestry and land use model to analyze the potential marginal costs of reducing net carbon emissions by avoiding deforestation in tropical countries. Our estimates suggest that about 0.1 Pg C yr-1 of emissions reductions could be obtained over the next 30 to 50 yr for $5 per Mg C, and about 1.6 Pg C yr-1 could be obtained over the same time frame for $100 per Mg C. In addition, the effects of carbon incentives on land use could be substantial. Relative to projected baseline conditions, we find that there would be around 3 million additional hectares (ha) of forestland in 2055 at $5 per Mg C and 422 million ha at $100 per Mg C. Estimates of reductions in area deforested, GHG mitigation potential, and annual land rental payments required are presented, ail of which vary by region, carbon price paid, and time frame of mitigation.

It follows that each of us has a responsibility to look at how our own lives impact on the environment. This study aimed to investigate water use during surgical scrubbing. Two water delivery systems were assessed to see whether technological innovation can promote more 'environmentally friendly' scrubbing behaviour. At least 10 different individuals, comprising surgeons, assistants and scrub nurses, were observed at two sites. Twenty-five separate surgical scrubs were observed in each location and the length of time for which the tap was on recorded. The tap was on during surgical scrubbing for a mean of 2 min 23 s at Gartnavel General Hospital (maximum: 4 min 37 s; minimum: 49 s; SD: 55 s) and for a mean of 1 min 7 s at Stobhill Hospital (maximum: 2 min 25 s; minimum: 19 s; SD: 33 s). The mean 'tap on' time (in seconds) at Gartnavel was significantly greater than that at Stobhill [t(39.5) = P < 0.001]. A different tap design resulted in a net saving of 5.7 L of hot water, ∼600 kJ of energy and 80 g of carbon dioxide emitted per surgical scrub. Surgical scrubbing is a ubiquitous procedure performed daily in healthcare settings. A simple technological solution can reduce water and energy use by modifying hand-washing behaviour and thereby reduce the carbon footprint of surgical scrubbing. © 2008 The Hospital Infection Society.","Climate; Environment; Greenhouse effect; Hand washing; Water; Water supply","carbon dioxide; article; climate change; controlled study; energy conservation; environmental protection; general hospital; greenhouse gas; hand washing; human; nurse; surgeon; technology; time; United Kingdom; water supply; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Greenhouse Effect; Handwashing; Humans; Scotland; Temperature; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873207034

SAMM is a new concept of AORCM (Atmosphere-Ocean Regional Climate Model), where a global atmosphere model is locally coupled with a regional ocean circulation model. It consists of the global spectral AGCM ARPEGE-Climate model, whose variable resolution is maximum in the Mediterranean region (50 km), which has been coupled to the Mediterranean Sea limited area OGCM OPAMED (10 km). A 140-year numerical experiment starting in 1960 was run with the AORCM. Up to year 2000, forcing was prescribed from observed values, whereas forcing following a SRES-A2 scenario was applied beyond 2000. In order to ensure the model stability, a simple monthly heat flux correction on air-sea exchanges was applied. The present-climate validation proves that the AORCM is comparable to the state-of-the-art European Atmosphere Regional Climate Models (ARCM) at the same resolution. At first order, the climate change impact over Europe simulated by the AORCM is comparable with ARCM simulations. However the AORCM significantly amplifies the climate change signal over large parts of Europe with respect to the corresponding ARCM: the warming is higher in all seasons and in many areas of Europe (up to 25% of the signal), winters are wetter over northern Europe and summers drier over southern and eastern Europe (up to 50% of the signal). These differences are highly significant and the choice between coupled and non-coupled regional models could be an additional source of uncertainty when evaluating the climate change response over Europe. The factors responsible for these differences are discussed. Among them, the response of the Mediterranean SST, better simulated by the high resolution Mediterranean Sea model of the AORCM, seems to be preponderant. Further mechanism studies and model inter-comparisons are however required to legitimate the present results. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Differences in hourly ozone concentrations due to changes in anthropogenic emissions between the future case scenarios and a 2007 base case ranged from -14 to 22 ppb and were primarily associated with the implementation of federal mobile source standards; differences due to biogenic emissions and dry deposition due to urbanization ranged from only -1.4 to 0.7 ppb. These differences in the magnitude of emissions produced greater changes in air quality than differences in regional development patterns between the four scenarios.

The results imply that although the effects of urbanization patterns are non-negligible, the pattern of urban development is not as significant as reductions in emissions per capita. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Alternative fuels; Curing; Land use; Ozone; Regional planning; Anthropogenic emissions; Biogenic emissions; Development scenarios; Dry deposition; Mobile-source standards; Ozone concentrations; Per capita; Regional development; Spatial allocation; Urban developments; Air pollution; Urban growth; air quality; anthropogenic source; comparative study; emission; land use; ozone; regional development; urbanization; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; article; chemical analysis; dry deposition; United States; urbanization; Air; Motor Vehicles; Ozone; Texas; Time Factors; Transportation; Urbanization; Vehicle Emissions; Volatile Organic Compounds; Austin; North America; Texas; United States; Anthropogenic emissions; Biogenic emission; Development scenarios; Dry deposition; Mobile-source standards; Ozone concentration; Per capita; Regional development; Spatial allocation; Urban development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749086767

To test whether defoliation creates changes in soil that can feedback to plant growth, we collected soil from sub-arctic grassland plots that had been either defoliated or non-defoliated for three years and followed the growth of different plant species combinations in these soils in greenhouse conditions. Plant N acquisition and plant growth were lower in the soil collected from the defoliated field plots than in the soil collected from the non-defoliated plots. This response did not depend on the species composition or richness of the tested plant community. In the field, defoliation decreased net nitrogen mineralization. Despite the negative effect of decreased nutrient mineralization rate on plant growth and N accumulation in the greenhouse test, the aboveground abundance of most plant species was not affected by defoliation in the field. This indicates that plants in these sub-arctic grasslands can at least temporarily overcome defoliation-induced decrease in soil nutrient availability. To our knowledge, our results are the first direct evidence that defoliation can induce changes in the soil that negatively feedback to plant growth and N accumulation. This finding indicates that, especially in arctic and sub-arctic grasslands where nutrient mineralization rates are inherently low, soil feedbacks can have an important role in the outcome of herbivore-plant interactions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Plant exudation of labile C may facilitate microbial growth and enhance microbial immobilization of nitrogen (N). Here, we studied 15N label incorporation into microbes, plants and soil N pools after both long-term (12 years) climate manipulation and nutrient addition, plant clipping and a pulse-addition of labile C to the soil, in order to gain information on interactions among soil N and C pools, microorganisms and plants. There were few effects of long-term warming and fertilization on soil and plant pools. However, fertilization increased soil and plant N pools and increased pool dilution of the added 15N label. In all treatments, microbes immobilized a major part of the added 15N shortly after label addition. However, plants exerted control on the soil inorganic N concentrations and recovery of total dissolved 15N (TD15N), and likewise the microbes reduced these soil pools, but only when fed with labile C. Soil microbes in clipped plots were primarily C limited, and the findings of reduced N availability, both in the presence of plants and with the combined treatment of plant clipping and addition of sugar, suggest that the plant control of soil N pools was not solely due to plant uptake of soil N, but also partially caused by plants feeding labile C to the soil microbes, which enhanced their immobilization power. Hence, the cycling of N in subarctic heath tundra is strongly influenced by alternating release and immobilization by microorganisms, which on the other hand seems to be less affected by long-term warming than by addition or removal of sources of labile C. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Since phytoplankton assemblages were first described, phytoplankton ecologists concluded that these assemblages provide insight into phytoplankton responses to environmental changes. Objectives of this study were to investigate ecology of phytoplankton during a complete hydrological cycle in the deepest natural lake in Brazil, Dom Helvécio, and to sort species into the list of assemblages, checking its accordance with environmental changes in a tropical system within the middle Rio Doce Lake district, South-East Brazil. Canonical Correspondence Analysis, t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to analyze climatological, environmental, and plankton data, which were obtained monthly in 2002. A new phytoplankton assemblage, NA (atelomixis-dependent desmids), is suggested because atelomixis (robust movement of water occurring once a day) contributed to replacement of species in Dom Helvécio Lake. Stability of stratification, water chemistry, and composition of phytoplankton assemblages characterized two periods. The first period occurred in six rainy months (Jan-Mar and Oct-Dec) when the lake was stratified and phytoplankton was dominated by two assemblages: NA and F. The second period occurred in six dry months (Apr-Sep) when the lake was nonstratified and phytoplankton was dominated by four assemblages: S2, X1, A, and LO. Results suggest that phytoplankton in Dom Helvécio Lake was shaped by seasonal and daily changes of water temperature, even with its lower amplitude of variation within 2002 (El Niño year). These changes promoted water column stratification or mixing, reduced light, and increased nutrient availability. Temperature, therefore, is similarly important to phytoplankton ecology in tropical regions as it is in temperate ones. Sorting phytoplankton species into assemblages matched well with environmental changes and periods identified so it is also suggested that this can be further used as an appropriate tool to manage water quality when evaluating tropical lakes. © 2008 The Author(s).","Atelomixis; Desmids; NA assemblage; Phytoplankton assemblages; Tropical lake","Ecology; Lakes; Nutrients; Water quality; Atelomixis; Phytoplankton assemblages; Tropical lakes; Phytoplankton; canonical analysis; environmental change; hydrological cycle; lake water; light availability; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; phytoplankton; water quality; Brazil; Doce River; Dom Helvecio Lake; South America; Desmidiales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44249092743

This may be achieved through photochemical modeling, which is reliant on detailed, grid resolved emissions inventories. The US-EPA's approved Emissions Processing System (EPS) is used to develop a temporally and spatially resolved emissions inventory for the City of Cape Town for use in the Dynamic Air Pollution Prediction System (DAPPS). Included in this inventory are large and small point sources, mobile sources, and emissions from residential fuel burning and biogenic sources. Large point sources are usually well defined unlike the other source types that can have large uncertainties associated with them. In these circumstances, surrogate data are used to estimate emission rates. The FRamework for the Assessment of Uncertainties in Large-scale Emission INventories (FRAULEIN) approach to assessing uncertainty in the emissions inventory is adapted for DAPPS. A reasonable level of confidence exists for the characterization of large point sources but the two biggest source contributors namely vehicle and biogenic emissions, needs improvement. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these studies ignored the impacts of forests on atmospheric aerosol. We use a global atmospheric model to show that, through emission of organic vapours and the resulting condensational growth of newly formed particles, boreal forests double regional cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (from approx. 100 to approx. 200 cm−3). Using a simple radiative model, we estimate that the resulting change in cloud albedo causes a radiative forcing of between −1.8 and −6.7 W m−2 of forest. This forcing may be sufficiently large to result in boreal forests having an overall cooling impact on climate. We propose that the combination of climate forcings related to boreal forests may result in an important global homeostasis. In cold climatic conditions, the snow–vegetation albedo effect dominates and boreal forests warm the climate, whereas in warmer climates they may emit sufficiently large amounts of organic vapour modifying cloud albedo and acting to cool climate.© 2008 The Royal Society.","Aerosols; Boreal forests; Climate feedbacks; Climate mitigation; Cloud condensation nuclei; New particle formation","Aerosols; Air pollution; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospherics; Condensation; Cooling; Precipitation (meteorology); Solar radiation; Vegetation; Boreal forests; Climate feedbacks; Climate mitigation; Cloud condensation nuclei; New particle formation; Climatology; aerosol; carbon; aerosol; climate; climate change; taiga; tree; Aerosols; Carbon; Climate; Climate Change; Taiga; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849095098

Similarly, the mission of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership is to foster the safe and secure worldwide expansion of nuclear energy. GNEP comes at a crucial time in the burgeoning expansion of nuclear power. It is the only comprehensive proposal to close the nuclear fuel cycle in the United States, and engage the international community to minimize proliferation risks as well as provide and benefit from cooperation in policy formation, technical support, and technology and infrastructure development. Nuclear power's poised renaissance is encouraging, but it will require public support, expanded R&D activities and facilities, and increases in human capital needed for wide-scale construction and operation of new nuclear plants. Despite recent political currents, Germany can, too, become a part of this renaissance and become a full partner in the global partnership that shares a common vision for nuclear power's expansion.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49749120278

Although water used to irrigate the residential urban landscape will vary according to factors such as landscape type, management practices, and region, landscape irrigation can vary from 40% to 70% of household use of water. So, the efficient use of irrigation water in urban landscapes must be the primary focus of water conservation. In addition, plants in a typical residential landscape often are given more water than is required to maintain ecosystem services such as carbon regulation, climate control, and preservation of aesthetic appearance. This implies that improvements in the efficiency of landscape irrigation will yield significant water savings. Urban areas across the United States face different water supply and demand issues and a range of factors will affect how water is used in the urban landscape. The purpose of this review is to summarize how irrigation and water application technologies; landscape design and management strategies; the relationship among people, plants, and the urban landscape; the reuse of water resources; economic and noneconomic incentives; and policy and ordinances impact the efficient use of water in the urban landscape.","Conservation; Irrigation; Landscape preference; Ordinance; Reuse water; Xeriscape",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049144872

To produce a consistent and realistic assessment, we employ sources such as GHG National Inventories, NAPs and POLES world energy model to constitute the sectoral base year and 2010, 2020 emission levels in different countries and regions. We then use the market analysis tool ASPEN, which enables to derive supply and demand from sectoral MACCs produced with the POLES model, and to evaluate the economic impacts on the carbon market participants. The paper shows that, in compliance with the Kyoto targets, the benefits of an enlarged carbon market are significant, since more than 50% of the abatement in the short term have to be achieved in ETS sectors, which may indeed use CDM or JI credits. A second major conclusion is that in 2020 the new flexibility margins provided by the adjustment of investments in new capacities compensate for the increase in pressure towards stronger emission reductions.

We investigated how the reindeer-mediated aboveground changes affect soil microbial and microfaunal communities and enzymatic activities. We hypothesized that in areas with intensive summer browsing by reindeer, the carbon flow to belowground is reduced, but the carbon substances are more readily degradable. This is likely to influence both the abundance and the trophic structure of microbial and microfaunal communities. However, despite large differences in the vegetation, the reindeer ranges did not differ in the amount of microbial biomass or the abundance of nematodes. Furthermore, there was no difference in the microbial phospholipid fatty acid composition or in the trophic groups of soil nematodes. There were few effects on the organic fractions (non-polar extractives, water-soluble extractives, acid-soluble fraction, and acid-insoluble residue) of the soil organic matter. We suggest that the high stocks of organic matter in subarctic systems weaken the direct link between the aboveground and the belowground environments. Because soil carbon has a long turnover time in these systems, it takes at least several decades until the aboveground changes caused by large herbivores will influence the trophic structure in soils. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The complex timing and style of glaciations include asynchronous development of alpine glaciers in the western and eastern part of the area. While in the eastern part of NE Russia well-preserved moraines have been dated to the global Last Glacial Maximum (18-24ka), in the westernmost part of the area no glacial advance took place at this time. In general, glacial advances were more extensive earlier rather than later, in the last glacial cycle. Although only a handful of studies with reliable absolute ages in the vast area of NE Russia exist, it is clear that the number of advances throughout the region varies. Variable glacial response to global climate patterns is attributable to contrasting sources of precipitation. An Atlantic moisture source dominates in the western part of NE Russia, while a Pacific source influences the eastern part of the region. The glacial advances in the interior of NE Russia are largely unexplored and further research is needed in order to understand Quaternary climate change in the region.

Therefore advanced material and production methods have to be developed to meet this requirement. Since steel sheet metal parts cannot be substituted directly with lightweight aluminium parts, due to its minor formability, so called Tailored Heat Treated Blanks (THTB) are presented in this work. THTB are locally heat treated aluminium blanks from the 6000-series alloy, leading to a significantly improved formability for the manufacturing of complex aluminium car body parts. The enhancement of formability is reached by a local laser heat treatment before the forming operation. Since there is a strong influence of the heating on the forming process, a finite-element simulation of the process sequence is a prerequisite for the cost-effective usage of the THTB. The presented inverse approach considers first the desired forming result and enables the precise determination of heat treatment areas including the specific heat treatment temperatures.

Observations with space-borne X-ray telescopes revealed the existence of soft, diffuse X-ray emission from the inner regions of planetary nebulae. Although the existing images support the idea that this emission arises from the hot shocked central-star wind which fills the inner cavity of a planetary nebula, existing models have difficulties to explain the observations consistently. Aims: We investigate how the inclusion of thermal conduction changes the physical parameters of the hot shocked wind gas and the amount of X-ray emission predicted by time-dependent hydrodynamical models of planetary nebulae with central stars of normal, hydrogen-rich surface composition. Methods. We upgraded our 1D hydrodynamics code NEBEL by to account for energy transfer due to heat conduction, which is of importance at the interface separating the hot shocked wind gas (""hot bubble"") from the much cooler nebular material. With this new version of NEBEL we recomputed a selection of our already existing hydrodynamical sequences and obtained synthetic X-ray spectra for representative models along the evolutionary tracks by means of the freely available CHIANTI package. Results. Heat conduction leads to lower temperatures and higher densities within a bubble and brings the physical properties of the X-ray emitting domain into close agreement with the values derived from observations. The amount of X-rays emitted during the course of evolution depends on the energy dumped into the bubble by the fast stellar wind, on the efficiency of ""evaporating"" cool nebular gas via heat conduction, and on the bubble's expansion rate. We find from our models that the X-ray luminosity of a planetary nebula increases during its evolution across the HR diagram until stellar luminosity and wind power decline. Depending on the central-star mass and the evolutionary phase, our models predict X-ray [0.45-2.5 keV] luminosities between and of the stellar bolometric luminosities, in good agreement with the observations. Less than 1% of the wind power is radiated away in this X-ray band. Although temperature, density, and also the mass of the hot bubble is significantly altered by heat conduction, the dynamics of the whole system remains practically the same. Conclusions. Heat conduction allows the construction of nebular models which predict the correct amount of X-ray emission and at the same time are fully consistent with the observed mass-loss rate and wind speed.

This paper proposes a systematic, interdisciplinary framework for the integrated analysis of regulatory, legal, political, economic, and social factors that influence energy technology deployment decisions at the state level to enhance awareness of the interconnections and enable improved energy policy and planning and accelerated change in society's energy infrastructure. This framework, Socio-Political Evaluation of Energy Deployment, (SPEED), integrates analysis of laws, regulations, institutions and policy actors as well as varying regional perceptions and levels of awareness about the risks and benefits of emerging energy technologies to facilitate improved understanding of the complex interconnected components of state energy systems. While this framework has been developed with U.S. states as a model, the SPEED framework is generalizable to other countries with different sub-national structures. We present three research methods that could be applied within the SPEED framework that could be particularly helpful in understanding the integrated socio-political influences on energy technology deployment: (1) policy review and analysis, (2) media analysis, and (3) focus groups and structured interviews with key stakeholders. By integrating the fields of technology diffusion, environmental policy, comparative analysis of states, and risk perception, future empirical research conducted within this SPEED framework will improve understanding of the interconnected socio-political influences on energy technology deployment to enable energy modelers, policy-makers, energy professionals, state planners and other stakeholders to develop and implement more effective strategies to accelerate the deployment of emerging energy technologies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Measurements of the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2), particulate matter smaller than 10 μm (PM10), and ozone (O3) collected hourly over 22 years (1986-2007) at 39 urban monitoring locations were analyzed. Morning concentrations of CO, NOx, and PM10 are lower on Saturdays and even more so on Sundays, compared to workdays (Monday-Friday), while afternoon O3 concentrations change minimally and are occasionally even higher. This weekend effect is empirical evidence that photochemical O3 production is NOx-inhibited, and to the extent that emissions of CO are proportional to those of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), it is VOC-limited, at least in the urban areas for which the monitoring stations are representative. The VOC-limitation has increased in the past decade, due to decreases in the concentrations of CO (and presumably VOCs) and consequent decreases in the CO/NOx and VOC/NOx ratios. Enhancements of photolysis frequencies resulting from smaller weekend aerosol burdens are not negligible, but fall short of being an alternate explanation for the observed weekend effect. The strength of the weekend effect indicates that local radical termination occurs primarily via formation of nitric acid and other NOx-related compounds, some of which (e.g. peroxy acyl nitrates) can contribute to the regional NOx budget. While VOC emission reductions would be most effective in reducing local O3 production, NOx emission reduction may be more important for controlling regional oxidants.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; comparative study; concentration (composition); emission control; nitric acid; nitrogen oxides; oxidant; ozone; particle size; particulate matter; photochemistry; photolysis; pollution monitoring; temporal variation; urban area; volatile organic compound; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51549116472

The EDGE2D/NIMBUS code modelled the carbon migration in both experiments. This paper describes this modelling and identifies a number of important migration pathways: (1) deposition and erosion near the injection location, (2) migration through the main chamber SOL, (3) migration through the private flux region (PFR) aided by E × B drifts and (4) neutral migration originating near the strike points. In H-Mode, type I ELMs are calculated to influence the migration by enhancing erosion during the ELM peak and increasing the long-range migration immediately following the ELM. The erosion/re-deposition cycle along the outer target leads to a multistep migration of 13C towards the separatrix which is called 'walking'. This walking created carbon neutrals at the outer strike point and led to 13C deposition in the PFR. Although several migration pathways have been identified, quantitative analyses are hindered by experimental uncertainty in divertor leakage, and the lack of measurements at locations such as gaps and shadowed regions. © 2008 IAEA.",,"Colloids; Erosion; Location; Methane; Soil mechanics; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon migrations; Carbon neutrals; Deposition cycles; Experimental uncertainties; Injection locations; Migration pathways; Quantitative analyses; Range migrations; Separatrix; Shadowed regions; Experiments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149305382

The main EU directives which have impact on sustainable energy development are directives promoting energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources, directives implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and atmospheric pollution reduction policies and other policy documents and strategies targeting energy sector. Promotion of use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvements are among priorities of EU energy policy because the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvements has positive impact on energy security and climate change mitigation. The framework of indicators can be developed to establish the main targets set by EU energy and environmental policies allowing to connect indicators via chain of mutual impacts and to define policies and measures necessary to achieve established targets based on assessment of their impact on the targeted indicators representing sustainable energy development aims.

We reared grasshopper nymphs (Melanoplus femurrubrum) on Poa pratensis from field-grown monocultures or polycultures (16 species) that were subjected to either ambient or elevated levels of CO2 and N. Grasshopper growth rate was higher on P. pratensis leaves grown in monocultures than in polycultures, higher on P. pratensis grown under elevated than under ambient [CO2], and higher on P. pratensis grown under elevated than under ambient [N]. The higher growth rate observed on P. pratensis exposed to elevated [CO2] was, however, less pronounced for polyculture- than monoculture-grown P. pratensis. Growth rate of the grasshoppers was positively correlated with leaf [N], [C], and concentration of soluble carbohydrates + lipids. Concentration of non-structural carbohydrates + lipids was higher in leaves grown under elevated than under ambient [CO2], and the difference between P. pratensis grown under ambient and elevated [CO2] was greater for monoculture- than polyculture-grown P. pratensis. In addition, leaf N concentration was higher in P. pratensis grown in monocultures than in polycultures, suggesting that plant species richness, indirectly, may influence insect performance by changed nutritional value of the plants. Because we found interactive effects between all factors included ([CO2], [N], and plant species diversity), our results suggest that these parameters may influence plant-insect interactions in a complex way that is not predictable from the sum of single factor manipulations. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The work focused on understanding the impact of activated carbon amendment on PCB aqueous partitioning, PCB desorption characteristics, and PCB biouptake in a freshwater oligochaete (Lumbriculus variegatus). The results showed that PCB aqueous equilibrium concentrations, rapid desorption fractions, and biouptake by the oligochaete were reduced after activated carbon amendment. Addition of activated carbon at a dose of 0.5-fold native organic carbon reduced PCB bioaccumulation by 42% for Niagara River sediment, 85% for Grasse River sediment, 74% for Milwaukee River sediment 1, and 70% for Milwaukee River sediment 2. A linear relationship was observed between log biota-sediment accumulation factor and the first 6-h desorption fractions for each PCB homologue for treated and untreated sediments. Water-lipid bioconcentration factors for PCB congeners were largely conserved after amendment with activated carbon. Our present results suggest that at steady state, changes in the aqueous PCB concentrations can be used to predict changes in PCB bioaccumulation in deposit-feeding organisms. Thus, use of advanced pore-water measurement techniques, such as solid-phase extraction passive samplers, may be suitable for long-term monitoring of treatment performance. © 2008 SETAC.","Activated carbon; Bioconcentration factor; Desorption kinetics; Polychlorinated biphenyls","Activated carbon treatment; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Charcoal; Desorption; Environmental impact; Extraction; Fire hazards; Organic carbon; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuits; Rivers; Sedimentation; Sedimentology; Solvent extraction; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Areas of concerns; Bioconcentration factor; Bioconcentration factors; Desorption characteristics; Desorption kinetics; Equilibrium concentrations; Freshwater oligochaetes; Freshwater sediments; Geochemical characteristics; Great lakes; Linear relationships; Lumbriculus variegatus; Measurement techniques; Niagara rivers; North America; Passive samplers; PCB concentrations; PCB congeners; River sediments; Sediment accumulations; Solid-phase extractions; Steady states; Total organic carbons; Treatment performances; Activated carbon; activated carbon; fresh water; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; activated carbon; annelid; bioaccumulation; biological uptake; deposit feeding; desorption; extraction method; freshwater sediment; geochemistry; lipid; organic carbon; partitioning; PCB; porewater; reaction kinetics; animal experiment; animal tissue; annelid worm; article; bioaccumulation; controlled study; desorption; Lumbriculus variegatus; nonhuman; North America; priority journal; sediment; solid phase extraction; Animals; Carbon; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Oligochaeta; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Solubility; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Great Lakes [North America]; North America; Lumbriculus variegatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56049091258

This analysis can be complicated by seemingly incongruent data from different model runs, model types, and field measurements. Here we present a case study example that describes how to identify trends in regional scale mercury deposition using best-available information from multiple data sources. To do this, we use data from three atmospheric chemistry models (CMAQ, GEOS-Chem, HYSPLIT) and multiple sediment archives (ombrotrophic bog, headwater lake, coastal salt marsh) from the Bay of Fundy region in Canada. Combined sediment and modeling data indicate that deposition attributable to US and Canadian emissions has declined in recent years, thereby increasing the relative significance of global sources.

But it is not entirely clear hat the leading emitters - the United States and China - would be better off with the agreement that would be in he world's interest. The first problem is that as the largest emitters, the United States and China would probably have to bear a disproportionate cost of any significant emissions reduction effort. The second problem is that on prominent projections, the United States and China are unlikely to be the most serious losers from climate change. According to some analyses, the two nations are thus anticipated to bear disproportionately high costs from emissions controls and to gain disproportionately little from such controls. There are two ways to eliminate the resulting obstacle to an international agreement. The first is through altering the perceived cost-benefit analysis for both countries. The second is through an understanding that both nations, and the United States in particular, are under a moral obligation not to inflict serious harm on the highly vulnerable citizens of Africa, India, and elsewhere.

Three release strategies (caged, free-release and stem release) were assessed as a part of a redistribution process that involved engagement with community members, with an overall establishment rate of 97%. Long-term monitoring of seven sites between 1998 and 2004 showed that L. cardui densities fluctuated by up to 30-fold among sites and 12-fold among seasons, driven largely by climatic effects on host plant size and with no measurable effect of plant density. During 2002 a comparison was made of plant performance at seven release sites with L. cardui present and six matched control sites without L. cardui. Plant size and L. cardui density varied between release sites and, on average, L. cardui reduced plant height by 33% and seed production by 65%. A second agent, the seed weevil Larinus latus, directly destroyed 56% of the seed produced at the sites, leading to a mean overall reduction of 84% in seed added to the soil during 2002 (ranging from 37% to 99% across sites). The significant reductions in seed rain that are being accrued by these two agents augur well for the long-term success of this project.

Air quality modeling was conducted using CMAQ and meteorology downscaled from the GISS-GCM using MM5. Emissions for North America are found using US EPA, Mexican and Canadian inventories and projected emissions following CAIR and IPCC A1B emissions scenario. Higher temperatures for all sub-regions and regional changes in mixing height, insolation and precipitation are forecast in the 2049-2051 period. Future emissions are calculated to be lower over both Canadian sub-regions, but higher over northern Mexico. Global climate change, alone, is predicted to affect PM2.5 concentrations more than O3 for the projections used in this study: average daily maximum eight (8) hour O3 (M8hO3) concentrations are estimated to be slightly different in all examined sub-regions while average PM2.5 concentrations are estimated to be higher over both Canadian sub-regions (8% over western and 3% over eastern) but 11% lower over northern Mexico. More days are forecast where M8hO3 concentrations are over 75 ppb in all examined sub-regions but the number of days where PM2.5 concentration will be over 15 μg/m3 is projected higher only over western Canada. Climate change combined with the projected emissions lead to greater change in pollutant concentrations: average M8hO3 concentrations are simulated to be 6% lower over western Canada and 8% lower over eastern Canada while average PM2.5 concentrations are simulated to be 5% lower over western Canada and 11% lower over eastern Canada. Although future emissions over northern Mexico are projected higher, pollutant concentrations are simulated to be lower due to US emissions reductions. Global climate change combined with the projected emissions will decrease average M8hO3 4% and PM2.5 17% over northern Mexico. Significant reductions in the number of days where M8hO3 concentrations are over 75 ppb and PM2.5 concentration over 15 μg/m3 are also projected with a significant reduction in peak values.",,"air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; climate change; climate effect; comparative study; concentration (composition); emission inventory; estimation method; global climate; Canada; Mexico [North America]; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48049109417

The minimum extinguishing concentration of CO2 under low oxidizer velocities (&lt;20 cm/s) was measured in microgravity achieved by parabolic flights of the NASA Reduced Gravity Aircraft. Transient computations with full chemistry and a gray-gas radiation model were performed to reveal the detailed flame structure and extinguishment processes. To compensate for the overestimation of radiative heat losses at high concentrations of radiating CO2, the Planck mean absorption coefficient was multiplied by a correction factor (0 ≤ C ≤ 1). The fuel-lean peak reactivity spot (the so-called reaction kernel) at the flame base stabilized the trailing diffusion flame. The calculated temperature along the trailing flame decreased downstream due to radiative cooling, leading to local extinction at &lt;1300 K and flame tip opening. As CO2 was added to the oxidizer: (1) the calculated maximum flame temperature decreased toward a threshold (≈1600 K); (2) the reaction kernel weakened (i.e., lower heat release rate) but nonetheless remained at a nearly constant temperature (≈1450 K); (3) the flame base stabilized increasingly higher above the burner rim, parallel to the axis; until finally, (4) blowoff-type extinguishment occurred. In the lifted flame, the broadened reaction kernel supported a super-lean reaction branch on the oxidizer side as well as the trailing diffusion flame on the fuel-rich side (no triple flame structure was formed). © 2008 The Combustion Institute.","Carbon dioxide; Diffusion flame stabilization; Microgravity; Reaction kernel; Spacecraft fire suppression","Carbon dioxide; Methane; Microgravity processing; Nonmetals; Oxygen; Cup burners; Diffusion flame stabilization; Methane diffusion; Microgravity; Microgravity environments; Microgravity experiments; Oxygen-enriched; Reaction kernel; Spacecraft fire suppression; Semiconductor doping; carbon dioxide; methane; oxygen; absorption; acceleration; aircraft; airflow; article; calculation; chemical reaction; combustion; concentration (parameters); cooling; diffusion; heat exchange; mathematical model; microgravity; oscillation; physical chemistry; priority journal; structure analysis; temperature dependence; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53049084174

In case of the monomeric ZnP(edta) cofactor coordinated by one pyridine molecule, ZnP(py)(edta), a spontaneous 1:1 complex with a transient metal ion was formed in an aqueous solvent, and the photoexcited singlet state of ZnP, 1(ZnP)*, was quenched by the [CuII(edta)] moiety through intramolecular photoinduced electron-transfer (ET) reaction. The rate constant for the intramolecular quenching ET (kq) at 25 °C was successfully obtained as kq = 5.1 × 109 s -1. In the case of Co2+, Ni2+, and Mn 2+, intersystem crossing by paramagnetic effect was mainly considered between 1(ZnP)* and the [MII(edta)] complex. For the ZnMb-[MII(edta)] systems, the intramolecular ET reaction between the excited singlet state of 1(ZnMb)* and the [Cu II(edta)] moieties provided the slower quenching rate constant, kq = 2.1 × 108 s-1, compared with that of the ZnP(py)(edta) one. Kinetic studies also presented the efficient fluorescence quenching of the 1(ZnMb)*-[CoII(edta)] dyad.

Accordingly the average growing-season C budget ranged from -0.2 to 0.3 Mg C ha-1 and showed a negative correlation with air temperature during the crop-growing season. The 5-year C budget for different crop rotation systems ranged from -1.0 (3-year cropped cereal with 2-year bare fallow) to 0.4 (5-year continuous cereal cropped) Mg C ha-1.

A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to assess the economic profitability and risks associated with the systems considering them as 25-year projects and their potential for participation in C credit market. The traditional systems had high C stock in their biomass and soil, but little potential for sequestering additional C; on the other hand, the improved systems had low C stock, but high sequestration potential. For the standard size live fence (291 m) and fodder bank (0.25 ha) projects, the estimated net present values (NPV) were $ 96.0 and $158.8 without C credit sale, and $109.9 and $179.3 with C sale, respectively. From the C sale perspective, live fence seemed less risky and more profitable than fodder bank. Carbon credit sale is likely to contribute to economic development of the subsistence farmers in the WAS. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Clean development mechanism (CDM); Cost-benefit analysis; Fodder bank; Live fence; Risk analysis","agroforestry; biomass; carbon sequestration; clean development mechanism; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; economic development; fodder; Kyoto Protocol; profitability; risk assessment; socioeconomic conditions; Africa; Mali; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749146854

Some of these uncertainties arise from parametric data variability in life cycle inventory analysis. For instance, the efficiencies of manufacturing processes may vary among different industrial sites or geographic regions; or, in the case of new and unproven technologies, it is possible that prospective performance levels can only be estimated. Although such data variability is usually treated using a probabilistic framework, some recent work on the use of fuzzy sets or possibility theory has appeared in the literature. The latter school of thought is based on the notion that not all data variability can be properly described in terms of frequency of occurrence. In many cases, it is necessary to model the uncertainty associated with the subjective degree of plausibility of parameter values. Fuzzy set theory is appropriate for such uncertainties. However, the computations required for handling fuzzy quantities has not been fully integrated with the formal matrix-based life cycle inventory analysis (LCI) described by Heijungs and Suh (2002). Materials and methods: This paper integrates computations with fuzzy numbers into the matrix-based LCI computational model described in the literature. The approach uses fuzzy numbers to propagate the data variability in LCI calculations, and results in fuzzy distributions of the inventory results. The approach is developed based on similarities with the fuzzy economic input-output (EIO) model proposed by Buckley (Eur J Oper Res 39:54-60, 1989). Results: The matrix-based fuzzy LCI model is illustrated using three simple case studies. The first case shows how fuzzy inventory results arise in simple systems with variability in industrial efficiency and emissions data. The second case study illustrates how the model applies for life cycle systems with co-products, and thus requires the inclusion of displaced processes. The third case study demonstrates the use of the method in the context of comparing different carbon sequestration technologies. Discussion: These simple case studies illustrate the important features of the model, including possible computational issues that can arise with larger and more complex life cycle systems. Conclusions: A fuzzy matrix-based LCI model has been proposed. The model extends the conventional matrix-based LCI model to allow for computations with parametric data variability represented as fuzzy numbers. This approach is an alternative or complementary approach to interval analysis, probabilistic or Monte Carlo techniques. Recommendations and perspectives: Potential further work in this area includes extension of the fuzzy model to EIO-LCA models and to life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); development of hybrid fuzzy-probabilistic approaches; and integration with life cycle-based optimization or decision analysis. Additional theoretical work is needed for modeling correlations of the variability of parameters using interacting or correlated fuzzy numbers, which remains an unresolved computational issue. Furthermore, integration of the fuzzy model into LCA software can also be investigated. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Data variability; Fuzzy numbers; Life cycle inventory analysis; Matrix calculations; Uncertainty","article; carbon sequestration; comparative study; computer program; fuzzy system; life cycle assessment; mathematical computing; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; theoretical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249094284

The current densities were calculated using the Gauge-Including Magnetically Induced Current (GIMIC) method employing gauge-including atomic orbitals. The GIMIC calculations yield rules to estimate the global and local ring-current strengths as well as the current pathways for the hydrocarbon nanorings. For the overall antiaromatic molecules, aromatic groups such as benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene moieties localize the ring current making the global ring currents vanish. The ability of the edge groups to localize the currents is related to the aromatic character of the molecule as a whole. The local ring current prefers to follow the edges of the group. Phenalenyl corner moieties are found to introduce strong global ring currents, whereas with fused benzene and pyrene corner groups the global ring current vanishes. Fused benzene rings in the corner or along the edge of overall antiaromatic molecules sustain local ring currents of about the same size as for a free benzene molecule. For the overall aromatic molecules, the global ring current is split along the bonds of the edge moieties, but the detailed division fulfilling Kirchhoff s current law is not easily predictable and must be calculated for each individual bond. At the phenalenyl corner moieties, the global ring current follows the innermost route isolating the rest of the group from the main delocalization pathway. A hydrocarbon nanoring sustaining strong ring currents should be large and formally aromatic with many and large aromatic moieties along the edges. A clear correlation between the strength of the global ring currents and the size of the electric polarizabilities is obtained. The calculated 1H NMR shieldings of a proton in immediate contact to the global ring current vary between 22 ppm and 67 ppm in the studied molecules. The trend correlates well with the global ring-current strengths, which are in the range of 0-88 nA/T. The 13C NMR shieldings are also sensitive to the strength of the global ring current, but they vary less systematically and are not as good an indicator of the current strength as the hydrogen shieldings. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Benzene; Density functional theory; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Gages; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Magnetic shielding; Molecules; Nanorings; Nanostructured materials; Naphthalene; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Organic compounds; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Quantum chemistry; Shielding; Antiaromatic molecules; Aromatic groups; Aromatic moieties; Aromatic molecules; Atomic orbitals; Benzene molecules; Benzene rings; Current laws; Current strengths; Delocalization pathways; Electric polarizabilities; Functional theories; Kirchhoff; Magnetically induced currents; Nanoring; Nuclear magnetic shieldings; Phenalenyl; Planar rings; Ring currents; Aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149168724

There is only a weak empirical base for policy-makers to stand on regarding the comparative innovation effects of various climate policy options, however. Empirical scholarship in environmental innovation is hindered by the complexity of both the innovation process and the interactions between the dual market failures of pollution and innovation that are in play, and it appears that the field would benefit from the structure provided by a common lexicon. This paper focuses on the issues related to policy categorization in this field; these issues have received little attention in the literature despite their importance to making insights gained from empirical studies generalizable. The paper reviews the origins, strengths, and weaknesses of the dominant policy typology of technology-push versus demand-pull instruments. Its primary contribution, however, is to assemble a comprehensive chronology of solar policy in California and its impacts on innovation, where known, and then use this as a basis for building a new policy categorization that takes advantage of the intuitive resonance of the dominant typology, while encompassing the broader range of policy instruments that are employed in practice in order to stimulate environmental innovation. The most noteworthy aspect of the new categorization is that it introduces a third category of environmental innovation policy instrument that focuses on improving the interface between technology suppliers and users. This reflects developments in the economics of innovation literature as well as considerable evidence in the domain of distributed solar energy technologies that opportunism by some of the actors that work at this interface can be a barrier to innovation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

For herbivores in particular, climate can have strong direct and indirect effects on demography, which tend to exacerbate in arid and semiarid environments with highly seasonal weather. We studied the joint effect of forage conditions, plant phenology, and climate on the reproductive performance of a ""model"" population: domestic sheep in the Patagonian steppe of Argentina. In this region sheep behave as semi-natural populations and relatively good population records are available. Using linear models and artificial neural networks trained by second order back-propagation methods, we demonstrated that reproductive performance, characterized by the marking rate (number of lambs per ewe), was associated to the timing of growing season start and to the primary production (as estimated from remotely sensed data) at mating. An ANN model including these variables explained 73% of the variability of normalized marking rate, and predicted observed marking rates with an accuracy of 63%. Our results highlight the importance of forage availability as opposed to weather regulating the reproductive performance of sheep at Patagonia, suggesting that bottom-up controls are of dominant importance for these populations. Using artificial neural networks, satellite imagery, and historical productive and climatic records, we disentangled the controls of sheep reproductive performance in a region characterized by weak but consistent relationships between environment and sheep dynamics. Our work aims to the development of quantitative tools for the management and planning of sheep herd structure from ranches to regions, especially for those situations in which classical methods (i.e. linear methods) fail. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Altered nutrient availability is a major consequence of global change, directly due to anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition, and indirectly due to shifts in temperature and water availability. In the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment, microarrays were used to investigate the transcriptional responses of the dominant dicot, Geranium dissectum, to simulated N deposition. The transcript levels for several photosynthetic genes were elevated in plants exposed to elevated N, as has been reported previously, validating the use of microarrays under field conditions. A coordinated response of a suite of genes previously reported to be induced in response to phosphate (Pi) deficiency was observed, including genes for the glycolytic bypass pathway, which reduces ATP and Pi requirements for sugar degradation, suggesting that the plants were phosphorus (P) limited. Confirming this conclusion, foliar P levels in G. dissectum leaves were reduced to levels that are suboptimal for growth in plants grown in elevated N and elevated CO2 plots. Thus, although plants commonly produce more biomass in response to elevated N in native grasslands, this growth response may be suboptimal due to a P limitation. Foliar P levels in plants from elevated CO2 plots were also suboptimal for growth. However, genes indicative of Pi deficiency were not significantly expressed at higher levels. Transcript levels for genes involved in nitrate uptake and assimilation were unchanged by the elevated N deposition treatment, possibly due to the combined impacts of elevated N deposition and P limitation under field conditions. These observations highlight the complexity of the impact of global climate change factors in the field. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Cross-species hybridization; FACE; Gene expression; Geranium; Global change; Glycolytic bypass; Grassland; Microarray; Nitrogen deposition; Phosphorus limitation","climate effect; deposition; ecological impact; field method; gene expression; genomics; global change; grassland; growth response; hybridization; nitrogen; nutrient availability; phosphorus cycle; photosynthesis; plant; California; Jasper Ridge; North America; United States; Dicotyledoneae; Geranium dissectum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949120711

Although they are wide-ranging, polar bears do not belong to a single population but rather are comprised of 19 largely discrete subpopulations, 13 of which are fully or partly under Canadian jurisdiction. These subpopulations are used to manage the sustainable harvest of polar bears in Canada but for conservation purposes the species is currently considered a single biological unit. Long-term climate warming has reduced the availability of sea ice that polar bears require for feeding, movement and reproduction, and continued declines in ice extent and duration are forecast to have significant negative effects on polar bears in some areas. Under the Canadian Species at Risk Act separate legal protection may be given to intraspecific groups (so called designatable units, DUs) that are genetically, geographically and/or biogeographically distinct. We examined the conservation status of polar bears across their Canadian range and compared large-scale ecosystem properties across subpopulations. We found that threats to the conservation of polar bears are not spatially uniform and we identified five DUs that captured broad patterns of polar bear biodiversity. We conclude that the use of DUs provides a biologically-sound framework for the conservation of polar bears. © 2008 Fauna & Flora International.","Arctic; Climate change; COSEWIC; Management; Polar bear; Sea ice; Species At Risk Act; Ursus maritimus","bear; biodiversity; climate change; comparative study; conservation genetics; conservation management; conservation status; ecological impact; Endangered Species Act; feeding behavior; geographical distribution; ice community; long-term change; movement; population decline; reproductive behavior; sea ice; spatial analysis; Canada; North America; Ursus maritimus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53949099387

A recent addition to such knowledge is that the carbon/nitrogen ratio of inorganic consumption and release of dissolved organic matter may increase in a high-CO2 world. This will, however, yield a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 only if the extra organic material escapes mineralization within the photic zone. Here we show, in the context of an Arctic pelagic ecosystem, how the fate and effects of added degradable organic carbon depend critically on the state of the microbial food web. When bacterial growth rate was limited by mineral nutrients, extra organic carbon accumulated in the system. When bacteria were limited by organic carbon, however, addition of labile dissolved organic carbon reduced phytoplankton biomass and activity and also the rate at which total organic carbon accumulated, explained as the result of stimulated bacterial competition for mineral nutrients. This counterintuitive 'more organic carbon gives less organic carbon' effect was particularly pronounced in diatom-dominated systems where the carbon/mineral nutrient ratio in phytoplankton production was high. Our results highlight how descriptions of present and future states of the oceanic carbon cycle require detailed understanding of the stoichiometric coupling between carbon and growth-limiting mineral nutrients in both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. ©2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Many cyanobacteria also produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which bind soil particles together and decrease erodibility. The physical integrity and metabolic activity of soil crusts is thus critical to ecological productivity, erodibility and CO2 fluxes in dryland regions. There are, however, few studies of the magnitude and controlling factors of soil CO2 flux within these systems. Our aim was to quantify in situ soil CO2 flux during contrasting antecedent moisture conditions in the south west Kalahari of Botswana. We have designed a gas exchange chamber for field deployment coupled to a portable gas chromatograph, control and data logging instrumentation. The optical and active thermal control specifications of the chamber have been designed to permit photosynthesis and cope with the temperature extremes of the Kalahari whilst minimizing disturbance to the cyanobacteria soil crust. This approach has enabled CO2 fluxes to be monitored in situ with a high degree of precision for extended periods. In August 2005, when the surface and subsoils were dry, the ambient CO2 efflux was negative and low during the daytime (-6.15 mg C m2 h-1). When 8 mm rainfall equivalent of water was added to the surface there was an immediate uptake of CO2 during the daytime at rates up to 75 mg C m2 h-1 demonstrating that rates of net photosynthesis are greatly enhanced by available moisture. In contrast, in May 2006 following a prolonged wet period when the subsoil was moist, there was a net positive efflux of CO2 from the soil at rates of up to 60 mg C m2 h-1 irrespective of whether the surface soil was moist or not. This is consistent with subsoil heterotrophic bacterial respiration becoming an important contributor to soil efflux. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These proteins regulate inactivation and membrane localization of Kv1 and Kv4 channels. The Kvβ proteins bind to pyridine nucleotides with high affinity; however, their catalytic properties remain unclear. Here we report that recombinant rat Kvβ2 catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of aldehydes and ketones. The rate of catalysis was slower (0.06-0.2 min-1) than those of most other AKRs but displayed the expected hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration, with no evidence of allosteric cooperativity. Catalysis was prevented by site-directed substitution of Tyr-90 with phenylalanine, indicating that the acid-base catalytic residue, identified in other AKRs, has a conserved function in Kvβ2. The protein catalyzed the reduction of a broad range of carbonyls, including aromatic carbonyls, electrophilic aldehydes and prostaglandins, phospholipids, and sugar aldehydes. Little or no activity was detected with carbonyl steroids. Initial velocity profiles were consistent with an ordered bi-bi rapid equilibrium mechanism in which NADPH binding precedes carbonyl binding. Significant primary kinetic isotope effects (2.0-3.1) were observed under single- and multiple-turnover conditions, indicating that the bond-breaking chemical step is rate-limiting. Structure-activity relationships with a series of para-substituted benzaldehydes indicated that the electronic interactions predominate during substrate binding and that no significant charge develops during the transition state. These data strengthen the view that Kvβ proteins are catalytically active AKRs that impart redox sensitivity to Kv channels. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Aldehydes; Enzyme activity; Ketones; Nucleic acids; Nucleotides; Organic compounds; Potassium; Quantum chemistry; Aldo-keto reductase; Catalytic mechanisms; Catalytic properties; High affinity; Membrane localization; Potassium channels; Pyridine nucleotides; Substrate specificity; Proteins; aldehyde; aldehyde derivative; aromatic carbonyl; benzaldehyde; carbonyl derivative; carbonyl steroid; electrophilic aldehyde; ketone; phenylalanine; phospholipid; prostaglandin; pyridine nucleotide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Shaker potassium channel; Shal potassium channel; sugar aldehyde; unclassified drug; voltage gated potassium channel; acid base balance; article; beta chain; catalysis; chemical structure; enzyme specificity; nucleotide sequence; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; protein binding; site directed mutagenesis; structure activity relation; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Aldehydes; Animals; Binding Sites; Catalysis; Deuterium; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ketones; Kinetics; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; NADP; Phospholipids; Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated; Prostaglandins; Protein Subunits; Rats; Recombinant Proteins; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Substrate Specificity; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50149118166

The population composition and diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria carrying dsrAB genes from surface Puget Sound sediments was investigated using a polymerase chain reaction-based cloning approach. Sediment cores were collected from three different locations: Carr Inlet (C1A), Shallow Bud Inlet (S1A), and Turning Basin (T1A). A total of 498 dsrAB clones were sequenced from the three sites. Ecological indices indicated that T1A had the highest diversity and evenness values and C1A had the lowest. Correlations were also found between diversity indices and geochemical parameters. The diversity of the SRB decreased with decreasing carbon concentrations and sulfate reduction rates, and increasing levels of oxygen. A phylogenetic comparison revealed that the majority of the dsrAB sequences were associated with the delta-proteobacterial phylotypes Desulfonema, Desulfococcus and Desulfosarcina, suggesting that complete oxidizers with high substrate versatility dominate in the sediments. The environmental conditions and energy sources available in the sediments may have dictated microbial community structure and diversity of SRBs. Distinctive community structures of SRBs in Puget Sound sediments were found to vary at different sites with different redox profiles. The dominance of the Desulfobacteraceae-like sequences may be due to the presence of a diverse spectrum of substrates in the sediments. This study represents one of the first efforts to characterize the population of sulfate-reducing microbes in the oxygenated regions of Puget Sound sediments. The phylogenetic identification of dsrAB genes in the sediment samples allows the composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotic communities to be inferred, and working hypotheses about their likely carbon substrates to be formed. © Taylor & Francis, 2008.","Carbon bioavailability; Dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes; Microbial community; Microbial diversity","Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Clone cells; Cloning; Genes; Polymerase chain reaction; Substrates; Sulfur compounds; Biogeochemical property; Environmental conditions; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Microbial diversity; Phylogenetic comparisons; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Sulfite reductase; Sediments; carbon; oxygen; sulfate; Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Cloning; Genes; Sediments; community structure; dominance; environmental conditions; gene; microbial community; polymerase chain reaction; population structure; sediment core; species diversity; sulfate-reducing bacterium; article; bacterial gene; biogeochemistry; Desulfococcus; Desulfonema; Desulfosarcina; dsrab gene; genetic variability; microbial community; microbial diversity; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; population structure; reduction; sea; sediment; sulfate reducing bacterium; unindexed sequence; North America; Puget Sound; United States; Washington [United States]; Desulfobacteraceae; Desulfococcus; Desulfonema; Desulfosarcina; Prokaryota; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649103694

Sea-level rise is one consequence of particular concern to Pacific Island states. It also reviews the views of economists about connections between economic growth and global warming. Design/methodology/approach – International efforts, such as through the Kyoto protocol, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their atmospheric concentration are discussed and prospects for post-Kyoto policies are considered. Ways are also examined of addressing the consequences of global warming for the Pacific Island states. How they will be affected and to what extent is discussed, together with their ability to cope with the emerging problem. Findings – The paper finds that whereas the majority of economists did not foresee a conflict between economic growth and global warming, the possibility of such a conflict is now more widely recognized following the Stern Report. It is predicted that a significant reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions is unlikely to be achieved in the foreseeable future owing to conflicting national interest (a prisoners' dilemma problem) and because is will take time to develop new technologies which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, payment for greenhouse gas emissions (for example, via tradable permits) will accelerate desirable technological advance. Both international political action and efforts to develop and use technologies that lower greenhouse gas emissions need to be pursued. Given current and likely increases in greenhouse gas emissions, continuing global warming in this century (and beyond) appears to be inevitable and consequently Pacific Island states will be adversely affected by sea-level rise and climate change. Originality/value – The paper emphasizes that Pacific Island states will suffer great hardship from global warming but are ill-placed geographically, financially and administratively to prevent or adjust to the possible environmental disasters that await them.

In the UK, peatland drain blockage has been encouraged in recent years as a management practice to preserve peatland habitats and to reduce fluvial carbon loss and municipal water discoloration. Drain blockage has, however, been found to increase drain-water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and coloration in the short term. In order to investigate the contribution of changes in extracellular phenol oxidase activity to the increase in water coloration following peatland drain blockage, cores collected from a riparian peatland in North Wales were incubated under impeded drainage conditions. Impeded drainage resulted in the stimulation of peat extracellular phenol oxidase activity and heightened soluble phenolic concentrations, suggesting that changes in extracellular phenol oxidase activity may be a key driver of increases in DOC and water coloration following peatland drain blockage. An increase in peat pH with impeded drainage was also observed that may have contributed to the heightened soluble phenolic concentrations - directly (through effects on solubility) and/or indirectly as a driver of the elevated extracellular phenol oxidase activity. © 2008 The Authors.","Decomposition; DOC; Drainage; Peatland; Phenol oxidase; Soil enzymes","decomposition; dissolved organic carbon; drainage; enzyme activity; peatland; pH; phenol; phenolic compound; riparian zone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56649115985

Using dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion: Chamaeleonidae) as a model system, we explored the relationship between palaeoclimatic fluctuations and cladogenesis with respect to both temporal and spatial patterns in an effort to understand the process of speciation in southern Africa. Location: South Africa, with particular emphasis on the Cape Floristic Region and the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot. Methods: Mitochondrial sequence data (ND2 and 16S) were used to estimate the timing of major radiations and to examine the number of lineages through time. A dated phylogeny was constructed using Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction, and a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock was used to estimate divergence times. Spatial data and lineage-through-time plots were used to identify geographic regions that underwent diversification in connection with major climatic events. Both parsimony and likelihood optimizations of habitat type on the phylogeny were used to determine whether major habitat shifts have occurred. On a coarse scale (half-degree grid cells), phylogenetic diversity (sum of the branch lengths linking terminals) was compared with species richness (absolute number of species) to identify areas of conservation importance. Results: The complete species phylogeny of dwarf chameleons shows that the timing and mode of diversification exhibit spatio-temporal patterns that link to phases in the evolution of southern Africa's climate over the last 14 Myr. Optimizations of habitat on the phylogenetic tree show a progression from closed to open habitats since the Mid-Miocene, corresponding to the shift from C3 to C 4 environments, and later with the development of south-western Africa's winter-rainfall regime. These shifts are not simultaneous across the region, with different geographic centres of diversity generated during different time periods. Main conclusions: Regions that are prominent centres of chameleon diversification are encompassed by the current biodiversity hotspots as shown by chameleon species richness and phylogenetic diversity. Diversity within the Cape Floristic Region appears to be the result of a Late Pliocene radiation, whereas the diversity encompassed within the Maputaland-Pondoland- Albany hotspot is an aggregate of asynchronous radiation events, probably influenced by lineage losses. Overall, dwarf chameleons have experienced a shift in habitat types, with recent radiations occupying open habitats, and older lineages persisting in relictual forested habitats, corresponding to the continental shift of vegetation types since the Miocene Climatic Optimum. © 2008 The Authors.","Global cooling; Hotspots; Lizards; Miocene; Palaeoclimate; Pliocene; Reptiles; Southern Africa; Species radiation","Bayesian analysis; biodiversity; climate change; comparative study; cooling; divergence; ecological modeling; lizard; Miocene; optimization; paleoclimate; phylogeny; Pliocene; reconstruction; spatial analysis; speciation (biology); species diversity; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Bradypodion; Chamaeleonidae; Reptilia; Squamata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47949089112

We analyze the effect of interstate transport on surface O3 in each continental U.S. state in July 1996 using the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model. By examining the difference between a baseline simulation and perturbation simulations in which each state's nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are removed, we establish for the first time a summertime source-receptor matrix for all 48 continental states. We find that for 16 (20) states at least one neighboring state's NOx emissions are responsible for a larger increase in monthly mean peak 8 h (all-hour) O3 concentrations than the state's own emissions. For over 80% of the contiguous states, interstate transport is more important than local emissions for summertime peak O3 concentrations.

We modelled the impact of the CCS on levels of traffic pollutants, life expectancy and socioeconomic inequalities. Methods: Annual average NO2 and PM 10 were modelled using an emission-dispersion model. We assumed the meteorology and vehicle fleet remained constant during the pre- and post-CCS periods to isolate changes due to traffic flow. Air pollution concentrations were linked to small area socioeconomic, population and mortality data. Associated changes in life expectancy were predicted using life table analysis and exposure-response coefficients from the literature. Results: Before the introduction of the CCS, annual average NO2 was 39.9 μg/m 3 and PM10 was 26.2 μg/m3 across Greater London. Concentrations were 54.7 μg/m3 for NO2 and 30.3 μg/m3 for PM10 among census wards within or adjacent to the charging zone. Absolute and relative reductions in concentrations following the introduction of the CCS were greater among charging zone wards compared to remaining wards. Predicted benefits in the charging zone wards were 183 years of life per 100 000 population compared to 18 years among the remaining wards. In London overall, 1888 years of life were gained. More deprived areas had higher air pollution concentrations; these areas also experienced greater air pollution reductions and mortality benefits compared to the least deprived areas. Conclusions: The CCS, a localised scheme targeting traffic congestion, appears to have modest benefit on air pollution levels and associated life expectancy. Greater reductions in air pollution in more deprived areas are likely to make a small contribution to reducing socioeconomic inequalities in air pollution impacts.",,"nitric oxide; air pollution; article; exhaust gas; life expectancy; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomics; United Kingdom; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Automobiles; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Humans; Life Expectancy; London; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Health; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649085524

Identifying the fate of N from atmospheric deposition is important for understanding the N cycle of forest ecosystems. We studied soils of two Abies pinsapo fir forests under Mediterranean climate seasonality in southern Spain-one with low N availability and the other with symptoms of N saturation. We hypothesized that biotic and abiotic immobilization of nitrate (NO3 -) would be lower in soils under these forests compared to more mesic temperate forests, and that the N saturated stand would have the lowest rates of NO3 - immobilization. Live and autoclaved soils were incubated with added 15NO3 - (10 μg N g-1 dry soil; 99% enriched) for 24 h, and the label was recovered as total dissolved-N, NO3 -, ammonium (NH4 +), or dissolved organic-N (DON). To evaluate concerns about possible iron interference in analysis of NO3 - concentrations, both flow injection analysis (FIA) and ion chromatography (IC) were applied to water extracts, soluble iron was measured in both water and salt extracts, and standard additions of NO3 - to salt extracts were analyzed. Good agreement between FIA and IC analysis, low concentrations of soluble Fe, and 100% (±3%) recovery of NO3 - standard additions all pointed to absence of an interference problem for NO3 - quantification. On average, 85% of the added 15NO3 - label was recovered as 15NO3 -, which supports our hypothesis that rates of immobilization were generally low in these soils. A small amount (mean = 0.06 μg N g-1 dry soil) was recovered as 15NH4 + in live soils and none in sterilized soils. Mean recovery as DO15N ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 μg N g-1 dry soil, with no statistically significant effect of sterilization or soil type, indicating that this was an abiotic process that occurred at similar rates in both soils. These results demonstrate a detectable, but modest rate of abiotic immobilization of NO3 - to DON, supporting our first hypothesis. These mineral soils may not have adequate carbon availability to support the regeneration of reducing microsites needed for high rates of NO3 - reduction. Our second hypothesis regarding lower expected abiotic immobilization in soils from the N-saturated site was not supported. The rates of N deposition in this region may not be high enough to have swamped the capacity for soil NO3 - immobilization, even in the stand showing some symptoms of N saturation. A growing body of evidence suggests that soil abiotic NO3 - immobilization is common, but that rates are influenced by a combination of factors, including the presence of plentiful available carbon, reduced minerals in anaerobic microsites and adequate NO3 - supply. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","15N; Ferrous-wheel hypothesis; Iron; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrogen saturation status; Retention","anoxic conditions; coniferous forest; deciduous forest; environmental fate; forest ecosystem; forest soil; immobilization; Mediterranean environment; nitrate; nitrogen cycle; reduction; seasonality; soil chemistry; temperate forest; Abies; Abies pinsapo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54849422084

Specifically, multivariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were developed for Aedes vexans and the combined group of Culex pipiens and Culex restuans in Erie County, New York. Weekly mosquito collections data were obtained for the four mosquito seasons from 2002 to 2005 from the Erie County Department of Health, Vector and Pest Control Program. Climate variables were tested for significance with cross-correlation analysis. Minimum temperature (T min), maximum temperature (Tmax), average temperature (Tave), precipitation (P), relative humidity (RH), and evapotranspiration (ET) were acquired from the Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC) at Cornell University. Weekly averages or sums of climate variables were calculated from the daily data. Other climate indexes were calculated and were tested for significance with the mosquito population data, including cooling degree days base 60 degrees (CDD_60), cooling degree days base 63 (CDD_63), cooling degree days base 65 (C DD_65), a ponding index (IP), and an interactive C DD_65-precipitation variable (CDD_65 × P week_4).

It is found that AABW is stable to surface freshwater fluxes greater in volume and rate to those that permanently ""shut down"" North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). Although AABW weakens during FW forcing, it fully recovers within 50 yr of termination of FW input. This is due in part to a concurrent deep warming during AABW suppression that acts to eventually destabilize the water column. In addition, the prevailing upwelling of Circumpolar Deep Water and northward Ekman transport across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, regulated by the subpolar westerly winds, limits the accumulation of FW at high latitudes and provides a mechanism for resalinizing the surface after the FW forcing has ceased. Enhanced sea ice production in the cooler AABW suppressed state also aids in the resalinization of the surface after FW forcing is stopped. Convection then restarts with AABW properties only slightly colder and fresher compared to the unperturbed control climate state. Further experiments with larger FW perturbations and very slow application rates (0.2 Sv/1000 yr) (1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s-1) confirm the lack of multiple steady states of AABW in the model. This contrasts with the North Atlantic, wherein classical hysteresis behavior is obtained with similar forcing. The climate response to reduced AABW production is also investigated. During peak FW forcing, Antarctic surface sea and air temperatures decrease by a maximum of 2.5° and 2.2°C, respectively. This is of a similar magnitude to the corresponding response in the North Atlantic. Although in the final steady state, the AABW experiment returns to the original control climate, whereas the North Atlantic case transitions to a different steady state characterized by substantial regional cooling (up to 6.0°C surface air temperature). © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Chlorine compounds; Oceanography; Perturbation techniques; Sea ice; Antarctic Bottom Water; Antarctic Circumpolar Current; Application rates; Circumpolar deep water; Coupled climate models; Ekman transport; Freshwater fluxes; Global climates; High Latitudes; Intermediate complexity; North Atlantic deep water; Sea ice production; Shut down; Water column; Bathymetry; air temperature; atmospheric forcing; circumpolar current; Ekman transport; global climate; North Atlantic Deep Water; sea ice; upwelling; water column; westerly; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48549100824

Algal biomass in this lagoon is relatively low while heterotrophic plankton biomass is high. Although often considered herbivorous, it is known that filter-feeding bivalves can consume various types of food, from bacteria to zooplankton. We hypothesize that along with phytoplankton, heterotrophs constitute an important food resource for the Grande-Entrée mussels. In situ mesocosm experiments were undertaken at different seasons using short socks filled with mussels from the same cohort taken from an aquaculture farm, in order to determine the impact of cultured mussels on local plankton communities and assess the role of heterotrophs. Filtration activity by the mussels and associated epibionts present in the socks was expressed as clearance rates (CR). The average CR over all taxa was lowest in June and highest in October. Diatoms, dinoflagellates and heterotrophic protists constituted the bulk of planktonic carbon removed by mussels. While smaller-sized taxa contributed little (< 5%) to mussel carbon intake, large-sized heterotrophs (namely ciliates) contributed 69 to 88%. Taxon-marker pigment analyses generally confirmed these observations for groups containing phototrophic pigments. The high heterotrophic biomass retained by mussels indicates they are a major food source for mussels in this environment and should be considered both in the evaluation of mussel feeding and in assessing the influence of cultured mussels on local plankton ecosystems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Under the Kyoto Protocol, GWP can be used as a fixed index to govern the trade-off between different GHGs in a multi-gas approach to GHGs abatement. The use of fixed GWPs has been criticized for not being very cost effective compared to the use of some flexible indices. To gain wider acceptance, however, a flexible index must also prove to be easy to use, and the economic gains from its adoption must be significant. In this paper, we develop a flexible index based on the concept of marginal rather than cumulative or average global warming potentials. These marginal global warming potentials (MGWPs) can be endogenously determined within a climate model given a particular climate objective based on radiative forcing level. The MGPWs are then linked to the marginal abatement costs of the GHGs, which are also endogenously determined within an economic model. When the two concepts are linked in this way, the result is a cost-effective way of achieving a particular climate change objective with multigas abatement. We show that the savings in costs when using this flexible MGPWs can be significant, and more importantly, they are not uniformly distributed across different regions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Global warming potential; Integrated assessment; Marginal abatement cost; Model coupling","Atmospheric radiation; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Climate change assessment; Economic modeling; Global warming potential; Integrated approach; Integrated assessment; Marginal abatement costs; Model coupling; Radiative forcings; Climate models; abatement cost; environmental assessment; environmental economics; global warming; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; Kyoto Protocol; radiative forcing; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54349129145

In this study we quantify effects of urban areas on the carbon cycle in Europe. Among urbanization-driven environmental changes, which influence carbon sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere, we account for: (1) proportion of land covered by impervious materials, (2) local urban meteorological conditions, (3) urban high CO 2 concentrations, and (4) elevated atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We use the terrestrial ecosystem model BIOMEBGC to estimate fluxes of carbon exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere in response to these urban factors. We analysed four urbanization-driven changes individually, setting up our model in such a way that only one of the four was active at a time. From these model simulations we found that fertilization effects from the elevated CO2 and the atmospheric nitrogen deposition made the strongest positive contributions to the carbon uptake (0.023 Pg C year-1 and 0.039 Pg C year-1, respectively), whereas, the impervious urban land and local urban meteorological conditions resulted in a reduction of carbon uptake (-0.005 PgC year-1 and -0.007 PgC year-1, respectively).

The reduction of NOx emissions by 50% during the summer results in lower average oxidant levels and lowers PM2.5 (8% on average), mainly because of reductions of sulfate (9-11%), nitrate (45-58%), and ammonium (7-11%). The organic particulate matter (PM) slightly decreases in rural areas, whereas it increases in cities by a few percent when NOx is reduced. Reduction of NOx during winter causes an increase of the oxidant levels and a rather complicated response of the PM components, leading to small net changes. Sulfate increases (8-17%), nitrate decreases (18-42%), organic PM slightly increases, and ammonium either increases or decreases a little. The reduction of VOC emissions during the summer causes on average a small increase of the oxidant levels and a marginal increase in PM2.5. This small net change is due to increases in the inorganic components and decreases of the organic ones. Reduction of VOC emissions during winter results in a decrease of the oxidant levels and a 5-10% reduction of PM2.5 because of reductions in nitrate (4-19%), ammonium (4-10%), organic PM (12-14%), and small reductions in sulfate. Although sulfur dioxide (SO2) reduction is the single most effective approach for sulfate control, the coupled decrease of SO2 and NOx emissions in both seasons is more effective in reducing total PM2.5 mass than the SO2 reduction alone.

However, unlike strictly seasonal hibernators, bats sometimes alternate prolonged torpor bouts with increased activity coinciding with periods of mild weather. Winter activity may be especially common in hibernating tree-roosting bats because they are less insulated from external conditions than cave-roosting species and must also leave their roosts to drink, socialize or mate. To test this hypothesis, I measured the activity of a community of tree-roosting bats by recording echolocation calls at four sites on 18 nights throughout winter in south-eastern Australia. I also measured insect activity using light traps at each site. I recorded some bat activity on most nights, typically at dusk. Greater bat and insect activity occurred on nights of warmer temperatures, moderate wind speeds and falling barometric pressure, indicating the approach of low-pressure cold fronts. Thus, winter activity of tree-roosting bats is linked to short-term mild conditions caused by a specific, reoccurring weather pattern. Climatic shifts that reduce the frequency of such weather events, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation phenomenon and future human-induced climate change, may also reduce winter activity and/or increase the cost of necessary arousal periods by hibernating tree-roosting bats. © 2008 The Author.","Bat; Energy expenditure; Hibernation; Microchiroptera; Torpor; Winter","bat; behavioral ecology; bioenergetics; climate effect; community response; echolocation; hibernation; hypothesis testing; roosting; temperature effect; wind velocity; winter; Australasia; Australia; Hexapoda; Microchiroptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54249135917

Up to date, no model has been developed in order to predict air pollutant levels in the different towns spread in the region. Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) series have been investigated (years 1999-2000-2001). Multilayer perceptron models (MLPs) with backpropagation learning rule have been used. A resampling strategy with two-fold crossvalidation allowed the statistical comparison of the different models considered in this study. Artificial neural networks (ANN) models were compared with Persistence and ARIMA models and also with models based on standard Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) over test sets with data that had not been used in the training stage. The models based on ANNs showed better capability of generalization than those based on MLR. The designed procedure of random resampling permits an adequate and robust multiple comparison of the tested models. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of data and to transform exogenous variables into significant and independent components. Short-term predictions were better than medium-term predictions in the case of CO and SO2 series. Conversely, medium-term predictions were better in the case of SPM concentrations.

The soundness of the concept of gas-gas displacement for enhancing gas recovery was investigated via laboratory investigations, compositional modelling and economic analyses. Paramount Resources is field testing the concept in their GRIPE Project in the Athabasca region of Alberta, to enhance production from a gas bearing stratum overlying the oil sand interval. This paper is a part of a series of papers presenting results of EGR research conducted over a five-year period (2003-2007). The main targets were volumetric (closed) reservoirs in advanced phases of exploitation. Results of basic research on methane displaced from core samples by pure gases (pure CO2 or pure N2), as well as flue gases (mixtures of CO2 and N 2), are presented. A series of nine gas/gas displacement tests in 30 cm long, 4 cm diameter, Berea cores were conducted at a temperature of 70°C and a pressure of 6,200 kPa. Most of the tests were conducted in the presence of connate water, while others were conducted without connate water (dry cores) to confirm and benchmark the results by other investigators. The tests on consolidated cores showed that for pure nitrogen and pure CO2, used as the displacing medium, the recovery was comparable. Where a mixture of CO2 and nitrogen displaced the natural gas, it was observed that there was a delay in CO2 breakthrough, associated with a period when only a mixture of methane and nitrogen was produced. This is so because solubility of CO2 in connate water is considerably higher than that of nitrogen. This leads directly to a higher gas recovery due to a longer exploitation period, given the fact that up to 20% nitrogen can be tolerated in the produced stream, as opposed to only 1% for the CO2 case. For this period of methane and nitrogen production, there are no operational problems associated with the corrosive nature of CO2. EGR by gas-gas displacement is seen as a promising way of prolonging the productive life and economic recovery of many depleting volumetric gas reservoirs.",,"Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Methane; Mixtures; Natural gas; Nitrogen; Oil sands; Recovery; Athabasca regions; Compositional modelling; Economic recovery; Enhanced gas recoveries; Gas displacement; Laboratory investigations; Natural gas reservoir; Operational problems; Gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54249148678

These two complementary techniques permit the determination of the adsorbed amount with a sensitivity of ∼1% of the maximum surface coverage, changes in the average tilt of the adsorbed molecules, the presence of asymmetric aggregates in the adsorbed film, and the structure and orientation of the water molecules in the interfacial region. The TIR Raman spectra show a monotonic increase with CTAB concentration with no measurable changes in the relative intensities of the different polarization combinations probed, implying that no significant changes occur in the conformational order of the hydrocarbon chain. In the sum-frequency (SF) spectra, no detectable peaks from the surfactant headgroup and hydrophobic chain were observed at any surface coverage. Major changes are observed in the water bands of the SF spectra, as the originally negatively charged silica surface becomes positively charged with an increase in the adsorbed amount, inducing a change in the polar orientation of the water molecules near the surface. The detection limits for hydrocarbons chains in the SF spectra were estimated by comparison with the SF spectrum of a disordered octadecyltrichlorosilane monolayer. The simulations demonstrate that the asymmetry in the adsorbed CTAB layer at any concentration is less than 5% of a monolayer. The results obtained pose severe constraints on the possible structural models, in particular at concentrations below the critical micellar concentration where information is scarce.

These blends offer a valid opportunity for tackling sustainable transportation, in view of the future stringent emission limits for road vehicles. Air pollution is particularly suffered in large urban areas, where cars and heavy duty vehicles greatly contribute to total emissions. Hydrogen is a very interesting energy vector for road transportation, however long time would be required to implement new refuelling infrastructures and new engines or power train systems capable to use hydrogen as fuel. Thus such blends could be employed since now without any important changes in both the distribution infrastructures and engine fuel systems of the current natural gas vehicles. The aim of the paper is the investigation of the effects of hydrogen-natural gas blends on performance and efficiency of a spark ignition internal combustion engine. The activity evaluates the influence of hydrogen content in blends (ranging from 10% to 30% in volume) on flame propagation speed and heat release rates using an internal combustion engine model. Two different approaches have been used for ignition timing, cither employing a Maximum Brake Torque (MBT) spark timing for each fuel or retaining the spark advance of the natural gas engine. Engine brake efficiency increments ranged between 2% and 4.5% for different blends and load conditions adopting MBT ignition timing. Actual running fuel costs were observed to increases 8% for HCNG 10 and 29% for HCNG 30 when compared to CNG using MBT ignition timing.","Combustion model; Flame speed; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engine; Natural gas","Automobile engines; Brakes; Combustion equipment; Fossil fuels; Fuel pumps; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Hydrogen; Ignition; Internal combustion engines; Natural gas; Pollution; Roads and streets; Combustion model; Flame propagation speed; Flame speed; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Heavy duty vehicles; Maximum brake torques; Road transportation; Sustainable transportation; Natural gas vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866074833

The effects of recent human activities on forest composition, however, remain poorly understood. We quantified changes in forest composition during the past century in the mixed forests of Quercus suber (cork oak) and Q. canariensis (Algerian oak), and explored the effects of forest management and environmental (climate, topography) factors on forest structure at various spatial and temporal scales. Location: Mountains north of the Strait of Gibraltar (southern Spain). Methods: First, we quantified 20th-century changes in species composition from a series of inventories in nine mixed forests (c. 40,000 ha), and examined them in terms of the management practices and environmental conditions. Second, we analysed present-day Q. suber and Q. canariensis stand structure along environmental gradients at two spatial scales: (1) that of the forest landscape (c. 284 ha), combining local inventories and topographic variables and using a digital elevation model; and (2) regional (c. 87,600 km2), combining data from the Spanish Forest Inventory for the Andalusia region and estimates of climatic variables. Results: Historical data indicate anthropogenic changes in stand composition, revealing a sharp increase in the density of cork oaks over the last century. Forest management has favoured this species (for cork production) at the expense of Q. canariensis. The impact of management is imprinted on the present-day forest structure. The abundance of both species increases with annual mean precipitation, and they coexist above 800 mm (the minimum threshold for Q. canariensis). Quercus suber dominates in most of the stands, and species segregation in the landscape is associated with the drainage network, Q. canariensis being clearly associated with moister habitats near streams. Main conclusions: Our study quantitatively exemplifies a recent human-mediated shift in forest composition. As a result of forest management, the realized niche of the cork oak has been enlarged at the expense of that of Q. canariensis, providing further evidence for humans as major drivers of oak forest composition across the Mediterranean. Recent regeneration problems detected in Q. suber stands, a reduced demand for wood products, conservation policies, and climate change augur new large-scale shifts in forest composition. © 2008 The Authors.","Deciduous forest; Environmental gradients; Forest structure; Human impact; Land-use history; Mediterranean forest; Quercus canariensis; Quercus suber; Sclerophyllous species; Strait of Gibraltar","anthropogenic effect; coexistence; community composition; deciduous forest; digital elevation model; environmental factor; forest inventory; forest management; land use; stand structure; twentieth century; Andalucia; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; Strait of Gibraltar; Quercus canariensis; Quercus suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549109402

Several analyses have shown that nuclear technologies may represent very attractive options for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, especially in countries with high growth projections for energy demand. Our objective is to analyze the role of nuclear energy in long-term climate scenarios using the World-TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) bottom-up model. World-TIMES is a global model that optimizes the energy system of 15 regions over a 100-year horizon (2000-2100). We present energy and emission results for climate scenarios for two levels of CO2 concentration (450 and 550 ppmv by 2100). We analyze the penetration level of nuclear energy under various sets of assumptions on technology parameters and exogenous constraints on nuclear development to reflect social perceptions. Nuclear energy technologies satisfy a large portion of electricity production in many regions. Most regions experience an energy transition based on advanced oil and gas technologies and hydropower. Other renewable technologies might play a more important role but need further cost reductions or new regulations to penetrate the market in substantial proportions. Carbon sequestration and endogenous demand reductions for energy services are also significantly contributing to reach environmental target. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods and Results: OTA-producing A. carbonarius and B. cinerea were grown on grape-like medium at 20°C for 7 days. Radii of colonies were daily recorded and OTA was analysed. In addition, each B. cinerea isolate was inoculated on grape-like synthetic nutrient medium (SNM) paired with each A. carbonarius isolate at a distance of 45 mm. Botrytis cinerea isolates were also grown in OTA-spiked SNM. Growth rates of B. cinerea and A. carbonarius were 20 and 7.5 mm day -1, respectively. The growth of the colonies of each species stopped when they contacted each other in paired cultures. OTA production by A. carbonarius in the contact area was affected by B. cinerea, but no clear trend was observed. All B. cinerea isolates showed to degrade between 24.2% and 26.7% of OTA from spiked SNM. Conclusions: The ecological advantage of B. cinerea, in terms of growth rate, vs. OTA-producing Aspergillus in some wine-growing regions and its ability to degrade OTA may explain the low levels of this toxin in noble wines. Significance and Impact of the Study: At determinate conditions, the presence of B. cinerea in grapes with A. carbonarius may help in reducing OTA accumulation. © 2008 The Authors.","Aspergillus carbonarius; Botrytis cinerea; Grape-like medium; Ochratoxin A","ochratoxin; Degradation; Fruits; Fungi; Nutrients; fungus; growth response; toxin; article; aspergillus carbonarius; Botrytis cinerea; controlled study; fungal colonization; fungus; fungus growth; fungus isolation; in vitro study; nonhuman; Aspergillus; Botrytis; Culture Media; Ochratoxins; Vitis; Wine; Aspergillus; Aspergillus carbonarius; Botryotinia fuckeliana; Vitaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52449086048

Advection of the plume across the ceilometer occurred at a mean height of 250 m AGL. The plume traveled downwind at ∼3 m s-1, and at a distance of 8 km downwind, was ∼100 m in vertical thickness with particulate matter (PM) concentrations of order 30-40 μg m-3. Surface PM observations from surrounding urban monitoring stations suggest that the plume was not mixed to ground over the urban area. Plume trajectories at ∼250 m simulated by three numerical models all traveled to the northeast of the ceilometer location. Horizontal plume dispersion estimates suggest that the model trajectories were too far north to accommodate the likely lateral plume spread necessary to explain the ceilometer observations. This poor agreement between near surface observations and model output is consistent with previous mesoscale model validations in this region of complex urbanized terrain, and suggests that despite improvements in mesoscale model resolution, there remains an urgent need to improve upstream initial conditions over the Pacific Ocean, data assimilation over complex terrain, the representation of urban areas in mesoscale models, and to further validate such models for nocturnal applications in complex settings. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we used several sources of satellite data with biogeochemical and atmospheric modeling to better understand and constrain fire emissions from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea during 2000-2006. We found that average fire emissions from this region [128 ± 51 (1σ) Tg carbon (C) year-1, T = 1012] were comparable to fossil fuel emissions. In Borneo, carbon emissions from fires were highly variable, fluxes during the moderate 2006 El Niño more than 30 times greater than those during the 2000 La Niña (and with a 2000-2006 mean of 74 ± 33 Tg C yr-1). Higher rates of forest loss and larger areas of peatland becoming vulnerable to fire in drought years caused a strong nonlinear relation between drought and fire emissions in southern Borneo. Fire emissions from Sumatra showed a positive linear trend, increasing at a rate of 8 Tg C year -2 (approximately doubling during 2000-2006).

We analyze whether such an increase in elemental ratio may give rise to a stoichiometric constraint or bottleneck for regulation of phytoplankton by zooplankton and thus cause a decrease in trophic transfer efficiency. Because seston C:P ratios of seston tend to decrease with increasing P concentration in lakes, i.e. by increasing eutrophication, the reverse may be true, i.e. the C:P ratio of the seston will increase when lakes become reoligotrophicated by P reduction. This may imply lower food quality for P-demanding seston grazers, like Daphnia, which have both relatively low C:P ratios and are quite homeostatic with regard to C:P ratios. Consequently, the reduced grazer biomass may lead to lower grazing pressure on the phytoplankton and may result in lower trophic transfer efficiency. On the other hand, oligotrophication commonly leads to improved food quality in terms of composition of the phytoplankton community, e.g. increase of mixotrophs and reduced share of cyanobacteria. These two qualitative traits of seston (higher C:P ratios and change in phytoplankton composition) may thus work in opposite directions during re-oligotrophication. Most investigated lakes - both deep and shallow - responded by improvement in underwater light climate due to reduction of P loadings. Several compensatory mechanisms prevented the occurrence of a stoichiometric bottleneck for top-down control. From a few documented cases of both deep and shallow lakes, where seston stoichiometry, the presence of Daphnia and the trophic transfer efficiency were concurrently measured during the process of reoligotrophication, we may conclude that the anticipated increase in C:P ratios of the seston is not straightforward. It depends on lake-specific properties such as morphometry, water residence time, water temperature and trophic structure. A stoichiometric bottleneck is only likely to occur during summer in (1) the epilimnion of small deep and stratified lakes with a long water residence time and low mixing regime, and (2) shallow lakes with high C:P ratios caused by a relatively high detritus content of seston and/or grazing resistant algae, like colony forming cyanobacteria. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

In response, many agencies have established HDV inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs designed to target and repair vehicles with excess emissions. In this review, we conduct an international comparison of legislative context and HDV I/M program characteristics across Europe, North America, and Australia. The results of this analysis show that HDV-I/M programs vary greatly in terms of the ways in which testing is organized, for example, roadside versus periodic testing, whether the fleet is self-tested, and how nonfleet and age exemptions are handled. We also show how the I/M test criteria have changed little in the last 15 years while regulations for new heavy-duty diesel engine emissions have become increasingly stringent. In the U.S., HDV engine PM emissions limits were reduced by a factor of 26 between 1997 and 2007. Most I/M programs have continued to test according to EPA (and often with state legislative confirmation) guidance procedures having cut-points established in 1992. An analysis of data from Washington State show that only a minority of post-1997 vehicles actually exceeds the detection levels of the free-acceleration smoke-opacity test procedures, with the result that malfunctions of these vehicles may not actually be detected. From our review, it is clear that even with the potential adoption of new technologies and a more systematic and efficient framework for HDV-I/M, more research must be conducted in the efficacies of periodic versus roadside testing (and location selection), the use of evaluation methods like fail rates and opacity distributions, and finally, in development of better methods for identifying excess emissions with sensors and duty cycles. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Alternative fuels; Automobile engines; Diesel engines; Environmental Protection Agency; Maintenance; Opacity; Optical properties; Particulate emissions; Permanent magnets; Repair; Roads and streets; Roadsides; Vehicles; Analysis of datums; Australia; Critical reviews; Detection levels; Diesel engine emissions; Duty cycles; Duty vehicles; Evaluation methods; Fail rates; Heavy duties; I/m programs; Inspection and maintenances; International comparisons; Location selections; New technologies; North America; Particulate matter emissions; PM emissions; Test criterions; Test procedures; Urban areas; Washington states; Automobile parts and equipment; comparative study; diesel engine; efficiency measurement; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; testing method; traffic emission; urban area; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; Australia; comparative study; diesel engine; Europe; exhaust gas; legal aspect; North America; particulate matter; review; Maintenance; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Program Evaluation; Vehicle Emissions; Australasia; Australia; Eurasia; Europe; North America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549116383

Wet eutrophic lake bank sites showed locally high emission rates (up to 49 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, average 11.9 mg m-2 h-1). By contrast, fen emissions were an order of magnitude lower despite high water tables. Emission did not exceed 4.2 mg m-2 h-1 (average 1.3 mg m-2 h-1).

A clear relation with water temperature or soil temperature appears to be absent. Also in the wet year of 2006, with higher water table in the forest during the measurement period, CH4 uptake remained stable.

China recently surpassed the United States as the largest greenhouse gas emitter, and its projected future emissions far outstrip those of any other nation. Although the United States has been the largest emitter for years, China's emissions have enabled critics in the United States to argue that domestic reductions will be ineffective and will transfer jobs to China. These two aspects of the China Problem, Chinese emissions and their influence on the political process in the United States, result in a mutually supportive but ultimately destructive dance between the two countries. This Article argues that a post-Kyoto international agreement and other measures are necessary but will not create sufficient incentives to induce China, and ultimately the United States, to act. Instead, the Article draws on the fact that the United States and Europe account for 41% of Chinese exports to propose a novel means of changing both countries' incentives. The article suggests that private or public schemes in the United States and Europe to disclose product carbon emissions and corporate carbon footprints can create consumer and other pressure that will induce firms to impose supply-chain requirements on Chinese and other suppliers.

The importance of these questions is emphasized by the complexity of the relationship between climate and horticultural crops. Horticultural production is influenced by climate in the following ways: • climate is an important part of local environmental conditions; • it is a system of driving environmental factors: climate permanently influences vital processes of plants; and • it is a system of risk factors: horticultural plants can suffer significant damage caused by extreme meteorological events. Climate change is a realistic possibility nowadays, but there are a lot of open questions concerning the scenarios. An essential element of uncertainty in research concerning climate change is the lack of precise definition of the difference between climatic variability and climate change. This is one of the fundamental reasons why the risk associated with the current warming tendency is a hotly debated question. However, there is no question that (quite apart from the different interpretations of anomalies) climate change is an environmental problem of great importance and a societal response cannot be delayed because of any uncertainties. The response includes mitigation of greenhouse gas concentration and assessment of expected changes as well as their effects, which may help adaptation. There is no generally accepted prescription for adaptation. Climate change occurs locally, and the changes could be entirely different in different regions of the Earth. In addition, the impacts of changes on horticultural crops depend on species, varieties and strains. Nevertheless, exchange of different experiences among regions and countries may be useful, because it can help local efforts of adaptation. Hungarian horticultural production probably would be more influenced by more frequent extreme meteorological conditions than by rising temperature. This tendency seems to be basically unfavourable. Whereas a warmer climate may even exert a beneficial effect on harvest prospects, extreme weather events will decrease yields. For this reason, crop security would become the prime focus of the horticultural sector. © CAB International 2008.","Adaptation; Crop security; Drought; Frost; Mitigation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891721851

In this study, we coupled continuous minirhizotron observations with an array of solid-state CO 2 sensors. We calculated soil respiration using a gradient flux method. Using a Kaplan-Maier survival analysis, we determined a median longevity of 347 d for fine roots and of 400 d for rhizomorphs. Radiocarbon ( 14C) analysis suggested an age of 7 yr for fine roots &lt;1 mm and 17yr for roots of 1 mm in diameter. We found rapid changes in root length (maximum of 38.1 cm m -2 d -1) and rhizomorph length (maximum of 105.4 cm m -2 d -1) during sampling of four consecutive days. Changes in rhizomorph length were more variable than root length, and rhizomorphs were negatively correlated with daily changes in soil moisture. The variation in root length may be associated to prior environmental conditions. Fine root length was correlated with daily CO 2 production, and variation in daily fine root length could contribute up to 4680 g C ha -1 d -1. We observed a clockwise diurnal hysteresis effect in soil respiration with soil temperature that changed in amplitude and shape along the year. Our results show the importance of shorter intervals of minirhizotron measurements to understand rapid fine roots and rhizomorphs variation. Furthermore, continuous minirhizotron measurements should be couple with continuous measurements of multiple sensor arrays to explain biophysical factors that regulate belowground carbon dynamics. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sink; fine root; fungus; mixed forest; radiocarbon dating; root system; sensor; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; temperate forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949117293

In many cases, for practical and/or economical reasons, the use of aqueous solutions of ILs would be preferable to their use as pure compounds. In this work, high pressure equilibrium data for the {carbon dioxide (CO2) + tri-iso-butyl(methyl)phosphonium tosylate [iBu3MeP][TOS] + water system were measured at temperatures ranging from (276 to 370) K and pressures up to 100 MPa. Measurements were performed using a high-pressure cell with a sapphire window that allows direct observation of the liquid-vapour transition. Mixtures with different IL concentrations were studied in order to check the influence of the amount of IL on the solubility of CO2 in the aqueous mixture. The results show that the presence of IL enhances the solubility of CO2 in the (IL + water) system revealing a salting-in effect of the IL on the solubility of CO2. The appearance of a three phase region was observed for IL concentrations higher than 4 mol% of IL in water when working at pressures between 4 and 8 MPa and temperatures between (280 and 305) K.

Sediment samples were taken in August 2000 with a 0.05 m2 van Veen grab at 28 sampling locations. The predominance of n-alkanes with more than 24 carbons, together with CPI values close to one, and the fact that most of the stations showed UCM/resolved aliphatic hydrocarbons ratios (UCM:R) higher than two, indicated a high degree of anthropogenic contribution, the presence of terrestrial plant detritus, petroleum products and evidence of chronic oil pollution. The indices used to determine the origin of PAH indicated the occurrence of a petrogenic contribution. A pyrolytic contribution constituted mainly by fossil fuel combustion derived PAH was also observed. The results of the stepwise multiple regression analysis performed with chemical data and benthic ecological descriptors demonstrated that not only total PAH concentrations but also specific concentration ratios or indices such as ≥C24:&lt;C24, An/178 and Fl/Fl + Py, are determining the structure of benthic communities within the study area. According to the BIO-ENV results petroleum related variables seemed to have a main influence on macrofauna community structure. The PCA ordination performed with the chemical data resulted in the formation of three groups of stations. The decrease in macrofauna density, number of species and diversity from groups III to I seemed to be related to the occurrence of high aliphatic hydrocarbon and PAH concentrations associated with fine sediments. Our results showed that macrobenthic communities in the northeast portion of Todos os Santos Bay are subjected to the impact of chronic oil pollution as was reflected by the reduction in the number of species and diversity.

However, a plausible mechanism to explain these observations remains unclear. Although it is widely accepted that the climate change over the past 50 years is attributed to human influence, we present the case that local climate change in the tropical Pacific may be due to changes in the Earth's magnetic field strength. The changes in the tropical Pacific circulation have been observed during the last 50 years, and they are attributed to the increase of the global surface temperature. However, a geomagnetic modulation of the net radiative flux in the southern tropical Pacific was recently suggested. Moreover, comparisons of long-term reconstructions of the Northern Hemisphere surface temperature and solar activity proxies indicated that the existence of a geomagnetic signal in climate data would support a direct link between solar variability and their effects on climate. Here we show that in the tropical Pacific the sea-level pressure, which is a component of the Walker circulation, could be related to the magnetospheric, ionospheric, and upper-atmosphere processes which may propagate downward to the lower atmosphere. Furthermore, we show that the changes in sea-level pressure and the Walker circulation are correlated to the westward drift of the magnetic anomaly. We compare the region averaged monthly values of the sea-level pressure in the tropical Pacific with those of the magnetic field intensity near the surface for the last 50 years. We find that the sea-level pressure in the tropical Pacific is increasing as the magnetic field intensity is decreasing. The correlation coefficient of the sea-level pressure 36-month running means versus the magnetic field intensity is 0.96. We anticipate our investigation to be a starting point for a more sophisticated investigation of the coupling between the space weather processes and lower atmosphere and ocean dynamics.

The model is applied to the continental United States to investigate the subgrid-scale effects associated with Hg emissions from large elevated point sources on atmospheric Hg concentrations and deposition. The top thirty Hg-emitting power plants in the U.S. were selected for explicit plume-in-grid treatment. Two new processes are included in the Hg chemical mechanism: thegas-phase adsorption of reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) on atmospheric particulate matter and the reduction of RGM to elemental Hg by sulfur dioxide. The plume-in-grid treatment results in improved performance for Hg wet deposition over a purely Eulerian grid-based model, partial correction of overpredictions of wet deposition downwind of coal-fired power plants in the northeastern U.S., and decreases of approximately 10% in simulated dry and wet deposition over large parts of the eastern U.S., with larger decreases near the plants selected for plume-in-grid treatment. On average, 23% of ambient RGM is modeled to adsorb on atmospheric particulate matter.

The present study tries to reconstruct changes of seasonality from evidence of annual algal successions within the framework of well-established pollen zonation and 14C-AMS dates from terrestrial plants. Laminated Holocene sediments in Lake Jues (10°20.7′ E, 51°39.3′ N, 241 m a.s.l.), located at the SW margin of the Harz Mountains, central Germany, were studied for sediment characteristics, pollen, diatoms and coccal green algae. An age model is based on 21 calibrated AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plants. The sedimentary record covers the entire Holocene period. Trophic status and circulation/stagnation patterns of the lake were inferred from algal assemblages, the subannual structure of varves and the physico-chemical properties of the sediment. During the Holocene, mixing conditions alternated between di-, oligo- and meromictic depending on length and variability of spring and fall periods, and the stability of winter and summer weather. The trophic state was controlled by nutrient input, circulation patterns and the temperature-dependent rates of organic production and mineralization. Climate shifts, mainly in phase with those recorded from other European regions, are inferred from changing limnological conditions and terrestrial vegetation. Significant changes occurred at 11,600 cal. yr. BP (Preboreal warming), between 10,600 and 10,100 cal. yr. BP (Boreal cooling), and between 8,400 and 4,550 cal. yr. BP (warm and dry interval of the Atlantic). Since 4,550 cal. yr. BP the climate became gradually cooler, wetter and more oceanic. This trend was interrupted by warmer and dryer phases between 3,440 and 2,850 cal. yr. BP and, likely, between 2,500 and 2,250 cal. yr.

We used monthly measurements over 2 years to examine variation in retention of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH4+ ) in two Mediterranean headwater streams with contrasting hydrological regimes (that is, perennial versus intermittent). Differences in retention between streams were more evident for NH4+ , likely due to strong differences in the potential for nitrogen limitation. In both streams, nutrient-retention efficiency was negatively influenced by abrupt discharge changes, whereas gradual seasonal changes in SRP demand were partially controlled by riparian vegetation dynamics through changes in organic matter and light availability. Nutrient concentrations were below saturation in the two streams; however, SRP demand increased relative to NH4+ demand in the intermittent stream as the potential for phosphorus limitation increased (that is, higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen:SRP ratio). Unexpectedly, variability in nutrient retention was not greater in the intermittent stream, suggesting high resilience of biological communities responsible for nutrient uptake. Within-stream variability of all retention metrics, however, increased with increasing time scale. A review of studies addressing temporal variation of nutrient retention at different time scales supports this finding, indicating increasing variability of nutrient retention with concomitant increases in the variability of environmental factors from the diurnal to the inter-annual scale. Overall, this study emphasizes the significance of local climate conditions in regulating nutrient retention and points to potential effects of changes in land use and climate regimes on the functioning of stream ecosystems. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Intermittent stream; Nitrogen; Nutrient retention; Nutrient spiralling; Phosphorus; Temporal variation; Uptake length","climate conditions; comparative study; ecosystem function; headwater; hydrological regime; land use change; Mediterranean Water; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient uptake; phosphorus; seasonal variation; solubility; streamflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249122034

Previously, we have shown that enzymes of PG synthesis pathway such as prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1), prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS) and prostaglandin 9-ketoreductase (CBR1) are important in regulation of PG production in the conceptuses and endometrium of cyclic and pregnant pigs. Therefore, localization and expression patterns of these enzymes were determinated in porcine CL. The PGFS protein content was lower in metestrus and higher around luteolysis, and then decreased in late regressing CL. PGFS protein levels were lower on days 5-8 of pregnancy and did not differ between days 10 and 25. Elevated expression of mPGES-1 mRNA was found in early luteal phase. The mPGES-1 protein content, similarly to PGFS, was higher during luteolysis. mPGES-1 mRNA and protein levels were constant between days 5 and 25 of pregnancy. PGFS and mPGES-1 expression was down-regulated on days 16-17 of the oestrous cycle when compared to the corresponding days of pregnancy. Enhanced mPGES-1/PGFS ratio occurred during early luteal phase and days 5-8 of pregnancy. Expression of CBR1 mRNA and protein was constant during the cycle and pregnancy. Our studies revealed higher mPGES-1/PGFS ratios in the CL during early luteal phase and corresponding days of pregnancy that could favor PGE2 synthesis and may be important in the control of luteal development.

There is no indication of major anthropogenic input of the elements Be, Co, Cr, Fe, Si, Tl, V, K, Mg, Ca, Sr and Zn, based on normalization to Al. The concentrations of these metals in the sediment are a function of the relative amounts of trace-metal-rich Mississippi River-derived silicate material and trace-metal-poor plankton-derived carbonate. This is not true for the elements Ba, Ni, Pb, Cd, As, Cu and Mn, whose concentrations show considerable scatter when normalized to Al and a general enrichment. On a normalized basis, Mn is enriched 5-10 fold, Cu and Ni 2-3 fold and Pb 2 fold over Mississippi River-derived material. These enrichments are likely the result of remobilization of metals from depths in the sediment column where reducing conditions exist. The Ba concentrations at selected sites are higher than those of average clay-rich sediments, but are typical of sediments from near oil well platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico. In the case of Ba, it seems likely that the enrichments, as high as a factor of 10, are due to disposal of oil well drilling mud. The Ba-enriched samples are from the three shallowest water sites in the Mississippi Trough (sites MT1, 2 and 3) and from site C1 and WC5. All are in an area of intense petroleum exploration and development. PAH concentrations are also elevated at MT1, MT3 and C1. The total PAH concentration ranged from not detected (ND) to 1033 ng/g with a mean of 140 ng/g. Even at the sites most enriched in PAHs and trace elements, the concentrations are not at the levels expected to adversely affect the biota. However, these predicted non-effects are based on research using mostly near-shore estuarine species, not on the indigenous species at the sampling sites. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates a tradable permit policy for mitigating carbon emissions from personal road transport and discusses various issues of permit allocation. As tradable permits will effectively raise the price of fuel, the policy has important distributional implications. The distribution of burden depends on permit allocation strategies and on the consumer response to an increase in price. The behavioural response varies among different segments of the population depending on their travel needs, which in turn are contingent upon their income, location of residence and other factors.

The off-line algorithm (Particulate Source Apportionment Technology, PSAT) is simpler to implement, has a lower computational cost and is suitable for a range of source apportionment studies. As a first application, PSAT was used to investigate the contribution of power plant SO2 emissions to particulate sulfate concentrations in the Eastern United States. The impact of the transport of SO2 emissions from the Chicago, IL area and the impact of these emissions on particulate sulfate concentration in surrounding areas were also studied as a second application. The implementation of PSAT for the SO2/particulate sulfate system only resulted in a 1% increase in computation time over the base simulation.

They are being promoted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve U.S. energy independence. This paper analyzes pipeline, rail, and truck distribution options for alternative fuels using the state of Iowa as a test case. By completely switching to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline) in Iowa, local ethanol production could replace 80% of gasoline use. Likewise, hydrogen derived from steam methane reforming at 7 facilities could replace all gasoline usage in the state. At 2006 gasoline prices, vehicles fueled with E85 would have comparable or lower fuel costs. The costs of hydrogen at the pump for both gas and liquid delivery are higher than those for gasoline and the ethanol scenarios. There are strong economies of scale in distribution paths, so a major shift to alternative fuels is needed to achieve the most cost effective distribution methods modeled in this analysis. There is considerable uncertainty in the cost estimates, particularly for the production costs of cellulosic ethanol, feedstock costs for hydrogen production, and the future price of petroleum. © 2008 ASCE.","Crops; Fuels; Infrastructure; Iowa","Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Automobile testing; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Energy resources; Ethanol; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel manufacture; Gasoline; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Leakage (fluid); Liquid fuels; Methane; Nonmetals; Petroleum products; Pipelines; Raw materials; Uncertainty analysis; Cellulosic ethanol; Cost estimating; Crops; Economies-of-scale; Effective distribution; Energy independence; Ethanol production; Feedstock costs; Fuel costs; Gasoline prices; Green house gas emissions; Infrastructure; Iowa; Liquid delivery; Production costs; Steam methane reforming; Test cases; Transportation fuels; Ethanol fuels; alternative energy; carbon emission; energy market; ethanol; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; transportation infrastructure; Iowa; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50149114325

Methane emissions from 14 Siberian lakes and 9 Alaskan lakes were characterized using stable isotopes (13C and D) and radiocarbon (14C) analyses. We classified ebullition (bubbling) into three categories (background, point sources, and hot spots) on the basis of fluxes, major gas concentrations, and isotopic composition. Point sources and hot spots had a strong association with thermokarst (thaw) erosion because permafrost degradation along lake margins releases ancient organic matter into anaerobic lake bottoms, fueling methanogenesis. With increasing ebullition rate, we observed increasing CH 4 concentration of greater radiocarbon age, depletion of 13CCH4, and decreasing bubble N2 content. Microbial oxidation of methane was observed in bubbles that became trapped below and later within winter lake ice; however, oxidation appeared insignificant in bubbles sampled immediately after release from sediments. Methanogenic pathways differed among the bubble sources: CO2 reduction supported point source and hot spot ebullition to a large degree, while acetate fermentation appeared to contribute to background bubbling. To provide annual whole-lake and regional CH4 isofluxes for the Siberian lakes, we combined maps of bubble source distributions with long-term, continuous flux measurements and isotopic composition. In contrast to typical values used in inverse models of atmospheric CH4 for northern wetland sources (δ13 CCH4 = -58%, 14C age modern), which have not included northern lake ebullition as a source, we show that this large, new source of high-latitude CH4 from lakes is isotopically distinct (δ13CCH4 = -70%, 14C age 16,500 years, for North Siberian lakes).

Incomplete combustion of petroleum and coal are the primary sources of elevated concentrations of urban PAHs. The purposes of the study were: 1) to determine and compare the concentration of PAHs in soils taken from two major US cities, New Orleans and Detroit; and 2) to examine the main sources of PAHs in urban soils by diagnostic PAH ratios. A total of 107 New Orleans soil samples were taken from 6 census tracts (n = 13-19 per census tract) and compared with 106 Detroit soil samples from 6 census tracts. Sampling sites included house foundations, open spaces, and soil bordering residential and busy streets. The average total PAH (sum of 17 PAH concentrations) of Detroit soils was 7,843 μ g/kg, compared to 5,100 μ g/kg for New Orleans soils. Several diagnostic PAH concentration ratios were calculated for source determination for Detroit and New Orleans, respectively: phenanthrene/anthracene ratios (2.97 and 5.36), benz(a)anthracene/chrysene ratios (0.99 and 0.85), benzo(b)fluoranthene/benzo(k)fluoranthene ratios (1.51 and 1.53), and benzo(a)pyrene/benzo(e)pyrene ratios (0.98 and 0.92). The ratios indicate that PAH concentrations are attributable to pyrolytic sources, mainly vehicle exhaust. Travel and gasoline consumption data in Detroit and New Orleans support these findings.

This approach holds a great potential for paleoecological reconstruction using paleosols. However, two main uncertainties exist, which limits the accuracy of this application. One is 13C-enrichment as the plant carbon becomes incorporated into soil organic matter. The other is due to environmental influences on δ13C of plants. Two types of data were collected and analyzed with an objective of narrowing the error of paleovegetation reconstruction. First, we investigated δ13C variations of 557 C3 and 136C4 plants along a precipitation gradient in North China. A strong negative correlation is found between the δ13C value of C 3 plants averaged for each site and the annual precipitation with a coefficient of -0.40%/100mm, while no significant coefficients were found for C4 plants. Second, we measured13C of soil organic matters for 14 soil profiles at three sites. The isotopic difference between vegetation and soil organic matter are evaluated to be 1.8% for the surface soil and 2.8% for the soil at the bottom of soil profiles. We conducted a sample reconstruction of paleovegetation at the central Chinese Loess Plateau during the Holocene and the Last Glacial (LG), and conclude that, without corrections for 13C-enrichment by decomposition, the C4 abundance would be overestimated. The importance and uncertainties of other corrections are also discussed. in the vegetation at a given locality in the past. Many researchers have used δ13CSOM of paleosols and/or loess to reconstruct paleovegetation and paleoclimate (e.g. Stanley et al., 1991; Boutton, 1996; Boutton et al., 1998; Guillaume et al., 2001; Wang and Zheng, 1989; Gu, 1991; Frakes and Sun, 1994; Han et al., 1996; Wang and Follmer, 1998; Lin et al., 1991; Ding and Yang, 2000; Vidic and Montañez, 2004; Liu et al., 2005; An et al., 2005). For reconstructions of paleovegetation, the following isotope mass-balance equations are used: C3(%)= (δ13CSOM- δ13CC4)/( δ13CC3-δ13CC4 ) × 100; (1) C4(%)=100-C3(%) (2) where δ13CC3 , δ13CC4 are the mean δ13C values of C3 and C4 plants at a given locality at the time the soil under study was developed; C3 (%) and C4 (%) are percentages of C 3 and C4 biomass in the local vegetation. The accuracy of the reconstruction depends upon the accuracy of the end member values of δ13CC3 and δ13CC4 . The use of these equations also assumes that δ13CSOM represents the δ13C value of bulk local vegetation. To acquire the δ13C values for the pure C3 and C4 plants at the time paleosols formed, isotopic values for modern plants are first obtained. However, modern plants may be isotopically different from ancient plants due to environmental changes. An array of environmental factors influence the δ13C values of plants, and many scientists have investigated the effects (see the summary in Arens et al., 2000). Attempts have been made by several authors to correct the effects of these enviromental factors before Eqs. 1 and 2 were applied (Liu et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005). Another source of uncertainty comes from the assumption that δ13CSOM equals the δ13C of vegetation. It is known that 13C-enrichment occurs during decomposition such that the soil organic matter tends to have higher δ13C values than the vegetation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71949126073

Methods and Materials: Ten patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 4D CT scan for radiotherapy treatment planning on a positron emission tomography/CT scanner. Four-dimensional CT images were binned into 10 equispaced phases. The exhale phase served as the reference phase, and images from the other nine phases were coregistered to the reference phase image using an intensity-based, automatic deformable image registration method. Then the coregistered images were combined to create a single, high-quality reconstructed CT image at exhale phase as the new reference for target delineation. The extent of image quality enhancement was quantified relative to the original CT by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio. Results: The soft tissue image contrast was noticeably better after deformable image registration than in the original scans. Signal-to-noise ratios inside the liver region of interest increased for all patients by a factor of 3.0 (range, 2.3-3.7). The improvement in image quality was not linearly proportionate to the number of images averaged. Using only 6 phases can achieve at least 85% of the contrast enhancement that can be achieved using all 10 phases. We also found that contrast enhancement was inversely proportional to the original image quality (p = 0.006), and the contrast enhancement is attained with little loss of spatial resolution. Conclusions: This deformable image registration method is feasible to improve soft-tissue image quality in 4D CT images. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

With the expanded GREET model, we examined the well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of sugarcane-derived ethanol produced in Brazil and used to fuel light-duty vehicles in the United States. Results for sugarcane ethanol were compared with those for petroleum gasoline. The sugarcane-to-ethanol pathway evaluated in the GREET model comprises fertilizer production, sugarcane farming, sugarcane transportation, and sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil; ethanol transportation to U.S. ports and then to U.S. refueling stations; and ethanol use in vehicles. Our analysis shows that sugarcane ethanol can reduce GHG emissions by 78% and fossil energy use by 97%, relative to petroleum gasoline. The large reductions can be attributed to the use of bagasse in sugarcane mills, among other factors. To address the uncertainties involved in key input parameters, we developed and examined several sensitivity cases to test the effect of key parameters on WTW results for sugarcane ethanol. Of the total GHG emissions associated with sugarcane ethanol, the five major contributors are open-field burning of sugarcane tops and leaves, N2O emissions from sugarcane fields, fertilizer production, sugarcane mill operation, and sugarcane farming. Brazil is going to phase out open-field burning in the future. This action will certainly help further reduce GHG emissions of sugarcane farming, together with reductions in emissions of criteria pollutants such as NOx and particulate matter with diameters smaller than 10 microns. The eventual elimination of open-field burning in sugarcane plantations will result in additional GHG emission reductions by sugarcane ethanol of up to 9 percentage points.","Greenhouse gases; Life-cycle analysis; Sugarcane ethanol; Well-to-wheels analysis","Argonne National Laboratory; Fertilizer production; Life cycle analysis; Light duty vehicles; Particulate Matter; Regulated emissions; Sugarcane farmings; Well-to-wheels analysis; Computer simulation; Emission control; Ethanol; Fertilizers; Gasoline; Life cycle; Wheels; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749145384

Comparisons between simulations and measurements at three sites (industrial, urban and rural) were satisfactory. The synoptic weather chart indicated that prevailing winds were northwest (spring), north (autumn), and northeasterly (winter). Meteorological conditions suggest that PM10 typically accumulated and triggered a pollution episode on days with high surface pressure and low winds. Estimations using the TAPM model suggest that point-source emissions were the predominant contributors (about 49.1%) to PM10 concentrations at Hsiung-Kong site industrial site in Kaohsiung City, followed by area sources (approximately 35.0%) and transport from neighboring areas (7.8%). Because Pingtung City (urban) and Chao-Chou town (rural) are located downwind of Kaohsiung City when north or northeasterly winds prevail, the two sites also experience severe pollution events despite the lack of industrial sources; transport from neighboring areas contributed roughly 39.1% to PM10 concentrations at Pingtung site and 48.7% at Chao-Chou site. Since traffic emissions contributed little (around 8%) to PM10 concentrations at the three sites, reducing PM10 emissions from industrial sources in Kaohsiung City should be an effective way of improving air quality for Kaohsiung City and downwind areas such as Pingtung County.","Air pollution modeling; Meteorological condition; Particulate matter; PM10; Source contribution; TAPM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849143921

Plants tolerant to high concentrations of landfill gas (LFG) may play an important role in improving methane oxidation within landfill cover soil and reducing emission of methane, a greenhouse gas, from it. In this study, the effect of an LFG tolerant plant Chenopodium album L. on methane oxidation activity (MOA) and bacterial community composition in landfill cover soil was investigated. Soil samples from four simulated lysimeters with and without LFG and plant vegetation were taken at 4 stages during the plant's development cycle. Results showed that the total number of culturable bacteria in soil could be significantly increased (P < 0.05) by the growth of C. album. The total number of methanotrophs and MOA in soils with LFG was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in soils without LFG on sampling days 90, 150 and 210. The total number of methanotrophs and MOA in lysimeters with LFG added increased in the presence of C. album when the plant entered the seed setting stage. Polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) gel patterns of 16S rDNA gene fragment and band sequencing analyses showed apparent differences in soil bacterial communities in the presence of LFG and plant vegetation. Members of the genus Methylosarcina were found to be the active and dominant methanotrophs in rhizosphere soil of C. album with LFG, while Methylococcus, Methylocystis, and Methylosinus were the primary methanotroph genera in LFG soil without C. album. Thus, C. album appears to select for specific methanotrophic bacteria in the presence of LFG.

Although the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is not a new idea, commercial anaerobic digestion processes are often operated at well below their optimal performance due to a variety of factors. This paper reviews current optimisation techniques associated with anaerobic digestion and suggests possible areas where improvements could be made, including the basic design considerations of a single or multi-stage reactor configuration, the type, power and duration of the mixing regime and the retention of active microbial biomass within the reactor. Optimisation of environmental conditions within the digester such as temperature, pH, buffering capacity and fatty acid concentrations is also discussed. The methane-producing potential of various agriculturally sourced feedstocks has been examined, as has the advantages of co-digestion to improve carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and the use of pre-treatments and additives to improve hydrolysis rates or supplement essential nutrients which may be limiting. However, perhaps the greatest shortfall in biogas production is the lack of reliable sensory equipment to monitor key parameters and suitable, parallelised control systems to ensure that the process continually operates at optimal performance. Modern techniques such as software sensors and powerful, flexible controllers are capable of solving these problems.

In addition to changes in ambient PM2.5, an opportunity was provided to evaluate the changes in indoor air quality when old stoves were replaced with US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-certified woodstoves. PM2.5 samples were measured in 16 homes prior to and following the changeout. For each sampling event, PM2.5 mass was continuously measured throughout the 24-h sampling periods, and organic/elemental carbon (OC/EC) and associated chemical markers of woodsmoke were measured from quartz filters. Results showed that average PM2.5 concentrations and maximum PM2.5 concentrations were reduced by 71% and 76%, respectively (as measured by TSI DustTraks). Levoglucosan was reduced by 45% following the introduction of the new woodstove. However, the concentrations of resin acids, natural chemicals found in the bark of wood, were increased following the introduction of the new woodstove. There were no discernible trends in methoxphenol levels, likely due to the semi-volatile nature of the species that were measured. Although there is some uncertainty in this study regarding the amount of ambient PM infiltration to the indoor environment, these findings demonstrated a large impact on indoor air quality following this intervention. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2008.","Asthma; Indoor air quality; Intervention; Libby; Montana; Woodsmoke; Woodstove","carbon; organic compound; air pollutant; article; asthma; chemically induced disorder; chemistry; cooking; environmental monitoring; filtration; fire; government; health; heating; housing; human; indoor air pollution; instrumentation; methodology; particle size; particulate matter; smoke; uncertainty; United States; wood; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Asthma; Carbon; Cooking; Environmental Monitoring; Filtration; Fires; Heating; Housing; Humans; Organic Chemicals; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Smoke; Uncertainty; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Urban Health; Wood",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849157744

Total gas content (generally excluding residual gas) of the coal beds ranges from less than 0.37 cm3/g (as-analyzed or raw basis; 1.2 cm3/g, dry, ash free basis, daf) at depths less than 400 m, to greater than 7.3 cm3/g (as-analyzed basis; 8.76 cm3/g, daf) in deeper (&gt; 1,500 m) parts of the basin. About 20 Wilcox coal-gas wells in northern Louisiana produce from 200 to 6485 m3 of gas/day and cumulative gas production from these wells is approximately 25 million m3 (as of December, 2006). U.S. Geological Survey assessment of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas resources in the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain, including northern and south-central Mississippi, indicates that coal beds of the Wilcox Group contain an estimated mean total 109.3 million m3 (3.86 trillion ft3) of producible natural gas. To determine the origin of the Wilcox Group coal gases in northern Louisiana, samples of gas, water, and oil were collected from Wilcox coal and sandstone reservoirs and from under- and overlying Late Cretaceous and Eocene carbonate and sandstone reservoirs. Isotopic data from Wilcox coal-gas samples have an average δ13CCH4 value of - 62.6‰ VPDB (relative to Vienna Peedee Belemnite) and an average δDCH4 value of - 199.9‰ VSMOW (relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). Values of δ13CCO2 range from - 25.4 to 3.42‰ VPDB. Produced Wilcox saline water collected from oil, conventional gas, and coalbed gas wells have δDH2O values that range from - 27.3 to - 18.0‰ VSMOW. These data suggest that the coal gases primarily are generated in saline formation water by bacterial reduction of CO2. Shallow (&lt; 150 m) Wilcox coal beds containing freshwater have little or no biogenic gas. Molecular and isotopic analyses of gas samples collected from conventional gas and oil wells suggests that both biogenic and thermogenic gases are present in and adjacent to the Wilcox intervals that contain biogenic coal gases. Oil, probably sourced from thermally mature, down-structural-dip parts of the Wilcox Group, is produced from sandstones within the coal-bearing interval. Gas chromatograms of C10+ saturated hydrocarbons from Wilcox oils show a depletion of n-alkanes probably resulting from biodegradation of the oil. Isotopic composition of the gases associated with the oils is of mixed themogenic and biogenic origin (average δ13CCH4 = - 44.4‰ VPDB, and average δDCH4 = - 182.4‰ VSMOW).","Coalbed gas; Gulf of Mexico Basin; Methanogenesis; Wilcox Group","Coal beds; Coalbed gas; Gulf of Mexico Basin; Methanogenesis; Wilcox Group; Bituminous coal; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Gases; Geological surveys; Petroleum engineering; Coal gas; bituminous coal; coal production; coal seam; coalbed methane; Cretaceous; Eocene; isotopic composition; methanogenesis; sandstone; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Louisiana; Mississippi; North America; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms); Belemnoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249085398

We determined CH4 concentration in 216 groundwaters used for agriculture in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, and analyzed the spatial and seasonal variations. The percentage of CH4-detected samples and mean CH4 concentration were high in deltaic regions, 88% and 239 μmol L-1(n = 24) or 69% and 166 μmol L-1 (n = 49), low in alluvial fan (0%; n = 12) and mountainous area (35% and 11.7 μmol L-1(n = 22)). Methane was more frequently detected in groundwater with &gt;50 m depth (84%; n = 37). Mean CH4 concentration for CH4-detected samples from &gt;50 m depth was also higher than those from &lt;5 m depth, 248 versus 60.2 μmol L-1. Among groundwater samples with &lt;5 m depth, the probability of CH4 detection was higher under paddy fields. Seasonal variations in the concentration and stable C isotopic ratio of CH4 (δ 13CC H4; -65 to -89‰) were generally small in monitored groundwaters with 4-180 m depth, suggesting that CH4 produced mainly by CO2 reduction was preserved through a year. There were also shallow groundwaters (&lt;5 m depth) showing adverse seasonal changes in CH4 concentration and δ 13CC H4 (up to 20‰). Such shallow groundwaters showed significant CH4 production in a 90-day incubation with maximum rates of 3.03-6.43 nmol day-1. Acetoclastic methanogens were generally absent, while an addition of glucose and especially CO2/H2 enhanced methanogenesis. CH4 oxidizing potential was also observed in an aerobic incubation. These results suggested that the production/oxidation of CH4 in situ or at the source was responsible for the seasonal variations in CH4 concentration. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The carbonates contain 230Th, part of which is located in detritus such as silicate and organics, at the time of precipitation. The initial 230Th renders accurate dating with U-Th radioactive disequilibrium method difficult. We assessed the feasibility of correction using radioactive disequilibrium data of ambient sediment to overcome this difficulty. A (230Th/232Th)-(234U/232Th) isochron drawn by three chips divided from a carbonate nodule (PC05-04-50) passed through data points of local sediments. We conclude that the problem of initial 230Th can be resolved by measurements of local sediments. Results show that carbonate nodules include local sediment as impurities. Furthermore, the results of trace element analyses such as Rb, Zr, Nb, REE, Pb, and Th also support the idea. In all, 18 carbonate samples were dated with correction of initial 230Th using the mean value of local sediment in this study. The U-Th correction ages show 12-35ka with an isochron age of 26 ± 3ka. Results indicate that during the time interval of U-Th ages, from 12ka to 35ka, environmental conditions must have been favorable for enhanced methane flux through sediment. The extensive methane flow period at 20ka accords with the lowest-stand sea level during the last glacial age. Results of this study also suggest that U-Th ages of carbonate are useful as a reliable chronometer with regard to methane seep activation. In order to acquire U-Th ages of carbonate at methane seep sites, however, it is important to evaluate the amount of initial 230Th accurately using the value of sediment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Few models include both variables despite that it is recognised that both factors are important predictors of species distributions. Therefore, models that use both factors as independent input variables would be expected to be more accurate than those that are based on any factor alone. This study compares the accuracy of a range of multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) modelling approaches for modelling the global distribution of six insect species using various combinations of abiotic and biotic factors considered to influence insect species establishment. As well as individual MLP, the modelling approaches included ensemble and cascaded networks. The biotic factors were represented by regional host plant and insect species assemblages, and abiotic factors were represented by a range of climatic variables. While no single model was found to be superior for all species, in general, ensembles of models and the combination of biotic and abiotic factors, particularly in cascaded MLP, gave improved prediction accuracy. Interestingly, sensitivity and contribution analyses showed that the presence or absence of other insect species, represented by the regional insect assemblage, was the best predictor of target species distribution compared with climate and/or host plant assemblage. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The private law model views the court's role as the adjudicator of individual rights and conditions access to the court on a party's showing of a discrete injury at the hands of another party. The opposing public law model favors congressional power to create causes of action that confer standing without requiring a showing of differentiated injury, and conceives of the judiciary's role as integral to ensuring executive compliance with the law. Many commentators view Massachusetts v. EPA, a recent Supreme Court decision addressing global climate change, as liberalizing standing doctrine and as a significant victory for the public law model of adjudication. This Note departs from this commentary by arguing that, on the whole, the standing theory advanced in Massachusetts places the case within the Court's trend towards a more restrictive interpretation of the case-and-controversy requirement. This Note first analyzes the Massachusetts opinion, the history of state standing doctrine, and subsequent judicial treatment of the decision, in order to show that the Court's standing decision is based on a finding of injury to Massachusetts' governing interest: the ability of Massachusetts to regulate a harm that threatens the Commonwealth's territorial integrity. The Note then argues that this ""regulatory interest theory"" creates a standing regime that may be a variation of the public law model, but one that is potentially highly restrictive of both state and individual standing. In fact, the regulatory interest theory may create a standing regime where state attorneys general have monopoly power over public law adjudication, a possibility that threatens both core public and private law model values. This Note concludes that a positivist approach to standing that predicates state and citizen standing on positive statutory enactment provides a relatively straightforward, far more workable approach to the case-and-controversy requirement.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749202234

Temperatures in boreal regions are predicted to increase during the twenty-first century which may accelerate changes in soil microbial processes and plant community dynamics. In particular, climate-driven changes in plant community composition might affect the pathways and rates of methanogenesis, the plant-mediated emission of methane, and the scavenging of methane by methanotrophic bacteria. Climate change may also affect methane cycling through changes in pore water chemistry. To date, these feedbacks have not been incorporated into the carbon cycling components of climate models. We investigated the effects of soil warming and water table manipulations on methane cycling in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota, USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and fen received infrared warming treatments crossed with water table treatments for 6 years. In years 5 and 6, concentrations, fluxes, and isotopic compositions of methane were measured along with aboveground and belowground net primary productivity and pore water concentrations of acetate, sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon. Water table level was the dominant control over methane flux in the fen mesocosms, likely through its effect on methane oxidation rates. However, pore water chemistry and plant productivity were important secondary factors in explaining methane flux in the fen mesocosms, and these factors appeared to be the predominant controls over methane flux in the bog mesocosms. The water table and IR treatments had large effects on pore water chemistry and plant productivity, so the indirect effects of climate change appear to be just as important as the direct effects of changing temperature and water table level in controlling future methane fluxes from northern peatlands. Pore water sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and acetate had a relatively consistent negative relationship with methane emissions, pore water DOC had a positive relationship with methane emissions, and BNPP had mixed effects. The bog mesocosms had much higher methane emissions and pore water methane concentrations than the fen mesocosms, despite a much lower average water table level and peat that is a poor substrate for methanogenesis. We suggest that the relatively high methane fluxes in the bog mesocosms can be explained through their low concentrations of inhibitory pore water compounds, high concentrations of DOC, and high plant productivity. Stable isotopic data from pore water support acetate fermentation as the principal pathway of methanogenesis in bog mesocosms (mean δ13CH4 = -41.0‰, mean δD-CH4 = -190‰ ). Fen mesocosms had lower pore water concentrations and emissions of methane than bog mesocosms, despite much higher methane production potentials in fen peat. The methane from the fen mesocosms was isotopically heavy (mean δ13CH 4 = -28.9‰, mean δD-CH4 = -140‰), suggesting a strong oxidative sink. This is likely related to the dominance of graminoid vegetation and the associated oxygen transport into the rhizosphere. Our results illustrate the need for a more robust understanding of the multiple feedbacks between climate forcing and plant and microbial feedbacks in the response of northern peatlands to climate change.

Neither has so far committed to quantitative emissions limits. Some argue that China cannot be engaged on the basis of its national interest in climate policy, on the ground that China's national net benefits of limiting greenhouse gas emissions would be negative, as a result of significant GHG abatement costs and potential net gains to China from a warmer world. This premise has led some observers to advocate other approaches to engaging China, such as appeal to moral obligation. This Article argues that appeal to national net benefits is still the best approach to engage China. First, appealing to China's asserted moral obligation to limit its GHG emissions may be ineffective or even counterproductive. Even if climate change is a moral issue for American leaders, framing the issue that way may not be persuasive to Chinese leaders. Second, the concern that China's rational net benefits of climate policy are negative is based on older forecasts of costs and benefits. More recent climate science, of which the Chinese leadership is aware, indicates higher damages to China from climate change and thus greater net benefits to China from climate policy. Third, he public health co-benefits of reducing other air pollutants along with GHGs may make GHG emissions limits look more attractive to China. Fourth, the distribution of climate impacts within China may be as important as the net aggregate: climate change may exacerbate political and social stresses within China, which the leadership may seek to avoid in order to maintain political stability. Fifth, the costs of abatement may decline as innovation in China accelerates. Sixth, as China becomes a great power in world politics, and as climate change affects China's allies, leadership on climate policy may look more favorable to China's elites. Seventh, the design of the international climate treaty regime itself can offer positive incentives to China. Taken together, these factors point to a potential and even ongoing shift in Chinese climate policy. They illustrate how the international law and politics of climate change depend on domestic politics and institutions. And they suggest that the United States, if it too takes effective action, can make the case for enlightened pragmatism as a basis to engage China in a cooperative global climate policy regime.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349172316

This study aimed at parameterizing the carbon sink capacity of well-developed BSC in undisturbed steppe systems.

The analysis of CO2 fluxes and water inputs from the various sources showed that the bulk of BSC-related CO2 deposition occurs during periods with frequent rain events and subsequent condensation from water accumulated in the upper soil layers. Significant BSC activity on days without detectable atmospheric water supply emphasized the importance of high soil moisture contents as additional water source for soil-dwelling BSC, whereas activity upon dew formation at low soil water contents was not of major importance for BSC-related CO2 deposition.

P, however, remains adsorbed to Al(OH)3(S) regardless of redox conditions. During chronic or episodic acidification of a catchment, ionic Al is mobilized from soils to receiving waters. A fraction of the mobilized Al may precipitate as a consequence of higher pH of the receiving waters. We hypothesized that phosphorus retention in lake sediments is directly related to the magnitude of Al loading in response to low pH in the watershed. We studied cores representing over 200 years of sediment accumulation in historically acidic Mud Pond and Little Long Pond in eastern Maine, USA. Sequential chemical extractions of sediment were used to assess the history of Al, Fe, and P interactions. Mud Pond is a first-order pond with a pH of ~ 4.7, having acidified slightly in response to anthropogenic acidification from ~ 1930. The inlet stream to Mud Pond has dissolved Al concentrations often exceeding 500 μg/L, of which more than half is organically-bound. Mud Pond drains into Little Long Pond, a second-order pond with a historical pH of &lt; 6, and which has shown little pH or alkalinity response to increases or decreases in atmospheric SO42- input. Sequential extractions show that Al and P are predominantly in the 0.1 M NaOH-extractable fraction in the sediments from both ponds throughout the cores. The concentration of the likely biogenic and non-reactive P within the NaOH fraction increases up core from &lt; 30% to ~ 60%.

During stress and in senescing leaves, sugars often accumulate. In addition, both sugar accumulation and stress can induce leaf senescence. Infection by bacterial and fungal pathogens and attack by herbivores and gall-forming insects may influence leaf senescence via modulation of the sugar status, either by directly affecting primary carbon metabolism or by regulating steady state levels of plant hormones. Many types of biotic interactions involve the induction of extracellular invertase as the key enzyme of an apoplasmic phloem unloading pathway, resulting in a sourcesink transition and an increased hexose/sucrose ratio. Induction of the levels of the phytohormones ethylene and jasmonate in biotic interactions results in accelerated senescence, whereas an increase in plant- or pathogen-derived cytokinins delays senescence and results in the formation of green islands within senescing leaves. Interactions between sugar and hormone signalling also play a role in response to abiotic stress. For example, interactions between sugar and abscisic acid (ABA) signalling may be responsible for the induction of senescence during drought stress. Cold treatment, on the other hand, can result in delayed senescence, despite sugar and ABA accumulation. Moreover, natural variation can be found in senescence regulation by sugars and in response to stress: in response to drought stress, both drought escape and dehydration avoidance strategies have been described in different Arabidopsis accessions. The regulation of senescence by sugars may be key to these different strategies in response to stress. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Arabidopsis; Natural variation; Pathogen; Phytohormones; Senescence; Stress; Sugar signalling","abscisic acid; bacterial disease; carbon; dehydration; dicotyledon; drought stress; environmental stress; enzyme activity; fungal disease; hormone; leaf; metabolism; pathogen; phloem; senescence; sugar; Arabidopsis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hexapoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47649120869

Thus, it is no wonder in the time of high SO2 pollution, e.g., in the town of Herne (centre of the Ruhr district), that there was not a single beech forest hosting, for instance, Viola reichenbachiana or Anemone nemorosa. As air quality has improved very much over some decades in the Ruhr district, one can expect a recolonisation of the beech forests by the species of former time characteristic for the herb layer. However, one has to consider that only the air pollution was reduced, while soil acidification and contamination with heavy metals and PAH are, on the short run, irreversible. That is why experiments were carried out, considering the question as to whether recolonisation of the forests of the Ruhr district by the aforementioned species is possible and why such a recolonisation up to now has not occurred. Materials and methods: The experiments were carried out in a beech forest situated in the centre of the Ruhr district in the City of Herne. The wood anemone (A. nemorosa) was chosen as test plant because of its high frequency in beech forests on loess soils outside the Ruhr district, and its absence in beech forests in the Ruhr district. The experiments with A. nemorosa were carried out in three variants with different soils: (a): soil of the local forests (R); (b): soil of the local forests whose soot layer was removed (r); (c): imported soil from a clean air region far away from the Ruhr district (Odenwald). Results: Survival of rhizomes of A. nemorosa is possible for some years in the soils of the Ruhr district; however, the establishment of a population could not be achieved. The results obtained by the imported soil show that it is no longer air pollution, but the soil which prevents the establishment of a population. Sexual reproduction is rather impossible because of the thick litter layer with which all of the Ruhr district's beech forests are covered. Discussion: With respect to the unfavourable chemistry of the soil of the Ruhr district and in consideration of the unfavourable attributes of the soot layer, the author expected the following order of the development of shoot numbers: O&gt;r&gt;R. However, the result is: O&gt;R&gt;r. In contrast to the expected result, the soot layer has no negative but slightly positive effects on the implanted rhizomes. A possible explanation is that the soot layer, which is situated immediately below the top soil, prevents the top soil from drying up and thus even protects the rhizomes from desiccation. Also, the possibility has to be considered that the soot layer functions as a nutrient storage area. Conclusions: At present, a survival of the rhizomes of A. nemorosa in the soils of the Ruhr district is temporarily possible but does not lead to the establishment of a permanent population. This only can be achieved by additional sexual reproduction. However, the thick litter layer present in all beech forests of the Ruhr district prevents the establishment of seedlings, i.e., it does not allow sexual reproduction to contribute to the population. The soot layer situated below the litter layer represents a second hindrance for germination. Other than seedlings, rhizomes are not negatively affected by the soot layer but even a slight stabilisation has to be stated. As a reason for this slightly positive effect, a protection of the upper mineral soil from desiccation by the hydrophob soot layer has to be considered. Secondly, the soot layer may serve as a nutrient storage which is of particular importance in acid soils, because acidification generally leads to a leeching of nutrients. To answer these questions, detailed further research is necessary. Recommendations and perspectives: In order to restore the formerly rich herbaceous layer of the forests of the Ruhr district, experiments (removal of the litter layer; liming; ploughing) should be carried out at broad-scale to solve the question of how the strong negative effects of the established thick raw humus layer can be reduced or even be avoided. When the problem of the humus layer is solved, the beech forests of the Ruhr district today highly impoverished in species will become a vivid ecosystem, rich in flowering herbaceous species and thus much more attractive for the people of the Ruhr district than at present. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Anemone nemorosa; Beech forests; Implantation experiments; Long-term observations; Recolonisation; Ruhr district; Soot layer","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); contaminated land; forest; fumigation; leaching; nutrient; plant; recolonization; rhizome; sexual reproduction; soot; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; Anemone; article; beech; ecosystem; environmental protection; Germany; methodology; physiology; tree; Air Pollution; Anemone; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fagus; Germany; Trees; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Herne; North Rhine-Westphalia; Odenwald; Ruhr; Anemone; Anemone nemorosa; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Viola reichenbachiana; Violaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349106451

Biogas production functions of high-strength organic wastes are derived from data of implemented methane fermentation systems. The distributions of organic wastes from sewage, household, wholesale/retail, manufacturing, farming, and livestock activities in the Tokyo Bay region are calibrated into a disaggregated spatial database by compiling general activity statistics and emission intensity parameters using Geographic Information System (GIS). Three scenarios of organic matter circulation by co-digestion in sewage treatment plants (STPs) are designed and assessed. Surplus electricity and heat from methane fermentation systems are used for STP operations and household demand. The spatial database allows a preliminary examination for the suitability of locations for technology implementation from the aspects of bioenergy supply and balance. The results show that an additional 368,000-1,328,000 MW of electricity would be generated, and 1300-3600 TJ of heat could be used by households, reducing the annual emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels by 307,000-798,000 t. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The ventilation demand is primarily related to the occupant load. In this study, the ventilation demands due to occupant load variations and occupant acceptability were examined against certain IAQ objectives using the mass balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in an air-conditioned office. In particular, this study proposed a ventilation model for the consideration of the occupant load variations and occupant acceptability based on the regional survey of typical offices (422 samples) in Hong Kong. The model was applied to evaluate the relative energy performance of different IAQ objectives in ventilation systems for typical office buildings in Hong Kong. The results showed that the energy consumption of a ventilation system would be correlated with the occupant load and acceptability in the air-conditioned office. Indicative CO2 levels of 800 ppmv, 1000 ppmv and 1200 ppmv corresponding to 83%, 97% and 99.7% survey samples were shown, corresponding to the thermal energy consumptions of 1500 MJ m-2 yr-1, 960 MJ m-2 yr-1and 670 MJ m-2 yr-1, respectively. In regards to the monetary issue, an annual value of HK$ 762 million per year in electrical consumption could be saved in all office buildings in Hong Kong when the indoor target CO2 concentration is increased from 1000 ppmv to 1200 ppmv. To achieve an excellent IAQ following the existing design standard, i.e. to decrease the CO2 level from 1000 ppmv to 800 ppmv, 56% additional energy would be consumed, corresponding to an annual value of HK$ 1,419 million, even though the occupant acceptability is only improved from 81% to 86%. The development of the models in this study would be useful for the energy performance evaluation of ventilation systems in air-conditioned offices.

The climate problem is compounded in so-called Urban Heat Islands, urban areas where the air can be 3-5°C hotter than its surrounding areas and where pollution levels are consequently raised. Including a colour section with thermal images and maps, this book explores the complex relationships between climate, buildings and plants, especially in urban heat islands. These relationships bear very critically on a range of environmental issues and point to some corresponding solutions. One chapter highlights some of the extensive research work carried out in Singapore, especially investigating the thermal benefits of greenery in buildings in the urban setting. Though several books have been written on urban heat islands, this work uniquely examines the linkages between climate, buildings and plants. It forms a reference for researchers and professionals such as architects, architectural science, landscape architects, building services engineers, urban planners and urban climatologists. It may also be useful for final year undergraduates or graduate students in these disciplines. © 2009 Nyuk Hien Wong and Yu Chen.

An approach that integrates the impact of both the current regulations and the longer-term national and global trends is developed to construct an emissions inventory (EI) for North America for the mid-century in support of a regional modeling study of ozone and particulate matter (PM) less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Because the time horizon of such a distant projection is beyond that of EIs used in typical modeling studies, it is necessary to identify a practical approach that allows the emission projections to account for emission controls and climatic and energy-use changes. However, a technical challenge arises because this requires integration of various different types of information with which emissions from human activities are associated. Often, emission information in global models has less detail and uses coarser spatiotemporal resolution. The method developed here is based on data availability, spatiotemporal coverage and resolution, and future-scenario consistency (i.e., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios [IPCC SRES] A1B), and consists of two major steps: (1) near-future EI projection (to the year 2020), and (2) longer-term EI projection (to mid-century). The first step is based closely on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Interstate Rule EI, the Environment Canada EI, as well estimates of Mexico's EI; whereas the second step follows approaches proposed by the EI from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE), developed by Netherlands's National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). For the United States, the year-2050 emissions for nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), PM2,5, anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ammonia are projected to change by -55, -55, -30, -40, and +20%, respectively, compared with 2001. NOx and SO2 emission changes are very similar in total amount but different in sectoral contribution. The projected emission trends for Canada and Mexico differ considerably. After taking into account the modeled climate changes, biogenic VOC emission increases from three countries overwhelm the decreases in anthropogenic VOC emissions, leading to a net small increase (∼2%) in overall VOC emissions.

The vector mesons were detected with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) via their decays to e+e-. The rare leptonic decay was chosen to reduce final-state interactions. A combinatorial background was subtracted from the invariant mass spectra using a well-established event-mixing technique. The ρ-meson mass spectrum was extracted after the ω and signals were removed in a nearly model-independent way. Comparisons were made between the ρ mass spectra from the heavy targets (A>2) with the mass spectrum extracted from the deuterium target. With respect to the ρ-meson mass, we obtain a small shift compatible with zero. Also, we measure widths consistent with standard nuclear many-body effects such as collisional broadening and Fermi motion. © 2008 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47149118774

This paper describes how the usage of energy in a UK home results from a complex interaction between built form, location, energy-using equipment, occupants and the affordability of fuel. Current models with standard occupancy predict that energy use will be strongly related to size and built form, but surveys of real homes show only weak correlations, across all types of dwelling. Recent research has given us insights into occupancy factors including preferred comfort, 'take-back' from thermal efficiency improvements, and patterns of electricity use. Space heating is on a downward trend and is low in new dwellings. Energy use for lights and appliances, which is only weakly related to built form, is increasing. Strong legislation, combined with low-carbon technologies, will be needed to counteract this trend. Future challenges discussed include increases in real energy prices and climate change mitigation efforts, which are likely to improve the existing stock. Challenging targets are now in place for new housing to move towards low or zero energy and carbon standards. In the longer term, dwellings will demand less energy. Alternatives to gas for space heating will be increasingly common, including ground source heat and local combined heat and power (CHP) from biomass, while electricity could come from a more decarbonised electricity system. However, these improvements must be set alongside a demand for many new homes, demographic trends towards smaller households, and a more holistic approach to overall carbon use including personal transport. © 2008 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","Domestic energy; Lighting; Space heating","Apartment houses; Biomass; Buildings; Carbon; Climate change; Climatology; Cogeneration plants; Electric power systems; Electricity; Housing; Lighting; Renewable energy resources; Space heating; Thermography (temperature measurement); Water; Carbon technologies; Climate change mitigations; Combined Heat and powers; Complex interactions; Current models; Demographic trends; Domestic energy; Electricity systems; Electricity uses; Energy prices; Energy uses; Future challenges; Ground source heats; Holistic approaches; Hot waters; Power appliances; Thermal efficiencies; Weak correlations; Zero energies; Heating; carbon emission; climate change; energy policy; energy use; household energy; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55249087379

The first approach combined the plume's peak location information reconstructed from the Smooth Basis Function Minimization (SBFM) algorithm and the wind direction data to calculate source projection lines. In the second approach, the plume's peak location was determined with the Monte Carlo methodology by randomly sampling within the beam segment having the largest path-integrated concentration. We first conducted a series of simulation studies to investigate the sensitivity of using different basis functions in the SBFM algorithm. It was found that fitting with the beta and Weibull basis functions generally gave better estimates of the peak locations than with the normal basis function when the plumes were mainly within the OP-FTIR's monitoring line. However, for plumes that were symmetric to the peak position or spread over the OP-FTIR, fitting with the normal basis function gave better performance. In the field experiment, two tracer gases were released simultaneously from two locations and the OP-FTIR collected data downwind from the sources with a maximum beam path length of 97 m. For the first approach, the release locations were within the 0.25- to 0.5-probability area only after the uncertainty of the peak locations was included in the calculation process. The second approach was easy to implement and still performed as satisfactorily as the first approach. The distances from the sources to the best-fit lines (i.e., the regression lines) of the estimated locations were smaller than 10 m.

The increasing atmospheric CO2 and subsequent rise of pCO2 in seawater, which alters the carbonate system and related chemical reactions and results in lower pH and higher HCO3 - concentration, affect photosynthetic CO2 fixation processes of phytoplanktonic and macroalgal species in direct and/or indirect ways. Although many unicellular and multicellular species can operate CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) to utilize the large HCO3 - pool in seawater, enriched CO2 up to several times the present atmospheric level has been shown to enhance photosynthesis and growth of both phytoplanktonic and macro-species that have less capacity of CCMs. Even for species that operate active CCMs and those whose photosynthesis is not limited by CO2 in seawater, increased CO2 levels can down-regulate their CCMs and therefore enhance their growth under light-limiting conditions (at higher CO2 levels, less light energy is required to drive CCM). Altered physiological performances under high-CO2 conditions may cause genetic alteration in view of adaptation over long time scale. Marine algae may adapt to a high CO2 oceanic environment so that the evolved communities in future are likely to be genetically different from the contemporary communities. However, most of the previous studies have been carried out under indoor conditions without considering the acidifying effects on seawater by increased CO2 and other interacting environmental factors, and little has been documented so far to explain how physiology of marine primary producers performs in a high-CO2 and low-pH ocean. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","CO2; Growth; Macroalgae; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton","carbon dioxide; sea water; alga; article; atmosphere; chemistry; environment; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; phytoplankton; sea; Algae; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Environment; Oceans and Seas; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Seawater; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149203593

The IRMPD spectra of the protonated species are recorded using the combination of a free-electron laser (FEL) and an electrospray-ion-trap mass spectrometer. The structures of different possible isomers of these protonated species are optimized at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d, p) level of theory and the IR spectra calculated using the same computational method. For every amino acid studied herein, the current results indicate that a proton is bound to the α-amino nitrogen, except for lysine, in which the protonation site is the amino nitrogen in the side chain. According to the calculated and experimental IRMPD results, the structures of the protonated amino acids may be assigned unambiguously. For Gly, Ala, and Pro, in each of the most stable isomers the protonated amino group forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the adjacent carbonyl oxygen. In the case of Gly, the isomer containing a proton bound to the carbonyl oxygen is theoretically possible. However, it does not exist under the experimental conditions because it has a significantly higher energy (i.e. 26.6 kcal mol-1) relative to the most stable Isomer. For Ser and Phe, the protonated amino group forms two intramolecular hydrogen bonds with both the adjacent carbonyl oxygen and the side-chain group in each of the most stable isomers. In protonated lysine, the protonated amino group in the side chain forms two hydrogen bonds with the a-amino nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen, which is a cyclic structure. Interestingly, for protonated lysine the zwitterionic structure is a local minimum energy isomer, but the experimental spectrum indicates that it does not exist under the experimental conditions. This is consistent with the fact that the zwitterionic isomer is 9.2 kcal mol-1 higher in free energy at 298 K than the most stable Isomer. The carbonyl stretching vibration in the range of 1760-1800 cm-1 is especially sensitive to the structural change. In addition, IRMPD mechanisms for the protonated amino acids are also investigated. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Ultraviolet and visible Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, and N2O decomposition at 523 K were used to investigate the effect of extra-framework Ga on the nature of the Fe species in Fe/Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts. Introducing extra-framework Ga and high-temperature treatment can significantly affect the distribution even the nature of the Fe species in Fe/Ga-ZSM-5. For the high-temperature treated catalysts, the presence of extra-framework Ga remarkably increases the amount of the Fe(II) sites and the activity of direct N2O decomposition, suggesting that extra-framework Ga can promote the formation of the active sites for N2O decomposition. The possible interpretation of the beneficial role of extra-framework Ga is that extra-framework Ga facilitates the reduction of bi- and oligo-nuclear Fe(III) sites to form the Fe(II) sites and interacts with the Fe sites with low nuclearity to form a mixed Fe-Ga-O phase for the high-temperature treated catalysts. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To discuss further the relation between ancient plant diversity and paleoenvironment, it is considered that the plant diversity in the Heqing region lies on increase or decrease of vertical vegetational belts in mountains around the studied area and richness of components of these vegetational belts, and is controlled by amplitude of tectonic uplift of mountains and climatic changes. The high plant diversity during 2.729-2.608 Ma responded to the strong uplift of mountains at the stage, while the plant diversity greatly increased and its fluctuant amplitude and frequency markedly largened at about 1.176 Ma was obviously response to the Middle Pleistocene Transition. The plant diversity and its fluctuant amplitude and frequency increased further at about 0.991 Ma may be superposably affected by both the Middle Pleistocene Transition and the tectonic uplift.

Sulfation was observed to influence the properties of catalysts in two aspects: (i) modify the dispersion and electronic state of surface rhodium species and (ii) determine the surface NOy groups. Differences in surface nitrates and their behaviors lead to different mechanisms for CH4-SCR of NO. On Rh/Al2O3, the adsorbed monodentate nitrates (1558 cm-1) could react with methane in the absence of oxygen, while remaining almost inert to the mixture of methane and an excess amount of oxygen.

Moreover, a proportional relationship between NO conversion rates and intensities of nitrosyl (1936 cm-1) bands was found on Rh/Al 2O3/SO42-, and the rate-determining step of NO conversion was probably the reduction of nitrosyl. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Bidentate nitrates; Catalytic performances; Comparative studies; Different mechanisms; Excess oxygens; Monodentate; NO conversions; Reaction mechanisms; Selective catalytic reduction of NOx; Surface nitrates; Electronic states; Methane; Nitrates; Nitrogen compounds; Nonmetals; Oxygen; Rate constants; Reduction; Rhodium; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149100677

A case-crossover study was performed to assess the associations between daily air pollution and cardiorespiratory (International Classification of Disease Ninth Revision [ICD-9]: 390-519) hospitalizations before and after plant closure and to evaluate how closure influenced these associations. Methods: Air pollution data, climatic data, and cardiorespiratory hospitalizations among residents ages 65 years and older were obtained for the period of 1996 through 2000 for the study area. Data were analyzed using a case-crossover design and conditional logistical regression. Two distinct referent-sampling approaches were compared. Results: Significant associations were observed between the fourth quartile in PM10 and cardiorespiratory hospitalizations (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02-1.23) and cardiovascular hospitalizations only (ICD-9: 390-459) (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01-1.26) before the plant closure. After closure of the plant, PM10 was not significantly associated with cardiorespiratory or cardiovascular disease hospitalizations. Moreover, the referent sampling approaches did not greatly alter the estimations in the case-crossover analysis. Conclusions: Existing secondary data are an economical source to assess the impact of point source pollution on the environmental landscape. The findings suggest that closure of the steel coke plant was associated with a reduction risk of the cardiovascular hospitalizations.

Upon successively cooling the liquid sample from 28 °C, at which the sample assumes an isotropic state, to 26, 25, and 24 7deglC, the infrared external reflection spectra exhibited drastic changes, indicating changes in the orientation and conformation of surface species. At 26 °C, an irregular structure of n-C17H36, with a gauche conformation changes into a regular one with a mainly trans conformation, and simultaneously the symmetry axis of the terminal methyl group tilts away from the surface normal. At 25 °C, the hydrocarbon chain raises its axis to the direction of the surface normal, and the carbon skeleton plane inclines to the direction of the surface plane. At 24 °C (Ts), the molecular axis is raised further to the direction of the surface normal, and the surface species form a rotator phase at the surface. Thus, upon cooling from a temperature a few degrees above Ts, surface freezing of n-C 17H36 proceeds through discrete structural and orientation changes of the surface species, contrasting with the explanations of previous studies in terms of an abrupt structural change at the free surface occurring at Ts. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Free surfaces; Heptadecane; Infrared external reflection spectroscopy; Crystallography; Photoresists; Molecular structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749092644

We find that the nearly free-electron (NFE) state of the BNNT couples with the alkali atom states, giving rise to metallic states near the Fermi level. Unlike the cases of potassium-doped carbon nanotubes, not only the s but the d orbital state substantially takes part in the hybridization, and the resulting metallic states preserve the free-electron-like energy dispersion. Through first-principles electron dynamic simulations under applied fields, it is shown that the alkali-doped BNNT can generate an emission current 2 orders of magnitude larger than the carbon nanotube. The nodeless wave function at the Fermi level, together with the lowered work function, constitutes the major advantage of the alkali-doped BNNT in electron emission. We propose that the alkali-doped BNNT should be an excellent electron emitter in terms of the large emission current as well as its chemical and mechanical stability. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Alkali atoms; Applied fields; D orbitals; Electron dynamics; Electron emission properties; Electron emitters; Emission currents; Energy dispersions; Functional theories; Metallic states; Orders of magnitudes; Alkalinity; Boron; Boron nitride; Chemical stability; Density functional theory; Electron emission; Electronic structure; Electrons; Fermi level; Fermions; Functions; Mechanical stability; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Nitrides; Potassium; Wave functions; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049209874

By normalizing the N2O production curve and calculating the value of the area under the curve (AUC), visual differences in the time course of N2O production in the presence and absence of an C2H2 treatment were quantified in a series of experiments. The effects of liming and the addition of selected inorganic salts on the N2O-reducing activity of soil were analyzed. The average N2O/N2 + N2O ratio, which is the ratio of the AUC value in the absence and presence of C2H2, indicated that a declining pH and the addition of Cl- and Ca2+ resulted in the inhibition of the N2O-reducing activity, whereas liming (pH 6 using calcined lime, dolomite, charcoal, and ash of the charcoal) and SO42- and Mg2+ addition resulted in enhancing the N2O-reducing activity. Since the charcoal addition resulted in lowering the average N2O/N2 + N2O ratio despite the fact that charcoal contained larger amounts of Cl- and Ca2+ than SO42- and Mg2+, the alkalinity of the charcoal (pH 9.3) rather than the types of anions and cations may be the most significant factor in the stimulation of the N2O-reducing activity. In addition, we found a non-linear negative relationship between the average N2O/N2 + N2O ratios and the specific increasing rate constant of the N2O production curve. This result indicated that the application of a growth inhibitor of denitrifying communities into soil decreases the N2O-reducing activity of soil. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is observed that the conducting behavior is rectifying in the as-deposited state, whereas becomes ohmic upon annealing above 900 °C for 5 min in an Ar ambient, resulting in a typical specific contact resistance as low as 10 -4 Ω cm 2 range corresponding to a doping level of 2 × 10 18 cm -3 . The Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray diffraction analysis results indicate that platinum atoms migrate towards SiC to form platinum silicides in intimate contact with SiC substrate. While the C atoms released from the SiC interface interact with out-diffused Ta atoms to form TaC at the contact surface. The addition of Ta into the Pt metallization scheme serves to reduce the residual carbon left behind from SiC dissociation and Pt-silicides formation, thus could lead to improvement of the thermal and electrical stability.

The GMS granitoids are relatively low in silica, calc-alkaline, metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, and show characteristics of normal (oxidized) to reduced I-type granites depending on the properties of country rocks. They may have been derived from partial melting of lower crustal rocks triggered by underplated basaltic magmas; and country rocks bearing reduced organic carbon and/or graphite may have played an important role in the reduction of normal I-type intrusions to reduced I-type, which is essential in the formation of intrusion-related gold systems. In contrast, the GS granites, although calc-alkaline and metaluminous to peraluminous, are relatively rich in silica, incompatible elements, and high field strength elements. They are fractionated I-type granites, and are probably related to the coeval Mount Douglas granite in the Saint George batholith through fractional crystallization. Their parental magmas may have been derived from partial melting of quartzofeldspathic sources at relatively low temperatures. Both GMS and GS intrusions are orogenic, although some of them display the affinity of those emplaced into a within-plate environment. The origin of intrusion-related gold systems in this region appears to be controlled by several factors, including magma sources, magmatic processes, redox conditions (country-rock nature), and local structural regimes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of sprinkler irrigation on the emissions of 1,3-D to the atmosphere and is based on recent research that has shown that saturating the soil pore space reduces gas-phase diffusion and leads to reduced volatilization rates. Aerodynamic, integrated horizontal flux, and theoretical profile shape methods were used to estimate fumigant volatilization rates and total emission losses. These methods provide estimates of the volatilization rate based on measurements of wind speed, temperature, and 1,3-D concentration in the atmosphere. The volatilization rate was measured continuously for 16 days, and the daily peak volatilization rates for the three methods ranged from 18 to 60 μg m -2 s-1. The total 1,3-D mass entering the atmosphere was approximately 44-68 kg ha-1, or 10-15% of the applied active ingredient.

The purpose of this study was to use the Community Readiness Model to examine heal smoke-free policy development. Design, Setting, and Subjects. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used to assess 64 Kentucky communities. Dimensions of readiness included a community's knowledge of the problem and existing voluntary smoke-free policies; leadership for policy development; resources for policy development; climate surrounding policy development; existing voluntary policy efforts; and political climate for policy development. Dimension scores were summed to identify one of six overall readiness stages: (1) unawareness; (2) vague awareness; (3) preplanning; (4) preparation; (5) initiation; and (6) endorsement. Analyses. Correlations between dimensions and overall readiness scores were evaluated. One-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate regional trends, and multiple regression was used to assess the influence of sociodemographic/political variables on policy readiness. Results. The knowledge dimension rated highest, and community climate rated lowest. Most communities were in the lower stages of readiness. No relationship was found between overall readiness and region (F[4,59] = 1.17; p &gt; .05); nor were there regional differences among dimension scores. Smaller communities were less ready for local policy development than larger ones (adjusted R2 = .25; p = .003). Conclusions. The Community Readiness Model is appropriate for understanding local policy development, and it provides advocates with information that may prove helpful in advancing smoke-free policy.

Emissions from the iron and steel-making industries account for 5-6% of global fossil CO 2 emissions. Biocarbon (i.e.,charcoal) could be used to replace the coal currently employed to smelt iron ore and thereby reduce fossil CO 2 emissions. In Brazil, Eucalyptus wood charcoal is used to smelt iron ore, but there is interest in the use of charcoal produced from other biomass feedstocks. Banagrass, a variety of elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum, Schum,), which produces near-record amounts of biomass, is a promising biomass candidate for charcoal production in Brazil and elsewhere. In this paper we describe results of charcoal production from banagrass of different ages and states of demineralization. Mature banagrass provides the highest yields of biocarbon. In addition to its maturity, the structure of the feedstock strongly influences the fixed-carbon yield. Our results indicate that banagrass may be preferred to Eucalyptus wood as a promising feedstock for metallurgical biocarbon production. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Biocarbon; Biomass feedstocks; Carbon yields; Charcoal productions; Eucalyptus woods; Global climate changes; Iron and steels; Iron ore; Biological materials; Biomass; Charcoal; Climate change; Feedstocks; Iron; Iron ores; Metallurgy; Carbon monoxide; Biomass; Carbon Monoxide; Charcoal; Climates; Iron; Metallurgy; Ore",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64549106428

The model showed that by the end of the 21st century, warming leads to a further increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) level of 123 ppm by volume (ppmv). This positive feedback can mostly be attributed to land-based soil-carbon dynamics. On a regional scale, Siberia experienced intense positive feedback, because the acceleration of microbial respiration due to warming causes a decrease in the soil carbon level. Amazonia also had positive feedback resulting from accelerated microbial respiration. On the other hand, some regions, such as western and central North America and South Australia, experienced negative feedback, because enhanced litterfall surpassed the increased respiration in soil carbon. The oceanic contribution to the feedback was much weaker than the land contribution on global scale, but the positive feedback in the northern North Atlantic was as strong as those in Amazonia and Siberia in our model. In the northern North Atlantic, the weakening of winter mixing caused a reduction of CO2 absorption at the surface. Moreover, weakening of the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water caused reduced CO2 subduction to the deep water. Understanding such regional-scale differences may help to explain disparities in coupled climate-carbon cycle model results.

Based on this relationship, we estimate the amount of paleoprecipitation that has occurred in the southeastern part of the Loess Plateau since the last interglacial stage using the carbon isotopic compositions of the soil organic matter (SOM). The results show that the annual precipitation in that region was high during the interglacial stages, with a maximum value of 850 mm, and that it decreased during the last glacial stage to a minimum value of 350 mm. We suggest that the use of organic carbon isotopic composition in paleosol sediments is a reliable method for reconstructing paleoprecipitation due to the clear relationships between soil δ13CTOC, C4/C3 abundance, and precipitation in modern ecosystems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a novel approach for preparation of cellulose/titanium dioxide hybrids was achieved by utilizing supercritical carbon dioxide-assisted impregnation. The hybrids, with a very small scale in length, suggest that the titania particles were not only coating on the external surface but also penetrating into the micro-cavity structure of the cellulose fibers. The penetrating and swelling effect of supercritical carbon dioxide, with a colsovent of ethanol, on the cellulose was also investigated. It was found that such actions of carbon dioxide in the supercritical state influenced the interactions between the molecular chains of cellulose. The titania particles were facilitated by the effect of supercritical carbon dioxide to access and impregnate into the crystalline structure of cellulose fibers by formation and stabilization of hydrogen bonds with abundant hydroxyl groups of cellulose, resulting in a change of its thermal stability in pyrolysis.

In this study, we implement a groundwater model into the regional climate model RegCM3, which is called RegCM3_GW, and investigate the effects of water table dynamics on regional climate. Numerical experiments by RegCM3_GW and RegCM3 over the east Asian monsoon area show that incorporating the water table dynamics into the regional climate model reduces the systematic biases of the simulated precipitation by 38.5% and 39.8% over semiarid and humid regions, respectively, and increases the bias slightly by 5.6% over semihumid regions. To seek the reasons for the differences of simulated precipitation, we analyze the atmospheric water vapor budget and the local water cycle among the water table, soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), and convective precipitation. It is found that the top and root zone soil layers become wetter and enhance the bare soil evaporation but do not always increase the transpiration. Because of the variations of each ET's component, the obvious enhancements of ET occur in semiarid regions and contribute to more instable profiles of pseudoequivalent potential temperature. The atmospheric moisture budget analysis indicates that the recycling rate and precipitation efficiency increase greatly over semiarid regions, which presents a local aquifer-atmosphere feedback, while the variations of atmospheric water vapor transport control the development of precipitation over semihumid and humid regions. Therefore, the effects of water table dynamics on regional climate consist of the local aquifer-atmosphere interaction and the changes of circulation originated from ambient aquifer-atmosphere interaction, and the latter factor plays an important role in the monsoon area. Sensitivity of the results to a change in convection parameterization is also explored.

Analysis of the Electric Power Development Plan of Shandong Province indicates that Shandong Province's current power generation capacity can satisfy demand until 2013. After that, electric power shortages will appear and the gap between supply and demand will reach 149.25 billion kWh by 2020. Projected new coal-fired power stations will consume 103.28 million tonnes of coal and 474.07 million m3 of water resources producing significant extra emissions of SO2, soot, CO 2, NOx, waste water, coal ash and slag. These emissions will exceed established environmental capacity and enhance the greenhouse gas contribution by around 50%. Water shortage and depleting coal reserves will restrict electric power development in Shandong Province. Increasing levels of pollutants, especially SO2 and soot, released by the coal-fired power industry, will bring serious pressures to Shandong Province's human population and urban and natural environments. These predictions suggest that a radically new approach to meeting the demands of economic growth is required if Shandong is to improve its air quality and meet international targets for greenhouse gas emissions.","Conflict; Electric power; Environmental sustainability; Market development; State planning","air quality; conflict management; economic growth; electrical power; electricity industry; emission; environmental protection; market development; planning process; power generation; sustainability; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56249133552

Upon immersion in water, part of the product floats while the main part sinks. Both the floating and the sinking part have been analyzed. We find that the floating and sinking part only differ by the amount of carbon that partly detaches from the particles upon immersion in water. Exposure to H2O results in rapid attack, within minutes, of the surface layer of the particles, because the particles are no longer protected by carbon. The deterioration of the carbon coat is dependent on the synthesis process, either hydrothermal or solid-state reaction. In both cases, however, the carbon coat is permeable to water and fails to protect the surface of the LiFePO4 particles. The consequence is that this immersion results in the chemical attack of LiFePO4, but is restricted to the surface layer of the particles (few nanometers-thick). In case the particles are simply exposed to humid air, the carbon coat protects the particles more efficiently. In this case, the exposure to H2O mainly results in the delithiation of the surface layer, due to the hydrophilic nature of Li, and only the surface layer is affected, at least for a reasonable time of exposure to humid air (weeks). In addition, within this timescale, the surface layer can be chemically lithiated again, and the samples can be dried to remove the moisture, restoring the reversible electrochemical properties. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find nine compact radio sources associated with this region, six of them are new radio detections. We discuss the characteristics of these sources based mostly on their spectral indices and find that most of them appear to be optically thin or thick ultra- and hyper-compact H II regions ionized by B zero-age main-sequence stars. Furthermore, in a few cases the radio emission may arise from optically thick dusty disks and/or cores; however more observations at different wavelengths are necessary to firmly confirm their true nature. In addition, we compared our centimeter maps with the mid-infrared images from the Spitzer Space Observatory GLIMPSE survey revealing a cluster of young protostars in the region together with multiple collimated outflows, some of which might be related to the compact centimeter objects. Finally, we find that one of these centimeter objects, VLA2d, is well centered in an apparent strong and compact north-south bipolar outflow traced by OH masers and we therefore suggest that this object is energizing the latter. © 2008.

The study revealed that native cyclodextrins interact more efficiently with the analytes investigated than do their hydroxypropyl counterparts. In the low-temperature region, enormously high ratios were observed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly 1,8-dimethylnaphthalene, acenaphthene and acenaphthylene chromatographed on a β-cyclodextrin-modified mobile phase. In such a case, the retention times of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were strongly reduced (e.g. from 127 to 1.2 min for 1,8-dimethylnaphthalene) and were close to the hold-up time of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (0.7 min). Moreover, chiral separation of 1-acenaphthenol optical isomers was observed and the elution order of the enantiomers was determined. Within the steroids group, strong interaction was observed for estradiol and testosterone. The results of cluster analysis indicate that β-cyclodextrin as well as γ-cyclodextrin and its hydroxypropyl derivative can be most effective mobile-phase additives under reversed-phase HPLC conditions for 3D-shape-recognition-driven separation, performed at subambient and elevated temperatures, respectively. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Cluster analysis; Cyclodextrins; Enantiomers; High-performance liquid chromatography; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Steroids; Temperature","Aromatic compounds; Arsenic compounds; Chlorine compounds; Chromatographic analysis; Chromatography; Cluster analysis; Cyclodextrins; Derivatives; Doping (additives); Drug interactions; Flow interactions; High performance liquid chromatography; High pressure liquid chromatography; Hydrocarbons; Isomers; Lipids; Liquid chromatography; Liquid phase epitaxy; Naphthalene; Organic compounds; Phase separation; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Random variables; Separation; Silanes; Three dimensional; Toluene; Acenaphthene; Acenaphthylene; Analytes; Chiral separations; Cyclo dextrin; D-shape; Dimethylnaphthalene; Elevated temperatures; Elution order; Enantiomers; Hold-up time; Host-guest interactions; Low molecular mass; Low temperatures; Mobile phase; Optical isomers; Retention times; Reversed-phase; Reversed-phase HPLC; RP-HPLC; Steroids; Strong interactions; Temperature; Aromatic hydrocarbons; (2 hydroxypropyl) alpha cyclodextrin; (2-hydroxypropyl)-alpha-cyclodextrin; 2 hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin; 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin; alpha cyclodextrin; alpha cyclodextrin derivative; alpha-cyclodextrin; beta cyclodextrin derivative; gamma cyclodextrin; gamma cyclodextrin derivative; gamma-cyclodextrin; oligosaccharide; organic compound; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; steroid; article; chemical structure; chemistry; circular dichroism; classification; high performance liquid chromatography; methodology; molecular weight; temperature; alpha-Cyclodextrins; beta-Cyclodextrins; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Circular Dichroism; gamma-Cyclodextrins; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Molecular Weight; Oligosaccharides; Organic Chemicals; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Steroids; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049087881

Frequent exceedences of the National Environmental Standards (NES) for ambient air quality of 50 μg m-3 occur for daily PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less). The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the emission reduction strategy implemented by Environment Canterbury (the local air quality management authority) for the city of Christchurch using an air pollution model called TAPM. This model is used with and without data assimilation to simulate the meteorology and particulate matter dispersion for 1-9 July, 2001, when a stagnant anticyclone dominated the region and led to a prolonged period of poor air quality (the NES was exceeded on every day). This period is again tested with the projected 2013 emission inventory to investigate the reduction in PM10 concentrations due to predicted emission reductions. The last surveyed emission inventory for Christchurch was conducted in 2001, when particulate emissions for a 'typical winter day' were estimated to be 7145, 974, and 1001 tonnes per day from domestic, industrial, and transport sources, respectively. Emission inventories for 2013 - also for a 'typical winter day' - are based on policy implementation resulting in predicted 2013 particulate emission strengths of 998 (domestic), 1164 (industry), and 421 (transport) tonnes per day. Results show that the 2013 emission inventory will cause no exceedences at the location of the monitoring station in Christchurch. However, due to the complex wind regime and topography of the area, it is highly likely that the NES will be exceeded at locations away from the monitoring site, making Christchurch non-compliant with its objectives. This is particularly significant as the NES apply to the maximum concentration occurring anywhere in the polluted airshed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing palaeoecological records from interior Alaska and Yukon indicate that the region was dominated by steppe-tundra vegetation that flourished under the cold, arid glacial conditions of the late Pleistocene. Plant macrofossils and stable carbon isotope measurements from fossil plant and mammal remains indicate this vegetation was exclusively composed of C3 plants. Only two C4 grass species are known to inhabit Alaska and Yukon at present. Their presence today raises the possibility that some C4 vegetation could have inhabited this region during hyper arid phases of Pleistocene glacials. However, only further plant macrofossil and stable carbon isotopic research can resolve this faint possibility. Crown Copyright © 2008.",,"Mammalia",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349147434

The approach is based on chemical lumping and species removal with the necessity analysis method, a combined reaction flow and sensitivity analysis. Independent of the fuel size, the CGR formalism generates very compact submodels for the alkane low-temperature oxidation and provides a general concept for the development of compact oxidation models for large model fuel components such as n-decane and n-tetradecane. A defined sequence of simplification steps, consisting of the compilation of a compact detailed chemical model, the application of linear chemical lumping, and finally species removal based on species necessity values, allows a significantly increased degree of reduction compared to the simple application of the necessity analysis, previously published species, or reaction removal methods. The skeletal model derived by this procedure consists of 110 species and 1170 forward and backward reactions and is validated against the full range of combustion conditions including low and high temperatures, fuel-lean and fuel-rich mixtures, pressures between 1 and 40 bar, and local (species concentration profiles in flames, plug flow and jet-stirred reactors, and reaction sensitivity coefficients) and global parameters (ignition delay times in shock tube experiments, ignition timing in a HCCI engine, and flame speeds). The species removal is based on calculations using a minimum number of parameter configurations, but complemented by a very broad parameter variation in the process of compiling the kinetic input data. We further demonstrate that the inclusion of sensitivity coefficients in the validation process allows efficient control of the reduction process. Additionally, a compact high-temperature n-heptane oxidation model of 47 species and 468 reactions was generated by the application of necessity analysis to the skeletal mechanism. © 2008 The Combustion Institute.","Chemical lumping; n-Heptane; Oxidation; Reduced mechanism; Skeletal mechanism","Applications; Chemical analysis; Chemical oxygen demand; Concentration (process); Fuel additives; Fuels; Heptane; Hydrocarbons; Ignition; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Paraffins; Powders; Sensitivity analysis; Analysis methods; Backward reactions; Chemical models; Combustion conditions; Degree of reductions; Efficient controls; Flame speeds; Fuel components; Fuel sizes; Global parameters; Hcci engines; High temperatures; Hydrocarbon oxidations; Ignition delays; Ignition timings; Input datums; N heptanes; n-Heptane; Oxidation models; Parameter variations; Plug flows; Primary reference fuels; Reaction flows; Reaction sensitivities; Reduced mechanism; Reduction processes; Removal methods; Rich mixtures; Sensitivity coefficients; Skeletal mechanism; Skeletal mechanisms; Skeletal models; Species concentrations; Stirred reactors; Temperature oxidations; Tetradecane; Validation processes; Modal analysis; heptane; article; chemical reaction; combustion; flow measurement; oxidation; priority journal; reaction analysis; reactor; reduction; sensitivity analysis; validation process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56049126629

To explore the mechanism for forming of RuBP regeneration limitation, we conducted the gas exchange measurements and some biochemical analyses in FACE-treated and ambient rice plants. Net CO2 assimilation rate (Anet) in FACE leaves was remarkably lower than that in ambient leaves when measured at the same CO2 concentration, indicating that photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 occurred. In the meantime the maximum electron transport rate (ETR) (Jmax), maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) in vivo, and RuBP contents decreased significantly in FACE leaves. The whole chain electron transport rate and photophosphorylation rate reduced significantly while ETR of photosystem II (PSII) did not significantly decrease and ETR of photosystem I (PSI) was significantly increased in the chloroplasts from FACE leaves. Further, the amount of cytochrome (Cyt) f protein, a key component localized between PSII and PSI, was remarkably declined in FACE leaves. It appears that during photosynthetic acclimation the decline in the Cyt f amount is an important cause for the decreased RuBP regeneration capacity by decreasing the whole chain electron transport in FACE leaves. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Heterocysts send fixed nitrogen to vegetative cells over long distances along the filament, receiving a reduced carbon source from them. These intercellular exchanges might involve a continuous periplasm along the filament or cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm conduits or both. In the present study, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to a twin-arginine translocation signal sequence, which exported GFP to the periplasm of either a heterocyst using the heterocyst-specific promoters PhepA and PpatB or to the periplasm of vegetative cells using the vegetative cell-specific promoter PrbcL. Using the techniques of FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) and FLIP (fluorescence loss in photobleaching), we found no evidence for intercellular diffusion of GFP through the periplasm, either from a heterocyst to vegetative cells or vice versa, or among vegetative cells. GFP could diffuse within the periplasm of the producing cell, but the diffusion stopped at the cell border. GFP diffusion could occur between two dividing cells before septum closure.

The labelled EPs were reacted with LiAlH4 so that the polar succinimide linker group between the EP backbone and the chromophore was converted into apolar pyrrolidine units. The resulting products were purified through a gel permeation chromatography column to remove the cleaved off chromophores. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed that after reduction, the peak assigned to the succinimide carbonyls was strongly diminished. UV-vis absorption and steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed in hexane and THF. The reduction of the succinimide carbonyls was found to have a significant effect on the luminescence properties of the labelled EPs. The polar associations taking place between the succinimide moieties in hexane were found to be dramatically decreased after reduction as shown by UV-vis absorption, steady-state excitation and emission fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. These results demonstrate that the presence of pyrene aggregates for EP-MAH labelled with 1-pyrenemethylamine is due primarily to the polar succinimide moieties rather than the aromatic pyrene. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The collector has been tested under various weather conditions. The results show that the CO2 temperature, CO2 pressure and mass flow rate increase with the solar radiation, which is different from those of traditional solar collector using liquid as working fluid. The solar radiation has influence on the CO2 states, being liquid, liquid-gas or supercritical state in the test, furthermore, affects the CO2 mass flow rate.

Under the umbrella of this program, the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) was established in 1999 to return cultivated land with slopes of 25° or more to perennial vegetation. However, the regional impacts on water resource management that are incurred by afforestation have not been carefully evaluated, especially in the subalpine region of southwestern China. The purpose of the present study was to provide reference values for the SLCP by evaluating the potential impact of afforestation on water yield under different climatic regimes. Accordingly, evapotranspiration (ET) in cropland (CL), shrubland, and general forest was calculated using a modification of Thornthwaite's method, and in coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest (BF), and mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MF) using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. The results of both approaches showed that afforestation reduces water yield by 9.6-24.3% depending on the types of conversion and climatic conditions. Water-yield reduction is greatest (>143.4 mm, or 24.3%) when CL is converted to BF in dry climate conditions. Compared with the other forest types studied, coniferous plantations prevented water-yield reduction by as much as 9.6% because of their relatively low levels of ET. It is expected that implementation of the SLCP, together with continuing climate change, will further pressure regional water resources. Thus, the effectiveness of afforestation must be evaluated in a broader context while taking into account its positive ecological aspects, such as soil-erosion control, the preservation of biodiversity, and the significant carbon sequestration provided by forests. © 2008 American Water Resources Association.","Afforestation; Evapotranspiration; Subalpine forest; Water yield","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate change; Climate control; Climatology; Forestry; Information management; Management; Reforestation; Resource allocation; Surface chemistry; Surface tension; Water management; Water supply; Afforestation; Evapotranspiration; Subalpine forest; Water yield; Water resources; afforestation; coniferous forest; deciduous forest; energy balance; evapotranspiration; hydrological response; land use change; subalpine environment; water management; water yield; Algorithms; Biodiversity; Chemistry; Ecology; Forestation; Management; Meteorology; Plants; Soil Erosion; Surface Properties; Surface Tension; Water; Water Supply; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549131269

The international communities have reached a consensus to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions and restrain global warming. The quantitative assessment of anthropogenic GHG emissions is the scientific basis to find out the status of global GHG emission, identify the commitments of each country, and arrange the international efforts of GHG emission reduction. Currently the main assessment indicators for GHG emission include national indicator, per capita indicator, per GDP indicator, and international trade indicator etc. The introduction to the above indicators is put forward and their merits and demerits are analyzed. Based on the GHG emission data from the World Resource Institute (WRI), the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), the results of each indictor are calculated for the world, for the eight G8 industrialized countries (USA, UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Russia), and the five major developing countries including China, Brazil, India, South Africa and Mexico. The paper points out that all these indicators have some limitations. The Indicator of Industrialized Accumulative Emission per Capita (IAEC) is put forward as the equitable indicator to evaluate the industrialized historical accumulative emission per capita of every country. IAEC indicator can reflect the economic achievement of GHG emission enjoyed by the current generations in every country and their commitments. The analysis of IAEC indicates that the historical accumulative emission per capita in industrialized countries such as UK and USA were typically higher than those of the world average and the developing countries. Emission indicator per capita per GDP, consumptive emission indicator and survival emission indicator are also put forward and discussed in the paper. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Assessment indicator; Emission indicator per capita per GDP; Global warming; Greenhouse gases (GHG) emission; Industrialized Accumulative Emission per Capita (IAEC)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049161993

To solve this problem, we propose a piecewise-integration method to reduce the systematic error in climate sensitivity studies. The observations are firstly assimilated into a numerical model by using the dynamic relaxation technique to relax to the current state of atmosphere, and then the assimilated fields are continuously used to reinitialize the simulation to reduce the error of climate simulation. When the numerical model is integrated with changed external forcing, the results can be split into two parts, background and perturbation fields, and the background is the state before the external forcing is changed. The piecewise-integration method is used to continuously reinitialize the model with the assimilated field, instead of the background. Therefore, the simulation error of the model with the external forcing can be reduced. In this way, the accuracy of climate sensitivity experiments is greatly improved. Tests with a simple low-order spectral model show that this approach can significantly reduce the uncertainty of climate sensitivity experiments.","Climate model; Dynamic relaxation technique; External forcing; Low-order spectral model; Sensitivity experiment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54549112158

However, this economic progress has come at a high cost. It has led to unprecedented environmental consequences. So this region needs to shift the conventional pattern of ""develop first and then treat the pollution"" to a trajectory of sustainable development. To that end, this paper examines a variety of policy responses, at national, regional and international levels, to deal with growing concerns about the environmental challenges in Asia. In the context of national responses, special attention is paid to the following issues: coordination between the central and local governments, market-based environmental instruments and industrial policies, tougher emissions standards for mobile and stationary sources and fuel quality, policies to promote energy efficiency and the use of clean energy and biofuels, the integration of environmental policies with economic and sectoral policies, and engagement of the private sector through e.g., ecolabelling, green government procurement, corporate ratings and disclosure programs, and drawing the support of financial institutions to promote improved corporate environmental performance. The paper concludes that having the right policy mix, coupled with strengthened cooperation at national, local and regional levels, will ensure continuing economic growth in the region without compromising its limited ecological-carrying capacity and environmental quality. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Assuming that frost flower-derived aerosols were the primary halogen source, the areas potentially covered by frost flowers were determined. The carbonate precipitation scheme was taken into account for triggering the bromine explosions in the model. A comparison of the simulations with GOME satellite measurements in springs of 2000 and 2001 showed that the spatial structure and temporal evolution of tropospheric BrO clouds were well predicted by the model. The majority of the springtime ODEs observed at three arctic stations was reasonably reproduced. An analysis on the model results indicated that most periods of simulated ozone depletion (03 < 1 nmol mol-1) occurred in a layer 300 to 400 m deep at the Arctic sites. It is found that the halogen chemistry in the marine boundary layer (MBL) contributed substantially to the spring time ODEs, but atmospheric temperature and circulations as well as the transported air pollution in the ABL were also responsible for the ODEs. For springs of 2000 and 2001, two source regions with low surface O3 levels were identified: the Siberian/Beaufort Arctic and the Canadian Arctic, broadly corresponding to areas of enhanced BrO levels and accompanied by the Arctic anticyclones. Dominant trans-Arctic transport pathways were also investigated for the ODEs at Alert, Barrow and Zeppelinfjellet.

Methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) consume CH4 in paddy soil and, therefore, reduce CH4 emission to the atmosphere. In order to estimate the contribution of paddy fields as a source of CH4, it is important to monitor the effects of fertilizer applications on the shifts of soil methanotrophs, which are targets in strategies to combat global climate change. In this study, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) based on 16S rRNA and pmoA genes, respectively, were used to analyze the soil methanotrophic abundance and community diversity under four fertilization treatments: urea (N), urea and potassium chloride (NK), urea, superphosphate, and potassium chloride (NPK), and urea, superphosphate, potassium chloride, and crop residues (NPK+C), compared to an untreated control (CON). The objective of this study was to examine whether soil methanotrophs responded to the long-term, different fertilizer regimes by using a combination of quantitative and qualitative molecular approaches. Soil samples were collected from the Taoyuan Experimental Station of Agro-ecosystem Observation at Changde (28°55′ N, 111°26′ E), central Hunan Province of China, in July 2006. Soil DNAs were extracted from the samples, then the 16S rRNA genes were quantified by real-time PCR and the pmoA genes were amplified via general PCR followed by DGGE, cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. The community diversity indices were assessed through the DGGE profile. Except for NPK, other treatments of N, NK, and NPK+C showed significantly higher copy numbers of type I methanotrophs (7.0-9. 6∈×∈107) than CON (5.1∈×∈10 7). The copy numbers of type II methanotrophs were significantly higher in NPK+C (2.8∈×∈108) and NK (2.5∈×∈108) treatments than in CON (1.4∈×∈108). Moreover, the ratio of type II to type I methanotrophic copy numbers ranged from 1.88 to 3.32, indicating that the type II methanotrophs dominated in all treatments. Cluster analyses based on the DGGE profile showed that the methanotrophic community in NPK+C might respond more sensitively to the environmental variation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 81% of the obtained pmoA sequences were classified as type I methanotrophs. Furthermore, the type I-affiliated sequences were related to Methylobacter, Methylomicrobium, Methylomonas, and some uncultured methanotrophic clones, and those type II-like sequences were affiliated with Methylocystis and Methylosinus genera. There was an inhibitory effect on the methanotrophic abundance in the N and a stimulating effect in the NK and NPK+C treatments, respectively. During the rice-growing season, the type II methanotrophs might be more profited from such a coexistence of low O2 and high CH4 concentration environment than the type I methanotrophs. However, type I methanotrophs seemed to be more frequently detected. The relatively complex diversity pattern in the NPK+C treatment might result from the strong CH4 production. Long-term fertilization regimes can both affect the abundance and the composition of the type I and type II methanotrophs. The inhibited effects on methanotrophic abundance were found in the N treatment, compared to the stimulated effects from the NK and NPK+C treatments. The fertilizers of nitrogen, potassium, and the crop residues could be important factors controlling the abundance and community composition of the methanotrophs in the paddy soil. Methanotrophs are a fascinating group of microorganisms playing an important role in the biogeochemical carbon cycle and in the control of global climate change. However, it is still a challenge for the cultivation of the methanotrophs, although three isolates were obtained in the extreme environments very recently. Therefore, future studies will be undoubtedly conducted via molecular techniques just like the applications in this study. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","16S rRNA gene; DGGE; Long-term fertilization; Methanotrophs; Paddy soil; PmoA gene; Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)","abundance; cluster analysis; community composition; crop residue; DNA; electrokinesis; fertilizer application; gel; gene expression; global climate; greenhouse gas; growing season; inhibition; methane; methanogenic bacterium; molecular analysis; oxygen; paddy field; phylogenetics; polymerase chain reaction; potassium chloride; real time; rice; RNA; soil microorganism; urea; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Taiwan; Taoyuan; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methylobacter; Methylococcaceae; Methylocystaceae; Methylocystis; Methylomicrobium; Methylomonas; Methylosinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56749107203

A non-linear finite element model was developed and verified against fixed-ended column tests. The column specimens were extruded from heat-treated aluminum alloys of 6063-T5 and 6061-T6, and the ends of the columns were transversely welded to aluminum end plates for the welded columns. The non-welded columns without welding of end plates were also investigated. The welded columns were modeled by dividing the column into different portions along the column length, so that the heat-affected zone softening at both ends of the welded columns was included in the simulation. The initial local geometric imperfections of the columns were measured in this study. Geometric and material non-linearities were incorporated in the finite element model. The verified finite element model was used for a parametric study of fixed-ended aluminum alloy circular hollow section columns. A comparison of the column strengths predicted by the finite element analysis and the design strengths calculated using the current American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for aluminum structures was presented. The column strengths were also compared with the design strengths predicted by the direct strength method, which was developed for cold-formed carbon steel members.

The present work investigates how mixing activated carbon into cohesive sediment affects the stability of sediment obtained from the intertidal zone at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Superfund site in South Basin, San Francisco Bay, CA. Our results show for these sediments that mixing activated carbon into sediment does not significantly affect stability of surface sediments, as measured by sediment erosion rate and critical shear stress for incipient motion, thus supporting the potential field application of this technique for in situ stabilization of persistent organic contaminants. Hydrodynamic modeling was used to estimate the maximum bottom shear stress encountered during high-wind storm events at the estuarine inlet from which the sediments were obtained. Comparison of estimated bottom shear stresses with measured critical shear stresses shows that surface sediments will not erode under normal, non-storm conditions. Bottom shear stresses caused by large waves under infrequent high-wind storm conditions may erode surface sediments for short periods of time. We conclude from sediment stability tests and hydrodynamic modeling that mixing activated carbon amendment with cohesive sediment at selected locations within South Basin will not reduce surface sediment stability nor result in significant erosion of treated sediments. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon amendment; Sedflume; Sediment stability","Activated carbon; Biochemistry; Erosion; Hydrodynamics; Marine pollution; Mixing; Shear flow; Ships; Stabilization; Storms; Submarine geology; Surficial sediments; Bottom shear stress; Carbon amendment; Critical shear stress; Organic contaminant; Persistent organic contaminants; Sedflume; Sediment stability; Stability of surfaces; Shear stress; activated carbon; organic compound; activated carbon; benthos; bioavailability; erosion; marine sediment; organic pollutant; sequestration (chemistry); shear stress; article; disaster; erosion; estuary; hydrodynamics; model; molecular stability; organic pollution; priority journal; sea pollution; sediment; shear stress; soil amendment; surface property; wind; California; North America; San Francisco Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51549117854

However, this growth paled in comparison with the solar photovoltaic industry, which spurted 53%, according to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) in its annual small wind turbine market report in July 2008. The discrepancy was in large part due to a federal tax incentive adopted for the solar industry in 2005, which the small wind industry does not have.

Corroborating AWEA's findings, Carbon Trust, a UK government-funded independent company, released a study in August of small-scale wind energy's potential and found that this source could provide up to 0.4% of the UK's total electricity supply if 10% of households installed turbines at costs competitive with grid electricity.

Working on behalf of Yorkshire Forward, Amec has studied the infrastructure network needed to connect local industrial emitters to suitable CO2 storage sites in the North Sea. According to Amec's project director Alastair Rennie, this would cost around $3.95 billion, which would cover the infrastructure needed to compress and transport the gas, but not the cost of capturing the gas or the technology at the wellhead. The plan sees a number of companies developing the infrastructure in stages. The Yorkshire and Humber area is ideally suited as a first project of this kind, because it has both a relatively small number of large-scale CO2 emitters, including the Drax, Eggborough, and Ferrybridge, and a large number of mature gas fields nearby with a well-understood, stable geology, ideal for carbon storage. Many of these are expected to be depleted between 2012 and 2030. Amec's calculations assume that only 25% of the CO2 emitted in the area would ultimately be abated, that is the amount captured minus the emissions associated with the process of gas capture and transportation. Even so, the contribution would be very noticeable, amounting to around 35.6 million ton/yr by 2030, or 6.4% of the country's total CO2 emissions in 2005. At best, Rennie calculates that the Yorkshire and Humber region could abate 46.3 million ton/yr of carbon by 2040.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949120898

Strong year-over-year production growth resulted from the development of onshore fields, particularly in Texas and Wyoming. As a result of the growth of US production, EIA projects that net gas imports from Canada will continue to fall until 2030 and it does not expect indigenous production to meet both this shortfall and projected growth in demand over that period. Thus, LNG imports are still expected to increase - from 0.5 tcf in 2006 to 2.8 tcf by 2030.
