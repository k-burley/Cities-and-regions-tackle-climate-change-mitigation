These mountainous basins are typically large (17-81,000 km2; mean = 11,000 km2), often have decades of measurement data on daily water and sediment discharge, and display an extraordinary range of denudation (0.01-6.9 mm/yr), runoff (16-2700 mm/ yr), and local topographic relief (700-4300 m), yet the underlying lithology (granitic plutons, metasediments, and Quaternary deposits) can be classified into a small number of homogeneous types, and anthropogenic disturbance is limited. The steep nature of the channels precludes sediment storage, and unlike previous global studies of fluvial denudation rates, based on data compilations from very large river basins (&gt;100,000 km2), this analysis distinguishes the sediment production in mountains from sediment entrapment within adjacent sedimentary basins. Lithology and average catchment slope account for 90% of the variance in sediment yield, and yield is not significantly correlated with runoff. However, because runoff over geologic timescales orchestrates the processes of channel network incision and sediment evacuation, climate could ultimately govern basin hillslope conditions and thereby the rates of hillslope erosion. Several theoretical geomorphic models for mass wasting are tested to assess hillslope-scale sediment yield models for the study basins. When applied throughout the Amazonian Andes, such empirical models predict an annual Andean sediment flux to the lowland Amazon Basin of 2.3-3.1 Gt. Because ∼1.3 Gt/yr of sediment reach the gauged tributaries of the mainstem Amazon River, the intervening foreland basins appear to intercept about half of the total Andean sediment discharge. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

The composition, structure, microstructure and chemical state of the films have been investigated by the complementary use of RBS, NRA, XRD, GIXRD, TEM and XPS analyses. These characteristics of the films were then correlated to their mechanical properties determined by hardness (H), Young's modulus (Er) and friction coefficient measurements. Under low CH4 pressures, the formation of a mixture of nanocrystalline WC1-x and W2C phases has been observed. A pure WC1-x phase was observed in films having a composition close to W1C0.9. With increasing CH 4 pressure, the amount of carbon in the films increases, leading to a progressive amorphization of tungsten carbide deposited layers. Nanocomposite films appeared to be formed, with WC1-x nanograins (&lt;3 nm) dispersed in an amorphous carbon matrix. The film deposited at 30% of CH 4 exhibits a-C:H phase.

High volume samplers were used for the determinations of total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations at representative assessment points situated nearest to the cement site at three existing residential houses. Furthermore, dust impact arising from cement plant on the three existing residential houses was predicted using an air quality model (fugitive dust model, FDM). The emission rates of dust from various activities of the cement plant were estimated by using the emission factors technique. The measured (high sampler) and predicted (FDM) values of dust concentration were compared. The results of the study showed that the agreement between the 24-h average predicted and measured dust concentrations were excellent. Although the model under-predicted slightly the measured dust concentrations, yet the FDM was adequate for application at the cement plant. Furthermore, the spatial isopleths of TSP concentration for cement plant and its surrounding environment indicated that the predicted ground level of dust concentrations, close to the cement plant, exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value of 120 μg/m3. This study was invaluable for locating areas nearby the cement plant that are at risk of approaching or exceeding guideline TSP concentrations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, niched Pareto genetic algorithm, and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) have been developed and successfully applied to an environmental/economic electric power dispatch problem. A new procedure for quality measure is proposed in this paper in order to evaluate different techniques. A feasibility check procedure has been developed and superimposed on MOEA to restrict the search to the feasible region of the problem space. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is also imposed to provide the power system operator with a representative and manageable Pareto-optimal set. Moreover, an approach based on fuzzy set theory is developed to extract one of the Pareto-optimal solutions as the best compromise one. These multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been individually examined and applied to the standard IEEE 30-bus six-generator test system. Several optimization runs have been carried out on different cases of problem complexity. The results of MOEA have been compared to those reported in the literature. The results confirm the potential and effectiveness of MOEA compared to the traditional multiobjective optimization techniques. In addition, the results demonstrate the superiority of the SPEA as a promising multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to solve different power system multiobjective optimization problems. © 2006 IEEE.","Economic power dispatch; Emission reduction; Environmental impact; Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization","Electric load dispatching; Electric power systems; Environmental impact; Genetic algorithms; Hierarchical systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Electric power dispatch; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm; Evolutionary algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744773216

The programme was delivered by EcoSys in partnership with the East Sussex Sustainable Business Partnership, a collaboration of all East Sussex Local Authorities, the Environment Agency and EcoSys. ES betre provided a range of free support and advice over a 2-year period including: 54 workshops, 6 newsletters, 30 environmental audits, 16 grants and 312 technical helpline enquiries. Information on environmental compliance and best practice for solid waste minimisation and recycling, energy and water efficiency was disseminated and activities linked with the government's best practice programmes, e.g. Envirowise, Action Energy and The Carbon Trust. Marketing activities were extremely successful in attracting businesses to join with 757 signing up, 60% of which then went onto become active service users. This is the most successful recruitment rate in the UK to date, making ES betre some 40 times larger than the average UK waste minimisation club. Excellent links with local business support/trade associations were built up and recruitment by personal recommendation became a feature. The project had a strong focus on smaller businesses (&lt;250 employees). Of the businesses that signed up to the project, 56% were Micro (&lt;9 employees) and 86% employed less than 50 employees (Small). The project reached 4000 local businesses regularly via newsletters and event mailings. Some 60% of the 757 businesses became actively involved and attended training events or had environmental audits. A total of 189 businesses identified improvement actions (1226) and of these, 123 businesses had implemented at least one improvement action by the end of the programme. These resulted in estimated cost savings of at least £263,000 per annum and just over half of these savings have already been achieved (March 2005). In addition, actions taken to prevent pollution and ensure compliance with environmental legislation will save businesses a further £297,000 in fines. These cost savings were larger than the cost of the project (£298,000). The environmental impact of the programme has been significant with reductions identified in waste (1915 t), water (17,352 m3) and energy (1.2 million kWh). The savings quantified are thought to be conservative as it was found that many Micro and SMEs did not measure the impact of their actions. Previous experience indicates that, for projects involving smaller companies, cost savings are likely to be underestimated by at least 50%. As well as making it difficult to measure outputs, this lack of measurement means it is harder to demonstrate the need for change with the benefits of improved practice. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Gauge locations are usually in or near population centers, which tend to lie at low elevations relative to the surrounding terrain. For hydrologic modeling purposes, the resulting bias can result in serious underprediction of observed flows. A hydrologic water balance approach to develop a globally consistent correction for the underestimation of gridded precipitation in mountainous regions is described. The adjustment is based on a combination of the catchment water balances and variations of the Budyko E/P versus PET/P curve. The method overlays streamflow measurements onto watershed boundaries and then performs watershed water balances to determine ""true"" precipitation. Rather than relying on a modeled runoff ratio, evaporation is estimated using the Budyko curves. The average correction ratios for each of 357 mountainous river basins worldwide are spatially distributed across the basins and are then interpolated to ungauged areas. Following application of adjustments for precipitation catch deficiencies, the correction ratios are used to scale monthly precipitation from an existing monthly global dataset (1979-99, 0.5° resolution). The correction for orographic effects resulted in a net increase in global terrestrial precipitation of 6.2% (20.2% in orographically influenced regions only) for the 1979-99 climatology. The approach developed here is applicable to any precipitation dataset in regions where good streamflow data exist. As a cautionary note, the correction factors are dataset dependent, and therefore the adjustments are strictly applicable only to the data from which they were derived. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Catchment water balance; Correction factors; Data sets; Global precipitation; Hydrologic modeling; Mountainous regions; Orographic effects; Population centers; River basins; Streamflow measurements; Water balance; Watershed boundaries; Catchments; Climatology; Gages; Precipitation (meteorology); Runoff; Stream flow; Watersheds; Landforms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646355580

PIXGRO is an extension of the stand-level CO2 and H2O-flux model PROXELNEE, that simulates the NEE on a process basis, but goes further to include the dry matter production, partitioning, and crop development for spring barley. Dry matter partitioned to the leaf was converted to leaf area index (LAI) using relationships for the specific leaf area (SLA). The canopy flux component, PROXELNEE was calibrated using information from the literature on C3 plants and was tested using CO2 flux data from an eddy-covariance (EC) method in Finland with long-term observations. The growth component (CGRO) was calibrated using data from the literature on spring barley as well as data from the Finland site. It was then validated against field data from two sites in Germany and partly via the use of MODIS remotely sensed LAI from the Finland site. Both the diurnal and the seasonal patterns of gross CO2 uptake were very well simulated (R2 = 0.92). A slight seasonal bias may be attributed to leaf ageing. Crop growth was also well simulated; simulated dry matter agreed with field observed data from Germany (R2 = 0.90). For LAI, the agreement between the simulated and observed was good (R2 = 0.80), giving an indication that functions describing the conversion of fixed CO2 to dry matter and the subsequent partitioning leaf dry matter and LAI simulation were robust and provided reliable estimates. The MODIS LAI at a resolution of 1000 m agreed poorly (R2 = 0.45) with the PIXGRO simulated LAI and the observed LAI at the Finland site in 2001. We attributed this to the coarse resolution of the image and/or the small size of the barley field (about 17 ha or 0.25 km 2) at the Finland site. By deriving a regression relation between the observed LAI and NDVI from a higher resolution MODIS (500 m resolution), the MODIS-recalculated LAI agreed better with the PIXGRO-simulated LAI (R 2 = 0.86). PIXGRO provides a prototype model bridging the disciplines of plant physiology, crop modeling and remote sensing, for use in a spatial context in evaluating carbon balances and plant growth at stand level, landscape, regional, and with some care, continental scales. Since almost 50% of the European land surface is covered by crops, such a model is needed for the dynamic estimation of LAI and NEE of croplands. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The spectrum of M82 X-l was found to be unusually hard (photon spectral index Γ ≈ 1) with a sharp cutoff at ≈6 keV. The disk blackbody emission model requires a nonphysically high temperature. Instead, the spectrum is better described, with a lower reduced χ2, as emission due to the nearly saturated Comptonization of photons in an optically thick (τ ≈ 10-30, depending on the geometry) plasma having a temperature kT ≈ 2 keV. This is in contrast to the high-energy spectra of other black hole systems, which are relatively steeper (Γ &gt; 1.5) and hence are modeled as the unsaturated thermal and/or nonthermal Comptonization of soft photons, in an optically thin (τ ≈ l) high-temperature plasma. An iron line emission that is marginally resolved (σ ∼ 0.2 keV) is required to fit the data. We argue that the standard geometry for the X-ray - producing region, which consists of an optically thin inner disk or a uniform/patchy corona on top of a cold disk, is not applicable to this source. Alternatively, the geometry of the X-ray - producing region could be a large sphere surrounding a cold accretion disk or an optically thick inner disk region that cools by bremsstrahlung self-Comptonization. For the latter scenario, such an inner disk region, whose effective optical depth to absorption is less than unity, is expected in the standard accretion disk theory for near-Eddington accretion rates. © 2006.

Results from two case studies were analyzed during which boundary layer processes dominated the lower atmospheric processes. In the first case study (6 June 1987), we found that differences in the estimation of stomatal resistance in the two land-surface models (LSMs) triggered many of the differences in results obtained using the two LSMs. In the second case study (11 July 1987), only minor differences existed between respective net radiation and stomatal resistance estimations, leading to similar boundary layer structures. Diagnostic results indicate that in both case studies growth rates of and depths of atmospheric boundary layers and vertical profiles of virtual potential temperatures, water vapor mixing ratio, and horizontal winds are very similar in LAPS and ISBA. Our future studies are directed at evaluating these two schemes using a regional climate version of the WRF model.

The main advantages of this technology are improved methane yield because of the supply of additional nutrients from the codigestates and more efficient use of equipment and cost-sharing by processing multiple waste streams in a single facility. Many municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in industrialized countries currently process wastewater sludge in large digesters. Codigestion of organic wastes with municipal wastewater sludge can increase digester gas production and provide savings in the overall energy costs of plant operations. Methane recovery also helps to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The goal of this literature survey was to summarize the research conducted in the last four years on anaerobic Codigestion to identify applications of codigestion at WWTPs. Because the solids content in municipal wastewater sludge is low, this survey only focuses on codigestion processes operated at relative low solids content (slurry mode). Semi-solid or solid codigestion processes were not included. Municipal wastewater sludge, the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, and cattle manure (CAM) are the main wastes most often used in codigestion processes. Wastes that are codigested with these main wastes are wood wastes, industrial organic wastes, and farm wastes. These are referred to in this survey as codigestates. The literature provides many laboratory studies (batch assays and bench-scale digesters) that assess the digestibility of codigestates and evaluate the performance and monitoring of codigestion, inhibition of digestion by codigestates, the design of the process (e.g., single-stage or two-stage processes), and the operation temperature (e.g., mesophilic or thermophilic). Only a few reports on pilot- and full-scale studies were found. These evaluate general process performance and pretreatment of codigestates, energy production, and treatment costs.","Anaerobic digestion; Codigestion; Digestibility; Methane production; Organic wastes","Anaerobic digestion; Costs; Machine design; Methane; Water treatment plants; Codigestion; Digestibility; Methane production; Organic wastes; Wastewater treatment; methane; Anaerobic digestion; Costs; Machine design; Methane; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; activated sludge; emission; methane; organic pollutant; waste technology; wastewater; anaerobic capacity; atmospheric dispersion; biodegradability; cattle; energy cost; energy yield; equipment; greenhouse gas; industrial waste; industrialization; manure; monitoring; municipal solid waste; nutrient; organic waste; priority journal; review; sludge; technology; temperature dependence; waste management; waste water treatment plant; Bos taurus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749338209

Therefore, a stand-alone power supply is always in demand therein. In greenhouses, cooling and pumping equipments dominate the demand for electricity. The demand for electricity occurs during the periods when solar radiation is available and in abundance; an excellent harmony between demand and supply elucidates the feasibility of using solar energy. Therefore, utilization of solar energy for powering greenhouses in desert climate is considered amongst the important applications of solar energy and carries great significance and success. The main objective of this research project is to quantify the potential of using a photovoltaic (PV) system to power greenhouses. The greenhouse under investigation is located at al-Muzahmyah research station of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST). The PV-greenhouse system consisted of the 14.72 kW PV arrays, a 3000 Amp-hr battery storage system, a 15 kWp power conditioning system, data measurement & collection system, and a 9 x 39 m fiberglass greenhouse. The solar radiation availability and the demand for electricity were studied and quantified to optimize the PV-greenhouse for desert climate operation. Several consecutive plantation cycles were completed. This paper describes the complete PV-greenhouse system and its components and presents the system operational performance under the Saudi Arabian arid climate. The PV subsystem met the required load of the greenhouse under investigation. The performance of the PV subsystem, battery subsystem and greenhouse cooling system were satisfactory.","Energy; Environmental modification; Photovoltaic; Power consumption; Solar radiation; Stand-alone power supply",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749369593

Under some conditions for the ternary system, the permselectivity of the membrane is scarcely affected, while under other conditions, permselectivity is negatively affected by as much as 20%. In most cases, for the ternary feeds, significant depression in fluxes was observed due to competition between the CO2, CH4 and heavier hydrocarbons, but the effect was even more pronounced for the toluene. In addition to steady state tests in the presence and absence of n-heptane and toluene, modules were conditioned for 5 days with ternary mixture of CO2, CH4 and one or the other of these heavy hydrocarbons. Following this conditioning process, the modules were studied with a simple binary 10% CO2/90% CH4 mixture. These conditioning studies provide insight into the fundamental effects induced in the membrane due to the long-term exposure to the complex mixtures. Following exposure to the ternaries containing n-heptane, negligible CO2 permeance increase was seen, while significantly increased permeances were seen under some conditions following toluene exposure even at low pressures of the ternary toluene/CO2/CH4 conditioning gas mixture. Although a more protracted process occurs in the case of n-heptane/CO2/CH4 at 35°C and 500 ppm, a significant loss in selectivity does still occur in the actual ternary tests after exposure for 5 days. The problem caused by 300 ppm toluene at 35°C is more immediately apparent than for n-heptane exposure, but the ultimate selectivity loss is similar for both hydrocarbons. In addition to the selectivity, in the presence of toluene the permeability is also depressed significantly, presumably due to a greater capability of toluene to compete for added free volume elements introduced in the conditioning process. The conditioning treatment has negligible effect at 55°C, suggesting that that the sorption affinity of toluene decreases with increasing temperature. Results also suggest that an essentially defect-free, non-nodular morphology offers advantages in stability under demanding operating conditions. Earlier work [G. Djoekita, Characterization and Analysis of Asymmetric Hollow Fiber Membranes for Natural Gas Purification in the Presence of Hydrocarbons, The University of Texas at Austin, 2000] showed serious losses in performance of membranes comprised of similar materials, when the selective layer had a pronounced fused nodular nature as opposed to the intrinsically defect-free skin layers reported on here. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The motivation behind this paper is the need to: (1) design a hydrogen supply chain that integrates the previously mentioned components within a single framework, (2) understand the important trade-offs in such a supply chain, and (3) have a full understanding of the data requirements and uncertainties in such an exercise. Optimization techniques were implemented to develop the hydrogen supply chain for the transport sector, therefore, determining the optimum infrastructural and operational costs. Of course, cost is not likely to be the sole determinant of performance in practice. The network of interest was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Also, the network is presented as a steady state 'snapshot' problem using Great Britain as a backdrop. The model and assumptions presented in this paper reveal that the optimum future hydrogen supply chain might consist of medium-to-large, centralized methane steam reforming plants. The hydrogen produced from these plants will then be delivered as a liquid via tanker trucks and stored in centralized storage facilities. © 2006 Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Great Britain; Hydrogen; MILP; Supply chain network design","Computer simulation; Design; Integer programming; Linear programming; Operations research; Optimization; Hydrogen supply chain; Mixed-integer linear programming; Supply chain network design; Hydrogen; Computer simulation; Design; Hydrogen; Integer programming; Linear programming; Operations research; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745624259

We applied hierarchical variance partition methodology to Generalised Lineal Models (GLMs), with the presence of the tortoise in 1 km2 cells as the response variable. We posited the existence of a hierarchical scheme of factors (including climate, relief and lithology, and land-use) that determine the distribution of Testugo graeca in southeastern Spain. We also identified the environmental variables within each factor with the greatest explanatory power and decoupled local vs landscape effects. Climate, followed by relief and lithology, and then land-use, turned out to be the most important factor shaping the distribution of T. graeca in south-east Spain as well as determining the presence of the species within its range. Univariate models showed that the main climate constraints were related to rainfall and extreme minimum temperatures, two factors which could be related to constraints imposed by the length of the annual activity period and productivity. Finally, multi-scale decomposition suggested that neighbouring habitat and local dynamics may also be important in the distribution of the species at the landscape scale.

The sensitivity of the results to the horizontal resolution jump and updating frequency of the lateral boundary conditions are also evaluated. In order to accomplish this, a perfect-model approach nicknamed the Big-Brother Experiment (BBE) was followed. The experimental protocol consists of first establishing a virtual-reality reference climate over a fairly large area by using the Canadian RCM with grid spacing of 45 km nested within NCEP analyses. The resolution of the simulated climate is then degraded to resemble that of operational general circulation models (GCM) or observation analyses by removing small scales; the filtered fields are then used to drive the same regional model, but over a smaller sub-area. This set-up permits a comparison between two simulations of the same RCM over a common region. The Big-Brother Experiment has been carried out for four winter months over the west coast of North America. The results show that complex topography and coastline have a strong positive impact on the downscaling ability of the one-way nesting technique. These surface forcings, found to be responsible for a large part of small-scale climate features, act primarily locally and yield good climate reproducibility. Precipitation over the Rocky Mountains region is a field in which such effect is found and for which the nesting technique displays significant downscaling ability. The best downscaling ability is obtained when the ratio of spatial resolution between the nested model and the nesting fields is less than 12, and when the update frequency is more than twice a day. Decreasing the spatial resolution jump from a ratio of 12 to six has more benefits on the climate reproducibility than a reduction of spatial resolution jump from two to one. Also, it is found that an update frequency of four times a day leads to a better downscaling than twice a day when a ratio of spatial resolution of one is used. On the other hand, no improvement was found by using high-temporal resolution when the driving fields were degraded in terms of spatial resolution. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",,"climate modeling",Erratum,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32444440675

Filter-based methods such as the Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP) are most commonly used to quantify aerosol light absorption aloft. This paper reports first measurements of aerosol light absorption aloft with photoacoustic instrumentation (PA). Three examples of aerosol light absorption are presented. The first one illustrates a case of detached layers aloft arising from intercontinental, interoceanic transport of smoke from wildland fires in Siberia to the North American continent and the measurement campaign held at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Climate Research Facility in north central Oklahoma. Then, two examples of intense local fire smoke light absorption from the Coastal Stratocumulus Imposed Perturbation Experiment near Marina, California, USA, are presented. The first local fire was an oil fire burning in a storage tank near Moss Landing, California, USA, and smoke from this fire was very dark, indicating a low single scattering albedo. By contrast, the second local fire was predominantly burning wood, vegetation, and structures near Fort Ord in Marina, California, USA, and the smoke was very bright, indicating a high single scattering albedo. In all examples, PA measurements at 676 nm were compared with those from a PSAP modified to measure at three wavelengths, including 660 nm.

The model provides upper and lower bounds on the number of parties under each type of regime. It is shown that a regime with two agreements can Pareto dominate a regime based on a single global treaty.

Policy makers, however, are wary because of the widespread perception that these technologies cost more than conventional alternatives so that increasing their deployment will raise overall electricity generating costs. Energy planning represents an investment-decision problem. Investors commonly evaluate such problems using portfolio theory to manage risk and maximize portfolio performance under a variety of unpredictable economic outcomes. Energy planners need to similarly abandon their reliance on traditional, ""least-cost"" stand-alone kWh generating cost measures and instead evaluate conventional and renewable energy sources on the basis of their portfolio cost - their cost contribution relative to their risk contribution to a mix of generating assets. Energy security generally focuses on the threat of abrupt supply disruptions. This paper suggests a more profound aspect: mitigating fossil price volatility. An extensive body of research indicates that fossil volatility significantly disrupts the economies of consuming nations, potentially exacting hundreds of billions of dollars from the US and EU economies alone. Energy security is reduced when countries hold inefficient portfolios that are needlessly exposed to fossil price risks. This paper describes essential portfolio-theory ideas and uses three case studies to illustrate how electricity-generating mixes can benefit from additional shares of wind, geothermal and other renewables. Compared to existing, fossil-dominated mixes, efficient portfolios reduce generating cost while including greater renewables shares in the mix thereby enhancing energy security. Though counter-intuitive, the idea that adding more costly renewables can actually reduce portfolio-generating cost is consistent with basic finance theory. An important implication is that in dynamic and uncertain environments, the relative value of generating technologies must be determined not by evaluating alternative resources, but by evaluating alternative resource portfolios. © Springer 2006.","Comparative electricity generating cost; Efficient portfolios; Energy diversity; Fossil risk; Mean-variance portfolio-theory; Renewables; Risk-return; Security","climate change; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy planning; mitigation; policy implementation; renewable resource; Eurasia; Europe; European Union; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746580332

Thus far, the main areas of application have been in the steel, chemical and ceramic industries, where the technology has shown that NOx emissions can be lowered significantly while maintaining high efficiency. These advantages and other additional benefits are beginning to attract the attention of the gas turbine community in the power generation and aircraft industry sectors. In general, FO embodies partially premixed and diffusion reaction. Therefore, a validated methodology is needed, which can handle this complication in a manner enabling gas turbine combustor design calculations to be efficiently performed. The present paper concerns the validation of such a methodology and its application to a prototype gas turbine design. It follows a previous validation study of proposed FO modelling, covering a wide range of FO laboratory scale combustion facilities. Very useful agreement was demonstrated. In the first part of the present study, predictions of a recently constructed afterburner device, operated under gas turbine FO conditions, are performed to assess the validity of the model for gas turbine application. Thereafter, the method is applied to a new gas turbine combustor design. The conditions required to secure the FO regime therein are identified. Simulation of the new combustor shows encouraging results that demonstrate the potential for NOx reduction and improved pattern factors offered by FO combustion.","Flameless oxidation; High temperature air combustion application; Turbulent combustion","Air combustion; Flameless oxidation; Turbulent combustion; Combustion; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Gas turbines; High temperature operations; Nitrogen compounds; Oxidation; Turbulence; Combustors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745736455

A new class of metastable metal hydroperoxides is described that involves the rearrangement of the ground-state metal hydroperoxide to its inverted isomeric form with a hydroxyl radical hydrogen bonded to the metal oxide (MO-OH → MO....HO). The activation energy for this somersault motion of the FeO-OH group is 20.3 kcal/mol for the P450 model porphyrin iron(III) hydroperoxide [Por(SH)Fe(III)-OOH-] to produce the isomeric ferryl oxygen hydrogen bonded to an •OH radical [Por(SH)Fe(III)-O....HO-]. This isomeric metastable hydroperoxide, the proposed primary oxidant in the P450 hydroxylation reaction, is calculated to be 17.8 kcal/mol higher in energy than the ground-state iron(III) hydroperoxide Cpd 0. The first step of the proposed mechanism for isobutane oxidation is abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond of isobutane by the hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl radical to produce a water molecule strongly hydrogen bonded to anionic Cpd II. The hydroxylation step involves a concerted but nonsynchronous transfer of a hydrogen atom from this newly formed, bound, water molecule to the ferryl oxygen with a concomitant rebound of the incipient •OH radical to the carbon radical of isobutane to produce the C-O bond of the final product, tert-butyl alcohol. The TS for the oxygen rebound step is 2 kcal/mol lower in energy than the hydrogen abstraction TS (ΔE‡ = 19.5 kcal/mol).

In this study, formal risk concepts were introduced in decision-makers' meetings according to local demands and following a participatory approach, as a first step towards integrating risk assessment into rural decision-making in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Semi-structured interviews and meetings were conducted with extensionists and farmers. The following information was presented and discussed: (1) the time series and frequency distribution of maize yield predictions, simulated by the GAPS computer program for 16 feasible planting dates, representing climatic risks, both within and between years; and (2) a simple economic analysis (gross margin) and income probabilities for seven land-use options over a recent five-year period, followed by an interactive exercise where probabilities of achieving user-supplied target gross margins were calculated according to participants' actual information, using the computer program @RISK. This paper also investigates decision-makers' attitudes towards risk, and how these were influenced by objective information. Although results from a study such as this are not definitive, considering that the effects of the information on actual decision-making require some time to become evident, it was already possible to conclude that the risk-orientated information presented according to local demands and following a participatory approach had a positive impact on decision-makers' understanding and perceptions. This approach should be further explored to effectively integrate risk assessment into rural decision-making. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of hydrogen in a fuel cell offers the highest fuel conversion efficiency compared with all other technologies and it also has the potential to substantially reduce greenhouse gas and particulate emissions at least at the end-user sites. One of the major barriers to the introduction of the hydrogen economy and its wider acceptance is the lack of the rather costly hydrogen generation, transportation and distribution infrastructure to meet the local transport fuel demands. On-site or distributed hydrogen generation would remove the need for this up-front infrastructure requirements and assist with the early large-scale trials of the fuel cell technology for both transport and stationary applications and also introduction of the hydrogen economy. In this paper, the development of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis technology for on-site, on-demand hydrogen generation has been discussed. The major emphasis is given on reducing catalyst cost; interface design and modifications; interconnect materials, design and fabrication; and investigation of the sources of degradation. Stacks to 2 kWH 2 capacity have been constructed and tested and show initial efficiencies of &gt;87% at 1 A cm-2.","Electrolysis; Hydrogen production; Polymer electrolyte membrane; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746871067

The rate of soil desiccation is a significant determinant of the availability of fine soil particles for entrainment in air as dust. Dust suppressants such as polymer solutions can reduce soil desiccation rate, thereby reducing dust emission factor. Herein, a dust emission estimation methodology that involves the integration of desiccation time curves to find the average desiccation rate is formulated. This is combined with soil characteristics, stressor (environmental and possibly vehicle) characteristics and liquid content in soil to estimate potential emission factors. Using this methodology, the dust suppression potential of aqueous polyethylene oxide (PEO) solution was investigated experimentally with Na-montmorillonite (Na-mmt) as the model dust-generating material. PEO with a molecular weight of 8 × 106 and at aqueous concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 g/L, was mixed with 10 g of Na-mmt (surface area = 31.82 ± 0.22 m2/g) and desiccated for 700 h in a specially designed chamber at 25 °C and 30% relative humidity. The results show that generally, aqueous PEO is superior to distilled water as a dust suppressant for Na-mmt at concentrations in the range of 0.5-2.0 g/L. The experimental data obtained are introduced into the formulated estimation methodology, and potential emissions of dust from PEO-admixed Na-mmt are determined. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Policy makers and stakeholders require robust tools to evaluate national scale policy scenarios. Models for robust scenario analysis must combine the best available biophysical and economic information, and include understanding of uncertainties. I evaluate three different datasets as candidates for estimating the biological net primary production (NPP) of pastoral and forest land, as well as C sequestration potential under exotic or indigenous forest. For scenario analysis of land‐use change, estimating NPP is critical to represent the flow of agricultural and forest production into the economy, while estimating C sequestration potential in forests is required to estimate the quantity of C available for credits and liabilities. First, a 4‐year average of NASA's 1 km annual NPP product from the MODIS satellite sensor was verified using published New Zealand data, and used to test and calibrate the following indices. The MODIS NPP data were compared to average stocking indices for pasture and site indices for Pinus radiata forests derived from 10‐ to 3 0‐year‐old mapping in the Land Resources Inventory (LRI). Third, a “Storie Index” approach was developed using factors representing climate and soil properties that co‐limit potential productivity, and calibrated to MODIS NPP. Each approach represents the apparent variation in NPP at the national scale, but may risk serious errors at a more local scale. The calibrated Storie Index approach offers the best predictions for pastoral and tussock land (R2= 0.71) and indigenous forest (R2 = 0.38), while the LRI‐derived site index is most predictive for exotic forests (R2 = 0.16). While both the LRI‐derived indices and the “Storie Index” are recommended for modelling policy scenarios, the “Storie Index” approach shows the greatest versatility because it does not depend on current or past land use for estimation, provides the highest level of spatial detail, and can easily be improved. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, Ltd.","Forest; Kyoto Protocol; MODIS; Net primary productivity (NPP); Pasture; Storie Index","agricultural policy; forestry policy; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; MODIS; pasture; policy making; Australasia; New Zealand; Pinus radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646846294

The isotopic composition values of precipitation and groundwater are almost identical. The spatial variation of stable isotopes in precipitation is mainly due to the effect of seasonal temperature, altitude and amount. The groundwater reveals identical variation in isotopic composition to the precipitation due to direct recharge and the karstic nature of the outcropping Turonian aquifer. Tritium levels in wells are high and their content is similar to the weighted mean value of tritium content in precipitation, indicating local recharge and low residence time. The 14C activity in the tritiated groundwater is found to be about half of the 14C activity of precipitation in the region. A geochemical evolution through dissolution of carbonate by water-carbonate rock interactions reduced the atmospheric 14C activity from 114 to 61 pmc in the groundwater. A 14C of around 61 pmc and 7.6-TU values are considered the initial concentration for the recharge in the shallow carbonate aquifer in the Yarmouk Basin. The large fluctuation of water level in observation wells during the rainy season indicates the sensitivity and direct response of the aquifer to the recharge. The chemical composition of the groundwater (Ca2+-HCO3-) gives emphasis to the short duration of water rock interaction and indicates dissolution of the carbonate aquifer. The elevated concentrations of Cl- and NO3- in groundwater are attributed to anthropogenic sources. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Contamination; Environmental isotopes; Groundwater age; Hydrochemistry; Water-rock interaction","groundwater pollution; hydrochemistry; residence time; stable isotope; water-rock interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144463311

Forty consecutive male patients with unilateral, reducible inguinal hernias were studied prospectively. All patients underwent surgery under local anaesthesia, the first 20 with unbuffered solution and the next 20 using buffered solution. Pain scores were obtained for the infiltration in the anaesthetic room and for the total surgical procedure. In addition, satisfaction scores were obtained at the end of the procedure. The mean pain score for the initial infiltration of unbuffered anaesthetic was 3.00 (range 0-5), and for the buffered anaesthetic it was 1.45 (range 0-4), P=0.02. The mean pain score for the entire procedure for the unbuffered group was 3.05 (range 0-6), and for the buffered group it was 1.45 (range 0-5), P=0.02.

Standard stellar models predict that the 3He/H abundance ratios for PNe should be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the primordial value (3He/H ∼ 10 -5 by number) determined from Galactic H II region abundances and confirmed by WMAP cosmic microwave background results. Chemical evolution models suggest that fewer than 5% of all PNe enrich the interstellar medium (ISM) with 3He at the level of standard stellar models. Our target PNe are therefore anomalous in that they were selected from a sample deliberately biased to contain objects with properties that maximized the likelihood of a 3He detection by the VLA. We have detected the 8.665 GHz hyperfine 3He+ transition in J320 at the 4 σ level. The 3He/H abundance ratio is 1.9 × 10-3 with roughly a factor of 2 uncertainty. For NGC 6572 we find an upper limit of 3He/H ≲ 10-3. This detection of 3He in J320 makes it the second PN known to have an anomalously high 3He abundance, confirming that at least some low-mass stars produce significant amounts of 3He that survives to the PN stage and enriches the ISM. © 2006.

The free volume was characterized by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). For this study, we prepared three series of copolymers of methacrylates with various semi-fluorinated methacrylates with increasing fractional number of fluorine atoms fF. Moreover some commercial fluoroelastomers and semicrystalline fluoropolymers were investigated. After the subtraction of a narrow para-positronium DBAR component, calculated on a simplified way using the PALS data, from the conventional Doppler broadened annihilation energy line, the remaining broad distribution shows no response to the size of free volume holes or the positronium formation probability but can be related to the nature and density of the chemical species in the vicinity of the holes. Element specific information of the annihilation site can be expressed in terms of an integral parameter, e.g. the normalised curve shape parameter Sb n of the broad DBAR component. We observed that Sb n does not show the expected exponential decrease but goes down linearly with fF in the range fF&lt;0.45 and levels-off for fF≥0.5. This was explained assuming positronium localization and annihilation in two types of holes: holes, which have walls free of fluorine atoms and holes, which contain fluorine in their walls. A steeper, exponential-like decrease of Sb n with fF seem to occur for the fluoroelastomeric and semicrystalline fluoropolymers which contain not less than one F atom per two backbone carbons. In this, the case ortho-positronium localized at a hole will always find at least one fluorine atom in which neighbourhood it can annihilate. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this scheme, the electron-wave interaction space is divided into two regions due to magnetic field profiling. In the first (input) region, the magnetic field is such that the working traveling wave is relatively far from the resonance with electrons. It is established that, under certain conditions, the motion of electrons in a nonresonant wave field is accompanied by their effective bunching without significant changes in the energy. In the second (output) region, the magnetic field is close to the resonance and the bunched electron beam effectively radiates at the working wave frequency. Thus, the regular electrodynamic system features an electron-wave interaction of the klystron type with spatially separated processes of the electron bunching and wave emission. The proposed scheme can be used for increasing the efficiency of CRMs with various configurations. It is especially advantageous in CRMs with frequency multiplication, where the electron bunching in a low-frequency nonresonant wave field is accompanied by wave emission at a multiple frequency. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644665616

We report here the crystal structures of 14 cyclic and fused ring gem-alkynols, compounds that are known for their supramolecular inconsistency because of the juxtaposition of two hydrogen-bond donors (O-H, C≡C-H) and two hydrogen-bond acceptors (O-H, C≡C-H) in the molecules. Because of the competition between these hydrogen-bond donors, or hydrogen-bond acceptors, the packing pattern in any particular crystal structure is highly sensitive to substitution by functional groups. The compounds studied here are methyl and chloro derivatives of the parent compounds 1a (benzo series, 1b-1f), 2a (naphtha series, 2b-2f), 3a and 4a (anthra series, 3b, 4b-4d). Structures 2a and 4a are prototypes because the O-H⋯O, C-H⋯O, O-H⋯π, and C-H⋯π hydrogen bonds form sheets in these cases with the interdigitating hydrocarbon residues perpendicular to the sheets. The hydrogen bonds are arranged to give centrosymmetric synthons I and II, which are noteworthy for their robustness. Orthogonality of the hydrogen-bonded and hydrocarbon regions in these crystals leads to structural insulation so that the addition of an extra fused ring in going from, say, 2a to 4a, leaves the structure unaltered. Many types of methyl substitution on these rings also preserve the packing so that it may be inferred that methyl substitution is supramolecularly akin to benzo annelation in these compounds. A new synthon [(I)0.5(II)0.5], which is a hybrid of synthons I and II, is also observed. This hybrid, H, is thermodynamically comparable to synthons I and II because it contains the same cooperative network of strong and weak hydrogen bonds, O-H⋯-O-H⋯C≡C-H⋯C≡C- H⋯O-H⋯, which is the key structural element in this family. Chloro substitution is in general more aggressive than methyl substitution, and Cl/Me exchange does not operate in the benzene series. In contrast, Cl/Me exchange perturbs only some elements of the crystal packing in the naphthalene series. Also observed is a homology between crystal structures related by a naphtha/anthra exchange. Identifying robust supramolecular synthons and proving their repetition is a challenging task in a system as fragile as the gem-alkynols, and we note that prior to this work there was no repetition of a major hydrogen-bonded supramolecular synthon in the 144 gem-alkynols with published crystal structures. Also noteworthy is that synthons I, II, and H are fairly large-the real challenge in crystal engineering is to find a big enough synthon that occurs often enough. Large synthons that occur frequently constitute the most useful structural domains in crystal families, and we believe that we have identified such a domain in the gem-alkynol group of compounds. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646378664

A simple theoretical model shows that particles smaller than 400 μm will begin to thermally degrade and release disproportionately large quantities of HAPs. This is confirmed in full-scale practice where particles smaller than 500 μm show visible signs of charring. Laboratory measurement of the activation energy for the breakdown of wood tissue into methanol and formaldehyde led to a value of about 17 kcal/mol. The apparent activation energy measured in the field was higher. This result was obtained under nonisothermal conditions and is biased high by the fines fraction of the furnish, which is exposed to elevated temperatures. It is proposed that a combination of screening out the fines fraction smaller than 500 μm and reducing the dryer inlet temperature will substantially reduce emissions, possibly to the point where control devices can be downsized or eliminated. Our findings allow these HAPs reductions to be semiquantitatively estimated. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation energy; Drying; Formaldehyde; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Methanol; Pyrolysis; Wood; Dryer inlet temperature; Hazardous air pollutants (HAP); Wood flakes; Wood tissue; Air pollution; formaldehyde; methanol; Activation energy; Air pollution; Drying; Formaldehyde; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Methanol; Pyrolysis; Wood; activation energy; emission; hazardous waste; methanol; pollution control; wood; air pollutant; airflow; article; chemical reaction; flow rate; Fourier transformation; hazardous waste; industrial waste; infrared spectrometry; nonhuman; pine; process design; temperature; tree; United States; wood; Air Pollutants; Hazardous Substances; Wood; Activation Energy; Air Pollution; Drying; Emission; Formaldehyde; Methanol; Pyrolysis; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645753550

A research aircraft was used to determine the microphysical and chemical properties of airborne particulate metal emissions from the Nanticoke coal-fired power-generating station located on the north shore of Lake Erie, Ontario, and the Horne copper smelter at Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. These properties are critical to the determination of the deposition rates of the metals emitted, and hence the potential for these species to have impacts on local or distant ecosystems. An overview of the measurements made during the study is given. The size distributions of particles emitted from the stacks and observed within 5 km of the point of emission are briefly described. After dilution by ambient air, the concentration of particles smaller than 0.135 μm in diameter in the plumes is tens of thousands per cubic centimetre, far exceeding the concentrations found in ambient air.

For this reason, many advanced active and passive remote sensors have been used to study phytoplankton dynamics, since such phenomena are thought to be responsible for the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, one of the most important greenhouse gases. In this paper, one laser system and three satellite radiometers routinely used for the study of the phytoplankton dynamics will be briefly reviewed. Satellite sensors have been preferred to airborne sensors because, to our knowledge, ocean color airborne radiometers have not been operated in Antarctica, at least not throughout the whole lapse of time examined in this study. Particular focus was on the laser system (ELF) and on a specific satellite radiometer (SeaWiFS). ELF is based on the laser-induced fluorescence of phytoplankton pigments and was conceived for the Italian expeditions to Antarctica. The goal of SeaWiFS is to provide the Earth science community with quantitative data on the global ocean bio-optical properties. Such satellite radiometer has been calibrated with in situ data mainly acquired in non polar regions. This is why a comparison between ELF and SeaWiFS measurements of chlorophyll-a surface concentrations in the Southern Ocean during the austral summer 1997-1998 was believed to be significant. Our results indicate that SeaWiFS overestimates high concentrations and underestimates low concentrations. In order to correct this behavior, the chlorophyll-a bio-optical algorithm of SeaWiFS has been recalibrated according to the measurements of ELF, thus providing a new estimation of the primary production in the Southern Ocean.","Antarctica; Chlorophyll-a; LIDAR fluorosensor; Primary production; Satellite radiometer; SeaWiFS calibration","biogeochemical cycle; calibration; laser method; ocean color; phytoplankton; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite data",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747183075

It explains how further technological change might be induced by mitigation policies so as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize atmospheric concentrations. These are the first results of a structural econometric approach to modeling the global economy using the model E3MG (energy-environment-economy model of the globe), which in turn constitutes one component in the Community Integrated Assessment System (CIAS) of the UK Tyndall Centre. The model is simplified to provide a post-Keynesian view of the long- run, with an indicator of technological progress affecting each region's exports and energy use. When technological progress is endogenous in this way, long-run growth in global GDP is partly explained by the model. Average permit prices and tax rates about $430tC (1995) prices after 2050 are sufficient to stabilize atmospheric concentrations at 450ppm CO2 after 2100. They also lead to higher economic growth.

Inclusion of a self-thinning mechanism connects the individual to the larger-scale population and, being based on the conservation of mass, all mass flux processes are integral to the formulation. Significantly, disturbance (both regular and stochastic) and its impact at larger scales are included in the formulation. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how this model can be used to predict patch and ecosystem dry mass, and consequently system carbon. Examples from pine plantations and mixed forests are considered, with these applications requiring estimates of system carrying capacity and the growth rates of individual plants. The results indicate that the model is relatively simple and straightforward to apply, and its predictions compare well with the data. A significant feature of this approach is that the impact of local scale data on the dynamics of larger patch and ecosystem scales can be determined explicitly, as we show by example. Further, the general formulation has an analytic solution based on characteristics of the individual, facilitating practical and predictive application. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Allometrics; Carbon accounting; Dynamical modeling; Patch dynamics; Population dynamics; Scaling; Self-thinning","carbon cycle; population dynamics; self thinning; adaptation; algorithm; article; artificial neural network; biological model; computer simulation; ecology; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; plant; plant physiology; population dynamics; standard; Adaptation, Physiological; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Ecology; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Neural Networks (Computer); Plant Physiology; Plants, Edible; Population Dynamics; Weights and Measures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645109340

In particular, the non-Gaussian maps have been generated as a mixture of a Gaussian CMB map and a cosmic strings map in different proportions. First, we extract the CMB component from simulated multifrequency Planck data (in small patches of the sky) using the maximum-entropy method (MEM), Wiener filter (WF) and a method based on the subtraction of foreground templates plus a linear combination of frequency channels (LCFC). We then apply a wavelet-based method to study the Gaussianity of the recovered CMB and compare it with the same analysis for the input map. When the original CMB map is Gaussian (and assuming that point sources have been removed), we find that neither MEM nor WF introduce non-Gaussianity in the CMB reconstruction. Regarding the LCFC, the Gaussian character is also preserved provided that the appropriate combination of frequency channels is used. On the contrary, if the input CMB map is non-Gaussian, all the studied methods produce a reconstructed CMB with lower detections of non-Gaussianity than the original map. This effect is mainly due to the presence of instrumental noise in the data, which clearly affects the quality of the reconstructions. In this case, MEM tends to produce slightly higher non-Gaussian detections in the reconstructed map than WF whereas the detections are lower for the LCFC. We have also studied the effect of point sources in the MEM reconstruction. If no attempt to remove point sources is performed, they clearly contaminate the CMB reconstruction, introducing spurious non-Gaussianity. When the brightest point sources are removed from the data using the Mexican Hat Wavelet, the Gaussian character of the CMB is preserved. However, when analysing larger regions of the sky, the variance of our estimators will be appreciably reduced and, in this case, we expect the point source residuals to introduce spurious non-Gaussianity in the CMB distribution. Therefore, a careful subtraction (or masking) of point source emission is crucial in order to be able to perform Gaussian analysis of the CMB. © 2006 RAS.","Cosmic microwave background; Methods: data analysis; Techniques: image processing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645836132

Methods: We used data from a matched case-control study conducted through 11 hospitals in the United States that included a complete residential history for each patient and type of drinking water (public, private well, bottled) used at each address. Our analysis was limited to cases less than 20 years old. We standardized fluoride exposure estimates based on CDC-recommended target levels that take climate into account. We categorized exposure into three groups (<30%, 30-99%, >99% of target) and used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios. Results: Analysis is based on 103 cases under the age of 20 and 215 matched controls. For males, the unadjusted odds ratios for higher exposures were greater than 1.0 at each exposure age, reaching a peak of 4.07 (95% CI 1.43, 11.56) at age 7 years for the highest exposure. Adjusting for potential confounders produced similar results with an adjusted odds ratio for males of 5.46 (95% CI 1.50, 19.90) at age 7 years. This association was not apparent among females. Conclusions: Our exploratory analysis found an association between fluoride exposure in drinking water during childhood and the incidence of osteosarcoma among males but not consistently among females.

We evaluated the role of two representative Cerrado Oxisols (350 and 650 g clay kg-1) as sources or sinks of atmospheric C when managed under three tillage systems (conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-till (NT)) in 8- and 5-year long-term experiments. A literature review was also carried out and the mean C sequestration rates in no-till soils of tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil were calculated and compared with values for soils from temperate regions of the world. The original C stocks in 0-20 cm layer of soils under native Cerrado were higher in the clayey (54.0 Mg ha-1) than in the sandy clay loam soil (35.4 Mg ha-1), suggesting a higher physical stability of organic matter associated with variable clay minerals in the clayey Oxisol. The original C stocks of the native Cerrado soils appear not to have decreased after 23 years of conventional tillage in the sandy clay loam Oxisol, except when the soil had been subjected to erosion (15% loss of C), or after 25 years in the clayey Oxisol. Compared to conventionally tilled soil, the C stocks in no-till sandy clay loam Oxisol increased by 2.4 Mg ha-1 (C sequestration rate = 0.30 Mg ha-1 year-1) and in the clayey Oxisol by 3.0 Mg ha-1 (C sequestration rate = 0.60 Mg ha -1 year-1). The mean rate of C sequestration in the no-till Brazilian tropical soils was estimated to be 0.35 Mg ha-1 year-1, similar to the 0.34 Mg ha-1 year-1 reported for soils from temperate regions but lower than the 0.48 Mg ha -1 year-1 estimated for southern Brazilian subtropical soils. Considering the large area (about 70 million hectares) of the Cerrado which is currently used and potentially available for cropland, the adoption of no-till systems could turn the Cerrado soils into a significant sink for atmospheric C and contribute to the mitigation of global climate change. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Decisions with regard to industry, transportation, and development will affect air pollution and health both in the short term and in the far future through climate change. We investigated the pollution health consequences of modest changes in fossil fuel use for three case study cities in Latin American: Mexico City, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and São Paulo, Brazil. Annual levels of ozone and particulate matter were estimated from 2000 to 2020 for two emissions scenarios: (1) business-as-usual based on current emissions patterns and regulatory trends and (2) a control policy aimed at lowering air pollution emissions. The resulting air pollution levels were linked to health endpoints through concentration-response functions derived from epidemiological studies, using local studies where available. Results indicate that the air pollution control policy would have vast health benefits for each of the three cities, averting numerous adverse health outcomes including over 156,000 deaths, 4 million asthma attacks, 300,000 children's medical visits, and almost 48,000 cases of chronic bronchitis in the three cities over the 20-year period. The economic value of the avoided health impacts is roughly $21 to $165 billion (US). Sensitivity analysis shows that the control policy yields significant health and economic benefits even with relaxed assumptions with regard to population growth, pollutant concentrations for the control policy, concentration-response functions, and economic value of health outcomes. This research demonstrates the health and economic burden from air pollution in Latin American urban centers and the magnitude of health benefits from control policies. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The external effects we consider are those on landscape quality, wildlife and air quality. We also consider the welfare implications of different investment strategies for employment and electricity prices. The methodology used to do this is the choice experiment technique. Renewable technologies considered include hydro, on-shore and off-shore wind power and biomass. Welfare changes for different combinations of impacts associated with different investment strategies are estimated.

The focus is on vitrification of ashes arising from the incineration of municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage sludge in terms of their composition, glass melting and reuse potential. The conclusion is that the high compositional variability of these and other wastes tends to preclude their use in many applications.

They observed a strong weekend effect in the Atlanta region, with median daytime (6:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) decreases of 62%, 57%, and 31%, respectively, in the ambient levels of NO, NOx, and CO from Wednesdays to Sundays, during the ozone season (March to October). They also observed significant decreases in ambient VOC levels between Wednesdays and Sundays, with decreases of 28% for the sum of aromatic compounds and 19% for the sum of Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations target compounds. Despite large reductions in O3 precursor levels on weekends, day-of-week differences in O3 mixing ratios in and near Atlanta were much smaller. Averaging overall O3-season days, the 1-hr and 8-hr mean peak daily O3 maxima on Sundays were 4.5% and 2.3% lower, respectively, than their mean levels on Wednesdays (median of 14 site differences), with no sites showing statistically significant Wednesday-to-Sunday differences. When restricted to high-O3 days (highest 3 peak O3 days per day of week per site per year), the 1-hr and 8-hr Sunday O3 mixing ratios were 11% and 10% lower, respectively, than their mean peak levels on Wednesdays (median of 14 site differences), with 6 of 14 sites showing statistically significant Wednesday-to-Sunday differences.

However, the production lines are not flexible enough to meet today's requirements because of some complex dynamics and rigid operational practices. The benefit of applying modelling and simulation techniques in pulp and papermaking manufacturing processes will favour a better understanding of the mechanism involved in the processes and their control loops. This will allow papermakers to find solutions for currently pending problems in the paper industry, such as fast grade changes, improvement of paper quality, optimising the wet end chemistry, enhancing runnability and reducing emissions by improving process design, process monitoring and decision support during operation. Due to the importance of the topic at European level, a COST Action has been initiated for promoting the development and application of modelling and simulation techniques in pulp and paper manufacturing processes.

We investigated the impacts of variable rates of stover removal from no-till (NT) continuous corn systems on SOC and soil structural properties after 1 year of stover removal in three soils in Ohio: Rayne silt loam (fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludults) at Coshocton, Hoytville clay loam (fine, illitic, mesic Mollic Epiaqualfs) at Hoytville, and Celina silt loam (fine, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs) at South Charleston. This study also assessed relationships between SOC and soil structural properties as affected by stover management. Six stover treatments that consisted of removing 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0, and adding 100% of corn stover corresponding to 0 (T0), 1.25 (T1.25), 2.50 (T2.5), 3.75 (T3.75), 5.00 (T5), and 10.00 (T10) Mg ha of stover, respectively, were studied for their total SOC concentration, bulk density (ρb), aggregate stability, and tensile strength (TS) of aggregates. Effects of stover removal on soil properties were rapid and significant in the 0- to 5-cm depth, although the magnitude of changes differed among soils after only 1 year of stover removal. The SOC concentration declined with increase in removal rates in silt loams but not in clay loam soils. It decreased by 39% at Coshocton and 30% at Charleston within 1 year of complete stover removal. At the same sites, macroaggregates contained 10% to 45% more SOC than microaggregates. Stover removal reduced >4.75-mm macroaggregates and increased microaggregates (P < 0.01). Mean weight diameter (MWD) and TS of aggregates in soils without stover (T0) were 1.7 and 3.3 times lower than those in soils with normal stover treatments (T5) across sites. The SOC concentration was negatively correlated with ρb and positively with MWD and LogTS. Stover removal at rates as low as 1.25 Mg ha reduced SOC and degraded soil structure even within 1 year, but further monitoring is needed to establish threshold levels of stover removal in relation to changes in soil quality.

Using two pepper cultivars, 'Triton' (sweet) and 'PI 140367' (hot), we investigated how the development of seeds is affected by the gases surrounding them. The atmospheric composition of the seed environment was characterized during development by analysis of samples withdrawn from the fruit locule with a gas-tight syringe. As seed weight plateaued during development, the seed environment reached its lowest O 2 concentration (19%) and highest CO2 concentration (3%). We experimentally manipulated the seed environment by passing different humidified gas mixtures through the fruit Iocule at a rate of 60 to 90 mL·min-1. A synthetic atmosphere containing 3% CO2, 21% O2, and 76% N2 was used to represent a standard seed environment. Seeds developing inside locules supplied with this mixture had enhanced average seed weight, characterized by lower variation than in the no-flow controls due to fewer low-weight seeds. The importance of O2 in the seed microenvironment was demonstrated by reduction in seed weight when the synthetic atmosphere contained only 15% O2 and by complete arrest of embryo development when O2 was omitted from the seed atmosphere. Removal of CO2 from the synthetic atmosphere had no effect on seed weight, however, the CO2-free treatment accelerated fruit ripening by 4 days in the hot pepper. In the sweet peppers, fruit wall starch and sucrose were reduced by the CO2-free treatment. The results demonstrate that accretionary seed growth is being limited in pepper by O2 availability and suggest that variation in seed quality is attributable to localized limitations in O2 supply.","Carbohydrate; Hypoxia; Internal atmosphere; Protein; Starch","Capsicum annuum; Capsicum annuum var. annuum; Capsicum frutescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30944468294

The sensitivity of the Ecotube locations in a combustion chamber and the injection angle of jets on the Ecotube have been analysed numerically. A municipal solid waste incinerator and a coal fired boiler are the focus of this work. A definition of the heat release distribution ratio is proposed to identify the heat release inside the upper furnace of boilers or incinerators. Results show that an Ecotube system allows a far more uniform heat release, lower CO and NOx, emissions, and a more uniform temperature distribution, thus a longer life of the furnace chamber. Additionally, the combustion reaction zone occupies as high as 45% of the whole combustion chamber using an Ecotube system, ∼40% higher than a conventional multijet mixing system.","Boiler; Combustion; Incinerator; Numerical simulation; Turbulence","Ecotube system; Grate fired furnaces; Solid waste incinerator; Carbon monoxide; Coal fired boilers; Combustion chambers; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Jets; Nitrogen compounds; Solid wastes; Temperature distribution; Turbulence; Refuse incinerators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745760287

Here a novel approach to computing a mean dynamic topography (MDT), together with an error field, is presented for the northern North Atlantic. The method uses an ensemble of MDTs, each of which has been produced by the assimilation of hydrographic data into a numerical ocean model, to form a composite MDT, and uses the spread within the ensemble as a measure of the error on this MDT. The r.m.s. error for the composite MDT is 3.2 cm, and for the associated geostrophic currents the r.m.s. error is 2.5 cm s-1. Taylor diagrams are used to compare the composite MDT with several MDTs produced by a variety of alternative methods. Of these, the composite MDT is found to agree remarkably well with an MDT based on the GRACE geoid GGM01C. It is shown how the composite MDT and its error field are useful validation products against which other MDTs and their error fields can be compared. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Geostrophic currents; Mean dynamic topography; Ocean circulation","Numerical methods; Ocean currents; Topography; Alternative methods; Earth's climate; Error field; Geostrophic currents; Geostrophic surface currents; Hydrographic data; Intercomparisons; Mean dynamic topographies; North Atlantic; Ocean circulation; Ocean dynamic topographies; Ocean model; Sea surfaces; Surface topography; sea water; article; comparative study; image processing; methodology; oceanography; reproducibility; sea; statistics; water flow; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Oceanography; Oceans and Seas; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design; Seawater; Water Movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645565848

The phosphorylation state of EIIAGlc governs transport and metabolism of a number of carbohydrates. When glucose as preferred carbon source is transported, EIIAGlc becomes predominantly unphosphorylated and allosterically inhibits several permeases, including the maltose ATP-binding cassette transport system (MalFGK2) in a process termed ""inducer exclusion."" We have mapped the binding surface of EIIA Glc that interacts with the MalK subunits by using synthetic cellulose-bound peptide arrays like pep scan- and substitutional analyses. Three regions constituting two binding sites were identified encompassing residues 69-79 (I), 87-91 (II), and 118-127 (III). Region III is MalK-specific, whereas residues from regions I and II partly overlap but are not identical to the binding interfaces for interaction with glycerol kinase and lactose permease. These results were fully verified by studying the inhibitory effect of purified EIIAGlc variants carrying mutations at positions representative of each of the three regions on the ATPase activity of the purified maltose transport complex reconstituted into proteoliposomes.

Here, using the pH-sensitive fluorophore 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), we show that smooth muscle cells of intact mouse mesenteric, coronary, and cerebral small arteries all display a sodium-and bicarbonate-dependent pHi recovery after an NH4+-prepulse. The sodium-dependent bicarbonate flux was largely 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′- disulphonic acid (DIDS) sensitive (56% to 91%) and of a magnitude similar to the amiloride-sensitive flux. Additionally, steady-state pHi was lower (0.2 to 0.4 pH units magnitude) in all 3 vascular beds when CO 2/bicarbonate was omitted. RT-PCR analyses showed that NBCn1 (slc4a7) is the only Na+-dependent bicarbonate transporter of the slc4 family detectable at the mRNA level in all 3 vascular beds investigated. Whole-mount immunolabeling and immunogold electron microscopy confirmed the presence of NBCn1 protein in the sarcolemma of mouse mesenteric small arterial smooth muscle cells. Intact mouse mesenteric small arteries were electropermeated to facilitate transfection with small interfering RNA targeting NBCn1, which resulted in an approximate 43% decrease in the ratio of NBCn1 to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. After knock-down, we found a decreased steady-state pHi (0.21±0.08 pH units) as well as a 68±10% decrease in the net Na+-dependent, amiloride- insensitive base influx after acid load. Finally, omission of CO 2/bicarbonate resulted in a decreased contractile response to norepinephrine after sustained exposure to the agonist, underlining the importance of CO2/bicarbonate for vascular contractility. We conclude that NBCn1 mediates the Na+-dependent bicarbonate transport important for pHi regulation in smooth muscle cells of mouse mesenteric, coronary, and cerebral small arteries. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.","Bicarbonate; Intracellular pH; NBC; siRNA; Vascular smooth muscle cells","2',7' bis(2 carboxyethyl) 5 carboxyfluorescein; 4,4' diisothiocyanatostilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid; amiloride; ammonia; bicarbonate; cell protein; fluorescein; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; protein NBCn1; protein slc4a7; sodium ion; unclassified drug; 4,4' diisothiocyanatostilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid; bicarbonate; bicarbonate sodium cotransporter; carbon dioxide; noradrenalin; Slc4a7 protein, mouse; small interfering RNA; sodium; sodium proton exchange protein; animal cell; animal tissue; antibody labeling; article; bicarbonate blood level; blood vessel reactivity; brain artery; cell pH; controlled study; coronary artery; immunogold electron microscopy; male; mesenteric artery; mouse; nonhuman; pH measurement; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; smooth muscle fiber; steady state; vascular smooth muscle; vasoconstriction; animal; cytology; drug effect; genetic transfection; genetics; metabolism; pH; physiology; transport at the cellular level; 4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid; Animals; Bicarbonates; Biological Transport; Carbon Dioxide; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Male; Mice; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Norepinephrine; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Small Interfering; Sodium; Sodium-Bicarbonate Symporters; Sodium-Hydrogen Antiporter; Transfection; Vasoconstriction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645310698

As the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) covers only part of domestic carbon emissions, it implies a segmented environmental regulation scheme: Each EU Member State must specify additional domestic abatement policies for the sectors outside the EU-ETS in order to meet its emissions budget under the EU Burden Sharing Agreement. We highlight the generic problems of segmented carbon regulation in terms of information requirements for international carbon prices and domestic abatement costs of sectors outside the EU-ETS. Based on numerical simulations for Germany, we quantify the excess costs of segmented carbon regulation and conclude that inefficiencies can be much better explained by lobbying of influential EU-ETS sectors than by information problems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the Apheis-3 phase we quantified the PH impact of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 (particulate matter &lt;2.5 μm) in terms of attributable number of deaths and the potential gain in life expectancy in 23 European cities. Methods: We followed the World Health Organization (WHO) methodology for Health Impact Assessment (HIA) and the Apheis guidelines for data collection and analysis. We used the programme created by PSAS-9 for attributable-cases calculations and the WHO software AirQ to estimate the potential gain in life expectancy. For most cities, PM2.5 levels were calculated from PM10 measurements using a local or European conversion factor. Results: The HIA estimated that 16,926 premature deaths from all causes, including 11,612 cardiopulmonary deaths and 1901 lung-cancer deaths, could be prevented annually if long-term exposure to PM2.5 levels were reduced to 15 μg/m3 in each city. Equivalently, this reduction would increase life expectancy at age 30 by a range between one month and more than two years in the Apheis cities. Conclusions: In addition to the number of attributable cases, our HIA has estimated the potential gain in life expectancy for long-term exposure to fine particles, contributing to a better quantification of the impact of AP on PH in Europe. © Springer 2006.","Air pollution; Europe; Health impact assessment; Life expectancy; Mortality; PM2.5","air pollution; article; cardiovascular disease; computer program; Europe; health care policy; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; information system; life expectancy; long term exposure; lung cancer; mortality; particulate matter; practice guideline; public health; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; world health organization; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Health; Europe; Humans; Life Expectancy; Mortality; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Public Health; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747508577

The present study examines the use of high intensity pulsed plasma beams for surface alloying of the electron-transparent, titanium foil window, through which electrons enter into the flue gas, with the purpose of increasing its resistance to corrosion. The surface alloying, with palladium, to depth of a few hundred nanometres, is carried out under two modes of operation of a rod plasma injector: Pulsed implantation doping (PID) and deposition by pulsed erosion (DPE) modes, using nitrogen as the working gas. The performance of the resultant alloys is evaluated in 0.1 M H2SO4 at 80 °C. The corrosion resistance of the titanium foil is substantially improved by the surface alloying, with a shift in the open-circuit potential of the treated foil toward the region of passivity of titanium. Corrosion rates were slightly lower for the DPE mode of alloying than for the PID mode. The changes in surface regions of the alloyed layers following immersion in the test environment were determined by analytical scanning electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, nuclear reaction analysis and medium energy ion scattering revealing morphologically and compositionally non-uniform alloys and losses of palladium. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Three different biomanipulation treatments were applied. In two parts of the lake, isolated from the rest, fish was removed and one part was used as a reference treatment in which no biomanipulation was applied. Stable isotopes have proved useful to trace trophic interactions at higher food web levels but until now methodological limitations have restricted species specific isotope analysis in the plankton community. We applied a new approach based on the combination of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to trace carbon flow through the planktonic food web. With this method we aimed at obtaining group specific δ13C signatures of phytoplankton and to trace possible shifts in δ13C resulting from fish removal. Biomanipulation led to an increase in transparency and macrophyte biomass and decrease in phytoplankton abundance, but Zooplankton numbers did not increase. Fish removal also resulted in high pH, high O 2, low CO2 and more negative δ13C DIC values than expected, which is attributed to chemical enhanced diffusion with large negative fractionation. Despite high temporal variation we detected differences between the isotopic signatures of the primary producers and between the different treatments. The fractionation values of green algae (∼21‰) and diatoms (∼23‰) were similar and independent of treatment, while fractionation factors of filamentous cyanobacteria were variable between the treatments that differed in CO2 availability. 13C-labeling of the phytoplankton groups showed that biomanipulation led to increased growth rates of green algae and diatoms at the expense of cyanobacteria.

In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of long-term monitoring of the Siberian snowpack on large spatial scales owing to evidence of increased river discharge, changes in snow fall amount and alterations with respect to the timing of ablation. This can currently only be accomplished using remote sensing methods. The main objective of this study is to take advantage of a new land surface forcing and simulation database in order to both improve and evaluate the snow depths retrieved using a dynamic snow depth retrieval algorithm. The dynamic algorithm attempts to account for the spatial and temporal internal properties of the snow cover. The passive microwave radiances used to derive snow depth were measured by the Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) data between July 1987 and July 1995. The evaluation of remotely sensed algorithms is especially difficult over regions such as Siberia which are characterized by relatively sparse surface measurement networks. In addition, existing gridded climatological snow depth databases do not necessarily correspond to the same time period as the available satellite data. In order to evaluate the retrieval algorithm over Siberia for a recent multi-year period at a relatively large spatial scale, a land surface scheme reanalysis product from the Global Soil Wetness Project-Phase 2 (GSWP-2) is used in the current study. First, the high quality GSWP-2 input forcing data were used to drive a land surface scheme (LSS) in order to derive a climatological near-surface soil temperature. Four different snow depth retrieval methods are compared, two of which use the new soil temperature climatology as input. Second, a GSWP-2 snow water equivalent (SWE) climatology is computed from 12 state-of-the-art LSS over the same time period covered by the SSM/I data. This climatology was compared to the corresponding fields from the retrievals. This study reaffirmed the results of recent studies which showed that the inclusion of ancillary data into a satellite data-based snow retrieval algorithm, such as soil temperatures, can significantly improve the results. The current study also goes a step further and reveals the importance of including the monthly soil temperature variation into the retrieval, which improves results in terms of the spatial distribution of the snowpack. Finally, it is shown that further improved predictions of SWE are obtained when spatial and temporal variations in snow density are accounted for. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Energy efficiency in the public sector goes far beyond energy savings and climate protection. Energy efficiency must be seen as a strategy, which deals both with scarce public funds and with profound energy and climate challenges. The gains to be made are substantial. The study assessed the potential for energy and cost savings and the greenhouse gas reductions that are linked to energy efficiency in the European public sector. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first time such an analysis has been carried out. The study concluded that there are no fundamental legal obstacles that would a priori disable the public sector from procuring energy efficient technologies or applying energy efficiency considerations in its daily building management routines. However, at the level of implementation obstacles can occur. It is therefore of paramount importance that there is sufficient political will and adequate incentive systems at all relevant levels. It appeared to be particularly effective when public procurement is energy-efficiency minded in all its operations and life cycle costing is applied for investments instead of conventional public budgeting procedures. The study demonstrates that consistent and EU-wide application of these principles and instruments can result in rather substantial savings both in terms of energy and in terms of money.

The motivations for the workshop are presented here, together with its technical organization. The cases studied range from carbon to gold, and include both steady-state and time-dependent calculations. The set of results represents the current capabilities in kinetics modeling, and illustrates the effectiveness of this workshop approach to code comparisons. It was found that good agreement between codes and with experiments is observed near closed shells, but significant differences exist otherwise, or when density effects are important. On a more general level, we discuss how to meaningfully compare kinetics data. We conclude with plans for the next workshop and for a kinetics database. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Six multiday episodes between 1991 and 1995 were simulated, and the skill of the modeling system was evaluated. Two papers comprise various parts of this study. Part I details the ozone model performance and the methodology that was used to scale discrete episodic pollutant levels to seasonal and annual averages. This paper (part II) addresses issues involved with modeling particulate matter (PM) and its relationship to visibility. For most of the episodes, the fractional error was ∼50% or less for the major constituents of the fine PM (i.e., sulfate [SO4] and organics) in the region. The mean normalized errors and fractional errors are generally larger for the NO3 and soil components, but these components are relatively small. Variations in modeling bias with pollutant levels were also examined. The model showed a systematic overestimation for low levels and an underestimation for high levels for most PM species. For ammonium, the model showed better performance at lower SO4 concentrations when the measured SO4 was assumed to be completely neutralized (ammonium sulfate) and better performance at higher SO4 concentrations when the partially neutralized (ammonium bisulfate) assumption was made. The contributions of various components of PM to reductions in visibility were also calculated; SO4 was found to be the major contributor. © 2006 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Air quality; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Soils; Air quality modeling system; Discrete episodic pollutant; Soil components; Air pollution; ammonia; ammonium sulfate; sulfate; carbon; nitrate; quaternary ammonium derivative; sulfate; air pollution; air quality control; article; methodology; ozone layer; particulate matter; priority journal; soil pollutant; United States; visibility; air pollutant; dust; environmental monitoring; particle size; soil; theoretical model; uncertainty; Air Pollutants; Appalachian Region; Carbon; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Nitrates; Particle Size; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Soil; Sulfates; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645078681

Maria di Galeria (RM), Italy","The study proposes a weathering model of Pliocene-Pleistocene stiff and jointed blue-grey clay transforming into yellow clay. Physical, mineralogical, chemical and textural changes, as well as the weathering profile were investigated in a quarry of central Italy. Based on geological records and inferences, these changes are likely to have occurred within a time-span of about 50,000 years BP, upon overburden stress unloading and in a stress regime that is locally controlled by suction. Weathering propagated into the clay at a rate of about 0.3 mm/year and was enhanced by the enlargement of the pre-existing tectonic discontinuities and by the formation of new joints. A mass loss of about 22-25 wt.% was calculated. Considering Fe and P as immobile elements, the individual oxides contribute to mass loss in the following order: SiO2 &gt; CaO = CO2 &gt; Al2O3 &gt; MgO &gt; K2O &gt; S &gt; Na2O &gt; TiO2 &gt; MnO. The Fe2O3 / (Fe2O3 + FeO) ratio varies from 9-29% in the blue-grey clay to 75-82% in the yellow one. Oxidation and/or dissolution of 7 Å-Fe2+-bearing clay minerals, mica-like minerals and calcite and parallel increase of smectite and Fe-hydroxides play a critical role in the chemical changes and explain the higher plasticity of the yellow clay with respect to the blue-grey one. The role of water during the weathering process was inferred to occur in cyclical steps: 1) seepage of meteoric water; 2) dissemination of highly oxidizing meteoric water; 3) triggering of oxidation and dissolution of minerals; 4) water evaporation; 5) partial migration of the elements contained in the aqueous solution and consequent deposition of minerals in the joints. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

P7B 5E1, Canada","Stand structure, the arrangement and interrelationships of live and dead trees, has been linked to forest regeneration, nutrient cycling, wildlife habitat, and climate regulation. The objective of this review was to synthesize literature on stand structural dynamics of North American boreal forests, addressing both live tree and coarse woody debris (CWD) characteristics under different disturbance mechanisms (fire, clearcut, wind, and spruce budworm), while identifying regional differences based on climate and surficial deposit variability. In fire origin stands, both live tree and CWD attributes are influenced initially largely by the characteristics of the stand replacing fire and later increasingly by autogenic processes. Differences in stand structure have also been observed between various stand cover types. Blowdown and insect outbreaks are two significant non-stand replacing disturbances that can alter forest stand structure through removing canopy trees, freeing up available growing space, and creating microsites for new trees to establish. Climate and surficial deposits are highly variable in the boreal forest due to its extensive geographic range, influencing stand and landscape structure by affecting tree colonization, stand composition, successional trajectories, CWD dynamics, and disturbance regimes including regional fire cycles. Further, predicted climate change scenarios are likely to cause regional-specific alterations in stand and landscape structure, with the implications on ecosystem components including wildlife, biodiversity, and carbon balance still unclear. Some stand structural attributes are found to be similar between clearcut and fire origin stands, but others appear to be quite different. Future research shall focus on examining structural variability under both disturbance regimes and management alternatives emulating both stand replacing and non-stand replacing natural disturbances.

We studied the spatial extent and velocity structure of this cooling gas by obtaining spectra of the O VI doublet in NGC 4636 and NGC 5846 with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. For NGC 4636, the central LWRS pointing shows that the O VI lines are double-peaked and symmetrical about the systemic velocity of the galaxy, with a separation of 210 km s-1. An LWRS observation 30″ from the center failed to show additional O VI emission. For NGC 5846, three spectra were obtained with 4″ × 20″ apertures (MDRS) at the center and 4″ to the east and west of the center. The O VI line flux seen in the previous LWRS is contained in the sum of the smaller apertures, with most of the flux in a single noncentral MDRS aperture, suggesting a size for the emission ≤0.5 kpc; the emission consists of a blue and red peak. For both galaxies, the O VI velocity structure is similar to that of the optical [N II] emission and is consistent with rotation. The compactness and velocity structure of the O VI emission rules out cooling flow models with broadly distributed mass dropout but is consistent with cooling flow models in which the cooling occurs primarily in the central region. The 104 K gas may be the end state of the O VI emitting gas. © 2006. The American Astronomical Society.

Two methods for producing liposomes using compressed carbon dioxide in either its liquid or supercritical state were therefore investigated as possible alternatives to the conventional techniques currently used. The first technique used modified compressed carbon dioxide as a solvent system. The way in which changes in pressure, temperature, apparatus geometry and solvent flow rate affected the size distributions of the formulations was examined. In general, liposomes in the nano-size range with an average diameter of 200 nm could be produced, although some micron-sized vesicles were also present. Liposomes were characterized according to their hydrophobic drug-loading capacity and encapsulated aqueous volumes. The latter were found to be higher than in conventional techniques such as high-pressure homogenization. The second method used compressed carbon dioxide as an antisolvent to promote uniform precipitation of phospholipids from concentrated ethanolic solutions. Finely divided solvent-free phospholipid powders of saturated lipids could be prepared that were subsequently hydrated to produce liposomes with mean volume diameters of around 5 μm. © 2006 The Authors.",,"alcohol; carbon dioxide; cyclic GMP; liposome; phospholipid; solvent; article; flow rate; hydrophobicity; particle size; precipitation; pressure; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Hydrophobicity; Liposomes; Phospholipids; Pressure; Solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744822981

However, certain air purifiers produce ozone (O3) during operation, either intentionally or as a byproduct of air ionization. This is a serious concern, because O3is a criteria air pollutant regulated by health-related federal and state standards. Several types of air purifiers were tested for their ability to produce ozone in various indoor environments at 40-50% relative humidity, including office rooms, bathrooms, bedrooms, and cars. O3levels generated by personal wearable air purifiers were also tested. In many cases, O3concentrations were well in excess of public and/or industrial safety levels established by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California Air Resources Board, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

These terms reflect the palaeontological aspect of these communities, the securely fixed organisms having the best taphonomic chances of surviving fossilization in life position. Neontologists commonly refer to organisms attached to hard substrates as ""fouling organisms"". However, there are numerous other styles of attachment that are characteristic of hard substrate communities. Many of these involve soft-part anatomy (e.g., echinoderm podia, octopus suckers, gastropod foot) and chemical adhesives (e.g., gastropod pedal glue, macroalgal hapteron glue, bivalve byssus), which may leave no direct palaeontological evidence. Different organisms present widely differing degrees of permanence of attachment; some indeed are attached for only part of their life span. In fact, attachment styles range from the permanently affixed, temporarily affixed, periodically mobile to permanently mobile attachment. Each of these categories includes some organisms that etch or abrade their subjacent substrate, creating incipient trace fossils, but they do so for different reasons and by different means. Thus, the styles of attachment do not lend themselves to a compact, formal terminology, owing to the wide scope of attachment strategies and the overlap of their individual features. The categories are therefore retained here in 'open terminology'. The following styles of attachment have been distinguished. Muscular sucker attachment includes single sucker attachment (e.g., limpets) and multiple sucker attachment (e.g., Octopus). Holdfasts include the releasable bunches of byssus secreted by bivalves and the attachment of crinoids using cirri, and of crabs using legs. Organic glue secretions from basal membranes attach foraminifera, hydroids, bryozoans, tunicates, and some barnacles. Some groups of basal membrane gluers etch the substrate and produce incipient trace fossils. These include verrucid and some balanid barnacles, a few bryozoans and the anomiid bivalves. Hapterons include the permanent attachment of brown macroalgae onto rocky shores. Etchings include pits and dishes (e.g., foraminifera) and roots (etchings by brachiopod pedicles). Some vermetid gastropods show combined etching and cementation. Extensive to subtle cementation without etching includes oysters and other bivalves, and some vermetid gastropods. The many organism groups that etch carbonate substrates are unable to pursue this strategy on noncarbonate substrates. There is a much larger variety of strategies available to organisms attaching themselves to carbonate substrates than to noncarbonate. The great variety of attachment styles provided by organisms colonizing hard substrates provides a corresponding variety in taphonomic starting points for the fossilization process, including bioimmuration. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In response to historical deforestation of about 18 million sq km, the models simulate a decrease in global mean annual temperature in the range of 0.13-0.25°C. The rate of this cooling accelerated during the 19th century, reached a maximum in the first half of the 20th century, and declined at the end of the 20th century. This trend is explained by temporal and spatial dynamics of land cover changes, as the effect of deforestation on temperature is less pronounced for tropical than for temperate regions, and reforestation in the northern temperate areas during the second part of the 20th century partly offset the cooling trend. In most of the models, land cover changes lead to a decline in annual land evapotranspiration, while seasonal changes are rather equivocal because of spatial shifts in convergence zones. In the future, reforestation might be chosen as an option for the enhancement of terrestrial carbon sequestration. Our study indicates that biogeophysical mechanisms need to be accounted for in the assessment of land management options for climate change mitigation. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"climate change; climate modeling; land cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645296280

Therefore, it is important to explore whether there are economic incentives that might help the US to modify its current decision and move to a more environmentally effective climate policy. For example, can an increased participation of developing countries induce the US to effectively participate in the effort to reduce GHG emissions? Is a single emission trading market the appropriate policy framework to increase the signatories of the Kyoto Protocol? This paper addresses the above questions by analysing whether the participation of China in the cooperative effort to control GHG emissions can provide adequate incentives for the US to re-join the Kyoto process and eventually ratify the Kyoto Protocol. This paper analyses three different climate regimes in which China could be involved and assesses the economic incentives for the major world countries and regions to participate in these three regimes. The main conclusion is that the participation of the US in a climate regime is not likely, at least in the short run. The US is more likely to adopt unilateral policies than to join the present Kyoto coalition (even when it includes China). However, a two bloc regime would become the most preferred option if both China and the US, for some political or environmental reasons, decide to cooperate on GHG emission control. If the US decides to cooperate, the climate regime that provides the highest economic incentives to the cooperating countries is the one in which China and the US cooperate bilaterally, with the Annex B-US countries remaining within the Kyoto framework. © Springer 2006.","Agreements; Climate; Incentives; Negotiations; Policy","emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; incentive; Kyoto Protocol; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646531852

Here we show that mCx30.2, which is most abundantly expressed in sino-atrial and atrioventricular nodal regions of the heart, and its putative human ortholog, human (h)Cx31.9, also form functional hemichannels, which, like mCx30.2 cell-cell channels, are permeable to cationic dyes up to ≈400 Da in size. DAPI uptake by HeLa cells expressing mCx30.2 was &gt; 10-fold faster than that by HeLa parental cells. In Ca2+-free medium, uptake of DAPI by HeLaCx30.2-EGFP cells was increased ≈2-fold, but uptake by parental cells was not affected. Conversely, acidification by application of CO2 reduced DAPI uptake by HeLaCx30.2-EGFP cells but had little effect on uptake by parental cells. Cells expressing mCx30.2 exhibited higher rates of DAPI uptake than did cells expressing any of the other cardiac Cxs. Cardiomyocytes of 2-day-old rats transfected with hCx31.9-EGFP took up DAPI and ethidium bromide 5-10 times faster than wild-type cardiomyocytes. Mefloquine, a close derivative of quinine and quinidine that exhibits antimalarial and antiarrhythmic properties, reduced conductance of cell-cell junctions and dye uptake through mCx30.2 hemichannels with approximately the same affinity (IC50 = ≈10 μM) and increased dependence of junctional conductance on transjunctional voltage. Unitary conductance of mCx30.2 hemichannels was ≈20 pS, about twice the cell-cell channel conductance. Hemichannels formed of mCx30.2 and hCx31.9 may slow propagation of excitation in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes by shortening the space constant and depolarizing the excitable membrane. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Gap junction; Wenckebach period","4',6 diamidino 2 phenylindole; cation; connexin 30; connexin 30.2; connexin 31; connexin 31.9; dye; enhanced green fluorescent protein; mefloquine; unclassified drug; acidification; animal cell; animal experiment; article; atrioventricular conduction; cell culture; cell junction; controlled study; culture medium; gap junction; heart depolarization; heart excitation; heart muscle cell; HeLa cell; human; human cell; IC 50; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; rat; signal transduction; sinus node; Wenckebach period; Animals; Calcium; Coculture Techniques; Connexins; Electrophysiology; Genes, Reporter; Heart Conduction System; Hela Cells; Humans; Ion Channel Gating; Mefloquine; Mice; Myocardium; Patch-Clamp Techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745458793

Climate protection considerations are central to the new strategy for sustainable development and the planning framework that is charged with delivering this agenda. The gradual accumulation of planning guidance across a range of arenas, including housing, regional planning, transport, flooding and renewables, to name just the most obvious examples, provides a significant basis upon which to build regional and local strategies. There is evidence that regional bodies and local authorities are beginning to integrate climate protection into these strategies, at the rhetorical level at least. However, in seeking to put climate protection into practice, spatial planning faces some key challenges that it alone cannot resolve but with which it must engage. First, the need to shift the time horizons of political decision making into the future, yet act quickly. Second, the imperative to create a more robust and specific language which can be used to promote climate protection in the face of competing demands on the planning system. Finally, the requirement to find a means of dealing with the controversies that arise from seeking to resolve a collective problem in specific places. The critical issue at stake here is one of recognizing that such concerns may reflect a broader critique of the inadequacy of the ways in which we are trying to address climate change and, indeed, of how we are defining the problem. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",,"decision making; spatial planning; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746227535

This study determined the effect of three land-use treatments on CO2 efflux and growing season lengths in Southeast Virginia on two forested mineral soil wetlands. CO2 efflux, soil temperature, and soil moisture were measured 24 times in 18 months at plots representing forest, early successional field, and bare ground land-use treatments. CO2 efflux differed (p &lt; 0.05) by treatment in the order forest &gt; field &gt; bare ground. CO2 efflux was higher in hardwood- than conifer-dominated forest and higher in bare ground plots that were not inundated. Appreciable CO2 efflux took place even once leaves had fallen off deciduous trees, and most of the CO2 efflux appeared to be from vegetation rather than microbial sources during that period. Variability in CO2 efflux was best described by the interaction between soil temperature and soil moisture (R 2 = 0.32) (p &lt; 0.05). The below-ground growing season indicated by appreciable CO2 efflux was similar to that indicated by soil temperatures above 5°C measured at 50 cm, the regulatory reference depth. The CO2 efflux growing season was 365 days in the forest but was 9-16 days shorter in the field and 21-78 days shorter in the bare ground land-use treatment plots. These data can be used to modify the regulatory growing season definition in forested thermic wetlands and to reflect the environmental variation caused by different land uses. © Springer 2006.","Biological zero; Hydric soil; Hydrology threshold; Hydroperiod; Wet flats; Wetland mitigation","deciduous forest; land use; soil moisture; soil temperature; vegetation; wetland; North America; United States; Virginia; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645890301

Methodology is based on surface CO2 exchange measurements, ground spectral measurements, and satellite images interpretation. Thirty-nine field campaigns, each of duration of 3 days, were conducted over the course of 2 years at a sand dunes and a loess environment of the northwestern Negev desert in Israel, in order to relate the CO2 fluxes and the spectral signals to the seasonal phenology. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was derived from ground measurements of the BSC's reflectance and correlated with their CO2 exchange data. A linear mixture model, incorporating the different contributions of the sites' ground features, was calculated and compared with SPOT-HRV data. From the ground measurements, fairly good correlations were found between the NDVI and the CO2 fluxes on a seasonal scale. Hence, the NDVI successfully indicates the potential magnitude and capacity of the BSC's assimilation activity. The linear mixture model successfully describes the phenological cycles of the BSC, annual, and perennial plants and corresponds well to the satellite data. Moreover, the model enables annual changes of the phenology cycle and the growing season length to be distinguished. Both the linear mixture model and the derived NDVI values recorded the recovery of the BSC at the beginning of the wet season before annuals had germinated. Finally, it is concluded that a combination of CO 2 exchange measurements, linear mixture model, and NDVI values is suitable for monitoring BSC's productivity in arid regions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It was demonstrated that the significant variation of the oxygen content (several tens layers) in the Ni catalyst occurred during the oscillatory behaviour of methane oxidation. Together with the visual observation of the color changes due to the periodic variation of the Ni valence these data prove that the oxidation-reduction processes play the crucial role in the origin of the oscillatory behaviour during the methane oxidation over Ni catalysts. It was shown that during oscillatory behaviour of methane oxidation the catalyst contains the significant amount of deposited carbon, atleast, in two different forms. One of them is characterised by the higher reactivity and probably the higher state of the distribution on a metallic surface. The higher activity form of carbon prevails in the reduced state of the nickel catalyst. Another carbon form is characterised by the lower reactivity and, likely, does not noticeably effect the oscillations during methane oxidation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studies the potential use of ENSO-based climate forecasts to reduce N leaching without reducing profits on North Florida dairies. A model was created to perform the analyses, the Dynamic North Florida Dairy Farm Model (DyNoFlo). DyNoFlo is an integrated dynamic model that incorporates Markov-chain simulation of cow flows and crop model simulations for historical climatic years (El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral years). It also includes optimization of managerial options. It responds to dairy-specific environment (climate and soils) and management (livestock management, waste management, crop systems management). The DyNoFlo model was designed to be a tool for producers, regulatory agencies, and extension services in addition to a research tool. Analyzing a typical North Florida dairy farm, it was found that N leaching was highest during winter El Niño years. Sandy soils were substantially more prone to leach N, and perennial grasses were better to prevent N leaching. The typical farm could decrease N leaching up to 23% in an El Niño year and still maintain profit by adjusting protein in the diet, confinement time for milking cows, and combining perennial grasses and forages in pastures and sprayfields. Application of the DyNoFlo model to small, medium, and large dairy farms showed that they could decrease their N leaching by 9, 20, and 25%, respectively, without reducing profits by varying management strategies according to ENSO phases. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

M5S 3B2, Canada","Phosphorus (P) is a major factor limiting the response of carbon acquisition of plants and ecosystems to increasing atmospheric CO2 content. An important consideration, however, is the effect of P deficiency at the low atmospheric CO2 content common in recent geological history, because plants adapted to these conditions may also be limited in their ability to respond to further increases in CO2 content. To ascertain the effects of low P on various components of photosynthesis, white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) was grown hydroponically at 200, 400 and 750 μmol mol-1 CO2, under sufficient and deficient P supply (250 and 0.69 μm P, respectively). Increasing growth CO2 content increased photosynthesis only under sufficient growth P. Ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) content and activation state were not reduced to the same degree as the net CO2 assimilation rate (A), and the in vivo rate of electron transport was sufficient to support photosynthesis in all cases. The rate of triose phosphate use did not appear limiting either, because all the treatments continued to respond positively to a drop in oxygen levels. We conclude that, at ambient and elevated CO2 content, photosynthesis in low-P plants appears limited by the rate of ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) regeneration, probably through inhibition of the Calvin cycle. This failure of P-deficient plants to respond to rising CO2 content above 200 μmol mol -1 indicates that P status already imposes a widespread restriction in plant responses to increases in CO2 content from the pre-industrial level to current values. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Phosphorus deficiency; Photosynthetic limitations; Triose phosphate use","carbon dioxide; phosphorus; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; carbon dioxide; ecosystem; environmental effect; hydroponics; photosynthesis; plant; article; atmosphere; enzymology; fluorescence; growth, development and aging; lupin; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Fluorescence; Lupinus; Phosphorus; Photosynthesis; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Lupinus albus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645722792

Olsson) in a Nanjiug suburb in 2003. The experiment included 4 treatments in a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates: zero chemical fertilizer N (CK); urea at rates of 300 kg N ha-1 (U300) and 600 kg N ha-1 (U600), both as basal and two topdressings; and polymer-coated urea at a rate of 180 kg N ha-1 (PCU180) as a basal application. The acetylene inhibition technique was used to measure denitrification (N2 + N2O) from intact soil cores and N2O emissions in the absence of acetylene. Results showed that compared to CK total denitrification losses were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the PCU180, U300, and U600 treatments, while N2O emissions in the U300 and U600 treatments were significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) than CK. In the U300 and U600 treatments peaks of denitrification and N2O emission were usually observed after N application. In the polymer-coated urea treatment (PCU180) during the period 20 to 40 days after transplanting, higher denitrification rates and N2O fluxes occurred. Compared with urea, polymer-coated urea did not show any effect on reducing denitrification losses and N2O emissions in terms of percentage of applied N. As temperature gradually decreased from transplanting to harvest, denitrification rates and N2O emissions tended to decrease. A significant (P ≤ 0.01) positive correlation occurred between denitrification (r = 0.872) or N 2O emission (r = 0.781) flux densities and soil temperature in the CK treatment with a stable nitrate content during the whole growing season. © 2006 Soil Science Society of China Published by Elsevier Limited and Science Press.","Denitrification loss; N2O emission; Polymer-coated urea; Urea; Vegetable field","denitrification; emission; fertilizer; growing season; nitrous oxide; soil temperature; transplantation; urea; vegetable; vegetation cover; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Brassica rapa; Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745182534

The specific aspects of the built environment that influence vehicle choice, however, have not been well-established. Further, these studies have not shed much light on the underlying direction of causality: Whether neighborhood designs themselves, as opposed to preferences for neighborhood characteristics or attitudes towards travel, more strongly influence individuals' decisions regarding vehicle type. Using a sample from Northern California, this study investigated the relationship between neighborhood design and vehicle type choice, controlling for residential self-selection. Correlation analyses showed that neighborhood design has a strong association with vehicle type choice. Specifically, traditional neighborhood designs are correlated with the choice of passenger cars, while suburban designs are associated with the choice of light duty trucks. The nested logit model suggests that sociodemographic and attitudinal factors play an important role, and that an outdoor spaciousness measure (based on perceptions of yard sizes and off-street parking availability) and commute distance also impact vehicle type choice after controlling for those other influences. This study, therefore, supports the premise that land use policies have at least some potential to reduce the choice of light duty trucks, thereby reducing emissions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

If undisturbed, these ecosystems might be expected to show a net uptake of methane (CH4) and a limited emission of nitrous oxide (N2O). Land management has the potential to change dramatically the characteristics and gas exchange of ecosystems. The present work investigates the contribution of warm climate seasonally-dry ecosystems to the atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide and methane, and analyses the impact of land-use change on N2O and CH4 fluxes from the ecosystems in question. Location: Flux data reviewed here were collected from the literature; they come from savannas and seasonally-dry ecosystems in warm climatic regions, including South America, India, Australasia and Mediterranean areas. Methods: Data on gas fluxes were collected from the literature. Two factors were considered as determinants of the variation in gas fluxes: land management and season. Land management was grouped into: (1) control, (2) 'burned only' and (3) managed ecosystems. The season was categorized as dry or wet. In order to avoid the possibility that the influence of soil properties on gas fluxes might confound any differences caused by land management, sites were grouped in homogeneous clusters on the basis of soil properties, using multivariate analyses. Inter- and intra-cluster analysis of gas fluxes were performed, taking into account the effects of season, land management and main vegetation types. Results: Soils were often acid and nutrient-poor, with low water retention. N2O emissions were generally very low (median flux 0.32 mg N2O m-2 day-1), and no significant differences were observed between woodland savannas and managed savannas. The highest fluxes (up to 12.9 mg N2O m-2 day-1) were those on relatively fertile soils with high air-filled porosity and water retention. The effect of season on N2O production was evident only when sites were separated in homogeneous groups on the basis of soil properties. CH4 fluxes varied over a wide range (-22.9 to 3.15 mg CH4 m-2 day-1, where the negative sign denotes removal of gas from the atmosphere), with an annual average daily flux of -0.48 ± 0.96 (SD) mg CH4 m-2 day-1 in undisturbed (control) sites. Land-use change dramatically reduced this CH4 sink. Managed sites were weak sinks of CH4 in the dry season and became sources of CH4 in the wet season. This was particularly evident for pastures. Burning alone did not reduce soil net CH4 oxidation, but decreased N2O production. Main conclusions: Despite the low potential for N2O production, both in natural and managed conditions, tropical seasonally-dry ecosystems represent a significant source of N2O (4.4 Tg N2O year-1) on a global scale, as a consequence of the large area they occupy. The same environments represent a potential CH 4 sink of 5.17 Tg CH4 year-1. However, assuming that c. 30% of the tropical land is converted to different uses, the sink would be reduced to 3.2 Tg CH4 year-1. The limited information on fluxes from Mediterranean ecosystems does not allow a meaningful scaling up. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Cerrado; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Maquis; Multivariate analysis; Oxidation; Production; Tropical forest","biogeochemical cycle; gas exchange; land use change; methane; nitrous oxide; savanna",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645130702

This is particularly challenging for global aridlands where total N and the relative amounts of nitrate and ammonia vary both spatially and seasonally. We measured gas exchange and primary and secondary C metabolites in seedlings of two dominant aridland shrub species (Prosopis flexuosa [S America] and P. glandulosa [N America]) grown at ambient (350 ppm) or elevated (650 ppm) CO2 and nitrogen at two levels (low [0.8 mM] and high [8.0 mM]) and at either 1 : 1 or 3 : 1 nitrate to ammonia. Whereas elevated CO2 increased assimilation rate, water use efficiency, and primary carbon metabolites in both species, these increases were strongly contingent upon nitrogen availability. Elevated CO2 did not increase secondary metabolites (i.e., phenolics). For these important aridland species, the effects of elevated CO2 are strongly influenced by nitrogen availability and to a lesser extent by the relative amounts of nitrate and ammonia supplied, which underscores the importance of both the amount and chemical composition of soil nitrogen in mediating the potential responses of seedling growth and establishment of aridland plants under future CO2-enriched atmospheres.","Ammonia-N; Global change; Nitrate-N; Phenolic compounds; Prosopis flexuosa; Prosopis glandulosa; Rangeland","ammonia; arid region; botany; carbon; gas exchange; metabolism; nitrate; soil nitrogen; Fabaceae; Prosopis; Prosopis flexuosa; Prosopis glandulosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646430898

The Au/CeO2-Al2O3 sample demonstrates a much higher catalytic activity in the CO oxidation reaction than does the Au/Al2O3 sample. IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO reveals that ceria generally keeps gold in a more oxidized state. Gold is in the form of Au3+ on the as-prepared samples. Low-temperature CO adsorption on the Au/Al2O3 sample evacuated at 473 K leads to the formation of Au+-CO species evidencing reduction of Au3+ to Au+. No gold carbonyls are detected on the Au/CeO2-Al2O3 sample evacuated at the same temperature, this indicating that no auto-reduction has occurred. A carbonyl band at 2143 cm-1, assigned to Au+-CO species formed with Au+ cations on metal gold particles, is registered after low-temperature CO adsorption on the Au/CeO2-Al2O3 sample evacuated at 673 K, while CO adsorption on the Au/Al2O3 sample treated in the same way leads to the formation of Au0-CO species (carbonyl band at 2106 cm-1).

Knowledge of organic matter (OM) types and their transformation in mine soils and sediments is essential for the evaluation of ecosystem functioning in this region. The aim of the study was to use the isotopic signature of OM to: (1) determine lignite C contribution and (2) elucidate the contribution of OM derived from plant litter to three physical fractions in order to deduce its degree of degradation in three contrasting environments. We used stable and radioactive C isotopes to quantify the contribution of lignite C and to characterize humification processes occurring under contrasting vegetation and redox conditions. The upper mineral soil/sediment, the litter layer and the vegetation of three plots were sampled along a transect covering a forest soil, a partially submerged sediment at the land-water interface characterized by fluctuating water levels, and a constantly submerged sediment. The soil/sediment samples were fractionated into a macro (&gt;250 μm), a humus (material separated by flotation) and a sand (mainly mineral material) fraction to follow the transformation processes of plant and lignite. Radiocarbon analysis of the humus fraction showed a lignite C contribution ranging from 20% to 80% of total organic carbon (OC). The 14C activity was correlated with the δ13C value (r2 = 0.95). Even if not precise, in this case the correlation was used to get an idea about the lignite contribution in coal mining-impacted freshwater sediment and soil. The 13C data showed that lignite C contribution increases with depth in every fraction of the forest and partially submerged plots. At the submerged plot, the humus and macro fraction were almost free of lignite C, suggesting high amounts of fresh plant material at this plot. This was confirmed by the highest contribution (up to 40%) of the macro fraction, which is mainly composed of fresh plant material, to the total OC content in this plot. In the first 5 cm of all plots, most OC was found in the humus fraction. Combined elemental and isotopic analysis of the three physical fractions indicated that high amounts of humified OM were present in the constantly submerged sediment, whereas most intensive degradation of OM was occurring in the partially submerged sediment at the land-water interface. Here, δ13C values show that lignite C contributes to the macro fraction, which could suggest that it may have been incorporated into fresh plant material, thus being part of the active C cycle. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

LBNL has also adopted a legal approach by seeking an equivalent waste-treatment determination for the CCO process, and by petitioning the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to delist F-coded treatment residues. The results of this study demonstrate that (1) the CCO process can treat aqueous wastes containing a broad range of organic chemicals and achieve more than 99.999% destruction efficiency; (2) greater than 99.9% trapping efficiency for tritiated water can be achieved using an emission-reduction system that also confines the vapor of hydrochloric acid or nitric acid to the liquid residue; and (3) neutralized treatment residues can be disposed of as low-level radioactive waste at a permitted facility after EPA has approved LBNL's petitions, or the tritium in the residues can be recycled. The high oxidation efficiency of the CCO process is mainly due to the optimized operating conditions of the CCO process and the combined effect of steam reforming in the oxidation cell and the catalytic oxidation of organic mixtures and CO in the Pt/Al2O 3 catalyst bed.

Results of air quality monitoring data from 1994 to 2003 in Taipei City indicate that the 99th percentile O3, max was reduced, but those below the 90th percentile O3, max obviously increased and days with O3, 8 h greater than 60 ppb were doubled after the reduction of O3 precursor emissions. Because of Taipei's unique vehicle emissions pattern in having more motorcycles than cars, Sunday, as compared to weekdays, has more reductions of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) than NOX. This results in Sunday O3, max being lower than weekday O3, max average for those days with O3, max exceeding 80 ppb. On the contrary, if O3, max is lower than 60 ppb, Sunday O3, max is relatively higher than weekday O3, max average, due to the reduced NO titration effect. In addition, our evaluations of O3 levels with respect to the ambient air quality standards show that the number of Sundays with O3, max greater than 120 ppb is fewer than the number average of weekdays with O3, max exceeding 120 ppb for every month. Concerning O3, 8 h, only in June, July, and August, when the meteorological conditions favor O3 production, does the reduction of Sunday vehicle exhaust reduce the number of days with O3,8h greater than 60 ppb. However, in September and October, the reduction of Sunday vehicle exhaust will increase the number of days.

Clay assemblages have spatial and temporal changes and are markedly different in the eastern and the western bay. From a high abundance of the clay smectite, which has its major source in the Deccan Basalt in peninsular India, it is inferred that the western bay is predominantly a depocenter of 'peninsular sources'. The eastern and the central regions of the bay, however, mostly receive sediments of the 'Himalayan source'. Related to unstable climate, the reported dominant illite-chlorite (I + C) assemblage in the eastern region of the bay (I + C &gt; 60% smectite &lt; 15%), between 18 and 12.6 ka BP, points to a predominant supply from the Himalayan sources through equatorwards dispersal by the winter hydrography. Higher smectite, and reduced clays of the Himalayan sources (smectite &gt; 25%; I + C &gt; 45%) are reported also after 12.5 ka BP from the eastern bay. These are interpreted as evidences of an intensified SW monsoon and associated change in the dispersal pattern by stronger summer monsoon hydrography which supports across bay dispersal by anticyclonic gyre. The influence of climate on hydrographic changes is consistent during the short events of and climate (weak NE monsoon) in Holocene in core 31/ 1 (western bay), in which the enhanced contents of the clays of the Himalayan sources are observed (smectite &lt; 40% I + C &gt; 50%). These findings have implications for climate regulated influence of fluvial processes over the areas, hitherto, considered unaffected by the Indian peninsular fluvial sources. © Printed in India.","Bengal Fan; Clay minerals; Dispersal patterns; Himalayan sources; Hydrography","clay mineral; climate change; climate effect; hydrography; Quaternary; spatiotemporal analysis; Asia; Bengal Fan; Eurasia; Himalayas; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746327765

Two strategies can be considered: after-treatment or engine emissions reduction. For Diesel engines, after-treatment has a high cost induced by the required technology and implementation issues. In this context, the Highly Premixed Combustion combustion mode (HPC) has emerged as a topic of major interest in recent years. It represents one of the most promising ways for new generation of CI engines using high Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) rates. Experimentation on the testbench brought the proof of significant emission reduction. However, actual vehicle implementation implies frequent transient which fall far beyond steady state experimentation on the testbench. Several key challenges have to be addressed. With this combustion technology, accurate torque balancing at all engine modes is a requirement. Even slight unbalance between the cylinders can have dramatic consequences and induce important noise, possible stall and higher emissions. To achieve this goal, we develop high frequency individual cylinder estimators. These serve as tools for real time control strategies.

When statistical downscaling is used to obtain regional climate change scenarios, the uncertainty may originate from the uncertainties in the global climate models used, the skill of the statistical model, and the forcing scenarios applied to the global climate model. The uncertainty associated with global climate models can be evaluated by examining the differences in the predictors and in the downscaled climate change scenarios based on a set of different global climate models. When standardized global climate model simulations such as the second phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2) are used, the difference in the downscaled variables mainly reflects differences in the climate models and the natural variability in the simulated climates. It is proposed that the spread of the estimates can be taken as a measure of the uncertainty associated with global climate models. The proposed method is applied to the estimation of global-climate-model-related uncertainty in regional precipitation change scenarios in Sweden. Results from statistical downscaling based on 17 global climate models show that there is an overall increase in annual precipitation all over Sweden although a considerable spread of the changes in the precipitation exists. The general increase can be attributed to the increased large-scale precipitation and the enhanced westerly wind. The estimated uncertainty is nearly independent of region. However, there is a seasonal dependence. The estimates for winter show the highest level of confidence, while the estimates for summer show the least.","Climate change scenario; Global climate model; Statistical downscaling; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32144437425

We showed earlier that human β3 homopentameric GABAA receptor recognizes all of the important GABAergic insecticides and reproduces the high insecticide sensitivity and structure-activity relationships of the native insect receptor. Despite large structural diversity, the NCAs are proposed to fit a single binding site in the chloride channel lumen lined by five transmembrane 2 segments. This hypothesis is examined with the β3 homopentamer by mutagenesis, pore structure studies, NCA binding, and molecular modeling. The 15 amino acids in the cytoplasmic half of the pore were mutated to cysteine, serine, or other residue for 22 mutants overall. Localization of A-1′ C, A2′C, T6′C, and L9′C (index numbers for the transmembrane 2 region) in the channel lumen was established by disulfide cross-linking. Binding of two NCA radioligands [3H]1-(4-ethynyl-phenyl)-4-n-propyl-2,6,7- trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and [3H] 3,3-bis-trifluoromethyl- bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2,2-dicarbonitrile was dramatically reduced with 8 of the 15 mutated positions, focusing attention on A2′, T6′, and L9′ as proposed binding sites, consistent with earlier mutagenesis studies. The cytoplasmic half of the β3 homopentamer pore was modeled as an α-helix. The six NCAs listed above plus t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate fit the 2′ to 9′ pore region forming hydrogen bonds with the T6′ hydroxyl and hydrophobic interactions with A2′, T6′, and L9′ alkyl substituents, thereby blocking the channel. Thus, widely diverse NCA structures fit the same GABA receptor β subunit site with important implications for insecticide cross-resistance and selective toxicity between insects and mammals. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","β3 homopentamer; Disulfide trapping; Insecticide; Receptor model; Transmembrane 2","1 (4 ethynylphenyl) 4 n propyl 2,6,7 trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; 3,3 bistrifluoromethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane 2,2 dicarbonitrile; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor blocking agent; amino acid; chloride channel; cysteine; disulfide; endosulfan; fipronil; hydroxyl group; insecticide; lindane; picrotoxinin; serine; tert butylbicyclophosphorothioate; unclassified drug; alpha helix; amino acid substitution; animal cell; article; beta chain; binding site; controlled study; cross linking; cross resistance; drug receptor binding; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; molecular model; mutagenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; structure activity relation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bicyclo Compounds; Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic; Binding Sites; Cell Line; Drosophila; GABA Antagonists; Gene Expression; Humans; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Nitriles; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Protein Subunits; Rats; Receptors, GABA; Sequence Alignment; Structure-Activity Relationship; Animalia; Hexapoda; Insecta; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645511221

Data from 13 high-frequency and 79 low-frequency CH4 observing sites have been averaged into monthly mean values with associated errors arising from instrumental precision, mismatch error, and sampling frequency. Simulated methane mole fractions are generated using the 3-D global chemical transport model (MATCH), driven by NCEP analyzed observed meteorology (T62 resolution), which accounts for the impact of synoptic and interannually varying transport on methane observations. We adapted the Kalman filter to optimally estimate methane flux magnitudes and uncertainties, from seven seasonally varying (monthly varying flux) and two aseasonal sources (constant flux). We further tested the sensitivity of the inversion to different observing sites, filtered versus unfiltered observations, different model sampling strategies, and alternative emitting regions. Over the 1996-2001 period the inversion reduces energy emissions and increases rice and biomass burning emissions relative to the a priori emissions. The global seasonal emission peak is shifted from August to July because of increased rice and wetland emissions from southeast Asia. The inversion also attributes the large 1998 increase in atmospheric CH4 to global wetland emissions. The current CH4 observational network can significantly constrain northern emitting regions but not tropical emitting regions. Better estimates of global OH fluctuations are also necessary to fully describe interannual methane observations. This is evident in the inability of the optimized emissions to fully reproduce the observations at Samoa.

As in young pulsars, MSPs emit a relativistic wind, which in interacting with the ISM and/or a binary companion can significantly contribute to the nonpulsed emission of these pulsars. An application and extension of a simple model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old recycled MSP B1957+20. It is found that the pulsar wind can indeed contribute to both the resolved and unresolved X-ray emission. For other MSPs in the Galactic field for which the spectral index of the nonpulsed component has been measured (i.e., PSR B1937+21, PSR J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar wind to the nonpulsed X-ray luminosity is estimated. For the MSPs in the core regions of globular clusters, the pulsar wind nebula is likely affected by its interaction with the dense stellar environment, possibly leading to a diminished contribution to the total X-ray emission. In this case, the existence of nonthermal nonpulsed X-ray emission is more likely for binary than for isolated MSPs, with the emission arising from the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind and a binary companion. Our study suggests that the magnetization parameter in the pulsar wind nebulae of MSPs is significantly larger than that of the Crab Nebula, by about a factor of 10. The nebulae powered by rapidly rotating neutron stars either in isolation or in the quiescent state of soft X-ray transients can contribute to the faint X-ray source population associated with nonaccreting neutron stars. The emission from MSPs moving at high velocities (≳100 km s-1) through regions of the ISM characterized by magnetic field strengths ≲0.1 mG may appear spatially extended with a tail-like morphology. Thus, MSPs may also contribute to the faint filamentary X-ray source subpopulation in the Galaxy. © 2006. The American Astronomical Society.

We used four treatments: fertilizer containing no nitrogen (CONT), broadcast application of urea (BR-U), band application of urea (B-U), and band application of controlled-release urea (B-CU). The application rate was 250 kg N ha-1, a conventional rate in the region. We measured N 2O flux two or three times a week during the 82-day growth period, then divided the cumulative emissions into three stages: early (28 days), middle (27 days), and late (27 days). The temporal variation in N2O emissions differed among the treatments. Broadcast urea application produced 70% of N2O emissions during the early stage. N2O emissions increased with increasing cabbage growth in the CONT treatment, indicating that plant growth accompanied by increasing root biomass could stimulate N 2O emissions from unfertilized soil. There were no differences in the patterns of temporal variation in N2O flux between the two band applications (B-U and B-CU); N2O emissions in the early and middle stages were 46 and 42%, respectively, for B-U, vs. 41 and 40% for B-CU.

Local mole fractions of radicals, such as OH or CH, at the flame edge of a CH4/air mixture were found to be larger than those in other parts of the flame. On the other hand, local mole fractions of radicals in the flame edge of a C3H8/air mixture were smaller than those in other parts. These numerical results agreed well with the experimental results of the present authors. Moreover, it was elucidated that two flame edges of twin counterflow flames did not merge at the edge even in the case of the CH4/air mixture. The ratio of the local stretch rate at the flame edge to the extinction stretch rate for planar twin flames with the same equivalence ratio was 0.6 for the CH4/air mixture and 0.7 for the C3H8/air mixture.

We here report that the carbon control protein-A (CcpA) of Bacillus subtilis, primarily concerned with carbon metabolism, influences expression of various phosphorus (pho) regulon genes including the two alkaline phosphatase structural genes, phoA and phoB. The directions and magnitudes of the effects of glucose and the loss of CcpA on these two genes depend on growth conditions, but they always correlate inversely. Absolute expression levels of phoA and phoB depend on a rich nitrogen source, and gene activation by a fermentable substrate such as glucose depends on the presence of a respiratory substrate such as succinate. We show that these CcpA-dependent glucose effects can be explained by the effects of glucose and CcpA acting on the phoPR operon. Although a good CcpA-binding site (CRE) is found in the control region of the phoPR operon, direct regulation of phoPR gene expression by CcpA via this CRE could not account for the effects of glucose and CcpA on phoA and phoB gene expression. We conclude that CcpA exerts indirect control over the pho regulon by a mechanism that involves CcpA and PhoRP but does not involve the phoPR operon CRE. Copyright © 2005 S.

Knowledge of trihalomethane (THM) formation potential of soil-derived organic carbon is important for developing effective strategies for organic carbon removal in drinking water treatment. In this study, soil organic carbon was extracted with electrolytes (deionized H2O and Na- or Ca-based electrolytes) of electrical conductivity bracketing those found in Delta leaching and runoff conditions. The extracts were physically and chemically separated into different fractions: colloidal organic carbon (0.45-0.1 μm), fine colloidal organic carbon (0.1-0.025 μm), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (&lt;0.025 μm); hydrophobic acid (HPOA), transphilic acid, and hydrophilic acid. Two representative Delta soils, Rindge Muck (a peat soil) and Scribner Clay Loam (a mineral soil) were examined. Results showed that less than 2% of soil organic carbon was electrolyte-extractable and heterogeneous organic fractions with distinct THM reactivity existed. Regardless of soil and electrolytes, DOC and HPOA fractions were dominant in terms of total concentration and THMFP. The amounts of extractable organic carbon and THMFP were dependent on the cation and to a lesser extent on electrical conductivity of electrolytes. Along with our previous study on temperature and moisture effects on DOC production, we propose a conceptual model to describe the impacts of agricultural practices on DOC production in the Delta. DOC is mainly produced in the surface peat soils during the summer and is immobilized by accumulated salt in the soils. DOC is leached from soils to drainage ditches and finally to the Delta channels during winter salt leaching practices. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

PM2.5 sampling was conducted using Desert Research Institute (DRI) sequential filter samplers (SFS) from December 1999 through February 2001 at two urban sites (Fresno and Bakersfield), one regional transport site (Angiola), and two boundary sites (Bethel Island and Sierra Nevada Foothills) during CRPAQS in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV). Additional filter-based sampling was done in Fresno as part of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Supersites program. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations were higher during winter (December-February) than summer (June-August) and this trend was most pronounced at Fresno and Bakersfield. OC and EC displayed similar diurnal trends during winter and summer at Fresno and during winter at Angiola. The diurnal pattern at Angiola reflected the transport of secondary pollutants to the site. Collocated measurements of OC and EC on undenuded quartz-fiber filters were made at Fresno with the DRI SFS and the Andersen FRM and RAAS samplers. All average differences in OC between samplers were less than their respective measurement uncertainties. Positive and negative OC biases were evaluated at Fresno using the Andersen RAAS sampler with carbon-denuded and undenuded channels with Teflon-membrane and quartz-fiber filter pairs. Differences between the denuded particle OC and that obtained by subtracting the quartz-behind-Teflon or quartz-behind-quartz OC from the undenuded quartz-fiber front filter were less than twice their measurement uncertainties in most cases. Particulate OC in the denuded channel agreed most closely with the difference between undenuded front and backup quartz-fiber OC. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Minimally invasive endovascular occlusion techniques can be used for IHP, but control of leakage remains a major drawback. We hypothesized that the increased intraabdominal pressure generated by a CO2 -pneumoperitoneum (PP) can reduce the leakage rate of hypoxic endovascular IHP by mechanical compression of the capillary beds connecting the liver to the systemic circulation. Methods: IHP was performed on adult pigs through laparotomy using a fenestrated double balloon-catheter placed into the retrohepatic vena cava to collect the hepatic outflow which was reinfused into the hepatic artery through an extracorporeal circulation system. Each pig underwent IHP during four consecutive phases: abdomen open (Phase I), abdomen closed under a 15 and 20 mmHg pneumoperitoneum (Phase II and III, respectively) and abdomen re-opened (Phase IV). The leakage rate from the liver to the systemic circulation was continuously monitored using a nuclear medicine technique. The systemic arterial pressure, the IHP inflow and outflow pressures and the flow rate were recorded. Results: Leakage from the hepatic extracorporeal circulation to the systemic circulation occurred in all animals during Phase I. Under PP (Phases II and III), two leakage profiles were observed: (1) a major increase of the leakage rate in two animals with a high differential pressure (&gt;50 mmHg) between the IHP inflow and the systemic pressures; (2) no change or a decrease of the leakage rate in the other three animals who had a low or negative differential pressure (&lt;30 mmHg). Leakage was undetectable in all animals after exsufflation of the PP (Phase IV). Conclusions: IHP under PP is feasible. Leakage is not reduced during PP. A high gradient between the IHP inflow and the systemic pressure increases systemic leakage during PP. Upon release of the PP, the leakage is most likely redirected towards the volume depleted low resistance portal territory. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Gas accounts for ∼ 21% of world primary energy supply. Driven by strong growth in the power sector, this share is expected to reach 25% by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. In western Europe, investment in new infrastructure projects, from pipelines to LNG import plants, underscores the regions interest in increasing supply, with Norway, Russia, Qatar, and Africa the main sources. Between 1998 and 2003, gas demand across Europe rose by 60%, because of strong demand from power suppliers and large industrial users. This trend is likely to continue. With the creation of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), gas has become an even more competitive fuel vs. coal. The ETS is part of the EU strategy to cut CO2 emissions. But there is strong evidence of a sharp rise in consumption in many states. Italy has witnessed a rapid uptake of gas in the past decade, at the expense of oil-fired generation, although it boasts a diversified portfolio, including coal and hydropower.

The use of hydrogen offers considerable potential benefits such as reducing greenhouse emissions, reducing urban pollution, increased energy security and increased efficiencies from the use of advanced energy conversion technologies. One of the most important questions when considering the development of a hydrogen economy is ""where will the hydrogen come from?"" Possible answers include electrolysis of water, steam reforming of methane and the gasification of coal. Given the high costs associated with electrolysis of water, and the increase in the cost of methane predicted over time, the gasification of coal is viewed by many as being the cheapest method of hydrogen production in the foreseeable future. These considerations are particularly relevant to New Zealand where gas supplies are dwindling but where there is sufficient coal to last for many centuries at present utilization rates. This, along with the current high international interest in hydrogen energy, has been recognized by the New Zealand Government in the form of a six-year [2002-2008] research project ""Hydrogen Energy for the Future of New Zealand"". One important coal property that, in particular, determines the suitability of a particular coal for use in a fluidised bed gasifier is its reactivity towards the gasification reaction. It was found that a high percentage of New Zealand's coal resource is particularly well-suited towards fluidised bed gasification, reacting at anywhere between 0.9 to 1.75 times the rate of Australian brown coals. It was found the New Zealand lignites contained significant levels of organically bound calcium, which was shown to be responsible for not only the high reactivity of the New Zealand lignites, but also a product gas composition with higher than expected hydrogen concentrations.

During the 30 years of the Brazilian Alcohol Program, Brazil has accumulated a significant amount of experience in the various aspects of sugarcane ethanol production. This paper discusses this experience and the lessons learned, with special attention paid to the following aspects: (1) private investments now fund alcohol mill construction, eliminating the need for subsidies or other government incentives (so there is no influence of the sunk capital investments made in the past), and it is competitive with gasoline without the need for government subsidies to the industry; (2) the favorable energy balance of ethanol; (3) there is no competition for land with food crops; (4) the quality of jobs and social impacts; (5) the compatibility of existing fleets with ethanol-gasoline blends; (6) adequate legislation can control local environmental impacts associated with feedstock production and biofuel manufacture; (7) perspectives for the replication of the Brazilian ethanol program in other developing countries. © 2006 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Automobile manufacture; Biofuels; Competition; Developing countries; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Regional planning; Capital investment; Ethanol gasoline blend; Ethanol production; Feedstock production; Fossil fuel savings; Government incentive; Government subsidies; Private investment; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049173993

Plots were also established outside chambers (ANC) to test chamber affects. Potato leaf appearance rate and canopy development did not differ between CO2 treatments. Six plants in each plot were harvested in late July and August. At the first harvest, the number of stems, total stem weight, number of flowers, and total flower dry weight decreased with increasing CO2. Biomass allocated to stems and leaves declined while allocation to tubers increased with elevated CO2. Root:shoot ratio was larger and percent leaf nitrogen declined 12.6% with increased CO2. At the final harvest, total tuber dry weight in A + 350 chambers was 36% higher than in the A treatment, but yields in open-top chamber plots were lower than the no-chamber plots possibly due to 7-14% less photosynthetic active radiation in chambers. Net photosynthesis measurements made on July 13 showed no differences due to CO2 treatment; however, on August 5, net photosynthesis of leaves grown at A + 350 was 53% greater than at ambient CO2. Tuber initiation and growth began between the two photosynthesis measurements. Before tuber initiation, photosynthetic rates may have been down-regulated by insufficient carbon sink capacity. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The alkaline intestinal environment could potentially also cause essential metal carbonate formation reducing bioavailability. Iron accumulation was assessed in the Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) gut by mounting intestine segments in modified Ussing chambers fitted to a pH-stat titration system. This system titrates to maintain lumen pH constant and in the process prevents bicarbonate accumulation. The luminal saline pH was clamped to pH 5.5 or 7.0 to investigate the effect of proton concentrations on iron uptake. In addition, redox state was altered (gassing with N2, addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbate) to evaluate Fe3+ versus Fe2+ uptake, enabling us to compare a marine teleost intestine model for iron uptake to the mammalian system for non-haem bound iron uptake that occurs via a ferrous/proton (Fe2+/H+) symporter called Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1). None of the redox altering strategies affected iron (Fe3+ or Fe2+) binding to mucus, but the addition of ascorbate resulted in a 4.6-fold increase in epithelium iron accumulation. This indicates that mucus iron binding is irrespective of valency and suggests that ferrous iron is preferentially transported across the apical surface. Altering luminal saline pH from 7.0 to 5.5 did not affect ferric or ferrous iron uptake, suggesting that if iron is entering via DMT1 in marine fish intestine this transporter works efficiently under circumneutral conditions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In the first stage, the reduction stage, the framework oxygen of a reducible inorganic oxide is used for the combustion of the carbonaceous material. In the second stage, the regeneration stage, the carrier in a reduced state is regenerated with air to recover the properties of the fresh carrier, ready to reinitiate a new cycle. This article provides results for the performance of a copper oxide silica-supported oxygen carrier in a 20-cycle test of chemical-looping of methane in a fixed-bed reactor at 800 °C and atmospheric pressure. The mesoporous nature of silica provided a good dispersion of the active phase imparting a high mechanical strength to the overall carrier. Additionally, silica is stable under highly reducing agents and inert in the two involved processes. The respective CH4, CO2, and CO breakthrough curves in the reduction stage show that the reduction reaction rate is fast and highly selective to CO2 formation. CO emissions are very low, only yielded at the end of the reduction stage, when the reduction stage should be stopped to initiate a regeneration stage. Characterization studies using different techniques, such as TPR, SEMEDX, and powder XRD, reveal that CuO might decompose into Cu2O at the operating conditions used in the reduction stage, but fortunately, the decomposition rate is so low that it has no effect on the oxygen amount initially available for chemical-looping combustion. Copper does not promote the thermal decomposition of methane, and deposited carbon, consequently, could not be detected in the reduced carrier. In a 20-cycle test neither performance decay nor mechanical degradation of the oxygen carrier has been observed. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Characterization; Combustion; Dispersions; Inorganic compounds; Mesoporous materials; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Performance; Reduction; Silica; Strength of materials; Chemical-looping combustion; Fixed-bed reactor; Oxygen carrier; Copper oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644543747

Attributes relate objectives important to choosing control technologies with specific alternatives that may meet several of the objectives differently. The transparent framework enables multiple stakeholders to understand how different subjective judgments and varying attribute properties may result in different technology choices. Standard scoring techniques ensure that attributes are not biased by subjective scoring and that weights are the primary quantitative input where subjective preferences are exercised. An expected value decision structure is adopted that considers probabilities (likelihood) that a given alternative can meet its claims; alternative decision criteria are discussed. Capital and annual costs are combined using a net present value approach. An iterative approach is advocated that allows for screening and disqualifying alternatives that do not meet minimum conditions for acceptance, such as engine warranty or U.S. Coast Guard requirements. This decision framework assists vessel operators in considering explicitly important attributes and in representing choices clearly to other stakeholders concerned about reducing air pollution from vessels.

In the 1980s, Coleman and Hoffer (1987) found in the USA that the performance of these pupils was better at religious schools than at comparable public schools. Dronkers and Robert (2003) found in PISA data for 19 comparable countries that private government-dependent schools are more effective than comparable public schools, also after controlling for characteristics of pupils and parents and the social composition of the school. The main explanation appeared to be a better school climate in private government-dependent schools. Private independent schools were less effective than comparable public schools, but only after controlling for the social composition of the school. As a follow-up we now investigate, again with the PISA data of these 19 countries, whether this positive effect of private government-dependent schools differs between pupils from different strata. We use various indicators to measure social strata: social, cultural, and economic. We expect that the thesis of Coleman and Hoffer does hold for private government-dependent schools because in these 19 countries they are mostly religious schools, which have more opportunities to form functional communities and create social capital. But for private independent schools, which because of their commercial foundation are less often functional communities, this relation is not expected to hold. However, the results show that public and private schools have mostly the same effects for the same kind of pupils and thus mostly do not favor one kind of pupils above another kind of pupils. But private government-dependent schools are slightly more effective for pupils with less cultural capital and private independent schools are also more effective for pupils from large families or low status families.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646452422

We report time-resolved studies on particle ejection from CaF 2 and BaF 2 targets. Pump-probe time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToF MS) was used to measure the particle yields as a function of the delay time between pairs of sub-damage threshold laser pulses, thus obtaining the temporal dynamics of the laser-excited charged particle emission. In a correlative manner, the positive ion, electron and negative ion desorption yields dependence on the pump-probe delay time reveal a coherence peak around zero delay (similar to a two-pulse autocorrelation), accounting for the increase of the ion yield with laser intensity. Additionally, the measurements reveal a delayed peaks at ∼900 fs (BaF 2 ) and ∼300 fs (CaF 2 ). For comparison, we present time-resolved studies on electron emission from aluminum targets with pump and probe pulses below the damage threshold. The measurements show, again, the autocorrelation peak in the coherence region and an additional increase in the electron yield when the pulses are several picoseconds apart. The autocorrelation could also stand for the dephasing time of the electronic coherence, while the delayed peaks may reveal for the time needed for the collisional energy to be transferred to the lattice. The pump pulse induces a new unstable phase, which is further destabilized by the probe pulse.

This can lead to slippery conditions on insulated pavement sections, while adjacent conventional pavement sections have dry surfaces. One way to control the occurrence of this phenomenon, known as differential icing, is to place a granular layer on top of the insulation. This paper proposes a rational design approach that considers climate conditions, as well as the properties of the pavement materials, to establish the minimum thickness of the granular protection layer needed to reduce the risk of differential icing. The proposed approach is illustrated with typical cases at various locations in Quebec, Canada.

Doing so brings to light how induced technical change may not only lower stabilization costs thanks to pure technological progress, but also trigger induction of final demand-effects critical to both the level of the carbon tax and the costs ofpolicy given a specific stabilization target.

Three key circulation patterns representing broad southwesterly flow and large geopotential height gradients are associated with over 80% of the extreme fire-weather days identified in this study. Seasonal changes in relative humidity levels, strength of height gradient, and geopotential heights all modulate the relationship between these key circulation patterns and extreme fire-weather days. Examination of daily incident summaries for three recent wildfires (May 2000, June 2002 and June 2003) shows that wildfire activity can be strongly regulated by these critical fire-weather circulation patterns.

In this study we compare the ship-based and buoy-based radiative, bulk latent, and sensible heat fluxes, as well as the meteorological state variables used to compute the turbulent heat fluxes. The buoy net surface heat flux measurements appear to have an overall uncertainty near the target 10 W m-2, when careful attention is paid to the state variables. When hourly averaged data were unavailable, the telemetered daily averaged data were used in combination with an estimate of the mesoscale gustiness. In the eastern tropical Pacific a warm layer correction to account for stratification above 1-m depth was important only during the warm season (January-May) near the equator. These high-quality, cross-validated buoy heat flux time series are then used to assess the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/ NCAR), NCEP/Department of Energy, and 40-year European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalyses' surface heat fluxes. All reanalyses show that over warm water where deep convection is prominent, latent heat loss is too large and net solar radiation is too weak; conversely, in regions of stratocumulus over cool water, net solar radiation is too strong, and for NCEP/NCAR, latent heat loss is too weak.",,"Boundary layers; Buoys; Climate change; Heat flux; Oceanography; Weather forecasting; boundary layer; buoy system; heat flux; measurement method; mooring system; numerical method; solar radiation; stratification; weather forecasting; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751101335

With the co-operation of provincial and municipal environmental agencies, samples have been collected at urban and rural monitoring sites across the country. Samples were collected in evacuated canisters and analyzed by gas chromatography with a mass-selective detector. Using data from all sites, the composite average 1,3-butadiene concentration at urban sites in Canada for the years 1995-2003 was found to be 0.22 μg m -3 and the composite median was 0.17 μg m-3. In general, 1,3-butadiene concentrations were higher at commercial and industrial sites than at residential sites, particularly at sites close to street level in the urban core. The highest 24-h 1,3-butadiene concentration of 2.58 μg m-3 was measured at the Sarnia, Ontario, site in 2001; this site was significantly influenced by industrial point sources. Mean 24-h 1,3-butadiene concentrations at rural sites were typically an order of magnitude lower than at urban sites. 1,3-Butadiene concentrations varied by season, particularly in western Canada, and by day of week. Concentrations of 1,3-butadiene decreased from 1995 to 2003 in response to reduced rates of emissions from mobile and point sources. At most urban monitoring sites, the concentrations of 1,3-butadiene and acetylene were highly correlated; this supports the hypothesis that 1,3-butadiene is emitted primarily by mobile sources. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The lanthanum ternary halide lattice, co-doped by different lanthanide ions, can exhibit up-conversion emission in a wide spectral range from blue to red. For this purpose (Pr 3+) and (Yb3+) ions and also co-doping by other Ln ions are promising systems. In this lecture the excited states dynamics in the praseodymium and praseodymium co-doped by ytterbium ion ternary halides will be discussed basing on the high resolution absorption, emission and emission excitation spectra at 293, 77 and 4 K as well as the decay times of the crystals with different concentrations from 2 mol% to stoichiometric of the optically active ions. Changes of the spectral properties in the range of 4f-5d and 4f-4f transitions are observed for the series of halides (Cl, Br, I). The differences in emission behavior can be explained by changes of the crystal field strengths, subtle variations of electron-phonon coupling, decrease of the phonon energies and increase of covalency. Some features in the emission vary with excitation energy and in some cases exciton emission and strong re-absorption was detected. Lowering of the emission efficiency in the concentrated systems can be due to the concentration quenching and energy migration to traps. On the other hand, formation of the polymeric chains in the structure is responsible for strong ion-ion interaction, which can promote the up-conversion process. Excitation into 1D2 of the Pr3+ state leads to up-conversion emission from 3P0 state, whereas 940 nm pumping line used in excitation of 2F5/2 level of the Yb3+ in K2LaCl5:5% Pr3+, 2% Yb 3+ crystal is responsible for both emission from 1D 2 and 3P0 of Pr3+ levels. Non-radiative energy transfers between Pr3+ ions and Pr 3+-Yb3+ ions are observed and up-conversion mechanisms are proposed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Small scooters, which are very much used in the congested centers of several cities are a remarkable source of air pollution. Therefore every effort to reduce the emissions is an important contribution to improve the air quality in urban centers. In the present work detailed investigations of particle emissions of different 2-stroke scooters with direct injection and with carburetor were performed. The nanoparticulate emissions with different lube oils and fuels were measured by means of SMPS, (CPC) and NanoMet. Also the particle mass emission (PM) was measured with the same method as for Diesel engines. It can be stated, that the oil and fuel quality have a considerable influence on the particle emissions, which are mainly oil condensates. The engine technology influences the (nano)particle emissions by: mixture preparation, mixture tuning, oil consumption, postoxidation, quality, condition and temperature of the catalyst. Since the particulate emission of the 2-S consists mainly of lube oil condensates the minimization of oil consumption stays always an important goal.

However, recently, most diesel exhaust systems have started to be additionally equipped with wall-flow particulate filters. Most commercial filters are also catalyst-coated, which gives the potential option to combine oxidation and filtration functionalities in a single reactor. The present study compares the steady-state and transient performance characteristics of catalyzed wall-flow diesel particulate filters to the respective flow-through oxidation catalysts. The comparison is based on a theoretical basis, using mathematical models previously published and experimentally validated. It is shown that the conversion efficiency of the wall-flow catalyzed filter is a complex function of thermal, mass-transport, and chemical phenomena that occur simultaneously. Under steady-state conditions, the wall-flow reactor has a higher conversion efficiency, compared to a respective flow-through with the same dimensions and catalytic loading, under mass-transfer-limited conditions (high temperature, high flow rate). Under kinetically limited conditions, both systems perform identically. The transient performance during a simulated cold-start operation of the wall-flow reactor is shown to be inferior, compared to the flow-through one. The phenomena are analyzed and explained in detail by examining the time-dependent profiles of flow distribution, temperature, and species concentration in both reactors. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalyst activity; Chemical reactors; Coated materials; Exhaust gases; Filters (for fluids); Particles (particulate matter); Steady flow; Wall flow; Diesel exhaust systems; Steady-state conditions; Transient performance; Wall flow reactors; Industrial emissions; Catalyst activity; Chemical reactors; Coated materials; Exhaust gases; Filters (for fluids); Industrial emissions; Particles (particulate matter); Steady flow; Wall flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744746905

Future trends in urban water consumption patterns will be determined by changes in population concentration, per-capita water use, climate, and the proportion of water retained for the production of instream ecosystem services. The objective of our research was to identify patterns of renewable water availability and urban consumption throughout the globe between the years 2000 and 2015. To better understand the interactions between urban consumption and regional availability of renewable water we used a modified ecological footprint (EF) approach. Urban water footprint areas were differentially sensitive to changes in consumption and changes in water availability; our results suggest climate induced reductions in water availability may be more of a concern than population growth or increased per-capita for securing continued supplies of water to large cities.

Having placed Australian cities in the context of such turbulence, this paper considers implications of the contested status of urban nature for the practice of nature conservation.

To illustrate this point, I present NIR IFS analysis of the central starburst region of NGC 1140, obtained with CIRPASS on Gemini-South. While strong [Fe ii ] emission is found throughout the galaxy, higher-order Brackett emission is predominantly associated with the northern starburst region. Based on the spatial distributions of the [Fe ii ] versus Brackett line emission, I conclude that a galaxy-wide starburst was induced several ×107 yr ago, with more recent starburst activity concentrated around the northern starburst region. I look forward and discuss the exciting prospects that IFS at higher spatial (and spectral) resolution will allow us trace (i) the massive outflows (""superwinds"") expected to originate in the dense, young massive star clusters commonly found in intense starburst environments, and (ii) their impact on the galaxy's ISM. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Nascimento de Castro 2127, Lagoa Nova, 59056-450, Natal, RN, Brazil","Shrimp aquaculture is a recent development of the Brazilian agribusiness but has increased by about 20% per year during the last decade along the semi-arid NE coast due to the optimal climate and environmental setting. The activity has been blamed to cause several environmental impacts mostly associated with the emission of large amounts of N and P to estuaries. Here we estimate, using an emission factor approach, the annual emissions of N and P from intensive shrimp farming and other anthropogenic sources and natural processes to six estuaries along the coast of Rio Grande do Norte State, NE Brazil, where about 40% of the shrimp farming area of the country is located. Emission factors for natural sources (atmospheric deposition and soil runoff) are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those from anthropogenic sources. Shrimp farming presents the largest average emission factors for N (1.9 t km- 2 yr- 1), followed by agriculture (1.3 t km - 2 yr- 1) and husbandry (0.7 t km- 2 yr - 1). For P, largest average emission factors are from husbandry (0.9 t km- 2 yr- 1) and agriculture (0.34 t km- 2 yr- 1), although shrimp farming also presents a significant emission factor per unit of area for P (0.23 t km- 2 yr- 1). Wastewaters and solid waste disposal and urban runoff present much lower emission factors per unit of area, due to the low level of urbanization and small population of the basins. Anthropogenic emissions of N and P are 20 to 50 times higher than natural emissions. Agriculture contributes with the larger fraction (40% to 63%) of the total annual N load to three of the rivers, whereas P emissions are dominated by husbandry (64% to 74%). Wastewaters contribute with significant loads of N and P to the more populated basin only (35% and 11%, for N and P, respectively). Urban runoff is practically negligible in all basins, (less than 5% of the total emission), with the exception of Guamaré basin where 22% of the N emission come from this source. Aquaculture is the most important source of N to the Açu basin (58%), where the largest pond surface is observed. In the other basins N contribution from aquaculture ranges from 2% to 22%. Aquaculture contribution to the total P emission is small in all basins, varying from 2% to 14%. Notwithstanding the small area covered by shrimp farms relative to agriculture or husbandry, the location of farms adjacent to estuarine areas makes possible direct inputs to estuarine waters, while most other emissions go firstly to soils before eventually being transported to surface waters. In general, hydrochemical proxies of nutrient loads were consistent with the estimated loads. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

More than half of the cane is harvested to produce bioethanol as a fuel for light vehicles. The distilleries produce approximately 13 L of distillery waste (vinasse) for each litre of ethanol produced. In the 1980s there was considerable concern over the long-term effects of the disposal of this material (containing about 1% carbon and high in K) on cane yields if it was applied to the field. At the same time there was a growing movement to abandon the practice of pre-harvest burning and some research was showing that some Brazilian varieties of sugar cane were able to obtain significant contributions of N from plant-associated biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). For these reasons an experiment was installed on a cane plantation in the state of Pernambuco, NE Brazil to investigate the long-term effects of vinasse and N fertiliser additions and the practice of pre-harvest burning on crop and sugar yield, soil fertility parameters, N balance and soil C stocks. The results showed that over a 16-year period, trash conservation (abandonment of burning) increased cane yields by 25% from a mean of 46 to 58 Mg ha-1. Vinasse applications (80 m3 ha-1 crop-1) increased mean cane and sugar yield by 12 to 13% and the application of 80 kg N ha-1 as urea increased cane yields by 9%, but total sugar yield by less than 6% (from 7.0 to 7.4 Mg ha-1 crop-1). The total N balance for the soil/plant system when only the surface 20 cm of the soil was considered was positive in plots where no N fertiliser was added. However, the data indicated that during the 16 years of the study considerable quantities of soil organic matter were accumulated below 20 cm depth such that the N balance considering the soil to 60 cm depth was strongly positive, except where N fertiliser was added. The data indicated that there were considerable BNF inputs to the system, which was consistent with its low response to N fertiliser and low N fertiliser-use-efficiency. There were no significant effects of vinasse or urea addition, or trash conservation on soil C stocks, although the higher yields proportioned by trash conservation had potentially significant benefits for increased mitigation of CO2 emissions where the main use of the cane was for bioethanol production. © Springer 2006.","Biological nitrogen fixation; Carbon sequestration; Nitrogen fertiliser; Sugarcane; Trash conservation; Vinasse","burning; carbon; fertilizer; nitrogen; soil by origin or composition; Brazil; Pernambuco; South America; Saccharum; Saccharum hybrid cultivar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646556964

We evaluated associations between gene variants in CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTM3, EPHX1, and NQO1 and adult brain tumor incidence. Cases were patients with glioma (n = 489), meningioma (n = 197), or acoustic neuroma (n = 96) diagnosed from 1994 to 1998 at three U.S. hospitals. Controls were 799 patients admitted to the same hospitals for nonmalignant conditions. DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 1277 subjects, and genotyping was conducted for CYP1A1 I462V, CYP1B1 V432L, EPHX1 Y113H, GSTM3 *A/*B (intron 6 deletion), and NQO1 P187S. The CYP1B1 V432L homozygous variant was associated with decreased risk of meningioma (odds ratio [OR] = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-1.0) but not the other tumor types. The GSTM3 *B/*B genotype was associated with increased risk of glioma (OR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0-5.2) and meningioma (OR = 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3-9.8). Increased risks associated with GSTM3 *B/*B were observed in younger subjects (age < 50) and older subjects (age ≥ 50), in men and women, and within each study site. The magnitude of association for GSTM3 with glioma and meningioma was greater among ever-smokers than among those who had never smoked. None of the other genotypes showed consistent associations with any tumor type. The association with the GSTM3 *B allele, while intriguing, requires replication, and additional research is needed to clarify the function of the GSTM3 alleles studied here.

Addressing more localised impacts requires that new integrated modelling approaches are developed to address fine-scale processes including species' dispersal and local connectivity. Here we integrate four models (a continental scale bioclimatic envelope model, a regional scale bioclimate and land use suitability model, a dispersal model, and a connectivity model) in a scale-dependent hierarchical framework. The approach has been used to analyse the fine scale impacts of climate change on species' distributions within two contrasting case study regions located in East Anglia (UK) and Almeria (Spain). Eight and six species respectively were used to test our approach under three climate change scenarios. Despite the uncertainties inherent in the modelling approach, our analyses suggest two general conclusions: (i) climate change involves the development of transient conditions and fragmentation within the core of species distributions; (ii) climate change would favour the opening of gaps within the current vegetation zones, rather than a simple zonal shift of them. Dynamic and integrated conservation policies are required, that take account of the current and potential future spatial arrangement of species and their habitats, to assist species to respond to future environmental change. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective and methods: We studied the temporal variability of finger-tapping and gait in 9 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) before and after they undertook a physical rehabilitation programme. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) was performed in these subjects to look for changes in metabolic brain activity after completion of the rehabilitation program. Results: The reduction of variability was seen not only in gait but also other repetitive movements such as finger tapping. Furthermore, here we show differences in resting regional cerebral glucose utilisation in these patients compared to healthy controls (significant hypometabolism-p&lt;0.001-for the PD group in the right parietal and temporal lobes, left temporal and frontal lobes and a hypermetabolism in the left cerebellum) and specific changes following the improvements in repetitive movement abilities (significant metabolic increment-p&lt;0.001-in the PD group in the right cerebellum and in the right parietal and temporal lobes). Conclusions: Although our study does not allow us to draw firm conclusions, it provides new information on the neural basis of auditory stimulation in PD. Our results extend those from previous studies to show improvement in the temporal variability of two types of rhythmic movements after participation by PD patients in a physical rehabilitation programme, along with changes in glucose uptake in several brain areas involved in sensorimotor processing. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The conditions investigated are 3.8-15 wt% for THF concentration and 0.2-3.5 MPa for the CO2 partial pressure range, conditions that are adapted to the use of the corresponding hydrate slurries as secondary refrigerants. Both differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods were used for the experimental determinations. Experimental values were compared with modeling, combining the van der Waals and Platteeuw approach with the Redlich-Kwong equation of state associated to a modified Huron-Vidai (MHV2) mixing rule. At fixed temperature, adding THF to the systems results in a drastic reduction of Co2 equilibrium pressure. For instance, at 280 K, a 78.9% decrease of CO 2 pressure is experimentally observed if the solution contains 3.8 wt% of THF. Furthermore, a dissociation enthalpy of (CO2: + THF) hydrates roughly two times higher that that of CO2 hydrates was calculated from measured and predicted data of hydrate formation. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Data acquisition; Differential scanning calorimetry; Differential thermal analysis; Enthalpy; Hydrates; Hydrate formation; Latent heat of dissociation; Tetrahydrofuran (THF); Furan resins; equilibrium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30444447204

This approach assumes a gradual increase in the number of Parties involved and their level of commitment according to participation and differentiation rules. The analysis focuses on two global greenhouse gas emission profiles resulting in CO2-equivalent concentrations stabilising at 550 and 650 ppmv in 2100 and 2150, respectively. Three Multi-Stage cases have been developed in order to assess different types of thresholds. These share three consecutive stages representing different commitments: stage 1 - no quantitative commitments; stage 2 emission-limitation targets and stage 3 - emission reduction targets. The analysis shows that by 2025 all three cases result in emission reduction objectives for all Annex I regions of at least 30-55% below their 1990 levels for 550 ppmv, whereas for 650 ppmv target they range from 0 to 20%. Furthermore, early participation is required of the major non-Annex I regions through emission limitation targets i.e. before 2025 and 2050 for the 550 and 650 ppmv targets, respectively. The first participation threshold for adopting emission-limitation targets on the basis of a capability-responsibility index (as introduced here) can provide for a balanced and timely participation of non-Annex I regions. Major strengths and weaknesses of the climate regimes are discussed and important obstacles and pre-conditions for their feasibility and acceptability are highlighted. © Springer 2006.","Differentiation of future commitments; International regime; Multi-Stage; Post-Kyoto climate regime","climate change; emission; environmental effect; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646511766

The first (CLE) scenario reflects implementation of current air quality legislation around the world, while the second (MFR) represents a more optimistic case in which all currently feasible technologies are applied to achieve maximum emission reductions. We contrast these scenarios with the more pessimistic IPCC SRES A2 scenario. Ensemble simulations for the year 2000 are consistent among models and show a reasonable agreement with surface ozone, wet deposition, and NO 2 satellite observations. Large parts of the world are currently exposed to high ozone concentrations and high deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems. By 2030, global surface ozone is calculated to increase globally by 1.5 ± 1.2 ppb (CLE) and 4.3 ± 2.2 ppb (A2), using the ensemble mean model results and associated ±1 σ standard deviations. Only the progressive MFR scenario will reduce ozone, by -2.3 ± 1.1 ppb. Climate change is expected to modify surface ozone by -0.8 ± 0.6 ppb, with larger decreases over sea than over land. Radiative forcing by ozone increases by 63 ± 15 and 155 ± 37 mW m-2 for CLE and A2, respectively, and decreases by -45 ± 15 mW m-2 for MFR. We compute that at present 10.1% of the global natural terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to nitrogen deposition above a critical load of 1 g N m-2 yr-1. These percentages increase by 2030 to 15.8% (CLE), 10.5% (MFR), and 25% (A2).

With a range of emission scenarios for man-made ozone precursor emission sources available, a wide range of model trends were predicted for the period up to 2030. In the scenario based on current planned air pollution controls, IIASA CLE, methane shows a strong upward trend, ozone shows a weaker upward trend, and carbon monoxide is approximately flat in baseline air masses. In one of the more pessimistic IPCC SRES scenarios, A2, all three gases show future increases. However, in the scenario based on maximum feasible emission reductions, IIASA MFR all three trace gases decline. By 2030, projected climate change reduces the growth in CH4, but has insignificant effects on baseline CO and O3 in these simulations.

Most existing models used to describe the fate of chemicals in surface water and sediment generally consider a 'static scenario', in which a contaminant is discharged at a constant rate and environmental input parameters do not change during the simulation time. This approach is not suitable in environmental scenarios characterized by daily or periodic changes of several input parameters. The aim of this study is to estimate approximate emissions of DDT lo Lake Maggiore using a new surface water model, (DynA Model) that describes the fate of a chemical in a dynamic scenario. Methods. The model is developed on the grounds of an existing and validated model (QWASI). A numerical solution was adopted to build the fully dynamic version of the model. Results and Discussion. The model was applied to Lake Maggiore emitting DDT at a constant rate until steady-state was reached. Emissions were stopped and later sporadic 'pulse' emissions were added. This was done to calculate the amount of DDT needed to simulate concentrations close to those measured in water and sediments. This allowed the evaluation of the order of magnitude of emissions. An uncertainty analysis for sediment resuspension was also performed, given the lack of measured resuspension rates. Conclusion. The model showed the time response of the Lake Maggiore system to varying emission scenarios and provided what are regarded as reasonable estimates of DDT emissions. The model demonstrated the importance of sediment-water exchange. Recommendation and Outlook. In order to better calculate DDT concentrations the model should be run with different discharge scenarios to clarify the time trends of concentrations, possibly with the use of different sets of measured data (such as biota and sediment deposition/resuspension rates). © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","DDT; DynA Model (Dynamic Aquatic Model); Fugacity; Lake Maggiore; Models; Resuspension; Sediments; Unsteady-state; Water","chlorphenotane; fresh water; chemical pollutant; DDT; environmental fate; lake water; resuspension; sediment-water interface; water pollution; article; chemistry; Italy; reproducibility; sediment; theoretical model; time; water flow; water pollutant; water supply; DDT; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Italy; Models, Theoretical; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply; Eurasia; Europe; Lake Maggiore",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29344449077

One of the most common restinga vegetation types in Rio de Janeiro state, an open woodland, is dominated by the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) tree Clusia hilariana Schltdl. (Clusiaceae). We provide allometric equations and biomass estimation for this species on three sites varying woody plant cover. Estimated aboveground biomass stock of C. hilariana plus the litter accumulated underneath the canopy of these plants ranged from 0.64 to 8.63 t ha-1 depending on plant cover. These values are often comparable to those of the entire woody component of many neotropical savannas, which have been claimed to have important impact on global carbon cycles. The litter-layer represents 31% of aboveground biomass, which is very high when compared to other tropical savannas. This indicates that slow decomposition may play an important role on carbon accumulation at the studied ecosystem. Thus, C. hilariana, despite its conservative strategy of carbon acquisition via CAM, gives a high contribution to biomass stock in this nutrient-poor coastal vegetation in the tropics. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, reactions proceed stereoselectively to give adducts of exo stereochemistry with the approach of the carbonyl ylide dipoles from the less-hindered face of cyclopropenes. The electronic properties of the substituent at the C3 position of cyclopropenes play an important role in governing the reactivity of cyclopropenes: when the C3 position is substituted by electron-acceptors such as the methoxycarbonyl or cyano groups, the yields of adducts are decreased significantly or no adducts can be detected at all. Relative reactivities of cyclopropenes were quantified by competition experiments to give the best correlation with σF-Taft constants. Both measured photoelectron spectra and ground-state calculations of a series of 1,2-diphenylcyclopropenes indicate considerable lowering of cyclopropene π-HOMO energies by substitution with an acceptor group. Such changes in electronic structures of cyclopropenes may cause the inversion of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) interactions from HOMOcyclopropene-LUMOylide to LUMOcyclopropene- HOMOylide type. In terms of philicity, nucleophilic properties of acceptor-substituted cyclopropenes are diminished to such an extent that these species are no longer good nucleophiles in the reaction with carbonyl ylides, and neither are they good electrophiles, being unreactive.

With this event, two such market emerges: a commodity market for CO2 for use in EOR projects and a trading market for credits created by governments in programs to reduce GHG emissions. Governments are on the move to restrict companies.

Two models contain only dispersive sites, whereas the other two models account explicitly for the dispersive and electrostatic sites. Using numerous data in the literature on benzene adsorption on graphitized thermal carbon black at various temperatures, we have found that the effect of surface mediation on interaction between adsorbed benzene molecules must be accounted for to describe correctly the adsorption isotherm as well as the isosteric heat. Among the two models with partial charges tested, the WSKS model of Wick et al.1 that has only six dispersive sites and three discrete partial charges is better than the very expensive all-atom model of Jorgensen and Severance.2 Adsorbed benzene molecules on graphitized thermal carbon black have a complex orientation with respect to distance from the surface and also with respect to loading. At low loadings, they adopt the parallel configuration relative to the graphene surface, whereas at higher loadings (still less than monolayer coverage) some molecules adopt a slant orientation to maximize the fluid-fluid interaction. For loadings in the multilayer region, the orientation of molecules in the first layer is influenced by the presence of molecules in the second layer.

The term 'gross emissions' means gas flux measurements from the reservoir surface without natural pre-impoundment emissions by natural bodies such as the river channel, seasonal flooding and terrestrial ecosystems. The net emissions result from deducting pre-existing emissions by the reservoir. A power dam emits biogenic gases such as CO2 and CH4. However, studies comparing gas emissions (gross emissions) from the reservoir surface with emissions by thermo-power generation technologies show that the hydro-based option presents better results in most cases analyzed. In this study, measurements were carried in the Miranda, Barra Bonita, Segredo, Três Marias, Xingó, and Samuel and Tucuruí reservoirs, located in two different climatological regimes. Additional data were used here from measurements taken at the Itaipu and Serra da Mesa reservoirs. Comparisons were also made between emissions from hydro-power plants and their thermo-based equivalents. Bearing in mind that the estimated values for hydro-power plants include emissions that are not totally anthropogenic, the hydro-power plants studied generally posted lower emissions than their equivalent thermo-based counterparts. Hydro-power complexes with greater power densities (capacity/area flooded-W/m2), such as Itaipu, Xingó, Segredo and Miranda, have the best performance, well above thermo-power plants using state-of-the-art technology: combined cycle fueled by natural gas, with 50% efficiency.

We describe the functional expression of the firefly luciferase gene, a reporter commonly used to tag genes in many other cellular systems. Due to a non-standard codon usage by this yeast, the CUG codons were first mutated to UUG to allow functional expression. When integrated into the chromosome of C. albicans with a strong constitutive promoter, cells bioluminesce when provided with luciferin substrate in their media. When fused to the inducible promoter from the HWP1 gene, expression and bioluminescence was only detected in cultures conditioning hyphal growth. We further used the luciferase gene as a selection to isolate transformed cell lines from clinical isolates of C. albicans, using a high-density screening strategy that purifies transformed colonies by virtue of light emission. This strategy requires no drug or auxotrophic selectable marker, and we were thus able to generate stable transformants of clinical isolates that are identical to the parental strain in all aspects tested, other than their bioluminescence. The firefly luciferase gene can, therefore, be used as a sensitive reporter to analyze gene function both in laboratory and clinical isolates of this medically important yeast. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, an in vitro propagation method for 'fragrant taro' was developed, and the effects of thidiazuron (TDZ) and benzylaminopurine (BAP) on shoot-tip differentiation and multiplication were analysed. Shoot-tips were first cultured in half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) semi-solid medium containing different concentrations of TDZ, BAP and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) for 30 d. The best result was found with 1.0 mg l-1 TDZ treatment. Plantlets were then sub-cultured in MS liquid medium for another 90 d. After 30 d, the highest multiplication rate (2.5) was observed in medium with 1.0 mg l -1 BAP and 0.5 mg l-1 NAA. The multiplication rate in medium supplemented with 3.0 mg l-1 BAP and 0.1 mg l-1 TDZ was the highest (4.7) after 90 d of culture. Well-developed shoots were rooted in MS medium solidified with 0.6% (w/v) agar, supplemented with 1.0 mg l -1 BAP, 0.5 mg l-1 NAA and 500 mg l-1 active carbon before transplanting. A protocol for propagating 'fragrant taro' in vitro was established in which shoots maintained rapid multiplication for a long time.

Results were obtained using an automatic gas chromatograph, during 1998-2001 (April-October) and 2004 (February-July), optimized for systematic, unattended measurement of 62 C2-C10 non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) every hour, 24 times a day, with detection limits below 0.1 ppbv. Annual average concentrations for most of the NMHC show very little variations along the years. Benzene is an exception; during year 2000, its concentration on ambient air decreased down to a half, after the enforcement of environmental regulations reducing the benzene content on fuels. Significant correlations found among various hydrocarbons and the observed daily cycle indicate that traffic is their principal source. However, some compounds like acetylene and benzene, commonly used as tracers of vehicular emissions, show in our case other sources, during working days for acetylene, and continuous for benzene. This is now relevant, especially when considering that such measuring systems are now starting to be deployed around many cities, all over the world, because in urban areas where similar influences by industrial or commercial sources are to be expected, ratios like toluene/benzene or ethene/acetylene, cannot be used to characterize traffic polluted air masses. Isoprene has been found to have mostly an anthropogenic origin during winter, and a dual anthropogenic-biogenic origin during summer, when natural isoprene amounts 55% of the total.

We use the Theil index of inequality and show that this decomposition methodology can be extended for analyzing between- and within-group inequality components. We can thus analyze the factors behind inequalities in per capita CO2 emissions across countries, between groups of countries and within groups of countries. The empirical illustration for international data suggests some points. Firstly, international inequality in per capita CO2 emissions is mainly attributable to inequalities in per capita income levels, which helps to explain its recent reduction, while differences in carbon intensity of energy and energy intensity have made a less significant contribution. This result is strongly influenced by the performance of China and India. Secondly, the between-group inequality component, which is the biggest component, is also largely explained by the income factor. Thirdly, the within-group inequality component increased slightly during the period, something mainly due to the change in the income factor and the interaction terms in a few regions. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In particular the wavelength of the tryptophan fluorescence emission peak (λmax) is a valuable parameter to characterize properties of the unfolded state. In all cases with a typical red shift of the emission spectrum occurring during structural unfolding we observed a larger magnitude of this shift for GndHCl-induced unfolding as compared to thermal unfolding. Although a quantitative relation between aggregation and reduction of the unfolding induced red shifts cannot be given, our data indicate that protein aggregation contributes significantly to smaller magnitudes of red shifts as observed during thermal unfolding. In addition, other properties of the unfolded states, most probable structural compactness or simply differences in the conformational scrambling, also affect the magnitude of red shifts. For the irreversible unfolding α-amylases studied here, transition temperatures and magnitudes of red shifts are strongly depending on heating rates. Lower protein concentrations and smaller heating rates lead to larger red shifts upon thermal unfolding, indicating that under these conditions the protein aggregation is less pronounced. © 2006 by the Biophysical Society.",,"amylase; hydrochloric acid; tryptophan; article; chemical parameters; correlation analysis; enzyme analysis; fluorescence spectroscopy; heating; protein aggregation; protein conformation; protein folding; quantitative analysis; spectrum; temperature dependence; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646231493

These can be used to investigate biogeographic patterns and processes, aid in paleoclimate reconstruction, and help evaluate the performance of climate models. The process of biomization relates pollen abundance data (from fossil or modern pollen spectra) to plant functional types (PFTs) and PFTs to biomes, which are globally recognized vegetation types. Describing the data in terms of PFTs makes use of known plant-climate relationships; plant structure and function, not floristics, are the basis of the vegetation reconstructions. The approach avoids problems associated with trying to map disparate reconstructions of past vegetation related to differences in regional approach or paleoecological methodology. It also circumvents the problems inherent in the interpretation of past climate directly from fossil pollen data in cases where fossil assemblages have no modern counterparts. The approach was designed with the evaluation of climate model performance in mind and has been applied widely in this context. Typically, a vegetation model is driven by data from a paleoclimate simulation, and its output is compared with the mapped paleovegetation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: This two-part study was conducted in order to investigate the possible role of serotonin (5-HT) in the behavioral effects of N2O by clarifying its effects on regional brain concentrations of 5-HT and assessing the influence of 5-HT antagonist and reuptake inhibiting drugs on the anxiolytic-like behavioral effect of N2O. Methods: In experiment A, male, 150-200 g Sprague-Dawley rats were killed following a 15-min exposure to room air or 70% N2O. The frontal cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum and hypothalamus were dissected out and analyzed by HPLC with electrochemical detection for content of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA); dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were also measured. In experiment B, male 18-22 g NIH Swiss mice were pretreated with the 5-HT2 antagonist cinanserin, the 5-HT3 antagonist LY-278,584, the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine or saline and tested in the light/dark exploration test under 70% N2O 30 min after pretreatment. Results: In experiment A, N2O produced differential effects on 5-HT neurons in distinct brain areas. There was increased 5-HT turnover in the hypothalamus, decreased turnover in the frontal cortex but no changes in either hippocampus or corpus striatum. By comparison, dopamine turnover in these brain regions was unaltered by N2O exposure. In experiment B, pretreatment with neither cinanserin, LY-278,584 nor fluoxetine had any appreciable effect on the N2O-induced increase in time spent in the light compartment. Only cinanserin significantly reduced the N2O-induced increase in transitions. Conclusions: While neurochemical results suggest an effect of N2O on brain 5-HT function, there was no effect of 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 antagonists or 5-HT reuptake inhibitor on N2O-induced anxiolytic-like behavior. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Along with a general move towards marketbased approaches in environmental regulation and other fields of public policy (see Djelic ch. 3), successful examples of these new markets can be cited, including the creation of pollution rights, resource use quotas, and credits for reducing environmental impacts (Daily and Ellison 2002). The most prominent example is the so-called Acid Rain Program introduced by the United States in the 1990s to reduce the country's overall SO2 (sulfur dioxide) emissions (Ellerman et al. 2000). These developments have been grist to the mill for advocates of the free market who criticize government intervention for its inefficiencies and the distortions it creates. From the perspective of advocates of the free market, environmental pollution or overuse of natural resources occur when property rights over the environment or natural resources do not exist or are poorly enforced. Prices then do not adequately reflect the scarcity of a resource or the damage to an environmental good, and consequently produce market failures. Thus, to avoid pollution and overuse, property rights must (and can) be established and enforced, and the transfer of those rights should be allowed, thus creating a market in which undistorted price signals emerge. The market is thereby seen as the solution to environmental problems, whereas regulation would only create more distortions (Anderson and Leal 1991, 1997). © Cambridge University Press 2006 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649194695

Therefore, soil temperature and moisture for snow-covered and snow-free areas can be very different. In computing these soil state variables, many land surface schemes in climate models do not explicitly distinguish between snow-covered and snow-free areas. Even if they do, some schemes average these state variables to calculate grid-mean energy fluxes and these averaged state variables are then used at the beginning of the next time step. This latter approach introduces a numerical error in that heat is redistributed from snow-free areas to snow-covered areas, resulting in a more rapid snowmelt. This study focuses on the latter approach and examines the sensitivity of soil moisture and streamflow to the treatment of the soil state variables in the presence of snow cover by using WATCLASS, a land surface scheme linked with a hydrologic model. The model was tested for the 1993 snowmelt period on the Upper Grand River in Southern Ontario, Canada.

A simple, if not rhetorical, question that belies a straightforward answer. Ultimately, provenance for this well-known transformation depends on a second question: what chemical process actually constitutes a Pummerer reaction? Perhaps the original candidate for this role was reported by Fromm and Achert in 1903,1 who described the decomposition of dibenzylsulfoxide (1) upon attempted distillation to furnish the suite of products 2-5 (Scheme 1). This study did not include the deliberate treatment of the sulfoxide with an electrophile (i.e., H+, Ac2O), a precondition of the modern version of the Pummerer reaction, and so it is likely that adventitious and unacknowledged acid autocatalyzed the decomposition. No mechanistic discussion attended this observation, and the surprising formal oxidative transposition that was observed caused the authors to doubt the structure of their starting material: ""Der merkwürdige Zerfall des Benzylsulfoxyds bei 210°, insbesondere die Bildung von Benzaldehyd bei dieser Zersetzung, liess Zweifel darüber autkommen, ob die dem Sulfoxyd zugeschriebene Constitutions-formel: (C6H5·CH2)2S:O, die richtige sei. Es musste in diesem Falleja eine Wanderung des Sauerstoffs vom Schwefel an den Kohlenstoff stattgefunden haben. Eine solche Wanderung konnte man ausschliessen, wenn man dem Benzylsulfoxyd die folgende Constitutions-formel, in welcher der Sauerstoff von vornherein an Kohlenstoff gebunden ist, zuschrieb: C6H5·CH2·S· O·CH2·C6H5.""1 (The unusual decomposition of benzylsulfoxide at 210°, in particular the formation of benzaldehyde upon this decomposition, raises concerns about whether the constitutional formula assigned to the sulfoxide, (C6H5·CH2)2S:O, is correct. If it is so, then migration of the oxygen from sulfur to carbon must have taken place. Such a migration can be excluded if one assigns the following constitutional formula, in which the oxygen is bound at carbon from the outset, to the benzylsulfoxide: C6H5·CH2·S· O·CH2·C6H5.) Six years later in early 1909, Smythe picked up this train of research and described the products detected upon exposing 1 to the undeniable Pummerer activators HCl and Ac2O.2 Smythe observed formation of the characteristic Pummerer reaction product benzaldehyde (2) (and its derived thioacetal 7), and his mechanistic speculation started out in a productive vein by suggesting that the hydroxysulfide 9 preceded the aldehyde. However, Smythe was apparently at a loss to rationalize the intermediacy of this alcohol, and he resorted to invoking what he termed 'dynamic isomerism' between 1 and 9, by analogy with known keto-enol tautomerizations, to justify its presence. Later in that same year, in a paper that cites the work of Smythe, Rudolph Pummerer authored his now famous report on the consequences of treating the sulfinyl acetic acid 10 with HCl.3a Pummerer meticulously characterized the product distribution, which included the aldehyde 13 and thiophenol. Once again, a formal oxidation at carbon required explanation, and Pummerer rose to this challenge by invoking the intermediacy of the sulfurane 11 and then its formal 1,2-chloride shift product, the sulfide 12. The similarity of Pummerer's sulfurane to the currently adopted thionium ion intermediate, Ph(+)S=CH-, should not be overlooked (simple chloride ionization from 11), and this hypothesis provided for the first time a rational mechanistic framework for discussing sulfoxide decomposition chemistry. Pummerer evaluated and then rejected Smythe's dynamic isomerism explanation, noting that ""Auf die ausführlichen Desmotropie-Betrachtungen des Verfassers kann ich nicht näher eingehen, sie stehen in beträchtlichem Gegensatz zur heutigen Kenntnis derartiger Probleme.""3a (I don't want to elaborate further on the author's detailed discussion of 'desmotropy', as it stands in considerable contrast to modern understanding of such problems.) Thus, while Pummerer was perhaps not the first researcher to observe his eponymous reaction, he appears to be the first to understand what he was observing. It is unclear whether Pummerer appreciated the significance of his (or Smythe's) discovery. He published only one follow-up report on the topic in 1910,3b which did, however, describe the reaction of a sulfoxide 10a with acetic anhydride in the classical Pummerer sense, before embarking on a long and distinguished career in the general area of industrial organic chemistry. In fact, Pummerer's biographer, R.E. Oesper, wrote a 1951 encomium that noted Pummerer's many contributions to both industrial chemistry and organic mechanistic studies, but failed even to mention the sulfoxide chemistry that now bears his name!4 So, why is the Pummerer reaction called 'The Pummerer reaction'? Perhaps the genesis of this term can be traced to a 1960 supplement for a 1959 article by Horner and Kaiser from Universität Mainz,5a who christened the reaction thusly: ""Die Analogie zur POLONOVSKI-Reaction liegt auf der Hand. Die Reaktion zwischen Sulfoxyden und Säureanhydriden wollen wir in Zukunft als 'Pummerer-Reaktion' bezeichnen.""5b (The analogy to the POLONOVSKI reaction is obvious. In the future, we would like to designate the reaction between sulfoxides and acid anhydrides as the 'Pummerer reaction'.). Research into the electrophile-promoted decomposition of sulfoxides proceeded only fitfully for the 50 years following Pummerer's initial observation, Figure 1. Sporadic reports of Pummerer-like chemistry appeared, but no systematic efforts to explore the process were documented until the 1959 Horner and Kaiser work. Perhaps the Mainz groups' attention to this obscure reaction, coupled with their elevation of the chemistry to 'named reaction' status, piqued the interest of other researchers, as the 1960s saw the beginning of an upsurge of research work that continues unabated to the present day. Early studies largely focused on mechanistic issues and attempted to explore the scope of the process, leading to elucidation of a detailed reaction mechanism. Other milestones include the first use in a natural product synthesis (illudin M by Matsumoto et al.6), the first example of C-C bond formation,7 and the first claim for asymmetric synthesis from a chiral sulfoxide.8. The mechanistic course of the Pummerer rearrangement has been explored through judicious use of deuterium- and O18-labeling experiments, kinetic analysis, and product identification studies.9 The confluence of results from these studies provides a self-consistent mechanistic picture, Scheme 2. A chiral sulfoxide is invoked to illustrate some of the mechanistic subtleties uncovered by the labeling studies, as the observation of significant levels of asymmetric induction would otherwise be at odds with passage through the commonly cited achiral thionium ion intermediate 20. Treatment of sulfoxide 16 with Ac2O rapidly provides the chiral sulfonium salt 17, which can racemize under certain circumstances (e.g., high acetate concentration) via the intermediacy of a sulfurane PhS(OAc)2CH2R. To limit this undesirable outcome, the effective acetate trap DCC has been introduced into the Pummerer mixture, albeit at some sacrifice in yield.10 If acetate acts as a base with 17 instead, ylide 18a will be formed, itself a resonance form of the sulfurane 18b. This ylide preserves the chirality at sulfur under standard Pummerer conditions, and it is postulated to serve as a direct precursor to (chiral) α-acetoxysulfide 21 via either intramolecular S-to-C transposition of the acetate group,11 or by intermolecular addition of exogenous acetate.12 Ejection of acetate from 18 competes with product formation, and this process can lead first to a tight ion pair 19 and then to a solvent separated ion pair 20. Both 19 and 20 can serve as precursors to α-acetoxysulfide 21, although the stereochemical consequences for each path may differ. The broader utility of the Pummerer reaction in organic synthesis stems, at least in large part, from the capability of the electrophilic intermediate 20 to combine productively with carbon π-nucleophiles and fashion new C-C bonds. The question then can be raised, 'How good of an electrophile is thionium ion 20?' Many studies have shown that electron rich arenes and alkenes are effective partners for 20. Some qualitative measure of sulfur-stabilized carbocation 20's electrophilicity can be gleaned from the seminal contributions of Mayr, who measured/calculated the electrophilicity parameter E for the species 22-24.13 By this scale, the doubly sulfur-stabilized carbocation ion 23 reacts with Mayr's reference π-type carbon nucleophiles a few orders of magnitude slower than the phenyl/oxygen stabilized carbocation 22, but significantly faster than the iminium ion 24. The energetics that govern the various competitive pathways that extend from 18 seem to be finely balanced, as variations of substrate structure/functionality, solvent, additives, etc. appear sufficient to steer the reaction down one channel or another. Oxygen-18 labeling studies provide evidence for the predominant or exclusive operation of each of these pathways under differing circumstances.9b.","Iodonium; Oxidation; Pummerer; Rearrangement; Sulfide; Sulfoxide","alkene derivative; amide; aromatic compound; cation; iodine derivative; Lewis acid; phosphite; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; polyene; polymer; sulfoxide; acylation; chemistry; cyclization; cycloaddition; priority journal; Pummerer reaction; review; solid state",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745645688

Two metabolic roles have been ascribed to this folate derivative. It has been proposed to 1) serve as a storage form of folate because it is chemically stable and accumulates in seeds and spores and 2) regulate folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism by inhibiting folate-dependent enzymes, specifically targeting folate-dependent de novo purine biosynthesis. Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) is the only enzyme that metabolizes 5-formylTHF and catalyzes its ATP-dependent conversion to 5,10-methenylTHF. This reaction determines intracellular 5-formylTHF concentrations and converts 5-formylTHF into an enzyme cofactor. The regulation and metabolic role of MTHFS in one-carbon metabolism was investigated in vitro and in human neuroblastoma cells. Steady-state kinetic studies revealed that 10-formylTHF, which exists in chemical equilibrium with 5,10-methenylTHF, acts as a tight binding inhibitor of mouse MTHFS. [6R]-10-formylTHF inhibited MTHFS with a Ki of 150 nM, and [6R,S]-10-formylTHF triglutamate inhibited MTHFS with a Ki of 30 nM. MTHFS is the first identified 10-formylTHF tight-binding protein. Isotope tracer studies in neuroblastoma demonstrate that MTHFS enhances de novo purine biosynthesis, indicating that MTHFS-bound 10-formylTHF facilitates de novo purine biosynthesis. Feedback metabolic regulation of MTHFS by 10-formylTHF indicates that 5-formylTHF can only accumulate in the presence of 10-formylTHF, providing the first evidence that 5-formylTHF is a storage form of excess formylated folates in mammalian cells. The sequestration of 10-formylTHF by MTHFS may explain why de novo purine biosynthesis is protected from common disruptions in the folate-dependent one-carbon network. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Biosynthesis; Cells; Concentration (process); Enzyme kinetics; Metabolism; Reaction kinetics; De novo purine; Enzyme cofactor; Isotope tracer; Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase; Enzymes; 10 formyltetrahydrofolic acid; 5,10 methenyltetrahydrofolate; adenosine triphosphate; folic acid derivative; folinic acid; methenyltetrahydrofolate sythetase; synthetase; unclassified drug; 5 formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase; 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase; ligase; purine; purine derivative; article; binding kinetics; controlled study; enzyme binding; enzyme inhibition; enzyme kinetics; feedback system; human; human cell; in vitro study; neuroblastoma; neuroblastoma cell; priority journal; protein binding; purine synthesis; steady state; binding site; biosynthesis; chemical structure; chemistry; drug antagonism; enzyme specificity; enzymology; mouse; neuroblastoma; physiology; tumor cell line; Mammalia; Binding Sites; Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Mice; Models, Molecular; Neuroblastoma; Purines; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645213880

The mycelia interact with a range of organic and inorganic substrates, as well as with different organisms such as bacteria, fungi, soil micro-and meso-fauna and the roots of secondary hosts or non-host plants. Some of the carbon allocated to the mycelium is used to make compounds such as enzymes, organic acids, siderophores or antibiotics, which influence biotic or abiotic substrates through processes such as decomposition, weathering or antibiosis. Organic and inorganic nutrients mobilized from these substrates can be taken up by the mycorrhizal mycelia and translocated to their plant hosts, influencing plant growth, community structure and vegetation dynamics. Ultimately these changes have further impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Different types of mycorrhizal symbiosis have evolved as adaptations to different suites of edaphic parameters, resulting in the characteristic vegetation types that dominate different terrestrial biomes. Other chapters in this book consider specific contributions of ectomycorrhizal fungi to mineral dissolution (see Wallander, Chapter 14, this volume), carbon and nitrogen cycling (see Hobbie & Wallander, Chapter 5, this volume) and mineral tunnelling (see Smits, Chapter 13, this volume). In this chapter we concentrate on how these activities are integrated and on ways in which ectomycorrhizal hyphae may interact with other microorganisms to influence biogeochemical cycles. © British Mycological Society 2006.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548163290

Attention on the anaerobic technology for improving the sustainability of sewage treatment has been paid mainly after the energy crisis in the 1970s. The successful use of anaerobic reactors (especially up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors) for the treatment of raw domestic sewage in tropical and sub-tropical regions (where ambient temperatures are not restrictive for anaerobic digestion) opened the opportunity to substitute the aerobic processes for the anaerobic technology in removal of the influent organic matter. Despite the success, effluents from anaerobic reactors treating domestic sewage require post-treatment in order to achieve the emission standards prevailing in most countries. Initially, the composition of this effluent rich in reduced compounds has required the adoption of post-treatment (mainly aerobic) systems able to remove the undesirable constituents. Currently, however, a wealth of information obtained on biological and physical-chemical processes related to the recovery or removal of nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur compounds creates the opportunity for new treatment systems. The design of DST plant with the anaerobic reactor as core unit coupled to the pre- and post-treatment systems in order to promote the recovery of resources and the polishing of effluent quality can improve the sustainability of treatment systems. This paper presents a broader view on the possible applications of anaerobic treatment systems not only for organic matter removal but also for resources recovery aiming at the improvement of the sustainability of DST. © Springer 2006.","Anaerobic processes; Domestic sewage; Improved anaerobic reactor design; Post-treatment; Resources recovery; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32344438309

The Aerosol Inorganics Model is used to estimate retained particle bound water, and an ammonium nitrate evaporation model is used to estimate nitrate concentrations retained on the Teflon-membrane filter of the FRM. To address large uncertainties in carbonaceous mass calculated from STN carbon measurements, retained carbonaceous mass is derived by material balance between PM2.5FRM mass and estimates of its non-carbon constituents. The resulting sulfate, adjusted nitrate, derived water, inferred carbonaceous material balance approach (SANDWICH) is compared with reconstructed fine mass (RCFM) using the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments monitoring program equation. For this study, the SANDWICH method resulted in ∼21–27% higher sulfate mass and ∼24–85% lower nitrate mass. The combined mass associated with sulfates and nitrates, however, are well within ±10% of the proportion derived using the more traditional RCFM method. The discrepancies between SANDWICH and measurement-derived carbonaceous mass vary from −21% to +56% on an annual basis and are attributed in part to urban–rural source influences and uncertainties in estimating FRM-retained carbonaceous mass. © 2006 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Aerosols; Ammonium compounds; Carbon; Evaporation; Nitrates; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Rural areas; Sulfate minerals; Water; Aerosol Inorganics Model; Ammonium nitrate; Carbonaceous mass; Fine particulate matter; Hydrated sulfates; Inferred carbonaceous material balance approach; Speciation Trends Network; Teflon-membrane filter; Particles (particulate matter); ammonium nitrate; carbon; nitrate; politef; sulfate; water; aerosol; chemical composition; conference paper; environmental monitoring; evaporation; gravimetry; hydration; membrane filter; particulate matter; priority journal; rural area; thermodynamics; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646236546

A refined approach to define anthropogenic CO2 is introduced that has a stronger thermodynamic orientation than current methods, and is based on a back-calculation technique by Chen and Millero and Poisson and Chen. Anthropogenic CO2 results of the new technique are compared with results from the original technique as well as with results of the technique of Gruber et al. The new technique is furthermore applied to three time-separated data sets in the subpolar North Atlantic and shows consistent results with regard to available data quality and anthropogenic CO2 quantities. The difference between the new thermodynamic approach and the anthropogenic CO2 definition of Gruber et al., which is termed mechanistic, is discussed. Here likely changes in the CO2 solubility pump are a thermodynamic property of this definition, whereas it is a separate phenomenon in the mechanistic definition. The thermodynamic approach is not without caveats, but points to improvements by the synergistic use of model results and those from observations. Future improvements are considered for the initial saturation state of oxygen and CO2, at the instant the surface water loses contact with the atmosphere and for variations in the Redfield ratio.

Using the EPA 1999 National Emission Inventory as a reference emission data set, NOx and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission rates at selected power plants are updated to their summer 2003 levels using Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) measurements. The validity of the CEMS data is established by comparison to observations made on the NOAA WP-3 aircraft as part of the 2004 New England Air Quality Study. The impacts of power plant NOx emission decreases on O3 are investigated using the WRF-Chem regional chemical forecast model. Summertime NOx emission rates decreased by approximately 50% between 1999 and 2003 at the subset of power plants studied. The impact of NOx emission reductions on ozone was moderate during summer 2004 because of relatively cool temperatures and frequent synoptic disturbances. Effects in individual plant plumes vary depending on the plant's NOx emission strength, the proximity of other NOx sources, and the availability of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sunlight. This study provides insight into the ozone changes that can be anticipated as power plant NOx emission reductions continue to be implemented throughout the United States.

The formulation of emission control strategies requires considerable information including: (1) emission inventories, (2) available control technologies, (3) meteorological data for critical design episodes, and (4) computer models that simulate atmospheric transport and chemistry. The simultaneous consideration of this information during control strategy design can be exceedingly difficult for a decision-maker. Traditional management approaches do not explicitly address cost minimization. This study presents a new approach for designing air quality management strategies; a simple air quality model is used conjunctively with a complex air quality model to obtain low-cost management strategies. A simple air quality model is used to identify potentially good solutions, and two heuristic methods are used to identify cost-effective control strategies using only a small number of simple air quality model simulations. Subsequently, the resulting strategies are verified and refined using a complex air quality model. The use of this approach may greatly reduce the number of complex air quality model runs that are required. An important component of this heuristic design framework is the use of the simple air quality model as a screening and exploratory tool. To achieve similar results with the simple and complex air quality models, it may be necessary to “tweak” or calibrate the simple model. A genetic algorithm-based optimization procedure is used to automate this tweaking process. These methods are demonstrated to be computationally practical using two realistic case studies, which are based on data from a metropolitan region in the United States. © 2006 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Air quality; Computation theory; Cost effectiveness; Heuristic methods; Mathematical models; Optimization; Pollution control; Atmospheric transport; Emission inventories; Tropospheric ozone; Tweaking process; Ozone; air quality control; article; calibration; cost effectiveness analysis; genetic algorithm; meteorology; ozone layer; priority journal; screening test; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745469345

Over the past decade, efforts to assess vulnerability to climate change triggered a process of theory development and assessment practice, which is reflected in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This paper reviews the historical development of the conceptual ideas underpinning assessments of vulnerability to climate change. We distinguish climate impact assessment, first- and second-generation vulnerability assessment, and adaptation policy assessment. The different generations of assessments are described by means of a conceptual framework that defines key concepts of the assessment and their analytical relationships. The purpose of this conceptual framework is two-fold: first, to present a consistent visual glossary of the main concepts underlying the IPCC approach to vulnerability and its assessment; second, to show the evolution of vulnerability assessments. This evolution is characterized by the progressive inclusion of non-climatic determinants of vulnerability to climate change, including adaptive capacity, and the shift from estimating expected damages to attempting to reduce them. We hope that this paper improves the understanding of the main approaches to climate change vulnerability assessment and their evolution, not only within the climate change community but also among researchers from other scientific communities, who are sometimes puzzled by the unfamiliar use of technical terms in the context of climate change. © Springer 2006.",,"Estimation; Public policy; Adaptation policy assessment; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); Climate change; climate change; climate effect; conceptual framework; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; policy development; vulnerability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744454699

This paper presents the development and test of a N2O model resulting from the linkage of a dynamic soil-crop simulation model (CERES) with two sub-models of N2O production and reduction in soils. These sub-models (NOE and NGAS) account for both the nitrification and denitrification pathways. The resulting models (CERES-NOE and CERES-NGAS) were tested against experimental data collected on three contrasting wheat-cropped soils representative of the Beauce agricultural region in France. Although the input variables for the N2O modules were correctly simulated, CERES-NGAS was over-responsive to soil water content in a Haplic Calcisol, and strongly over-estimated the N2O fluxes as a result. On the other hand, CERES-NOE predicted correct mean N2O emission levels for all sites, but failed to simulate the peak fluxes observed in the weeks following fertilizer application in the most N2O- productive soil. Both models achieved root mean squared errors in the 23-26 g N-N2O ha-1 day-1 range, significantly higher than the average experimental error on the measurements. On the other hand, their mean deviations were acceptable, being lower than 2.2 g N-N2O ha-1 day-1, compared with a mean observed flux of 7.9 g N-N2O ha-1 day-1. Overall, the response of CERES-NOE to soil type was more accurate, but this came at the cost of costly, site-specific characterization on the soils' biological properties. The development of pedo-transfer functions to infer these parameters from basic soil characteristics appears as a pre-requisite for the use of CERES-NOE on a wider scale. © Springer 2006.","CERES; Fertilization; Greenhouse gases; Modelling; Nitrous oxide","emission; fertilizer application; global warming; model; nitrous oxide; soil chemistry; soil water; wheat; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe; Ceres; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745597880

The phase structure of the NiCoB based alloy was determined by Rietveld analysis. The PEMFC environment was constituted of 0.5 M H2SO4 at 60 °C and the evaluation techniques employed included potentiodynamic polarization, linear polarization resistance, open circuit potential measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that in all cases the corrosion resistance of the Ni-Co-B coating was higher than that of the uncoated alloys; about two orders of magnitude with respect to carbon steel and an order of magnitude compared to 304 stainless steel. Except for the uncoated 304 type stainless steel, the polarization curves for the coated specimens did not exhibit a passive region but only anodic dissolution. The corrosion potential value, Ecorr, was always nobler for the coated samples than for the uncoated specimens. This was true for the stainless steel in the passive region, but in the active state for the carbon steel and Al 6061 alloy.

Events like the energetic crisis of 1973, the continuous geopolitic clashes in energetic resource-rich areas, and the global environmental deterioration as a consequence of the industrial activity taking place in last century, make obvious the need of searching new sources of energy [1]. One of these sources is the obtainment of energy from biomass exploitation. The use of this raw material involves advantages in the emission of low quantities of contaminants to the atmosphere and its renewable character. Until now, the main drawback of this source is its lack of viability when trying to obtain electric power from biomass, due to the use of systems composed of a boiler and a steam turbine (which offer low operative flexibility), which are not rentable in such a competitive market as it is, currently, the energetic one. Nowadays, the use of internal combustion engines, combined with biomass gasifiers, allows rapid connection-disconnection of the plant (aproximately of five minutes), which confers a big flexibility to the system and, as a consequence, a better exploitation of the plant in maximum energetic consumption hours. It also has the advantage of establishing a co-generation system since the gases are generated at a high temperature, 800 °C [2]. With this view, the aim of this work has focused in the re-design of a gasification plant for the production of activated carbons, from biomassic residues, for the energetic exploitation of the combustible gases produced during the pyrolytic process (H2, CO, CH4, C 2H2, C2H4, C2H 6), since these gases are currently burnt in a torch in the plant. The idea of designing the activated carbon production plant arose from the need of managing the biomass residues (olive wastes) generated by the firm Euroliva-Azeites e Oleos Alimentares SA, located in Alto Alentejo, in the city of de Vale do Peso, Concelho de Crato. This firm collects the residues produced in the olive oil mill of Concelho do Crato and then, in the plant, makes the last obtainment of less-quality olive oil, which gives rise to a high production of olive waste. The production of this residue is 250 tons/day, which involves an annual production of 87,500 tons of residues that have to be removed [3]. The activated carbon production plant, already built, has a processing capacity of 250 kg h- 1 of residual biomass, with a yield close to 16% in carbon production. According to the plant capacity and the generated gases potential, a thermal power of 1.05 MW and, considering a process global output of 25%, an electric power of 250 kW would be obtained. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This is done by using an up-to-date stellar evolutionary code coupled with a state-of-the-art pulsational code. The emission of gravitational waves is computed for a standard 0.6 M⊙ white dwarf with a liquid carbon-oxygen core and a hydrogen-rich envelope, for a massive DA white dwarf with a partially crystallized core for which various ℓ l = 2 modes have been observed (BPM 37093) and for PG 1159-035, the prototype of the GW Vir class of variable stars, for which several quadrupole modes have been observed as well. We find that these stars do not radiate sizeable amounts of gravitational waves through their observed pulsation g-modes, in line with previous studies. We also explore the possibility of detecting gravitational waves radiated by the f-mode and the p-modes. We find that in this case the gravitational wave signal is very large and, hence, the modes decay very rapidly.

Three of these runs also simulate the uptake of chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) into the ocean using the protocol from the Ocean Carbon Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP). Comparison with ocean observations taken between 1980 and 2000 shows that the global CFC-11 uptake is simulated very well. However, there are regional biases, and these are used to identify where too much deep-water formation is occurring in the CCSM3. The differences between the three runs simulating CFC-11 uptake are also briefly documented. The variability in ocean heat content in the 1870 control runs is shown to be only a little smaller than estimates using ocean observations. The ocean heat uptake between 1957 and 1996 in the ensemble is compared to the recent observational estimates of the secular trend. The trend in ocean heat uptake is considerably larger than the natural variability in the 1870 control runs. The heat uptake down to 300 m between 1957 and 1996 varies by a factor of 2 across the ensemble. Some possible reasons for this large spread are discussed. There is much less spread in the heat uptake down to 3 km. On average, the CCSM3 twentieth-century ensemble runs take up 25% more heat than the recent estimate from ocean observations. Possible explanations for this are that the model heat uptake is calculated over the whole ocean, and not just in the regions where there are many observations and that there is no parameterization of the indirect effects of aerosols in CCSM3. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric aerosols; Chlorofluorocarbons; Climate change; Composition effects; Heat transfer; Oceanography; Community Climate System Model; Heat uptake; Ocean Carbon Model Intercomparison Project; Climatology; CFC; climate modeling; computer simulation; parameterization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745068066

Only two of the species examined emitted isoprene at rates of 10 μg C g-1 h-1or greater. These species accounted for &lt;10% of the estimated vegetative biomass in these arid regions of low biomass density, indicating that these ecosystems are not likely a strong source of isoprene. However, isoprene emissions from these species continued to increase at much higher leaf temperatures than is observed from species in other ecosystems. Five species, including members of the Ambrosia genus, emitted monoterpenes at rates exceeding 2 μg C g-1 h-1. Emissions of oxygenated compounds, such as methanol, ethanol, acetone/propanal, and hexanol, from cut branches of several species exceeded 10 μg C g -1 h-1, warranting further investigation in these ecosystems. Model extrapolation of isoprene emission measurements verifies recently published observations that desert vegetation is a small source of isoprene relative to forests. Annual and daily total model isoprene emission estimates from an eastern US mixed forest landscape were 10-30 times greater than isoprene emissions estimated from the Mojave site. Monoterpene (and possibly oxygenated terpene and sesquiterpene) emissions may be more comparable, as annual forest terpene emission model estimates were 3-8 times greater than those from the Mojave Desert, and were within a factor of 2 for peak summertime fluxes. Primary productivity and leaf biomass of desert ecosystems are very dependent on annual precipitation, and our model results indicate that there can be at least a three-fold difference in total annual BVOC emissions between dry and wet years. We recommend additional studies of desert plant BVOC emissions, especially those that focus on sesquiterpenes, oxygenated compounds, and the effects of soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and seasonality. Landscape flux studies are needed to test BVOC model estimates and to verify BVOC influences on regional atmospheric chemistry.","Ambrosia deltoidea; Ambrosia dumosa; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Emission factor; Ephedra nevadensis; Isoprene; Larrea tridentata; Leaf temperature; Monoterpene; Photosynthetically active radiation","Air pollution; Biomass; Ecosystems; Industrial emissions; Methane; Organic compounds; Oxygenators; Ambrosia deltoidea; Ambrosia dumosa; Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVO); Emission factors; Ephedra nevadensis; Isoprene; Larrea tridentata; Leaf temperature; Monoterpene; Photosynthetically active radiation; Vegetation; acetone; alcohol; hexanol; isoprene; methane; methanol; propionaldehyde; sesquiterpene; terpene; volatile organic compound; biogenic emission; isoprene; monoterpene; volatile organic compound; article; biomass; desert; ecosystem; nonhuman; oxygenation; plant; plant leaf; priority journal; ragweed; summer; temperature; United States; vegetation; North America; United States; Ambrosia; Ambrosia deltoidea; Ambrosia dumosa; Ephedra nevadensis; Larrea tridentata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32044469672

Carbonaceous particles emitted by combustion processes are the main factors responsible for the blackening of buildings. The identification and evaluation of the carbon species constituting the noncarbonate fraction of total carbon in damage layers, particularly in urban areas, are required in order to investigate atmospheric deposition on building surfaces. Since noncarbonate carbon contains organic and elemental carbon originating from various human activities, its measurement and speciation are crucial to the protection and conservation of monuments and ancient masonry, playing an important role both in the proposal of mitigation strategies and in the definition of conservation treatments. The availability of a correct, accurate, and reproducible analytical method for a complete carbon balance is essential in studying the effects of atmospheric pollutants on the environment, including those affecting cultural heritage. A chemical-thermal methodology was set up, and its sensitivity, accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility were tested on appropriate standard samples of composition similar to the black crusts on stones and mortars. The results indicate that the technique satisfactorily distinguishes among carbon species, particularly those of anthropogenic origin, allowing a reliable evaluation of their quantities in damage layers.

The Apeldoorn Workshop (April 15th, 2004, Apeldoorn, NL) brought together specialists in LCA and Risk Assessment to discuss current practices and complications of the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) ecological toxicity (ecotox) methodologies for metals. The consensus was that the LCIA methods currently available do not appropriately characterize impacts of metals due to lack of fundamental metals chemistry in the models. A review of five methods available to perform ecotox impact assessment for metals has been prepared to provide Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) practitioners with a better understanding of the current state of the science and potential biases related to metals. The intent is to provide awareness on issues related to ecotox impact assessment. Methods. In this paper two case studies, one a copper based product (copper tube), the other a zinc-based product (gutter systems), were selected and examined by applying freshwater ecological toxicity impact models - USES-LCA, Eco-indicator 99 (EI 99), IMPACT 2002, EDIP 97, and CalTOX-ETP. Both studies are recent, comprehensive, cradle-to-gate, and peer-reviewed. The objective is to review the LCIA results in the context of the practical concerns identified by the Apeldoorn Declaration, in particular illustrating any inconsistencies such as chemical characterization coverage, species specificity, and relative contribution to impact results. Results and Discussion. The results obtained from all five of the LCIA methods for the copper tube LCI pointed to the same substance as being the most important - copper. This result was obtained despite major fundamental differences between the LCIA methods applied. However, variations of results were found when examining the freshwater ecological toxicity potential of zinc gutter systems. Procedural difficulties and inconsistencies were observed. In part this was due to basic differences in model nomenclature and differences in coverage (IMPACT 2002+ and EDIP 97 contained characterization factors for aluminium that resulted in 90% and 22% contribution to burden respectively, the other three methods did not). Differences were also observed relative to the emissions source compartment. In the case of zinc, air emissions were found to be substantial for some ecotox models, whereas, water emissions results were found to be of issue for others. Conclusions. This investigation illustrates the need to proceed with caution when applying LCIA ecotox methodologies to life cycle studies that include metals. Until further improvements are made, the deficiencies should be clearly communicated as part of LCIA reporting. Business or policy decisions should not without further discussion be based solely on the results of the currently available methods for assessing ecotoxicity in LCIA. Outlook. The outlook to remedy deficiencies in the ecological toxicity methods is promising. Recently, the LCIA Toxic Impacts Task Force of the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative has formed a subgroup to address specific issues and guide the work towards establishment of sound characterization factors for metals. Although some measure of precision of estimation of potential impact has been observed, such as in the case of copper, accuracy is also a major concern and should be addressed. Further investigation through controlled experimentation is needed, particularly LCIs composed of a variety of inorganics as well as organics constituents. Support for this activity has come from the scientific community and industry as well. Broader aspects of structure and nomenclature are being collectively addressed by the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative. These efforts will bring practical solutions to issues of naming conventions and LCI to LCIA flow assignments. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH.","Apeldoorn Declaration; Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); Life cycle management (LCM); Metals; Toxicity methods","aluminum; copper; metal; zinc; accuracy; conference paper; decision making; ecotoxicity; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; life cycle assessment; priority journal; risk assessment; species difference; water pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144449587

This paper summarizes the new physical features of the models and examines the simulations that they produce. Of the two new coupled climate model versions 2.1 (CM2.1) and 2.0 (CM2.0), the CM2.1 model represents a major improvement over CM2.0 in most of the major oceanic features examined, with strikingly lower drifts in hydrographic fields such as temperature and salinity, more realistic ventilation of the deep ocean, and currents that are closer to their observed values. Regional analysis of the differences between the models highlights the importance of wind stress in determining the circulation, particularly in the Southern Ocean. At present, major errors in both models are associated with Northern Hemisphere Mode Waters and outflows from overflows, particularly the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Oceanography; Climate models; Hydrographic fields; Ocean simulation; Climatology; climate change; climate modeling; global climate; laboratory method; oceanic circulation; oceanic current; simulation; wind stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645815473

One of the designed SMCs performs engine speed control, while the other controls the engine/generator torque, together achieving the engine operation in the optimal efficiency region of the torque-speed curve. The control strategy is designed for application on a SHEV converted from a standard high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV) and simulated by using the Matlab-based PNGV Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). The performance of the control strategy is compared with that of the original PSAT model, which utilizes PI controllers, a feedforward term for the engine torque, and comprehensive maps for the engine, generator and power converter (static only), which constitute the auxiliary power unit (APU). In this study, in spite of the simple modeling approach taken to model the APU and the optimal efficiency region, an improved performance has been achieved with the new SMC based strategy in terms of overall efficiency, engine efficiency, fuel economy, and emissions.

The reduction kinetics are found to be influenced by dissolved carbonate/bicarbonate ions. The formation of hydrated UVI species on the electrode surface is avoided in carbonate solutions, allowing H2O2 reduction to proceed at less cathodic potentials than in carbonate-free solutions. At more cathodic potentials, the adsorption of carbonate ions on the active reduction sites inhibits the H2O 2 reduction reaction. Over a narrow potential region, the reduction of peroxide is catalyzed by coadsoption of H2O2 and HCO3-/CO32-. The pH dependence of the H2O2 reduction reaction appears to be stronger in carbonate solutions than in solutions that do not contain carbonate. This can be attributed to the displacement of inhibiting CO32-/ HCO3- adsorbed ions by OH-. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The 30 yr mean relationships between indicators of extremes (IoEs) and annual mean daily maximum temperature (Txa) are investigated. Such relationships from the UK Met Office Hadley Centre RCM HadRM3P, along with temperatures from the global climate model HadCM3, are used to scale IoEs to other time periods and scenarios. This is tested for selected indicators of heat-wave and drought over Europe for the period 1961-2099. Curvature is demonstrated in the relationships between these quantities and Txa. Such non-linearities are shown to have a large potential effect on how these climate extremes are likely to evolve during the century, as well as their sensitivity to emissions. A broad picture of possible changes in European heat-wave and drought severity is presented. For drought over the Mediterranean and western Europe, a very clear positive curvature in the relationship between drought length and annually averaged temperature is found. (This feature is also common in a brief study of 6 other RCMs.) It suggests a rapid increase in drought length towards the end of the century, and a strong sensitivity to the emission scenario. Extended summer dry spells are projected to become a much more regular feature of western European climates. For European heat-waves, we find a slightly earlier onset of increases in heat-wave severity and a reduced sensitivity to emission scenarios than might be expected from a more straightforward interpretation of the Hadley Centre model results. This is linked with extreme dryness occurring at high summer in all years by the end of the century, but was not evident in the 6 other RCMs studied. Based on these results, suggestions are made for choices of future RCM experiments. © Inter-Research 2006.","Drought; Heatwave; Impacts; Pattern scaling; Precipitation; Warming","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Drought; Environmental impact; Precipitation (meteorology); climate modeling; drought; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746418370

The CuZ cluster provides an exogenous ligand-binding site, and, in its fully reduced 4Cu I state, the cluster turns off binding of stronger donor ligands while enabling the formation of the CuZ-N2O complex through enhanced CuZ-N2O back-donation. The two copper atoms (CuI and CuIV) at the ligand-binding site of the cluster play a crucial role in the enzymatic function, as these atoms are directly involved in bridged N2O binding, bending the ligand to a configuration that resembles the transition state (TS) and contributing the two electrons for N2O reduction. The other atoms of the CuZ cluster are required for extensive back-bonding with minimal σ ligand-to-metal donation for the N2O activation. The low reaction barrier (18 kcal mol-1) of the direct cleavage of the N-O bond in the CuZ-N2O complex is due to the stabilization of the TS by a strong CuIV2+-O- bond. Due to the charge transfer from the CuZ cluster to the N2O ligand, noncovalent interactions with the protein environment stabilize the polar TS and reduce the activation energy to an extent dependent on the strength of proton donor. After the N-O bond cleavage, the catalytic cycle consists of a sequence of alternating protonation/one-electron reduction steps which return the Cu Z cluster to the fully reduced (4CuI) state for future turnover. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation energy; Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Nitrogen compounds; Potential energy; Reaction kinetics; Thermodynamics; Density functional theory; Metal donation; Reaction thermodynamics; Sulfide-bridged tetranuclear Cu; Reduction; copper; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; copper; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; oxidoreductase; zinc; article; binding site; biodegradation; catalysis; cluster analysis; covalent bond; denitrification; density functional theory; dimerization; enzyme mechanism; ligand binding; molecular interaction; protein stability; reaction analysis; thermodynamics; chemical structure; chemistry; gas; hydrogen bond; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Binding Sites; Catalysis; Copper; Gases; Hydrogen Bonding; Models, Molecular; Nitrous Oxide; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Thermodynamics; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30744454598

This interest is driven partly by the recent adoption in Canada of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) Green Building Rating System and partly by a greater general awareness of environmental issues. Designers are beginning to look at how to incorporate reused steel components into construction projects, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions by saving on primary steel production. However, although some designers are willing to redesign their projects to make use of available reclaimed structural steel components, it is often difficult to identify suitable materials in the local area at the appropriate time in the life of a project. A limiting factor is that designers, construction companies, and others perceive a lack of a well-established and easily available mechanism for exchange of reclaimed components. This paper reviews the issues that are relevant to increasing recycling and reuse in construction and focuses on examples that illustrate the benefits that steel can bring to sustainable construction. In particular, it discusses the issues relevant to designing to enable future disassembly and the way in which steel components can be readily reused. © 2006 NRC Canada.","Design for deconstruction; Reclaimed steel; Reuse of materials; Steel recycling; Sustainable construction","Buildings; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Steel structures; Design for deconstruction; Reclaimed steel; Reuse of materials; Steel recycling; Sustainable construction; Steel construction; Buildings; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Steel construction; Steel structures; building; design; recycling; steel structure; Canada; North America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747075736

The energies of an excited triplet state for the ligands are 20704 cm-1 (L) and 20408 cm-1 (L′), respectively. The fact that the ligands strongly sensitized Eu3+ and the order of the emission intensity for the Eu3+ complexes were explained by the relative energy gap between the lowest triplet energy level of the ligands (T) and 5D of Eu3+ or Tb3+.

The enzymes between the two species of Tephritidae have a very high homology and further examination of the variable positions with respect to the highly conserved binding site residues enabled their grouping in three distinct categories, with possible association to dimer formation, functional specificity, and antigenicity.

Crown volume is the most significant (p &lt; 0.01) variable explaining variation of air temperature below the tree crown. Q. pubescens gives a higher contribution to decreasing air temperature during the hottest months, due to its inherent larger crown volume than Q. ilex (252 ± 19 and 533 ± 52 m3, respectively for the large size). Moreover, our results show the existence of a strong urban carbon dioxide dome with a peak CO2 concentration (on an average 432 ± 37 ppm) at polluted sites, 16% greater than at control sites.

The contribution of CO2 reduction was calculated from the linear relationship between ratios of labelled and total CH4 production and ratios of labelled and total CO2 after the addition of 13C-bicarbonate. In the case of acetoclastic methanogenesis rates of 13CH4 and 12CH 4 production were fitted to a model based on an assumption that the relationship between the concentration of 13C-labelled acetate and the rates of labelled and unlabelled methane production followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A comparison of the raw data with the model supported the assumption and provided both an estimate of the contribution of acetate to methane production and an estimate of the size of the indigenous acetate pool without the need to measure acetate directly. The method was applied to a freshwater sediment in the English Lake District where it was found that 66.3% (se 4.9) of methane production was due to acetate disproportionation and 28.9% (se 1.9) of methane production resulted from CO2 reduction.

Location: We simulated the vegetation biogeography and dynamics on five of the main islands of the Mediterranean Basin: Mallorca, Corsica, Sardinia, Crete and Lesvos. Methods: We used LPJ-GUESS, a generalized ecosystem model based on dynamic processes describing establishment, competition, mortality and ecosystem biogeochemistry. We simulated the vegetation distribution and dynamics using a set of plant functional types (PFTs) based on bioclimatic and physiological parameters, which included tree and shrub PFTs defined especially for the Mediterranean. Additionally, two invasive PFTs, an invasive tree type and an invasive herb type, were defined and used to estimate the vulnerability to invasion of a range of different ecosystems. The model was used to simulate climate changes and associated changes in atmospheric [CO 2] to 2050 according to two Specialq1Report on Emissions Scenarios climate scenarios (A1Fi and B1) combined with mean disturbance intervals of 3 and 40 years. Results: The simulations and scenarios showed that the effect of climate change alone is likely to be negligible in many of the simulated ecosystems, although not all. The simulated progression of an invasion was highly dependent on the initial ecosystem composition and local environmental conditions, with a particular contrast between drier and wetter parts of the Mediterranean, and between mountain and coastal areas. The rate of ecosystem disturbance was the main factor controlling susceptibility to invasion, strongly influencing vegetation development on the shorter time scale. Main conclusions: Further invasion into Mediterranean island ecosystems is likely to be an increasing problem: our simulations predict that, in the longer term, almost all the ecosystems will be dominated by exotic plants irrespective of disturbance rates. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Disturbance; Ecosystem vulnerability; LPJ-GUESS; Mediterranean; Plant functional types; Plant invasion; Vegetation modelling","biological invasion; climate change; ecosystem resilience; functional response; vegetation dynamics; Balearic Islands; Corse; Crete; Eurasia; Europe; France; Greece; Italy; Lesbos; Majorca; Mediterranean Sea; Northern Aegean; Sardinia; Southern Europe; Spain; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644976899

Overlying Cenomanian strata have δ13C values of -24‰, to -23‰, that are similar to pre-excursion values. The absence of an intervening positive excursion (as exists in marine records of the Albian-Cenomanian boundary) likely results from a depositional hiatus. The corresponding positive δ13C event and proposed depositional hiatus are concordant with a regionally identified sequence boundary in the Dakota Formation (D2), as well as a major regressive phase throughout the globe at the Albian-Cenomanian boundary. Data from RCP confirm suggestions that some positive carbon-isotope excursions in the geologic record are coincident with regressive sea-level phases. We estimate using isotopic correlation that the D2 sequence boundary at RCP was on the order of 0.5 m.y. in duration. Therefore, interpretations of isotopic events and associated environmental phenomena, such as oceanic anoxic events, in the shallow-marine and terrestrial record may be influenced by stratigraphic incompleteness.

Remarkable Ph-X activation (X = I, Cl) by [(dppe)Pd(Ph)(CF3)] (1) has been found to come about to cleanly produce biphenyl and [(dppe)Pd(Ph)(X)]. This reaction does not take place under rigorously anhydrous conditions but in the presence of traces of water it readily occurs, exhibiting an induction period and being zero order in PhI. As shown by mechanistic studies, the role of water is to promote reduction of small quantities of the Pd(II) complex to Pd(0) which activates the Ph-X bond. Subsequent transmetalation to give diphenyl Pd complexes, followed by Ph-Ph reductive elimination give rise to the observed products. The water-induced reduction to catalytically active Pd(0) has been demonstrated to proceed via both the Pd(II)/P(III) to Pd(0)/P(V) redox mechanism and α-F transfer, followed by facile hydrolysis of the difluorocarbene to carbonyl, migratory insertion, and reductive elimination of PhC(X)O (X = F, OH, or OOCPh). In the absence of H2O and ArX, the diphosphine-stabilized trifluoromethyl Pd phenyl complexes undergo slow Ph-CF3 reductive elimination under reinforcing conditions (xylenes, 145 °C). © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation analysis; Complexation; Redox reactions; Synthesis (chemical); Water; Migratory insertion; Phenyl complexes; Redox mechanism; Reinforcing conditions; Palladium compounds; palladium; trifluoromethylpalladium; unclassified drug; water; article; catalysis; complex formation; hydrolysis; oxidation reduction reaction; reduction; solid state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646044397

We convert a species-based land-cover database for Texas into a database compatible with the community land model (CLM) and a database compatible with the Noah land-surface model (LSM). We link the LSM-compatible land-cover databases to the original species-based data set as a means to derive region-specific BVOC emission capacities for each plant functional type (in the CLM database) and for each land-cover type (in the Noah database). The spatial distribution of inherent BVOC flux (defined as the product of the BVOC emission capacity and the leaf biomass density) derived using the Texas-specific BVOC emission capacities is well correlated with the spatial distribution of inherent BVOC flux calculated using the original species data (r=0.89). The mean absolute error for the emission-capacity-derived inherent flux distribution is an order of magnitude lower than the statewide range of inherent fluxes. The ground-referenced land-cover databases derived here are likely more accurate than their satellite-derived counterparts; they can be used for a variety of regional model simulations in Texas. The inherent BVOC flux distributions derived using region-specific BVOC emission capacities are more consistent with observations than the BVOC flux distribution derived using the CLM3 standard BVOC emission capacities, which are top-down estimates based on the literature. When used in conjunction with detailed land-cover data sets, region-specific BVOC emission capacities produce reasonably accurate inherent BVOC fluxes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This has aroused the interest of operators, regulators and legislators in natural gas-fired distributed generation (gas-fired DG), namely, the integrated or stand-alone use of small, modular gas-fired power generation close to the point of consumption as an alternative to large power generation and electricity transport over long distances. Gas-fired DG can provide an important benefit from the environmental point of view. Customer proximity, in fact, greatly increases the potential for combined heat and power generation, involving energy saving and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Unfortunately this kind of decentralized supply also determines higher non-GHG emissions (mainly NOx, compared to the best available central power technology) which occur in urban areas (high populated) instead of extra-urban areas (where large power plants are generally located). It is therefore difficult to make a reliable evaluation of gas-fired DG environmental benefits without comparing centralized and decentralized models in terms of external costs, that is without an analysis which allows us to compare the extent of global and local-regional impacts in terms of monetary damage. If, on the one hand, this underlines the (potential) importance of the methods adopted to assess the economic value of environmental externalities (even for policy decisions that are binary, i.e. the choice between different energy technologies), on the other, it raises the crucial question of the uncertainty about the economic estimates. This article aims at demonstrating that the uncertainty about external costs, even if large, does not undermine the possibility of verifying whether gas-fired DG is preferable (or not) to centralized supply. The paper compares centralized and decentralized models in terms of the external environmental costs which are calculated by using the results of the available studies in this field (in particular the results of the dissemination process of the so-called ExternE project, one of the most recent and accurate methodologies, and the results of a meta-analysis, with regard to the marginal cost of GHG emissions). The uncertainty about external costs is substantial but not so large that it is not possible to say anything about the environmental raking of alternative technology solutions involving trade-off between the impacts of different pollutants (or between different kinds of impacts). The literature on external costs provides several studies accounting for a large part of uncertainty by means of appropriate statistical and sensitive analysis. By using and elaborating these results, the analysis described in this paper seems to support the conclusion that centralized supply, and especially the completely electric solution (based on the reversible electric heat pump), is still preferable to natural gas-fired CHP distributed generation. This is not a definitive conclusion but, we hope, a useful (scientific based) contribution for policy decisions under the state of the art. In fact, this result has an interesting policy implication. It suggests unless questioning the current enthusiasm on natural gas-fired CHP distributed generation deployment (e.g. the European Commission is indeed advocating DG as a contribution to GHG emission reduction) and helps us to reflect upon gas-fired DG supporting environmental policies which focus on the reduction of GHG emissions and totally disregard the possible trade-off between the impacts of global and local-regional pollutants. Unless one denies the rationality attributed to making tradeoffs, on the basis of ethical limits of economic valuations. Even in this case, however, cost-benefit analysis seems to be legitimate and a necessary step of the public discourse. We think that the results of this paper are emblematic, from this point of view. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a comprehensive dataset of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) collected from August 2001 to December 2002 at a polluted rural/coastal site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) is analyzed to assess the relative contributions of major pollution sources to ambient NMVOC mixing ratios. A unique approach based on emission ratios of individual chemical species was used to classify the bulk air samples in order to apportion regional and local source contributions to the measured mixing ratios. The collected air samples fell into four major groups, including air masses from the inner PRD region and Hong Kong (HK) urban area. To estimate the source apportionment of NMVOCs, a principal component analysis/absolute principal component scores receptor model was applied to the classified data points. The results indicate that the regional and local source contributions to ambient NMVOC levels at the site were significantly different due to the differences in local versus regional energy use and industrial activities. For air masses originating from HK, vehicular emissions accounted for approximately 39% of the total NMVOC levels, followed by industrial emissions (35%), gasoline evaporation (14%) and commercial/domestic liquefied petroleum gas/natural gas use (12%). By contrast, for air masses originating from the PRD the industrial emissions accounted for 43% of the total NMVOC burden, followed by vehicular emissions (32%) and biomass burning (25%). In particular, the higher regional contribution of biomass burning found in this study as compared to existing emission inventories suggests that further efforts are necessary to refine the emission inventories of NMVOCs in the PRD region. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The structural and surface features and electrocatalytic properties of bimetallic PtRu/OCNF and PtRu/RCNF were extensively investigated. FT-IR spectra show that carboxyl groups exist on the surface of the OCNF, which greatly influence the morphology and crystallinity of the electrocatalysts. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction consistently show that PtRu/RCNF has a smaller particle size and more uniform distribution than PtRu/OCNF. However, both catalysts have very similar methanol oxidation peak current densities that are significantly lower than commercial catalyst based on current-voltage (CV) results. These two catalysts also give very similar single cell performance except for some difference in the resistance polarization region. The OCNF supported catalysts give better performance than commercial catalysts when current density is higher than 50 mA cm-2 in spite of low methanol oxidation peak current density.

Although this scheme is presently limited to the developed countries, it is anticipated that as and when developing countries commit themselves to some kind of upper emission limit, they too can participate in this process. There is also considerable pressure on developing countries to take on some form of measurable commitment as of the second budget period, which is expected to begin in 2012. For economists this is logical and necessary, since emissions trading is an efficient solution to the problem of climate change. Various formulae have been devised to facilitate allocations of initial emission entitlements or allowances that work in the interest of either the developed or the developing countries. The anticipated difficulties in reaching an amicable compromise were, however, seen as the reason that such a scheme would not work; nevertheless, through a clever negotiating strategy, emissions trading is one of the instruments in the climate change regime. But as someone who has grown up in a developing country, frequently visited developing countries, immersed herself in problems of developing countries, it is difficult for me to fathom that the international community does not realise that this instrument is doomed to failure since the majority of the countries of the world, including several of the East and Central European countries, just do not have the institutional wherewithal to cope with such a complex system with such high financial stakes. © Cambridge University Press 2004.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927059490

Such electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable products is an area of interest for the purpose of reducing green house gas emissions. In the reactions involved, CO2 acts as both a reactant and a buffer, consequently the estimation of local concentrations at the electrode surface is not trivial and a numerical approach is required. The necessary partial differential equations (PDEs) have been set-up and solved using MATLAB. The results show the local concentrations at the electrode surface to be significantly different from the bulk concentrations under typical reported experimental conditions. The importance of buffer strength and a careful quantification of the degree of mixing produced in the experimental apparatus is demonstrated. The model has also been used to re-examine previously published data, showing that the Tafel slopes in CO2 reduction are consistent with those reported for the simpler CO reduction system. Further, the effect of pulsed electroreduction was also modeled, showing that pulsing causes corresponding swings in local pH and CO2 concentrations. © Springer 2005.","Boundary layer; Carbon dioxide electroreduction; Carbonate buffer; CO 2 reduction; Electrode surface concentrations","Boundary layer flow; Concentration (process); Electrodeposition; Greenhouses; Mathematical models; Partial differential equations; Carbon dioxide electroreduction; Carbonate buffer; Electrode surface concentrations; Green house gas emissions; Electrochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30544440278

Compound 1 does not exhibit the ideal CS symmetry and its conformation is intermediate between the CS-synperiplanar eclipsed and CS-antiperiplanar arrangements of the ligands. Density functional theory studies indicate that the CS-synperiplanar eclipsed, CS-antiperiplanar, and intermediate conformations of 1 and Cp*Rh(2,4-dimethyl-η5- pentadienyl)+ (2) do not differ by more than a few tenths of 1 kcal/mol. The geometrical features of cation 2 are similar to those of 1, and in both complexes the pentadienyl ligands are not planar. The metal-carbon distances to the Cp* ligands in 1 and 2 are comparable, while the metal-carbon distances to the pentadienyl moiety are somewhat shorter in the Ru complex. A study of the conformational flexibility of the Cp* ligand in 5610 organometallic complexes showed that it usually shields the central metal by 36.2(10)%, provided the metal-centroid(Cp*) distances are normalized to 2.28 Å. The corresponding values in 1 and 2 are 37.2% and 37.4%, respectively. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

An innovative feature of this system is an Enforcement Branch authorized to apply punitive measures or ""consequences"" in the second commitment period to Annex I Parties that have been found to be in non-compliance in the first commitment period. However, even after the latest Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), COP-11, and the first COP serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, COP/MOP-1, it is not yet clear whether these consequences will be legally binding. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. First, we examine the legal nature of the punitive consequences embedded in the Marrakesh Accords. Second, we discuss potential motives for making these consequences legally binding. We point out that one such motive is that their implementation requires cooperation by the Party that is in non-compliance. In this regard, Kyoto 9s compliance system differs from other international compliance systems equipped with punitive consequences, such as those of the WTO and the UN. Finally, we consider whether making the punitive consequences legally binding is likely to make a difference. The conclusion, which should be of interest to both academic researchers and the policy community, is that the legal status of the consequences is likely to have only a modest effect on compliance levels. A country that deliberately fails to abide by other legally binding commitments under the Kyoto Protocol is also likely to resist the application of punitive consequences, regardless of whether these consequences are made legally binding or not.","Enforcement; Kyoto protocol; Legal bindingness; Marrakesh accords; Non-compliance; Punitive consequences","climate change; economics; impact; Kyoto Protocol; law enforcement; legislation; politics; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Africa; Marrakech [Marrakech (PRV)]; Marrakech [Morocco]; Morocco; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746256551

Tests were conducted (a) after dark, (b) in high-temperature and high-humidity environments, (c) during temperature inversions, (d) under various generator loads, and (e) at different houseboat trim angles. Two different designs of houseboat exhaust stacks were evaluated and compared with the side-exhaust configuration, which is standard on many houseboats. The two designs were flagpole and vertical stack. Both exhaust stacks performed dramatically better than the standard water level, side-exhaust configuration. The highest mean CO concentrations on the upper and lower decks of the houseboat with the vertical exhaust stack were 27 ppm and 17 ppm. The highest mean CO concentrations on the upper and lower decks of the houseboat with the modified flagpole stack were 5 ppm and 2 ppm. These findings are much lower than the 67 ppm and 341 ppm for the highest mean CO concentrations found on the upper and lower decks of houseboats having the usual side-exhausted configuration. The NIOSH evaluation also indicated that high-temperature and high-humidity levels, temperature inversions, generator loading, and houseboat trim angles had little effect on the exhaust stack performance. It also demonstrated the importance of proper design and installation of exhaust stacks to ensure that all exhaust gases are released through the stack. Based on the results of this work, NIOSH investigators continue to recommend that houseboat manufacturers, rental companies, and owners retrofit their gasoline-powered generators with exhaust stacks to reduce the hazard of CO poisoning and death to individuals on or near the houseboat.","Carbon monoxide; Engineering control; Exhaust stack; Houseboats; Poisoning; Side exhaust","carbon monoxide; article; carbon monoxide intoxication; control system; darkness; engineering; exhaust gas; humidity; occupational exposure; priority journal; ship; temperature; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Equipment Design; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (U.S.); Ships; United States; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646357003

Such patients often have postprandial reflux. The mechanism of postprandial reflux remains controversial. To further clarify this, we studied the effect of carbonated beverages on the resting parameters of the lower esophageal sphincter. Nine asymptomatic healthy volunteers underwent lower esophageal sphincter manometry using a slow motorized pull through technique after ingestion of tap water and carbonated beverages. Resting pressure, overall length, and abdominal length of the lower esophageal sphincter were measured. All carbonated beverages produced sustained (20 minutes) reduction of 30-50% in all three parameters of the lower esophageal sphincter. In 62%, the reduction was of sufficient magnitude to cause the lower esophageal sphincter to reach a level normally diagnostic of incompetence. Tap water caused no reduction in sphincter parameters. Carbonated beverages, but not tap water, reduce the strength of the lower esophageal sphincter.

EOFs, however, can be difficult to interpret. Rotated empirical orthogonal functions (REOFs) have been proposed as more physical entities with simpler patterns than EOFs. This study presents a new approach for finding climate patterns with simple structures that overcomes the problems encountered with rotation. The method achieves simplicity of the patterns by using the main properties of EOFs and REOFs simultaneously. Orthogonal patterns that maximise variance subject to a constraint that induces a form of simplicity are found. The simplified empirical orthogonal function (SEOF) patterns, being more 'local', are constrained to have zero loadings outside the main centre of action. The method is applied to winter Northern Hemisphere (NH) monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) reanalyses over the period 1948-2000. The 'simplified' leading patterns of variability are identified and compared to the leading patterns obtained from EOFs and REOFs.

Oxygenated biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol blended with diesel fuel are biodegradable, non-toxic, renewable alternatives to imported petroleum diesel, and their use not only creates new markets for domestic agricultural products, but also greatly reduces particulate emissions. Unfortunately, biodiesel has been shown to increase NO X missions upwards of 10% compared to petroleum diesel. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the performance and NO X emissions of selected biofuels and blends with petroleum-based diesel fuel in a turbocharged and intercooled diesel engine using a steady-state nonroad ISO 8-mode test schedule. Test fuels included traditional No. 2 diesel and four biofuels comprising 100% soy methyl ester biodiesel, 2% biodiesel, 10% ethanol-diesel fuel, and 5% ethanol in biodiesel Exhaust NO X missions were monitored with a Horiba NO X analyzer. Reductions in peak torque varying from less than 0.5% to about 10% were measured with the test fuels and were attributed mainly to reduced energy content. Biodiesel fuel showed a 12% increase in NO X emissions, while 2% biodiesel fuel increased emissions 2.3%. The ethanol-diesel fuel blend reduced NO X emissions by 2.7% and was highly sensitive to load, with increased temperature and NO X emissions at light load. Addition of only 5% ethanol to biodiesel suppressed NO X emissions, with only a 2.6% increase occurring. It was concluded that ethanol could act as an effective NO X emissions reducing additive. © 2006 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Blend; Diesel engine; Ethanol; NO X emissions; Performance","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Blends; NOX emissions; Biodegradation; Crude petroleum; Diesel fuels; Ethanol; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Diesel engines; air quality; biofuel; diesel; diesel engine; exhaust emission; nitrous oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748892237

In this comparative study five models were examined concerning quantification and impact assessment of environmental effects from land application of treated organic MSW: DST (Decision Support Tool, USA), IWM (Integrated Waste Management, UK), THE IFEU PROJECT (Germany), ORWARE (ORganic WAste REsearch, Sweden) and EASEWASTE (Environmental Assessment of Solid Waste Systems and Technologies, Denmark). DST and IWM are life cycle inventory (LCI) models, thus not performing actual impact assessment. The DST model includes only one water emission (biological oxygen demand) from compost leaching in the results and IWM considers only air emissions from avoided production of commercial fertilizers. THE IFEU PROJECT, ORWARE and EASEWASTE are life cycle assessment (LCA) models containing more detailed land application modules. A case study estimating the environmental impacts from land application of 1 ton of composted source sorted organic household waste was performed to compare the results from the different models and investigate the origin of any difference in type or magnitude of the results. The contributions from the LCI models were limited and did not depend on waste composition or local agricultural conditions. The three LCA models use the same overall approach for quantifying the impacts of the system. However, due to slightly different assumptions, quantification methods and environmental impact assessment, the obtained results varied clearly between the models. Furthermore, local conditions (e.g. soil type, farm type, climate and legal regulation) and waste composition strongly influenced the results of the environmental assessment.

MICE actively encouraged the promotion of dialogue between the research and stakeholder communities in order to ensure that the research activities undertaken within the project were useful to the wider user community, Five workshops were held during the final 18 months of the project. In addition to these, a workshop report and a non-technical stakeholder-focussed brochure were produced to ensure that results do not remain solely within the academic community. The present paper provides a brief overview of the aims and objectives of the MICE project and describes the 5 workshops, including the rationale behind the structure of the final pan-European workshop, and selected results produced by the MICE Consortium. The main outcomes of the final workshop were (1) that the next 10 to 20 yr are important to stakeholders, whilst projections for the 2080s have limited relevance for decision-makers (2) the reliability of climate models needs to be increased and uncertainties decreased; (3) scientific results should be made accessible to the non-specialist, and stakeholders should be involved in relevant projects, preferably from the design stage; (4) there is the need to recognise and work to bridge the gap between what scientists can realistically achieve and what stakeholders require. © Inter-Research 2006.","Climate extremes; Dissemination activities; Impacts; MICE; Stakeholders","Climate change; Climatology; Computer simulation; Economics; Engineering research; Reliability theory; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; stakeholder",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746467418

These independent fingerprinting techniques provided good agreement on the nature and quantity of carbon deposited as a function of steam-reforming history. It is shown that the surface area and bulk phase characteristics were not irreversibly damaged by carbon deposition. However, TOC, XRD and TGA weight analyses showed a higher carbon content at lower S:C ratio and temperature. The weight derivative profiles for TPO and TPR suggest two types of carbon phases - atomic Cα and naphthalenic Cβ. The deactivation-causing Cβ was observed in the TEM micrographs as thick layers of filamentous carbon. This was corroborated by the crystalline carbon peak recorded in the XRD pattern. The study further showed that regeneration via reductive-oxidative carbon removal was more efficient than an oxidative-reductive route since the former produced a regenerated Co-Ni catalyst without substantial loss in surface properties (e.g., BET area, percent metal dispersion and active particle size). Carbon removal kinetics was attended by a relatively low activation energy (54-58kJmol-1) symptomatic of primary carbon deposition on metal sites. Solid-state rate data for the oxidative regeneration were adequately fitted by an Avrami-Erofeev reaction-order model. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis is demonstrated on ambuic acid powder, a widely occurring natural product, to provide the complete crystal structure. The NMR data verify phase purity, specify one molecule per asymmetric unit, and provide an initial structural model including relative stereochemistry and molecular conformation. A refinement of X-ray data from the initial model establishes that ambuic acid crystallizes in the P21 space group with unit cell parameters a = 15.5047(7), b = 4.3904(2), and c = 14.1933(4) Å and β = 110.3134(3)°.

Physical and chemical parameters were measured on primary and secondary lagoons on three different swine farming systems, three replicates each, in the Central Great Basin of the United States to determine ammonia (NH3) emissions. Nutrient concentrations, lagoon water temperature, and micrometeorological data from these measurements were used with a published process model to calculate emissions. Annual cycling of emissions was determined in relation to climatic factors and wind speed was found the predominating factor when the lagoon temperatures were above about 3°C. Total NH 3 emissions increased in the order of smallest to largest: nursery, sow, and finisher farms. However, emissions on an animal basis increased from nursery animals being lowest to sow animals being highest. When emissions were compared to the amount of nitrogen (N) fed to the animals, NH3 emissions from sows were lowest with emissions from finisher animals highest. Ammonia emissions were compared to similar farm production systems in the humid East of the United States and found to be similar for finisher animals but had much lower emissions than comparable humid East sow production.

Smoke particles modify the electrical properties of urban air: an increase in smoke concentration reduces air's electrical conductivity and increases the Potential Gradient (PG). Calibrated PG data are available from Kew since 1898, and air conductivity was measured routinely between 1909 and 1979 using the technique developed by C.T.R. Wilson. Automated smoke observations at the same site overlap with the atmospheric electrical measurements from 1921, providing an absolute calibration to smoke concentration. This shows that the late nineteenth century winter smoke concentrations at Kew were approximately 100 times greater than contemporary winter smoke concentrations. Following smoke emission regulations reducing the smoke concentration, the electrical parameters of the urban air did not change dramatically. This is suggested to be due to a composition change, with an increase in the abundance of small aerosol compensating for the decrease in smoke. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

On February 16, 2005, the epoch-making ""Kyoto Protocol"" came into effect, under which the action policies of the world of today will be planned on the basis of the viewpoint of the future generations of human beings, In this paper, the author reviews the environmental issues surrounding the ""Kyoto Protocol"" and the greenhouse gas reduction measures undertaken by the Japanese government and private sector, With respect to ensuring electric energy security, a special focus is provided on the importance of natural energy resources in east Siberia and Sakhalin to Japan and other Northeast Asian countries, The super-long-distance large-power international deep-sea submarine DC transmission cable system will play an important role in making use of green energy such as energy resources in east Siberia and Sakhalin in a green way. The key technologies for such transmission are ""SiC inverter/ converter"", ""high-temperature superconducting DC cable"" and ""PPLP-insulated super-long-distance large-power deep-sea submarine DC transmission cable"". It is crucially important that this new concept is regarded and promoted earnestly as part of the ""Northeast Asia Energy, Resource, Environmental and Economic Cooperation Region"" scheme established among Japan, China, South Korea and Russia, in which Japan who owns all necessary technologies mentioned above will take a leading role.

Petrographic study of the different quartz segregations showed that they were affected by variable recrystallization which controlled their fluid inclusion content. The oldest unaltered fluid inclusions found are present in vein crystals that survived dynamic and static recrystallization. These crystals contain a cogenetic, immiscible assemblage of CO2-rich (+H2O, +graphite) and brine-rich (+CO2, +halite, +carbonate) inclusions. The gas-rich inclusions have molar volumes between 44.8 and 47.5 cm3/mol, while the brine inclusions have a salinity of ∼33 eq. wt% NaCl. Modeling equilibrium immiscibility using volumetric and compositional properties of the endmember fluids indicates that fluid unmixing occurred at or near peak-metamorphic conditions of ∼460 °C and ∼4 kbar. Carbonate and graphite were precipitated cogenetically from the physically separated endmember fluids and were trapped in fluid inclusions. In most quartz crystals, however, recrystallization obliterated such early fluid inclusion assemblages and left graphite and carbonate as solid inclusions in recrystallized grains. Intragranular fluid inclusion trails in the recrystallized grains of breccia cementing and crosscutting quartz veins have CO2-rich assemblages, with distinctly different molar volumes (either between 43.7 and 47.5 cm3/mol or between 53.5 and 74.1 cm3/mol), and immiscible, halite-saturated H2O-CO2-NaCl(-other salt) inclusions. Later intergranular trails have CH4-H2 (XH2 up to ∼0.3) inclusions of variable density (ranging from 48.0 to &gt;105.3 cm3/mol) and metastable H2O-NaCl(-other salt?) brines (∼28 eq. wt% NaCl). Finally, the youngest fluid inclusion assemblages are found in non-luminescent secondary quartz and contain low-density CH4 (molar volume &gt; 105.33 cm3/mol) and low-salinity H2O-NaCl (0.2-3.7 eq. wt% NaCl). These successive fluid inclusion assemblages record a retrograde P-T evolution close to a geothermal gradient of ∼30 °C/km, but also indicate fluid pressure variations and the introduction of highly reducing fluids at ∼200-300 °C and 0.5-2 kbar. The quartz globules in the pillow fragments only contain sporadic CH4(+H2) and brine inclusions, corresponding with the late generations present in the cementing and crosscutting veins. We argue that due to the large extent of static recrystallization in quartz globules in the pillow breccia fragments, only these relatively late fluid inclusions have been preserved, and that they do not represent remnants of an early, seafloor-hydrothermal system as was previously proposed. Modeling the oxidation state of the fluids indicates a rock buffered system at peak-metamorphic conditions, but suggests a change towards fluid-graphite disequilibrium and a log fH2 / fH2O above the Quartz-Fayalite-Magnetite buffer during retrograde evolution. Most likely, this indicates a control on redox conditions and on fluid speciation by ultramafic rocks in the IGB. Finally, this study shows that microscopic solid graphite in recrystallized metamorphic rocks from Isua can be deposited inorganically from a fluid phase, adding to the complexity of processes that formed reduced carbon in the oldest, well-preserved supracrustal rocks on Earth. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Based on these data emission histories were related for selected contaminants. Significant emission sources and emission pathways were compiled. In correlation to investigations of national and international monitoring programmes a significant reduction of environmental emissions up to a tenth of previous values were found since 1998. Some selected compounds, discharged by municipal and industrial activities, for example disinfectants (methyltriclosan), flame retardants (tris(chloropropyl)phosphate), chlorinated benzenes, anilines and naphthalenes, can be classified as significant synthetic substances in the scope of the Water Framework Directive. Because of their chemical characters, their persistence, bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity, as well as their occurrence within the sediment core, these compounds create a significant potential risk for water quality, but a reduction of these synthetic compounds to zero cannot be expected for the next future.

The aim of this study was (1) to adapt the Lund-Postdam-Jena-GUESS (LPJ-GUESS) ecological modelling framework to Africa by providing new parameter values for tropical plant functional types (PFT), and (2) to assess the sensitivity of some African biomes to changes in precipitation regime. Location: The study area was a representative transect (0-220 N and 7-180E) through the transition from equatorial evergreen forests to savannas, steppes and desert northwards. The transect showed large latitudinal variation in precipitation (mean rainfall ranged from 50 to 2300 mm year-1). Methods: New PFT parameters used to calibrate LPJ-GUESS were based on modern pollen PFTs and remote sensed leaf area index (LAI). The model was validated using independent modern pollen assemblages, LAI and through comparison with White's modern potential vegetation map. Several scenarios were developed by combining changes in total rainfall amount with variation in the length of the dry season in order to test the sensitivity of African biomes. Results: Simulated vegetation compared well to observed data at local and regional scales, in terms of ecosystem functioning (LAI), and composition (pollen and White's vegetation map). The assessment of the sensitivity of biomes to changes in precipitation showed that none of the ecosystems would shift towards a new type under the range of precipitation increases suggested by the IPCC (increases from 5 to 20%). However, deciduous and semi-deciduous forests may be very sensitive to small reductions in both the amount and seasonality of precipitation. Main conlcusions: This version of LPJ-GUESS parameterized for Africa simulated correctly the vegetation present over a wide precipitation gradient. The biome sensitivity assessment showed that, compared with savannas and grasslands, closed canopy forests may be more sensitive to change in precipitation regime due to the synergetic effects of changed rainfall amounts and seasonality on vegetation functioning. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; DGVM; Leaf area index; Plant functional types; Pollen; Rainfall; Seasonality; Sensitivity analysis; Vegetation modelling; White's classification map","climate change; climate effect; climate variation; forest ecosystem; leaf area index; precipitation assessment; remote sensing; vegetation; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645776844

There is little information on the success of no-till dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production under annual cropping system in Iran. A 3-year experiment was conducted under dryland conditions to determine the influence of conventional and conservation tillage systems on grain yield and yield components of a winter wheat cultivar on a clay loam soil (Vertic Calcixerepts) in the northwest region of Iran. Tillage treatments comprised conventional tillage (CT: mouldboard plow + disk), reduced tillage (RT: chisel plow + disk), minimum till (MT: sweep plow), and no-till (NTss and NTtr: with standing stubble and total residue, respectively). Tillage treatments had significant effect on grain yield of wheat in 2 out of 3 years. Mean grain yield over three seasons was 1.0 Mg ha-1 for CT, 1.3 Mg ha-1 for RT, 1.1 Mg ha-1 for MT, 1.2 Mg ha-1 for NT ss and 1.4 Mg ha-1 for NTtr. A similar trend was observed for wheat biomass yields. Average grain yields with RT and NT tr were significantly greater (25-42%) than grain yields using CT treatment. Number of ears per square meter was significantly increased with NT and RT, while number of kernels per ear and ear length only increased under NTtr, compared with CT treatment. Tillage practices had no significant influence on 1000-kernel weight. Year affected grain yield significantly, mainly due to rainfall. Grain yields under NTtr were 70 and 38% higher than yields from CT treatment in a dry year (2000-2001) and in a year with precipitation above the average (2001-2002), respectively, whereas the precipitation use efficiency in the year with precipitation above the long-term average increased two-fold comparing with the dry year. Results from this study indicated that for a dryland continuous winter wheat cropping system, NTtr had higher grain yields (420 kg ha-1) than that obtained with CT system, probably owing to greater water availability. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Although this has been known for several decades, the contribution of LC degeneration to AD pathogenesis remains unclear. We induced LC degeneration with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-bromo-benzylamine (dsp4) in amyloid precursor protein 23 (APP23) transgenic mice with a low amyloid load. Then 6 months later the LC projection areas showed a robust elevation of glial inflammation along with augmented amyloid plaque deposits. Moreover, neurodegeneration and neuronal loss significantly increased. Importantly, the paraventricular thalamus, a nonprojection area, remained unaffected. Radial arm maze and social partner recognition tests revealed increased memory deficits while high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging-guided micro-positron emission tomography demonstrated reduced cerebral glucose metabolism, disturbed neuronal integrity, and attenuated acetylcholinesterase activity. Nontransgenic mice with LC degeneration were devoid of these alterations. Our data demonstrate that the degeneration of LC affects morphology, metabolism, and function of amyloid plaque-containing higher brain regions in APP23 mice.Wepostulate that LC degeneration substantially contributes to AD development.

This paper describes an integrated framework for organizing, synthesizing, and applying our growing understanding of aridland ecosystems using a flexible, multi-objective assessment, monitoring, and management approach. The framework is dual-purpose: (1) to coordinate the use of existing tools, resources, and diffuse knowledge, and (2) to facilitate the integration and application of new knowledge as it is developed. In particular, this framework must facilitate the integration of new knowledge about linkages among landscape units across scales. The framework includes five elements: (1) an ecological site-based approach for categorizing land based on soils and climate, (2) a repository for organizing existing data and knowledge about each ecological site, (3) conceptual models that organize information on the impacts of management and climate variability, and protocols for (4) assessing and (5) monitoring key ecosystem attributes fundamental to a variety of management objectives. Within this framework, basic and applied research are explicitly linked to management of arid and semi-arid ecosystems to more effectively articulate research questions and set research priorities. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, reductions in these pollutants have increasingly high costs; hence, quantifying the uncertainties in the calculation of critical loads and their exceedances has become increasingly important. The UK uses mass balance modelling techniques to calculate steady-state acidity and nutrient nitrogen critical loads for woodland habitats. The calculation uses data from a wide range of sources and the accuracy of the critical loads are influenced by the accuracy of the input data sets. This paper aims to quantify the uncertainties in the data used. A comparison of the uncertainties derived for UK data and those calculated by other European countries reveals a wide range in the estimates of uncertainty and in the methods used to derive them. Possible reasons for these differences are the different methods used to estimate the uncertainty, the scale at which the uncertainty was assessed and underlying methodological differences. Transparency in the way the uncertainties are derived are necessary for communication between scientists and decision makers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The way in which land is managed directly influences SOM. The objective of this work was twofold: (1) to evaluate the potential storage of C in a plinthic luvisol in southwest Burkina Faso under three different management methods - natural savannah vegetation, continuous cropping without manure and continuous cropping with manure; and (2) to examine the factors (chemical, physical and management) determining C storage in the soil. The methodology used in the field was characterization of the environment by soil mapping, measurement of bulk density, and soil sampling. In the laboratory, the determination of the soil physical and chemical characteristics and measurement of C and N contents and particle size distribution of the SOM were accomplished. The results show that the C content in the top 30 cm was 61 Mg ha -1 under savannah as compared to 16 Mg ha -1 under continuous cropping, with the C being present mainly in the surface layer. Cow manure applied at 2 Mg DM ha -1 yr -1 for 13 years led to an increase of 9 Mg C ha -1 . Particle size analysis showed that: (a) the carbon content was highest in the clay size fraction, and (b) the method of soil management mainly influenced the C content of the coarse fractions (200-2000 μm) and the fine fractions (0-20 μm) at the surface.

The rate of movement that occurs in response to changes in climate, whether fast or slow, will shape the distribution of natural ecosystems in the decades to come. Moreover, land-use patterns associated with urban, suburban, rural, and agricultural development will complicate ecosystem adaptation to climate change by hindering migration. Here we examine how vegetation's capacity to disperse and migrate may affect the biophysical and biogeochemical characteristics of the land surface under anthropogenic climate change. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of plant migration strongly influences carbon storage, evapotranspiration, and the absorption of solar radiation by the land surface. As a result, plant migration affects the magnitude, and in some cases the sign, of feedbacks from the land surface to the climate system. We conclude that future climate projections depend on much better understanding of and accounting for dispersal and migration. © 2006 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Carbon storage; Evapotranspiration; Global change; Surface radiation; Vegetation-climate feedback",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646535619

The crop is planted in April/May and harvested in September/October. The growing season is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with negligible rainfall, high solar radiation, and relatively cold nighttime temperatures, thus yields may exceed 9 t ha-1, 20% above the US average. California is a highly urbanized State with an affluent population demanding agricultural practices to be environmentally benign and food products to be safe for human health. This has contributed to a rigorous regulatory climate for plant protection chemicals thus increasing the cost of production. Likewise, the resource base is being challenged. Increased demand for clean potable water for urban expansion and the demand for environmental water compete with rice for limited supplies while raising cost. Production problems, such as straw management for cleaner air, weed resistance to herbicides, and the introduction of exotic pests also contribute to higher costs. The California rice industry is challenged by the increasing complexity of the rice production system to meet both the off-farm public demands and the on-farm need for higher productivity. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Alternative production systems; Environmental quality; Pest management",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32944472883

In the previous paper (Hirano et al. Building and Environment, forthcoming), it was revealed that building-scale voids are substantially effective in terms of reducing the cooling load. This paper firstly focuses on the cooling load reduction effects of component-scale voids, then moves on to the CO2 emission reduction effects of both component- and building-scale voids. Additionally, other environmentally friendly techniques are examined in order to assess the feasibility of the Architectural Institute of Japan (AIJ) charter, which sets the target that new buildings should extend their service life up to 100 years as well as reduce Life-Cycle CO2 (LCCO2) emission by 30%. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that compared to our a priori estimate (from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme's Global Emissions Inventory Activity), the a posteriori flux was much lower from 90°S-30°S and substantially higher from equator to 30°N. Consistent with these results, the a posteriori flux from the Southern Oceans region was lower than the a priori estimate, while Tropical Land and Tropical Ocean estimates were higher. The ratio of Northern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere fluxes was found to range from 1.9 to 5.2 (depending on the model setup), which is higher than the a priori ratio (1.5) and at the high end of previous estimates.

A monitoring program starting from November 2000 to February 2001 (winter) and June 2001 to August 2001 (summer) for PM10 and PM2.5 was performed at three monitoring stations in Hong Kong. Twenty-four-hour PM10 and PM 2.5 samples were collected once every 6 days at two urban sites, PolyU and KT, and every 12 days at a background site, HT, with Hi-Vol samplers. High concentrations of OC, EC (except in PolyU), water-soluble ions and elements were observed in winter among the three sampling sites for PM10 and PM2.5 fractions. Seasonal variations were significant in background HT. Dilution effect due to the increase in mixing depth and precipitation in summer reduced the concentrations of particulate matters. Long-range transport could contribute to the higher concentrations of particulate matter in the winter. Chemical mass closure calculations were performed for PM10 and PM2.5 observed. Mass closure improved when separate factors (1.4 and 1.9 respectively) were used to convert water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and water-insoluble organic carbon (WINSOC) into corresponding organic masses. The urban sites showed high percentages of water-soluble ions in winter and high percentages of carbonaceous species in summer. Better results were obtained for the chemical mass closure analysis in winter than in summer. High temperature and solar radiation in summer increased the rate of the complex photochemical reaction in the atmosphere. Therefore the chemical mass closure analysis would underestimate the volatized species and secondary aerosols during summer. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Despite a growing awareness of the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in nitrogen uptake, as carbon sinks for photosynthate and as conduits for carbon from plants to the below-ground community, few ecosystem ecologists have incorporated mycorrhizal fungi in their conceptualmodels of howforests function. Longstanding difficulties in assessing the presence and quantity of mycorrhizal fungi in soil, in identifying mycorrhizal fungi to species, and in assessing the mycorrhizal role in carbon and nitrogen cycling, have probably limited the willingness and ability of ecosystem ecologists to incorporate mycorrhizal fungi into their research. In particular, ecosystem models have not yet included mycorrhizal fungi, despite the key role of mycorrhizal fungi at the interface of plants, the soil and microbial communities below-ground. In this review we will focus on ectomycorrhizal fungi that form symbioses with many of the dominant trees of temperate and boreal forests, particularly in trees of the Pinaceae, Fagaceae, Betulaceae and Salicaceae. Ectomycorrhizal fungi also form symbioses with many tropical trees, including the Dipterocarpaceae of southeast Asia and Eucalyptus of Australia. We will lay out the current state of knowledge of the functioning of ectomycorrhizal fungi in carbon and nitrogen cycling of forest ecosystems as inferred from field and laboratory studies. Finally, we will discuss progress in integrating mycorrhizal fungi into quantitative frameworks of forest ecosystem function. © British Mycological Society 2006.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649113255

In ecosystems, the transfers within the pathway fractionate nitrogen isotopes so that the natural abundance of 15N in fungi differs from that in their host plants by as much as 12‰. Here we present a new method to quantify carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the symbiosis based on the fractionation against 15N during transfer of nitrogen from fungi to plant roots. We tested this method, which is based on the mass balance of 15N, with data from arctic Alaska where the nitrogen cycle is well studied. Mycorrhizal fungi provided 61-86% of the nitrogen in plants; plants provided 8-17% of their photosynthetic carbon to the fungi for growth and respiration.

It reports results from up to 8 years of experimental warming with ∼1 m2 open-top chambers (OTCs) at four tundra communities near Barrow (70°18′N, 156°40′W) and Atqasuk (70°29′N, 157°25′W) in northern Alaska. Between 1994 and 2002 the OTCs increased the mean growing season air temperature by between 0.6 and 2.2°C, depending on the site and year. The change in average July soil temperature recorded over 3 years at 10 cm depth due to the OTCs varied between -0.8 and 0.7°C, depending on the site. Changes in soil temperature did not result in detectable differences in thaw depth at any site. This is interpreted to be the result of the small size of the OTCs and possibly changes in vegetation. The differences in warming profiles between sites are important for the biological interpretation of manipulative warming experiments. These profiles also illustrate that vertical heat exchange varies according to plant community type and that this may be an important consideration as the region undergoes climatic change. © 2006 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"air temperature; arctic environment; climate change; growth response; plant community; soil temperature; tundra; warming; Alaska; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744903385

A seasonally-responsive dynamic systems model is used to identify the principal sources of natural and anthropogenic mercury, the relative contributions of these sources to the river, the impact of hypothetical reductions in specific natural and anthropogenic sources on mercury levels in surface water, sediment, and fish tissue, and the degree to which any such changes would be clearly discernible to environmental managers and Basin stakeholders. Two scenarios are modeled: ""PRES"", which considered all currently known natural and anthropogenic mercury sources and ""LEEM"", which (hypothetically) eliminated all local, but not global, anthropogenic sources and greatly lowered native soil erosion rates. Elimination of local air emissions reduces runoff of air-deposited mercury by ≈ 34% and advection from the Basin by ≈ 12%, while lowering erosion rates reduces particulate runoff by ≈ 57%, deposition from the water column to surficial sediment by ≈ 33%, and fluvial load by ≈ 24%; for a net reduction of 25.6% in the total mercury load to the river. Such hypothetical reductions bring methylmercury concentrations in predatory fish to levels that would allow restoration of fish consumption as a beneficial use. However, several factors, primarily technical feasibility and global sources, may impede attempts to attain this beneficial use. Actualizing the hypothetical 100% elimination of local anthropogenic sources and a > 50% reduction in erosion could pose significant technical challenges. Because local anthropogenic emissions make relatively smaller contributions to the Basin than do persistent global sources (sources over which there is little, if any, possibility of local control), localized environmental management actions alone may not be adequate to address mercury impacts within the Basin. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to palmitic acid (C 16 n-acid), which has been shown to record lake water D/H ratios, our surface sediments and down core data indicate that behenic acid (C22 n-acid), produced mainly by aquatic macrophytes, is also effective for capturing past environmental change. Calibration using surface sediments from two transects across eastern North America indicates that behenic acid records λD variation of lake water. Down core variations in λD values of behenic acid and pollen taxa are consistent with the known climate change history of New England. By evaluating the hypothesis that D/H fractionations of long chain even numbered fatty acids (C24-C32 n-acids) relative to lake water provide independent estimates of relative humidity during the growing season, we find that differences between lake-level records and isotopically inferred humidity estimates may provide useful insight into seasonal aspects of the hydrologic cycle. Combined analyses of D/H of short and long chain fatty acids from lake sediment cores thus allow reconstructions of both past temperature and growing season relative humidity. Comparison of λD records from two lakes in New England provides critical information on regional climate variation and abrupt climate change, such as the 8.2 ka event.

In a recent study, lidocaine significantly improved the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference gradients (A-aDO2) after tracheal instillation of acid in rabbits. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of lidocaine and pulse-dose steroids on human breast milk (HBM)-induced lung injury in rabbits. Methods: After Animal Care Committee approval, six adult rabbits were assigned to each of three treatments: control, lidocaine, and steroids. After induction of anesthesia and controlled ventilation, acidified HBM at pH 1.8 and volume 1.2 ml·kg-1 was instilled into the trachea. Rabbits in the lidocaine group received lidocaine 2 mg·kg-1 i.v. before tracheal instillation and then 2 mg·kg-1·h-1 i.v. continuously. Rabbits in the steroid group received 30 mg·kg-1 methylprednisolone before tracheal instillation. A-aDO2, static compliance and blood for white cell count, and cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) concentration were obtained at baseline and at 1 and 4 h postinstillation. After 4 h, the rabbits were killed. The left upper lobe was isolated and excised to determine the wet/dry ratio. The right lung was lavaged with 30 ml normal saline to determine the white cell count and the concentrations of albumin and IL-8. Data were analyzed using one- or two-way anova with repeated measures and an Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) posthoc test (P &lt; 0.05). Results: All rabbits completed the protocol. A-aDO2 and CO2 tensions increased significantly at 1 and 4 h compared with baseline, although there were no differences among the treatments (P &lt; 0.05). Compliance in the control group decreased compared with lidocaine and steroids.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) induce in vitro HO-1 expression and are reported to have pleiotropic benefits that reduce oxidative stress in the vasculature. We characterized the effects of statins on in vivo HO-1 expression in various extravascular tissues: liver, lung, brain, and heart. Adult mice were orally administered simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin. HO activity significantly increased in a statin- and tissue-specific manner, with all statins increasing heart and lung activity within 24 h. Significant elevations of HO-1 protein and mRNA were also observed in heart and lung after atorvastatin treatment. We conclude that in vivo HO-1 induction is statin- and tissue-specific.

However, hydrogen infrastructure is one of the major barriers. Because different H 2 pathways have very different energy and emissions effects, the well-to-wheels (WTW) analyses are necessary for adequately evaluating fuel/vehicle systems. The pathways used to supply H2 for FCVs must be carefully examined by their WTW energy use, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, total criteria pollutions emissions, and urban criteria pollutions emissions. Ten hydrogen pathways in Shanghai have been simulated. The results include well-to-wheels energy use, GHGs emissions, total criteria pollutions and urban criteria pollutions. A fuel-cycle model developed at Argonne National Laboratory - called the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model - was used to evaluate well-to-wheels energy and emissions impacts of hydrogen pathways in this study. Because the initial GREET model had no coal and naphtha-based hydrogen pathways, four hydrogen pathway computer programs were added to GREET in the research. To analyze uncertain impacts, commercial software, Crystal Ball™ was used to conduct Monte Carlo simulations. Hence, instead of point estimates, the results of this study were probability distributions. Through the research of H2 pathways in Shanghai, the following conclusions were achieved:All the pathways have significant reductions in WTW petroleum use, except two H2 pathways from naphtha, which achieve about 20% reductions in WTW petroleum.All the pathways have significant reductions in WTW urban criteria pollutions emissions, except two H2 pathways from coal, which result in significant increases in WTW urban SOX emissions.The NG-based H2 pathways have the best WTW energy efficiencies, and the electrolysis H 2 pathways have the worst WTW energy efficiencies. The WTW energy efficiencies of H2 pathways from naphtha and coal are between NG-based pathways and electrolysis pathways. The pathways from naphtha have higher energy efficiencies than the pathways from coal. Only four pathways (G NG C, G NG R, G N C, and L NG C) offer WTW energy benefits and the other six pathways consume more WTW energy than baseline-conventional gasoline vehicles.

The largest step in the history of Cenozoic climate, from an Eocene ""Greenhouse"" toward the modern glaciated state, is correlated with opening of a deep water connection between the Southern Indian and Southern Pacific Oceans. This study synthesizes results from previous work, assesses the possibility that ocean heat transport was much greater than modern during the globally warm Eocene, and explores the sensitivity of polar climate to large changes in ocean heat transport. The magnitudes of these sensitivities are compared with those due to greenhouse gas concentration changes. We find that ocean heat transport was unlikely to have been sufficiently greater than modern during the Eocene to explain the change in the climate. Specifically, in order to have significantly affected Antarctic climate, ocean heat transport changes would have had to change by an order of magnitude-much greater than the largest change produced in our simulations. In coupled climate model simulations, changes in CO2 concentrations(from 1120 to 560 ppm) supported by proxy records, lead to significant Antarctic responses in the absence of ocean heat transport changes. The results show that Antarctic snow accumulation is primarily controlled by changes in summer temperature, not precipitation, and that snow did not remain on Antarctica during summer months in Eocene even at low greenhouse gas concentrations. Greenhouse gas concentration changes and subsequent processes such as ice albedo and weathering feedbacks, were more likely to have been the primary cause of Antarctic glaciation than ocean heat transport changes. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we used geographic information systems (GISs) to explore possible associations between chromosomal damage in 65 African American children and their mothers from Oakland, California, and both proximity to traffic and regional ozone levels. Study participants were interviewed at the Healthy Child Clinic of Children's Hospital, Oakland, and their blood and buccal cells were collected for assessment of chromosomal damage by the micronucleus (MN) assay. Regional ozone levels, which decreased from April to November with a secondary peak in late summer, were highly correlated with season by month (r = -0.84, P = 0.02) and strongly associated with MN frequency (frequency ratio (FR): 3.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30-8.72) in both cell types of children and adults. Additionally, MN frequencies were modestly associated with individual measures of traffic density in children (FR = 2.45, 95% CI = 0.86-7.10), but not in adults; this suggests a greater vulnerability to traffic-related air pollution in children. Smoking in the household also increased MN frequency in the lymphocytes of children (FR: 1.13, 95%CI: 1.01-1.24) and adults (FR: 1.06, 95%CI: 0.99-1.13), whereas vitamin use in adults decreased MN frequency in both lymphocytes and buccal cells (FR: 0.17, 95%CI: 0.02-1.31; FR: 0.18, 95%CI: 0.03-1.18, respectively).

The primary carbonic inclusions were identified in coarse crystalline quartz of the main mineralisation stages at the Pering and Bushy Park deposits, hosted by Neoarchean dolostones of the Campbellrand Subgroup of the Transvaal Supergroup. The composition of the carbonic inclusions was determined from their low temperature phase behaviour during microthermometry and was confirmed with Raman microspectometry. It provides evidence for the presence of a highly reactive reducing agent (CH4) that may have been important during the mineralisation process. The carbonic inclusions and their coexistence with saline aqueous fluid inclusions allow the determination of the fluid temperature (200 to 240°C) and pressure (0.8 to 1.5 kbar) during mineralisation, suggesting that ore formation took place at 2.8 to 4.8 km depth under lithostatic pressure conditions.

Food-web interactions and carbon flows in the plankton community were estimated from size-dependent predation, carbon transfer between trophic levels and size-biomass measurements determined in 5 independent field investigations. The community was separated into 10 different functional groups, which consisted mainly of pico-, nano-and micro-phytoplankton, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, heterotrophic dinoflagellates, ciliates, nauplii, copepods and chaetognaths. The major carbon flow on all 5 occasions was consistent with a general conceptual food-web model, even though the study region was subjected to different oceanographic conditions - warm pool in 1990 to 1993, equatorial divergence in 1994. The 5 food webs showed distinct differences in structure, dependent on the size composition within each functional group, suggesting potential inherent non-steady-state dynamics at the intra-functional group level. The apparent stability of food-web dynamics in the equatorial plankton community may be a consequence of complex food-web interaction and resulting fluctuations, the effects of which neutralize each other over time. © Inter-Research 2006.","Community stability; Equatorial Pacific; Food-web complexity; Functional group; Pelagic food web; Size-dependent predation","bacterium; biomass allocation; carbon flux; ciliate; community structure; dinoflagellate; food availability; food web; marine ecosystem; photic zone; size distribution; trophic level; zooplankton; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745607895

T6G 2E3, Canada","Soil carbon sequestration (SCS) has emerged as a technology with significant potential to help stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations and thus reduce the threat of global warming. Methods and models are needed to evaluate and recommend SCS practices based on their effects on carbon dynamics and environmental quality. Environment Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) is a widely used and tested model for simulating many agroecosystem processes including plant growth, crop yield, tillage, wind and water erosion, runoff, soil density, and leaching. Here we describe new C and N modules developed in EPIC built on concepts from the Century model to connect the simulation of soil C dynamics to crop management, tillage methods, and erosion processes. The added C and N routines interact directly with soil moisture, temperature, erosion, tillage, soil density, leaching, and translocation functions in EPIC. Equations were also added to describe the effects of soil texture on soil C stabilization. Lignin concentration is modeled as a sigmoidal function of plant age. EPIC was tested against data from a conservation reserve program (CRP) 6-year experiment at five sites in three U.S. Great Plains states and a 61-year long-term agronomic experiment near Breton, Canada. Mean square deviations (MSD) calculated for CRP sites were less than 0.01 (kg C m -2)2, except for one site where it reached 0.025 (kg C m-2)2. MSD values in the 61-year experiment ranged between 0.047 and 0.077 (kg C m-2)2. The version of the EPIC model presented and tested here contains the necessary algorithms to simulate SCS and improve understanding of the interactions among soil erosion, C dynamics, and tillage. A strength of the model as tested is its ability to explain the variability in crop production, C inputs and SOC and N cycling over a wide range of soil, cropping and climatic conditions over periods from 6 to 61 years. For example, at the Breton site over 61 years, EPIC accounted for 69% of the variability in grain yields, 89% of the variability in C inputs and 91% of the variability in SOC content in the top 15 cm. Continued development is needed in understanding why it overpredicts at low SOC and underpredicts at high SOC. Possibilities now exist to connect the C and N cycling parts of EPIC to algorithms to describe denitrification as driven by C metabolism and oxygen availability. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The annual emissions per single source for each of the VOCs were found to be below the US EPA emissions standard which is 2,000 kg/yr in all companies except the emission of hexane from company F1 which was slightly higher than the standard. The type of tanks used seems to significantly influence the emission rate. Vertical fixed roof tanks (VFRT) emit a lot more than externally floating roof tanks (EFRT) and internally floating roof tanks (IFRT). The use of IFRT and EFRT should be encouraged especially for storage of petrol which had highest atmospheric emission contribution. Model predicted atmospheric emissions are less than annual losses measured by companies in all the eight sources. It is possible that there are other routes for losses beside atmospheric emissions. It is therefore important that waste reduction efforts in these companies are directed not only to reducing atmospheric emissions, but also prevention of the spillage and leakage of stored liquid and curbing of the frequently reported illegal siphoning of stored products. Emission rates for benzene, toluene, and xylene were used as input to CALPUFF air dispersion model for the calculation of spatial downwind concentrations from area sources. By using global positioning system (GPS) and geographical information system (GIS) the spatial benzene concentration contributed by organic liquid storage tanks has been mapped for Dar-es-Salaam City. Highest concentrations for all the three toxic pollutants were observed at Kigamboni area, possibly because the area is located at the wind prevailing direction from the locations of the storage tanks. The model predicted concentrations downwind from the sources were below tolerable concentrations by WHO and US-OSHA. The highest 24 hrs averaging time benzene concentration was used for risk assessment in order to determine maximum carcinogenic risk amongst the population exposed at downwind. Established risk for adult and children at 2.9 × 10-3 and 1.9 × 10-3 respectively, are higher than the acceptable US-EPA risk of 1 × 10-6. It is very likely that the actual VOCs concentrations in some urban areas in Tanzania including Dar-es-Salaam City are much higher than the levels reported in this study when other sources such as petrol stations and motor vehicles on the roads are considered. Tanzania Government therefore need to put in place: an air quality policy and legislation, establish air quality guidelines and acquire facilities which will enable the implementation of air quality monitoring and management programmes. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Atmospheric emissions; Benzene; Dispersion; Organic liquids; Risk; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Waste minimization; Xylene","Atmospheric emissions; Externally floating roof tanks; Internally floating roof tanks; Organic liquids; Benzene; Geographic information systems; Global positioning system; Oil tanks; Petroleum products; Risk assessment; Toluene; Toxic materials; Volatile organic compounds; Xylene; Air pollution control; benzene; hexane; petroleum; toluene; volatile organic compound; xylene; atmospheric pollution; developing world; dispersion; emission; risk assessment; storage tank; volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality control; article; atmospheric dispersion; cancer risk; developing country; environmental exposure; field emission; geographic information system; global positioning system; government regulation; law; motor vehicle; policy; pollution monitoring; population risk; prediction; public health; risk assessment; spillage; Tanzania; waste minimization; world health organization; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Benzene; Child; Developing Countries; Gasoline; Humans; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Organic Chemicals; Risk Assessment; Tanzania; Toluene; Volatilization; Xylenes; Africa; Dar es Salaam [Tanzania]; East Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745146216

In spite of the efforts to control emissions from road traffic by way of stringent emission norms (such as Euro-III and IV) for automobile engines and improved fuel quality, the road traffic emissions form a significant proportion of urban air pollutants. This is primarily due to constant increase in number of motor vehicles and their use in the urban areas. Recognizing this aspect and with a view to provide clean air, the Supreme Court of India has issued an order in a public interest litigation matter, directing that public transport vehicles, namely intracity buses, should be run on compressed natural gas (CNG) in Delhi. The directive of the Supreme Court was implemented but along with it many other actions/measures were also implemented by the concerned authorities. These measures included operation of taxis and auto rickshaws on CNG, scrapping of all commercial vehicles including taxis aged 15 years and above, introduction of Euro-I emission norms for private passenger cars, use of unleaded petrol, and premixing of 2T oil with petrol for two wheeler motor vehicles. The result of the combined efforts is a perceivable change in the ambient air quality for the better. But questions and debates were frequent as to whether the improved quality of air is mainly due to CNG and if so how much is to be attributed to CNG. To answer these questions a detailed study was carried out to quantify the emissions and their reductions due to different measures. This paper presents an account of the study. In this study the quantity of criteria pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter and hydrocarbons are estimated on the basis of vehicle kilometers traveled by different vehicles in the city during the course of time when the improvement measures were being effected on an incremental basis. The results of the study are discussed and the contribution of each of the measures is estimated. The implemented improvement measures were extremely successful. The improvement was, as made out to be, not simply because of CNG conversion of buses but due to the combined effect of many other steps like improved vehicle technologies and fuel quality, phasing out the old diesel vehicles, conversion of auto rickshaws to CNG, etc. The results are of interest to both the analysts and policy makers in appreciating the impact of each of the measures. © 2006 ASCE.","Air pollution; Emissions; Environmental impacts; India; Natural gas; Traffic management; Vehicles","Air pollution control; Buses; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Management; Motor transportation; Natural gas; Compressed natural gas (CNG); India; Traffic management; Unleaded petrol; Air quality; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; traffic management; Asia; Delhi; Eurasia; India; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646692498

Twisting of the phenyl rings along the carbon-carbon triple bond is almost frictionless in these systems giving rise to planar as well as several twisted ground-state conformations, and this results in broad structureless absorption in the spectral region of 250-450 nm. In the case of 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)- benzene, a broad absorption band was observed due to the HOMO-LUMO transition, whereas dialkoxy-substituted compounds possess two well-separated bands. Dialkoxy substitution in the 2,5-position of the phenyl ring in phenyleneethynylenes alters its central arene π-orbitals through the resonance interaction with oxygen lone pairs resulting in similar orbital features for HOMO and HOMO-l/HOMO-2. Electronic transition from the low-lying HOMO-1/HOMO-2 orbital to LUMO results in the high-energy band, and the red-shifted band originates from the HOMO-LUMO transition. The first excited-state transition energies at different dihedral angles, calculated by the TDDFT method, indicate that the orthogonal conformation has the highest excitation energy with an energy difference of 15 kcal/mol higher than the low-lying planar conformation. The emission of these compounds originates preferentially from the more relaxed planar conformation resulting in well-defined vibronic features. The fluorescence spectral profile and lifetimes were found to be independent of excitation wavelengths, confirming the existence of a single emitting species. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical bonds; Conformations; Electric excitation; Electric properties; Molecular dynamics; Olefins; Probability density function; Substitution reactions; Ground-state conformations; HOMO-LUMO transition; Molecular systems; Unsubstituted system; Oligomers; acetic acid derivative; alkyne; ether derivative; phenyleneethynylene; alkylation; article; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; electricity; photochemistry; rotation; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; Acetates; Alkylation; Alkynes; Electrostatics; Ethers; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Photochemistry; Rotation; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646366908

Efforts to enhance terrestrial organic carbon sequestration have traditionally focused on aboveground biomass and surface soils. An unexplored potential exists in thick lower horizons of widespread, mature soils such as Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols. We present a case study of fate and transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in a highly weathered Ultisol, involving spatial scales from the laboratory to the landscape. Our objectives were to interpret processes observed at various scales and provide an improved understanding of coupled hydrogeochemical mechanisms that control DOC mobility and sequestration in deep subsoils within humid climatic regimes. Our approach is multiscale, using laboratory-scale batch and soil columns (0.2 by 1.0 m), an in situ pedon (2 by 2 by 3 m), a well-instrumented subsurface facility on a subwatershed (0.47 ha), and ephemeral and perennial stream discharge at the landscape scale (38.4 ha). Laboratory-scale experiments confirmed that lower horizons have the propensity to accumulate DOC, but that preferential fracture flow tends to limit sequestration. Intermediate-scale experiments demonstrated the beneficial effects of C diffusion into soil micropores. Field- and landscape-scale studies demonstrated coupled hydrological, geochemical, and microbiological mechanisms that limit DOC sequestration, and their sensitivity to local environmental conditions. Our results suggest a multi-scale approach is necessary to assess the propensity of deep subsoils to sequester organic C in situ. By unraveling fundamental organic C sequestration mechanisms, we improve the conceptual and quantitative understanding needed to predict and alter organic C budgets in soil systems. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"carbon sequestration; dissolved organic carbon; environmental fate; fracture flow; hydrogeochemistry; laboratory method; preferential flow; river discharge; soil column; solute transport; Ultisol; vadose zone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947374091

Transformation of unsorted debris into a sorted circle causes early plant remains to be preserved in the fine-grained centre encircled by a coarse, clastic border. Systematic radiocarbon dating of plant remains from the sorted stone circles on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica, yielded ages between 290-4710 14C yrs BP. The oldest age obtained from a large stone circle approximated the regional deglaciation age recorded in marine and lacustrine sediment cores. Most of the ages, however, underestimate the time of deglaciation due to the continual addition of younger plant remains, changes in soil motion, and the diverse vegetation history. Despite its current limitations as a terrestrial proxy for regional deglaciation, further systematic dating and careful interpretation based on surface processes may improve the usefulness of sorted circles in reconstructing the glacial and periglacial history of polar terrestrial environments. © Antarctic Science Ltd.","Deglaciation history; Lichen; Moss; Patterned ground","age determination; deglaciation; glacial debris; lacustrine deposit; lichen; moss; radiocarbon dating; sediment core; vegetation history; Antarctica; King George Island; South Shetland Islands; West Antarctica; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744962041

Most of the Ni on the MgAl2O4 support were finely dispersed NiO clusters, while the Ni on the Al2O3 support was hard-to-reduce NiAl2O4.

The results showed that the total CH4 emissions from PF were 646.3±52.1 and 215.0±45.4 kg CH4 hm-2 during the rice-growing period and non-rice period, respectively. Both values were much lower than many previous reports from similar regions in Southwest China. The CH4 emissions in the rice-growing season were more intensive in PF, as compared to RW and RR. Only 33% of the total annual CH4 emission in PF occurred in the non-rice season, though the duration of this season is two times longer than the rice season. The annual mean N2O flux in PF was 4.5±0.6 kg N2O hm-2 yr-1. The N2O emission in the rice-growing season was also more intensive than in the non-rice season, with only 16% of the total annual emission occurring in the non-rice season. The amounts of N2O emission in PF were ignorable compared to the CH4 emission in terms of the global warming potential (GWP). Changing PF to RW or RR not only eliminated CH4 emissions in the non-rice season, but also substantially reduced the CH4 emission during the following rice-growing period (ca. 58%, P&lt;0.05). However, this change in cultivation system substantially increased N2O emissions, especially in the non-rice season, by a factor of 3.7 to 4.5. On the 100-year horizon, the integrated GWP of total annual CH4 and N2O emissions satisfies PF≫RR≈RW. The GWP of PF is higher than that of RW and RR by a factor of 2.6 and 2.7, respectively. Of the total GWP of CH4 and N2O emissions, CH4 emission contributed to 93%, 65% and 59% in PF, RW and RR, respectively. These results suggest that changing PF to RW and RR can substantially reduce not only CH4 emission but also the total GWP of the CH4 and N2O emissions.","CH4; Cultivation systems; Global warming potential (GWP); N2O; Permanently flooded rice fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646853838

Measurements of the CO2 generated by films exposed to ultraviolet irradiation (UV) were completed in 5 h - very much less than conventional accelerated tests. The TiO2 pigments used included anatase and rutiles with different surface treatments. Anatase pigmented material gave significantly higher CO2 emission than unpigmented PE whilst rutile-pigmented PEs either gave reduced CO2 emission or enhanced emission, according to the surface treatment. The ranking of the pigments as protectants or pro-degradants correlated well with the carbonyl index measured after more than 300 h exposure to UVA fluorescent tubes in a QUV machine. The method was then used to probe mechanistic aspects of the photo-oxidation of pigmented polyethylene (PE) film. For unpigmented polymer the photo-degradation was sensitive to changes in the small fraction of incident UV below 300 nm, but for pigmented films this was much less important. This is because unpigmented film degrades by direct photochemical attack whereas, for pigmented film, photocatalysis by TiO2, which absorbs in the 300-400 nm region, is important. For films whose photo-oxidation was dominated by photocatalysis by the TiO2 the rate of oxidation was shown to vary as the square root of the UV intensity. By contrast, for unpigmented films the rate of direct photochemical oxidation was linearly proportional to UV intensity. The difference is a consequence of the controlling role of electron-hole recombination in photocatalytic processes.

They offer valuable information on the current state of the Earth's land surface. However, considerable disagreements among them and classification legends not primarily suited for specific applications such as carbon cycle model parameterizations pose significant challenges and uncertainties in the use of such data sets. This paper addresses the user community of global land cover products. We first review and compare several global land cover products, i.e. the Global Land Cover Characterization Database (GLCC), Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), and the MODIS land cover product, and highlight individual strengths and weaknesses of mapping approaches. Our overall objective is to present a straightforward method that merges existing products into a desired classification legend. This process follows the idea of convergence of evidence and generates a 'best-estimate' data set using fuzzy agreement. We apply our method to develop a new joint 1-km global land cover product (SYNMAP) with improved characteristics for land cover parameterization of the carbon cycle models that reduces land cover uncertainties in carbon budget calculations. The overall advantage of the SYNMAP legend is that all classes are properly defined in terms of plant functional type mixtures, which can be remotely sensed and include the definitions of leaf type and longevity for each class with a tree component. SYNMAP is currently used for parameterization in a European model intercomparison initiative of three global vegetation models: BIOME-BGC, LPJ, and ORCHIDEE. Corroboration of SYNMAP against GLCC, GLC2000 and MODIS land cover products reveals improved agreement of SYNMAP with all other land cover products and therefore indicates the successful exploration of synergies between the different products. However, given that we cannot provide extensive validation using reference data we are unable to prove that SYNMAP is actually more accurate.

The search for the appropriate method is a controversial topic as it is subject to high uncertainty in particular associated to the upscaling from site measurements. In this study, all available data from Germany on annual N2O-emission rates derived from field experiments of at least an entire year are summarized. From each study, only differences in soil properties on N input qualified as an individual data set. Under these premises, 101 treatments from 27 sites were found equally spread across Germany. The annual N application ranged from 0 to 400 kg N ha -1 and the annual emission rates from 0.04 to 17.1 kg ha -1. Annual emission factors (EFs), uncorrected for background emission, varied considerably from 0.18% to 15.54% of N applied. There was no nationwide correlation found for the relationship between N2O losses and N application, soil C, soil N, soil texture, or soil pH. However, site-specific trends in the relationship between emission factor and mean soil aeration status, as expressed by the soil type and/or mean climatic conditions, were revealed. Regularly water-logged soils were characterized by low emission factors as were soils from the drier regions (&lt;600 mm y-1), whereas well-aerated soils from the frost-intensive regions showed exceptionally high emission factors. Since purely physical and chemical parameterization failed to describe N2O emissions from agricultural land use on the national scale, there must be a biological adaptation to mean site conditions, i.e., different microbial communities react differently to similar actual conditions in terms of N2O dynamics. Regardless of the point of view, the chapter on N2O soil dynamics cannot be closed yet, and new additional model concepts, process studies, and field measurements are needed. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In theories of the formation of the Earth, the composition of gases extracted by primary planetary magmas is accounted for by the large-scale melting of the early mantle in the presence of the metallic Fe phase [1, 2]. The fused metallic Fe phase and the melted silicate material experienced gravitational migration that exerted influence upon the formation of the metallic core of the planet. The large-scale melting of the early Earth should have been accompanied by the formation of volatile compounds, whose composition was controlled by the interaction of H and C with silicate and metallic melts, a process that remains largely unknown as of yet. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2006.",,"Carbon; Composition; Hydrogen; Iron; Melting; Silicates; Volcanic rocks; Magma; Mantle source; Redox state; Volatile compounds; Solubility; carbon; chemical composition; hydrogen; magma chemistry; mantle structure; melting; silicate melt; solubility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748796878

This paper addresses some problems concerning changes in the redox state of the upper mantle over geologic time and through its depth and the possible influence of fO2 stratification in the interiors on geochemical processes. Among these problems are the formation of fluids enriched in H2O, CO2, CH4,and H2; the possible influence of reduced fluid migration from mantle zones with low fO2 values on reactions in the lithosphere; and the formation of films of silicate liquids with high H2O and CO2 contents, which could be responsible for metasomatic transformations in rocks. The formation of a metallic core and accompanying large-scale melting of the silicate part of the Earth are the early mechanisms of the chemical differentiation of the mantle that must have had an effect on the redox state and the composition of volatile components in planetary materials. The molten metallic and silicate phases were prone to gravitational migration, which affected the formation of the metallic core. Volatile components had to be simultaneously formed in the zones of large-scale melting of the early Earth. The composition of these volatiles was largely controlled by the interaction of hydrogen and carbon, the two major gas-forming elements in the mantle, with melt under low fO2 values. A remarkable feature is that, despite fairly low fO2 values imposed by the presence of a metallic phase, both reduced (CH4 and H2) and oxidized species of hydrogen and carbon (H2O, OH- and CO32-) are stable in the melt. This peculiarity of carbon and hydrogen dissolution in reduced melts may be crucial for the elucidation of mechanisms for the formation of initial amounts of CO2 and H2O connected with incipient melting in the reduced mantle. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2006.",,"Carbon; Composition; Dissolution; Geochemistry; Hydrogen; Redox reactions; Rocks; Silicates; Vapor pressure; Oxygen fugacity; Planetary materials; Redox state; Oxygen; carbon; dissolution; fluid composition; fugacity; hydrogen; mantle chemistry; melting; metasomatism; oxygen; redox potential; upper mantle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748762478

Two types of linear-polarization anisotropy of the excitonic emission are revealed. The first type of anisotropy corresponds to the luminescence polarization along the [011] axis and is related to the emission from the lower level of the doublet state of heavy-hole excitons localized in the islands elongated in the [011] direction. The second type of anisotropy is related to the generation of free excitons with wave vectors exceeding that of light. Such a process is made possible by the elastic scattering of light at anisotropic interface-roughness structure originating from the growth steps. In this case, the emission is polarized along the [0-11] axis and the anisotropy is caused by deformation effects that lead to the perturbation of the hole states in the vicinity of the growth steps. The deformation appears due to a mismatch between the lattice constants of the barrier and the well materials. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2006.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645727908

H1743-322, a black hole transient observed intensely in X-rays and also covered in the radio band during its 2003 decay, provides clues about the changes in accretion geometry during state transitions and also the general properties of X-ray emission during the intermediate and low-hard states. In this work, we report on the evolution of spectral and temporal properties in X-rays and the flux in the radio band, with the goal of understanding the nature of state transitions observed in this source. We concentrate on the transition from the thermal dominant state to the intermediate state that occurs on a timescale of 1 day. We show that the state transition is associated with a sudden increase in power-law flux. We determine that the ratio of the power-law flux to the overall flux in the 3-25 keV band must exceed 0.6 for us to observe strong timing noise. Even after the state transition, once this ratio was below 0.6, the system transited back to the thermal dominant state for 1 day. We show that the emission from the compact radio core does not turn on during the transition from the thermal dominant state to the intermediate state but does turn on when the source reaches the low-hard state, as seen in 4U 1543-47 and GX 339-4. We find that the photon index correlates strongly with the QPO frequency and anticorrelates with the rms amplitude of variability. We also show that the variability is more likely to be associated with the power-law emission than the disk emission. © 2006. The American Astronomical Society.

It is shown that function W(E) has one or more maxima differing on value and location for different species. The narrow low-energy maximum appears due to acute maximum of phonon energy loss at the same energy. The broad maximum lying at higher energy is conditioned by energetic dependence of initial radius of TEP. Results of analysis compare with existing experimental data. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Five pairs of experiments were conducted using observed and climatological SSTs for cases 1) without any observation, 2) surface pressure observation only with the observation density of 1915, 3) surface pressure observation with the observation density of 1997, 4) surface observation and radiosondes, and 5) all observations, including satellite retrievals. The analyses were run for 4 months in 1997 (strong El Niño) and 1993 (near-normal SST). The impact of SST and the various observation systems on the analysis of near-surface parameters, the upper-level field, and several diagnostic fields were compared against the control analysis with observed SST and all available observations. The most important finding of this study is that the impact of SST varies with the time scale of the analysis, which is most apparent in the surface-pressure-only observation experiments. The impact of SST is largest for the low-frequency (seasonal) analyses and smaller for the high-frequency (daily) analyses. This is particularly apparent for near-surface temperature and upper-level height field analyses. In the extreme case of the strong El Niño year, the simulation with observed SST without any observations [Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-type run] produced seasonal mean 2-m temperature (T2M) and 500-hPa height fields that agreed better with the control analysis than the analysis with surface pressure observation only with climatological SST. On the contrary, the impact of surface pressure observation is greater on higher-frequency analyses, and lower on low-frequency analyses. Generally speaking, accurate analysis of SST is important when limited atmospheric observation is available. But even for the full atmospheric observation system, climatological SST produces inferior analysis over ocean as well as land. The introduction of radiosonde data drastically reduces errors in the analyses and diagnostic fields; thus, radiosonde data are indispensable for accurate estimation of the atmospheric state in both short and long time scales. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric density; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Computer simulation; Heat flux; Precipitation (meteorology); Pressure distribution; Radiosondes; Sea level; Latent heat flux; Near-surface temperature; Sea surface temperature; Climatology; sea surface temperature; temporal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645020265

However, little is known about the underlying immunological mechanisms. The study investigates the influence of high-altitude climate therapy on airway inflammation and cellular components of specific and unspecific immune response. Exhaled NO significantly decreased within 3 weeks of therapy in patients with allergic and intrinsic, moderate and severe asthma. Interleukin-10 (IL-10)-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) increased within 3 weeks of therapy in six of 11 patients, whereas transforming growth factor-β1-secreting PBMC remained stable. Furthermore, monocyte activation, assessed by CD80 expression significantly decreased during therapy. The frequency of CRTH2-expressing T cells decreased, while regulatory T cells (Treg) remained stable. FOXP3 and GATA-3 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells did not change, while interferon-γ and IL-13 mRNA expression decreased in eight of 10 patients. The current data demonstrate that high-altitude climate therapy reduces local airway inflammation. Furthermore, monocytes switch towards a tolerogenic phenotype under high-altitude climate therapy. The Treg/Th2 ratio increases; however, because of the absence of antigens/allergens, no de novo differentiation of Th2 nor Treg cells is observed. The high-altitude climate therapy therefore may form the immunological basis for the endogenous control of allergen-driven diseases. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"B7 antigen; interleukin 10; messenger RNA; nitric oxide; prostaglandin receptor; transcription factor FOXP3; transcription factor GATA 3; transforming growth factor beta1; adult; allergic asthma; antigen expression; article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; conservative treatment; controlled study; cytokine release; disease severity; expired air; gene expression; high altitude climate therapy; human; human cell; immune response; intrinsic asthma; leukocyte activation; lymphocyte activation; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; respiratory tract inflammation; treatment outcome; Adult; Altitude; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Asthma; Bronchitis; Climate; GATA3 Transcription Factor; Humans; Interferon Type II; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-13; L-Selectin; Lymphocyte Activation; Middle Aged; Nitric Oxide; Receptors, Immunologic; Receptors, Prostaglandin; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Transcription Factors; Transforming Growth Factor beta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645714238

ACF10, the most microporous activated carbon used in this study, had over 90% of its pore volume in pores smaller than 10 Å. It also had the highest volume in pores 5-8 Å, which is the optimum pore size region for TCE adsorption, among the four activated carbons. Adsorption of NOM fractions by ACF10 was, in general, negligible. Therefore, ACF10, functioning as a molecular sieve during preloading, exhibited the least NOM uptake for each fraction, and subsequently the highest TCE adsorption. The other three sorbents had wider pore size distributions, including high volumes in pores larger than 10 Å, where NOM molecules can adsorb. As a result, they showed a higher degree of uptake for all NOM fractions, and subsequently lower adsorption capacities for TCE, as compared to ACF10. The results obtained in this study showed that understanding the interplay between the optimum pore size region for the adsorption of target synthetic organic contaminant (SOC) and the pore size region for the adsorption of NOM molecules is important for controlling NOM-SOC competitions. Experiments with different NOM fractions indicated that the degree of NOM loading is important in terms of preloading effects; however the way that the carbon pores are filled and loaded by different NOM fractions can be different and may create an additional negative impact on TCE adsorption. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Fibers; Granular materials; Hydrophobicity; Molecular sieves; Pore size; Activated carbon fibers (ACF); Granular activated carbon (GAC); Natural organic matter (NOM); Trichloroethylene (TCE); Activated carbon; activated carbon; carbon fiber; natural organic matter; sorbent; trichloroethylene; Activated carbon; Adsorption; Fibers; Granular materials; Hydrophobicity; Molecular sieves; Pore size; filter; adsorption; article; hydrophobicity; molecular size; molecular weight; porosity; surface property; water treatment; Adsorption; Carbon; Porosity; Trichloroethylene; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33144473422

The mer encodes 345 amino acid residues, and the deduced amino acid sequence shows high similarity with those of hypothetical proteins from Debaryomyces, Candida and Saccharomyces, and ketoreductase from Zygosaccharomyces.

The main goal of the country is to reduce the import of fossil fuel, to improve environment conditions and to reduce the climate change impact. Analysis of implemented RE projects and forecasts for the future projects are also presented. Most of the efforts in Lithuania were aimed at drafting the biomass (wood chips, wood waste, straw, biogas) and small hydro projects and their subsequent implementation. At present the total capacity of wood-chip-fuelled boilers reached above 251 MW. No serious obstacles can be seen for the extension of wood fuel use. At present, new demonstrational projects have been started covering geothermal energy, solar energy, biogas, biofuels for transport and other. In this time, the RE sources comprise 7.69% of national energy balance. Taking into account feasible resources of RE (it is more than 19.85 TWh/year) and the ongoing implementation of projects it is clear that the share of RE sources will constitute 12-13% of national energy balance in 2010 year. The main factor limiting further growth is high investment costs. The electricity production from local and RE sources in Lithuania is mainly based on hydro energy. At this time the wind energy is not used for this purpose. The electricity production from local and renewable energy sources is about 3.22% of the total consumption. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 96, FI-02151 Espoo, Finland","Ni and Cu mining and ore processing in Hitura, Western Finland, have resulted in emissions of metal-rich wastewaters into the nearby Kalajoki River since 1970. The wastewaters are discharged into the river 3 km upstream from the eutrophic Lake Pidisjärvi, which is a widening of the river by the town of Nivala. The water level of the lake was elevated by 1.5 m and the extensive macrophyte stands were cut in 1979, profoundly changing the environmental conditions. The effects of the decreasing metal emissions and nutrient concentrations since 1979 on the now open 3.9 km2 lake were studied with paleolimnological techniques. A 2-m sediment core was taken from the lake in February 2004 and analysed for sediment chemistry and diatom assemblages. At the coring site, 13 cm of sediment had been deposited since 1979, on top of a bed of undecomposed macrophyte remains. When the sediment chemistry was compared with records of decreasing metal loading since 1979, no correlation was found because post-depositional mobility and changes in sediment characteristics affect the sediment metal profiles. Thus, the reduced emissions from the mine and the lower lake water phosphorus levels have not caused a corresponding decrease in sediment metal and P concentrations. However, both of these environmental variables accounted for a statistically significant percentage of variation in the sedimentary diatom assemblages in a redundancy analysis constrained to a single variable. This relationship persisted for Ni loading even in a partial analysis, while the importance of nutrients was confirmed by the good correlation between diatom-inferred and measured P concentrations. The results suggest that reductions in metal and nutrient loading have had an effect on the algal assemblages even though the sediment concentrations of Ni, Cu or P have not decreased. © Springer 2006.","Base metals; Diatoms; Finland; Mining; Monitoring; Nutrients; Recovery","acid mine drainage; copper; nickel; water pollution; algae; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144490718

This paper uses data from a climate change experiment with the same RCM (HadRM3H) to provide estimates of change in flood frequency between the 1970s and 2080s, for 15 catchments across Great Britain. This experiment is a rerun, at twice the horizontal resolution, of one of those used by the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) in the construction of its UKCIP02 climate change scenarios for the UK. It thus allows an exploration of the implication of these scenarios using a resolution more suited to the detailed hydrological application addressed in this paper. Despite decreases in annual average rainfall in all but one catchment, eight show an increase in flood frequency at most return periods whereas two show substantial decreases. As part I of this paper showed a distinct positive correlation between errors in annual rainfall and errors in flood frequency, the fact that flood frequency can increase despite an overall decrease in rainfall implies a marked change in the distribution of rainfall, either in terms of the probability of rainfall events and/or its seasonal cycle. Decreases in flood peaks are shown for a number of the catchments in the south and east of England, despite an increase in winter mean and extreme rainfall. Increased summer and autumn soil moisture deficits are thought to be the reason for this. Other catchments, further north or west, show an increase in flood peaks, in some cases of over 50% at the 50-year return period. Care needs to be taken when interpreting these results, as they are based on a single RCM experiment (using driving data from one GCM under a single emissions scenario). Other RCM experiments may give quite different results, and ensemble runs would ideally be required to limit sample error. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Flood frequency; Rainfall-runoff model; Regional climate models; Spatial generalisation","Catchments; Climate change; Climatology; Floods; Hydrology; Flood frequency; Rainfall-runoff model; Regional climate models; Spatial generalization; Rain; Catchments; Climate change; Climatology; Floods; Hydrology; Rain; climate change; flood frequency; frequency analysis; peak discharge; rainfall-runoff modeling; regional climate; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31044448050

Nowadays emissions of As are low. Over the lifetime of the plant's operation over 3000 tonne of As have been emitted into the environment. This paper aims to examine the concentrations of As in the soil around the power station, and also to investigate whether the coal burnt in the plant, and consequently the emissions from it, contained raised levels of six further heavy metals. Soil concentrations were compared to ground level air As concentrations predicted by an air dispersion model. Coal samples were taken from the power station and analysed to determine concentrations of As, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni and Cd. Soil samples (n = 113) were taken up to 12 km from the plant along a transect designed to follow the valley floor in which the power station is situated. Soil samples were analysed for concentrations of those elements for which coal was tested. Concentrations of As in coal were high (AM 518 μg/g). Those of other heavy metals were, in general, low. Concentrations of soil As were substantially raised in the near vicinity of the plant but decreased within 5 km to concentrations similar to those in the rest of the district. Overall, levels within 10 km of the plant were slightly above those recommended for residential levels in the UK. Soil concentrations of other heavy metals were higher in the vicinity of the plant but none, overall was raised. Comparison of results from a previous air dispersion model of ground level air arsenic concentrations showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.6) between modelled and measured values. Over its period of operation the power plant has contributed to raised levels of soil As in the local soils, though not substantially of other elements.

The aim of this study was to critically test the relationship between soil pH and rates of C and N cycling, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), in two long-term field experiments in which pH had been manipulated (Rothamsted silty clay loam, pH 3.5-6.8; Woburn sandy loam, pH 3.4-6.3). While alteration of pH for 37 years significantly affected crop production, it had no significant effect on total soil C and N or indigenous mineral N levels. This implies that at steady state, increased organic matter inputs to the soil are balanced by increased outputs of CO2. This is supported by the positive correlation between both plant productivity and intrinsic microbial respiration with soil pH. In addition, soil microbial biomass C and N, and nitrification were also significantly positively correlated with soil pH. Measurements of respiration following addition of urea and amino acids showed a significant decline in CO2 evolution with increasing soil acidity, whilst glucose mineralization showed no response to pH. In conclusion, it appears that changes in soil pH significantly affect soil microbial activity and the rate of soil C and N cycling. The evidence suggests that this response is partially indirect, being primarily linked to pH induced changes in net primary production and the availability of substrates. In addition, enhanced soil acidity may also act directly on the functioning of the microbial community itself. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

For this we used two climate scenarios, one representing a 10-year period of present-day climate (1991-2000) and a 9-year period for future climate conditions (2031-2039). The climate scenarios were used to drive the GIS-coupled biogeochemical model Photosynthesis-Evapotranspiration- Model-Denitrification-Decomposition-Model (PnET-N-DNDC), which has currently been tested for its predicting capability for soil N trace gas emissions for various sites across Europe. The model results show a complex, spatially differentiated pattern of changes in future N2O and NO emissions from the forest soils across Europe, which were driven by the combined effect of changes in precipitation and temperature. Overall, the model predicted that N2O emissions from the European forest soils will on average decrease by 6%. This decrease was mainly due to the shift in N2O:N2 ratio driven by enhanced denitrification. NO emissions were found to increase by 9%. The increases in NO emissions were mainly due to increases in temperature. Only for the regions where soil moisture was predicted to markedly increase or suffer from water stress during the vegetation period, a reduction of NO emissions was simulated. The simulations show the possibility and feasibility for assessing climate change feedbacks on biogenic N trace gas emissions from soils at a regional scale.

The HALS of all incubation samples showed a decrease in log (A400/A 600) values and an increase in A600/C values with increasing incubation time. When HALS were classified, only rice straw HALS of 160 days (RS160) belonged to Type A, whereas broad leaf HALS of 160 days (BL160) and Japanese cedar sawdust HALS of 160 days (JCSD160) belonged to Type B. For elemental and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, the HALS samples were prepared according to the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) method. Data from the elemental composition of all HALS showed high contents (45.98 to 56.55) of carbon (C), low (3.19 to 5.16) hydrogen (H), and low (0.33 to 2.36) nitrogen (N). Carbon content increased in RS and BL, and increased or fluctuated to some extent in the JCSD, whereas H and N contents decreased in all samples as incubation progressed. The H/C and O/C ratios showed a marked decrease, simultaneously the O/H ratio increased, with increased incubation days. These results suggested that oxidation occurred in the incubation system. Although some HALS samples (RS160 and BL160) appeared in the Type A region in both H/C versus O/C and H/C versus O/H diagrams. HALS plotted in the figures of log (A400/A600) versus A600/C, H/C versus O/C and H/C versus O/H diagrams were generally placed out of the area of natural soil HAs. In the case of 1H NMR, the spectral shape of RS, BL and JCSD differed from that of natural soil HAs. Only the 1H NMR spectrum of RS160 was similar to that of Type A soil HA. Changes in the composition of proton species in HALS showed that percentages of aromatic protons (H ar) increased with increasing incubation. Spectra obtained using 13C NMR revealed that RS and BL HALS were different from natural soil HAs, whereas RS160 was similar to Type A HA spectra. In the spectra of RS HALS, the signal intensities of carbohydrate C (approximately 74 and 105 p.p.m.) and methoxyl C (approximately 56 p.p.m.) decreased gradually as incubation time progressed, while carboxylic C (approximately 175 p.p.m.) increased. Simultaneously other distinct signals became broad and overlapped each other. As a result, the changes in RS HALS spectra suggested that progress in the modification of lignin and the oxidative degradation of polysaccharide structure, and the spectrum of RS160 became similar to the spectra of Type A HAs. Although the only signal resulting from phenolic C (approximately 150 p.p.m.) still appeared in RS160, the signal intensity decreased and became broader and weaker from RS0 to RS160 with incubation time. Therefore, it was concluded that RS HALS might form a completely similar spectra to the spectra of natural Type A HAs with longer incubation time. © 2006 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Humic acid like substances; NMR; Organic carbon; Spectroscopic; Type A humic acids","Cryptomeria japonica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745298257

The kidney preserves normal acid-base balance by two mechanisms: bicarbonate reclamation mainly in the proximal tubule and bicarbonate generation predominantly in the distal nephron. Bicarbonate reclamation is mediated mainly by a Na-H antiporter and to a smaller extent by the H-ATPase. The principal factors affecting HCO3 reabsorption include effective arterial blood volume, glomerular filtration rate, chloride, and potassium. Bicarbonate regeneration is primarily affected by distal Na delivery and reabsorption, aldosterone, arterial pH, and arterial pCO2. To generate metabolic alkalosis, either a gain of base or a loss of acid, must occur. The loss of acid may be via the GI tract or by the kidney. Excess base may be gained by oral or parenteral HCO3 administration or by lactate, acetate, or citrate administration. Factors that help maintain metabolic alkalosis include decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), volume contraction, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and aldosterone excess. Clinical states associated with metabolic alkalosis are vomiting, mineralocorticoid excess, the adrenogenital syndrome, licorice ingestion, diuretic administration, and Bartter's and Gitelma's Syndromes. The effects of metabolic alkalosis on the body are varied and include effects on the central nervous system, myocardium, skeletal muscle, and the liver. Treatment of this disorder is simple, once the pathophysiology of the cause is delineated. Therapy consists of reversing the contributory factors promoting alkalosis and in severe cases, administration of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, acid infusion, and low bicarbonate dialysis. © Società Italiana di Nefrologia.","Bicarbonate reclamation; Bicarbonate regeneration; Diuretics; Metabolic alkalosis; Potassium aldosterone; Volume contraction; Vomiting","acetazolamide; acetic acid; acid; aldosterone; ammonia; arginine; bicarbonate; carbonate dehydratase inhibitor; chloride; citric acid; estradiol 17beta dehydrogenase; furosemide; Glycyrrhiza extract; hydrochloric acid; lactic acid; loop diuretic agent; mineralocorticoid; potassium; sodium; sodium chloride; spironolactone; steroid 11beta monooxygenase; bicarbonate; potassium; acid base balance; arterial carbon dioxide tension; arterial pH; artery blood flow; article; Bartter syndrome; central nervous system disease; chloride blood level; clinical feature; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; corticosteroid blood level; dialysis; disease exacerbation; drug contraindication; drug indication; drug infusion; endocrine disease; enzyme deficiency; Gitelman syndrome; glomerulus filtration rate; Glycyrrhiza; heart output; hemodialysis; human; hypercapnia; hypertension; hypochloremia; hypokalemia; kidney acidifying capacity; kidney concentrating capacity; kidney failure; liver disease; metabolic alkalosis; myopathy; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; pathophysiology; potassium blood level; potassium depletion; sodium absorption; sodium depletion; sodium transport; uremia; urinary excretion; vomiting; acid base balance; alkalosis; metabolism; physiology; prognosis; review; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Alkalosis; Bicarbonates; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Potassium; Prognosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747117722

Investigation of their transport properties and characterization of electronic structure by in-situ photoemission spectroscopy have been carried out. The films grown at 450 ∼ 480 °C from BaCuO2 target had simple infinite layer structure with lattice parameter of a and c about 0.385 and 0.405 nm, respectively. Conductivity of these films were, however, poor. Usage of BaCu0.75Ox target and addition of CO2 into the growth atmosphere resulted in an expansion of c-axis length up to 0.810 ∼ 0.835 nm and a significant rise of conductivity. This structure is represented as 2c. For the 2c phase, conductivity above of 103 S/cm was achieved by adjusting their growth temperature in the range of 500 ∼ 530 °C. Most of the highly conductive 2c phase showed superconductivity. The maximum temperature of onset of the superconducting transition and zero resistance state obtained so far were 60 and 47 K, respectively. Finite spectral weights at Fermi level were successfully observed in in-situ photoemission spectra of the 2c phase. In valence band region, a prominent peak with u 3d character located at a binding energy around 1.6 eV. Though this low binding energy suggested a rather high hole concentration of mobile holes were around middle of 10 21 cm-3 range. These results about electronic structure indicate a coexistence of conventional CuO2 planes and distorted ones. The latter structure might play charge-reserving blocks, though some portions of holes should localize in them. Correlations between the properties and electronic structure are to be discussed. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746304727

In experiments, the dynamic mechanical properties of divalent Co2+-neutralized poly(ethyl acrylate) ionomers containing polar and non-polar plasticizers were compared with those of the monovalent Na+-neutralized ionomers. In the case of the ionomers plasticized with non-polar 4-decylaniline (4-DA), residing in non-ionic regions, the matrix and cluster Tgs of the ionomer decreased with increasing 4-DA contents. The decreasing rates of the matrix and cluster Tgs were found to be similar at 0.8 and 1.0 °C/(wt% of 4-DA) for the Co2+ and Na+ ionomers, respectively. The ionic modulus of the Co2+ ionomer changed only slightly with increasing 4-DA contents, but that of the Na+ ionomer decreased noticeably. In the SAXS study, it was observed that the un-plasticized Co 2+ ionomer showed a strong small angle upturn and a very broad SAXS peak, indicating that the ionomer phase was compositionally heterogeneous. The plasticization of the Co2+ ionomer with 4-DA, however, induced a well-developed SAXS peak that was comparable to that of the un-plasticized Na+ ionomer. These results suggested that the addition of 4-DA to the Co2+ ionomer made the ionomer have more multiplets at a prevalent distance, leading to more clustering. In the case of the Co2+ ionomers plasticized with polar glycerol (Gly) that acted mainly as multiplet plasticizer, a very weak cluster glass transition, decreasing ionic modulus and only a well-developed small angle upturn were observed.

For the prediction of particulate NH4NO3 concentrations, this study uses the USEPA Models-3/Community Multi-scale Air Quality (Models-3/CMAQ) model. The measurement data are collected from 4 ground-based stations (Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Kangwha) and ACE-ASIA C130 Flights #6, #7, and #10. The four ground-based stations and air flight tracks are located in and around the Yellow Sea in East Asia. According to the results, the predicted fine-mode NH4+concentrations are 1.2-3.8 times overestimated compared to those measured on the mass basis, and fine-mode NO3- concentrations are 1.9-7.6 times overestimated on the mass basis. It is also revealed in this study that aberrantly high predicted fine-mode NO3- concentrations in East Asia can be attributed to the overestimated NH3 emissions. The predicted gas-phase NH3 concentrations and estimated NH3 emissions are likely to be 1.2-3.8 times overestimated in East Asia on the mass basis. Therefore, it is recommended that approximately 20-75% reduced NH 3 emission fields should be used in future modeling studies for East Asia. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As uniform the methodologies as possible were intended with an established QA/QC procedure in order to produce reliable and comparable data by the network. The monsoon effects and seasonal changes in the sources/activities require long-term monitoring to understand the nature of air pollution in the cities. During phase 1 (2001-2004) of the AIRPET around 3000 fine and coarse particulate matter samples were collected from characteristic urban sites, which provide insight into temporal and spatial variations of PM in the cities. In all six cities, the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 were found high, especially during the dry season, which frequently exceeded the corresponding 24 h US EPA standards at a number of sites. The average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in the cities ranged, respectively, 44-168 and 54-262 μg m-3 in the dry season, and 18-104 and 33-180 μg m-3 in the wet season. Spatial and temporal distribution of PM in each city, the ratios of PM2.5 to PM10, and the reconstructed mass were presented which provide useful information on possible PM sources in the cities.

This paper analyzes, both deterministically and probabilistically, a California-based 1-day telework scenario, and explores how the mode of transportation and other parameters such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle model, occupancy rate, telecommuting frequency, and season (heating or cooling) affect the air pollution effects of telework programs when energy consumption-related emissions due to heating, cooling, lighting, and the use of electronic and electrical equipment (in the home and company office) are accounted for. Among others, the study found that total telework-related CO2 emissions during the cooling season and SO2, NOx, and hydrocarbon emissions in both seasons appear to be lower than nontelework emissions for all modes of transportation (except for light rail with higher NOx emissions and urban transit buses with roughly equal NOx emissions in the heating season). Light rail also has higher telework N2O and CH4 emissions. However, given the uncertainties in the data, the differences may be negligible. Urban transit buses and commuter express buses were found to be associated with more telework than nontelework CO emissions in both seasons. For these two modes, telework PM10 emissions are higher in the cooling and about the same in the heating season than nontelework emissions. Natural gas-powered ferries have more telework PM10 emissions than nontelework emissions. The study also found that for low-frequency telework programs energy use impacts could overturn transportation-related emission reductions independent of the mode of transportation used. Avoiding more polluting modes of transportation, increasing occupancy rates, substituting longer commutes and especially increasing telecommuting frequency could counteract these negative effects. © 2006 ASCE.","Air pollution; Emissions; Telecommunication","Bus transportation; Carbon monoxide; Energy utilization; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Probability; Carbon monoxide emissions; Telework; Transportation-related air pollution; Urban transit buses; Air pollution; Air pollution; Bus transportation; Carbon monoxide; Energy utilization; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Probability; atmospheric pollution; pollution effect; telecommunication; transportation mode; California; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646710589

However, solid methane has low-resisitivity to the radiation damage, and at some facilities it cannot be used due to the regulation to the explosive materials. We have been experimentally studied neutronic performances of various materials, explosive and non-explosive, to look for the materials having the good neutronic characteristics. Here, we present the experimental results on the neutronic performances of such materials. For the high-intensity type moderator and a coupled type moderator, we measured the neutronic performance of the mesitylene, methanol, benzene, etc. as inflammable materials, and also hydrogen and methane as flammable materials. It is concluded that, among inflammable materials mesitylene is the best, and that para-hydrogen would be the best in all materials studied. For the high-resolution-type moderator, a decoupled moderator, we also studied mesitylene, hydrogen, methane. The mesitylene moderator gives not so different spectral intensities compared with the hydrogen moderator but the pulse widths were wider than that of the hydrogen moderator at low energy. The use of the para-hydrogen improved the pulse characteristics very much, and it is expected that in some energy region the para-hydrogen moderator performance approaches to the methane moderator. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ISOPHOT multi-aperture photometry is an efficient method to resolve compact sources or to detect extended emission down to relatively faint levels with single detectors in the wavelength range 3 to 100μm. Aims. Using ISOPHOT multi-aperture photometry and complementary ISO spectra and IR spectral energy distributions we discuss the nature of the extended IR emission of the two PNe NGC 6543 and NGC 7008. Methods. In the on-line appendix we describe the data reduction, calibration and interpretation methods based on a simultaneous determination of the IR source and background contributions from the on-source multi-aperture sequences. Normalized profiles enable direct comparison with point source and flat-sky references. Modelling the intensity distribution offers a quantitative method to assess source extent and angular scales of the main structures and is helpful in reconstructing the total source flux, if the source extends beyond a radius of 1 arcmin. The photometric calibration is described and typical accuracies are derived. General uncertainty, quality and reliability issues are addressed, too. Transient fitting to non-stabilised signal time series, by means of combinations of exponential functions with different time constants, improves the actual average signals and reduces their uncertainty. Results. The emission of NGC 6543 in the 3.6μm band coincides with the core region of the optical nebula and is homogeneously distributed. It is comprised of 65% continuum and 35% atomic hydrogen line emission. In the 12 μm band a resolved but compact double source is surrounded by a fainter ring structure with all emission confined to the optical core region. Strong line emission of [ArIII] at 8.99 μm and in particular [SIV] at 10.51 μm shapes this spatial profile. The unresolved 60 μm emission originates from dust. It is described by a modified (emissivity index β= 1.5) blackbody with a temperature of 85 K, suggesting that warm dust with a mass of 6.4 × 10-4 M⊙ is mixed with the ionised gas. The gas-to-dust mass ratio is about 220. The 25 μm emission of NGC 7008 is characterised by a FWHM of about 50″ with an additional spot-like or ring-like enhancement at the bright rim of the optical nebula. The 60 μm emission exhibits a similar shape, but is about twice as extended. Analysis of the spectral energy distribution suggests that the 25 μm emission is associated with 120 K warm dust, while the 60μm emission is dominated by a second dust component with 55 K. The dust mass associated with this latter component amounts to 1.2 × 10-3 M⊙, significantly higher than previously derived. The gas-to-dust mass ratio is 59 which, compared to the average value of 160 for the Milky Way, hints at dust enrichment by this object. © ESO 2006.","Astronomical data bases: miscellaneous; Infrared: ISM; Methods: data analysis; Planetary nebulae: individual: NGC 6543; Planetary nebulae: individual: NGC 7008; Techniques: photometric","Calibration; Data reduction; Dust; Electromagnetic wave emission; Infrared radiation; Photometry; Spectrum analysis; Atomic hydrogen line emission; Interpretation methods; Multi-aperture photometry; Spectral energy; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744950781

However, appropriate mechanisms for intervention in the agricultural knowledge market are still in their infancy. This article discusses the case of the Nutrient Management Support Service (NMSS), a government-funded support service in The Netherlands designed to optimize the fit between the demand and supply of ""agricultural knowledge products"" that reduce nutrient emissions into the environment. The activities of the support service were four-fold: (1) distributing vouchers to farmers, (2) establishing mechanisms for quality control, (3) facilitating the articulation of end-users' needs, and (4) improving market transparency. We analyze the extent to which the NMSS has succeeded in supporting a demand-driven knowledge market for nutrient management issues. We question some of the conceptual and practical assumptions underlying this style of intervention. In addition, we argue that the notion of demand requires considerable refinement before it can be useful for guiding state involvement in demand-driven extension. © Springer 2006.","Demand-driven agricultural extension; Knowledge markets; Nutrient management; Privatization; Public interest; State intervention; The Netherlands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646936552

Responding to the complex nature of the climate problem and to the changing role of climate change in the international climate policy process, the scientific community has started to include stakeholder knowledge and perspectives in their assessments. Participatory Integrated Assessment (PIA) is in its early stage of development. Methodology varies strongly across PIA projects. This paper analyzes four recent IA projects of climate change that included knowledge or perspectives from stakeholders in one-way or another. Approaches and methods used turn out to differ in whether stakeholders are involved actively or passively, whether the approach is bottom-up or top-down, and whether the different functions in the IA process are open or closed to stakeholder input. Also, differences can be seen in the degree to which boundaries are pre-set that limit the roles and domains of competencies attributed to each scientific or non-scientific participant (so-called boundary work). The paper discusses pros and cons of the various approaches identified, and outlines heuristics and considerations to assist those who plan, design or fund new IA processes with stakeholder input on what approaches best to choose in view of the objectives for stakeholder involvement, in view of the role that the IA plays in the overall risk management process and in view of considerations regarding boundary work. © Springer 2006.",,"Environmental impact; Heuristic methods; International cooperation; Project management; Risk management; Boundary work; Global environmental risks; Integrated assessment; International climate policy; Participatory Integrated Assessment; Climate change; climate change; environmental risk; geographical knowledge; integrated approach; stakeholder",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744481564

Generally it is assumed that early diagenetic processes in heterozoan settings are mainly destructive, including abrasion and dissolution on the sea floor. Constructive diagenesis (cementation) is delayed to later stages in the burial environment, with pressure solution of calcitic grains acting as a cement source. This paper presents a study of Oligo-Miocene inner- to outer-ramp heterozoan carbonates from the Central Mediterranean (Maltese Islands and Sicily) indicating that early diagenetic processes are more important than previously assumed. Four to five different cement types, including fibrous, two types of epitaxial, bladed and blocky cement, are distinguished based on transmitted light microscopy. Cathodoluminescence microscopy allowed a differentiation between primary high-Mg calcitic (fibrous and epitaxial cement I) and primary low-Mg calcitic (epitaxial cement II, bladed and blocky) cements. Stable-isotope data indicate cement precipitation from marine, marine-derived, and meteoric waters. Trace-element analyses point to cementation in an open system (Maltese Islands) and a closed system (Sicily). Our investigations show that the majority of constructive diagenetic processes in these rocks occurs rather early in the shallow, marine burial environment, which is transitional between the marine seafloor and the deep-burial diagenetic environment. The main cement source in this environment is assumed to be aragonite. We suggest careful consideration of the importance of aragonitic components in fossil heterozoan settings, which seem to be more abundant than previously assumed and can act as a major early cement source. Due to the low preservation potential of these components, detailed geochemical studies are necessary to detect aragonite as the cement source. Our findings also have implications when considering the reservoir qualities of these rocks, because primary porosity can be occluded early and secondary porosity is not preserved.

Annual radial growth of trees and shrubs was mostly defined by summer temperature regime (positive correlation), but climatic response of woody plants was species specific and depends on local conditions. Dynamics of annual increments of mosses were opposite to tree growth. The difference in climatic response of the different vegetation components of the forest ecosystems indicates that these components seem to be adapted to use climatic conditions during the short and severe northern summer, and decreasing in annual production of one component is usually combined with the increase of other component productivity. Average productivity in the northern forest ecosystems varies from 0.05 to 0.14 t ha-1 year-1 for trees, from 0.05 to 0.18 t ha-1 year-1 for shrubs and from 0.54 to 0.66 t ha-1 year -1 for mosses. Higher values of tree productivity combined with lower annual moss productivity were found in sites in northern taiga in comparison with forest-tundra. Different tendencies in the productivity of the dominant species from each vegetation level (trees, shrubs, mosses) were indicated for the last 10 years studied (1990-1999): while productivity of mosses is increasing, productivity of trees is decreasing, but there is no obvious trend in the productivity of shrubs. Our results show that in the long term, the main contribution to changes in annual biomass productivity in forest-tundra and northern taiga ecosystems under the predicted climatic changes will be determined by living ground cover. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Aboveground biomass; Annual increment; Climatic change; Inter-annual variability; Productivity","aboveground biomass; aboveground production; annual variation; boreal forest; primary production; article; biomass; climate; comparative study; ecosystem; forestry; growth, development and aging; population dynamics; Russian Federation; season; temperature; time; tree; Biomass; Climate; Ecosystem; Forestry; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Siberia; Temperature; Time Factors; Trees; Eurasia; Siberia; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30544452641

Provisionally, one class, two orders and four alliances in addition to unclassified ""polar desert complex"" were distinguished. They were: the Salicetea arcticae, incorporating the Saxifragetalia oppositifoliae and the Caricetalia stantis. The Saxifragetalia oppositifoliae comprised of three alliances, i.e., Papaverion lapponici, Dryado - Salicion arcticae, and Cassiopion tetragonae, in addition to the ""polar desert complex"". Under the Caricetalia stantis, one alliance Caricion stantis was recognized. Vegetation of the Canadian High Arctic was compared with that of Svalbard. The most striking difference between the two regions was a presence/absence of Cassiope tetragona in the zonal phytogeocoenoses. The Cassiopedominating communities are fairly common in Svalbard whereas they are generally limited in the Canadian High Arctic. Such difference was explained primarily by climatic characteristics and concomitant soil properties in such a manner that a highly continental climate of the Canadian High Arctic decelerates the soil leaching and eluviation to maintain generally high base status of soils. On the other hand, a strongly oceanic climate of Svalbard promotes soil leaching to result in a soil acidification. Cassiope tetragona is known to be acidophilous and thrives better in acidic soils. In the Canadian High Arctic, development of the Cassiope-dominating communities is rather restricted to the areas where soils are generally acidic. Such a climate-soil-vegetation interaction regulates development of zonal phytogeocoenoses to determine biogeoclimatic characteristics of the respective regions. © 2006 National Institute of Polar Research.","Biogeoclimate processes; High Arctic Canada; Svalbard; Syntaxonomy vegetation classification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745752112

Measurements of EC were made using a semicontinuous thermal-optical analyzer. The mass concentrations of nonvolatile aerosol measured by the calibrated scanning mobility particle sizer combined with a heated inlet agreed with the independent EC measurements with a systematic difference of about 4%, demonstrating that the mass concentrations of nonvolatile aerosol well represent those for EC. A majority of the nonvolatile aerosol and therefore EC mass concentration was in volume equivalent diameters between 50 and 200 nm, peaking at around 130 nm. The correlation of EC and CO was generally compact throughout the measurement period because of the similarity in sources. The slope of the EC-CO correlation (ΔEC/ΔCO) is therefore a useful parameter in validating EC emission inventories. The EC concentration and ΔEC/ΔCO showed distinct diurnal variation. On weekdays, EC and ΔEC/ΔCO reached maximum values of about 3 μg m-3 and 9 ng m-3/parts per billion by volume, respectively, in the early morning (0400-0800 local time), when the traffic density of heavy-duty trucks with diesel engines was highest. In addition, these values were lower by a factor of 2 on Sundays. The heavy truck traffic showed similar diurnal and weekday/weekend variations, indicating that exhaust from diesel engines is an important source of EC. Monthly mean ΔEC/ΔCO showed a seasonal variation, reaching broad maximum values in spring-autumn and reaching minimum values in midwinter, following the seasonal variation in temperature, as observed in Maryland, United States (Chen et al., 2001). This temperature dependence is likely due to the temperature dependence of EC emissions from diesel engines on intake air temperature. More stringent regulation of emissions of particles from diesel cars started in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area in October 2003. The ΔEC/ΔCO values did not change, however, exceeding the natural variability (10%) after 1 year from the start of the new regulations, when the temperature dependence is taken into account. This indicates that the regulation of particle emissions in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area was not effective in reducing the EC concentrations after 1 year.

T6G 2N8, Canada","Numerous experimental and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are major constituents of cigarette tobacco tar, are strongly involved in the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Knowing that PAH-induced toxicities are mediated by the activation of a cytosolic receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which regulates the expression of a group of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, NQO1, and GSTA1, suggests a direct link between AhR-regulated XMEs and CVDs. Therefore, identifying the localization and expression of the AhR and its regulated XMEs in the cardiovascular system (CVS) is of major importance in understanding their physiological and pathological roles. Generally, it was believed that the levels of AhR-regulated XMEs are lower in the CVS than in the liver; however, it has been shown that similar or even higher levels of expression are demonstrated in the CVS in a tissue- and species-specific manner. Moreover, most, if not all, AhR-regulated XMEs are differentially expressed in most of the CVS, particularly in the endothelium cells, aorta, coronary arteries, and ventricles. Although the exact mechanisms of PAH-mediated cardiotoxicity are not fully understood, several mechanisms are proposed. Generally, induction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 is considered cardiotoxic through generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA adducts, and endogenous arachidonic acid metabolites. However the cardioprotective properties of NQO1 and GSTA1 are mainly attributed to the antioxidant effect by decreasing ROS and increasing the levels of endogenous antioxidants. This review provides a clear understanding of the role of AhR and its regulated XMEs in the pathogenesis of CVDs, in which imbalance in the expression of cardioprotective and cardiotoxic XMEs is the main determinant of PAH-mediated cardiotoxicity.

The importance of fuel cells for energy saving purposes is emphasised. Their applications are wide-ranging with use found in local stations and power plants, in industry for the highly efficient conversion of waste and biomass materials and in carbon dioxide reduction in all fossil-fuel-burning processes. Unique features highlighted include their importance in spacecrafts and their development for affordable implementation in electric cars.

Hence this study focuses on a single take-off and investigates the pollutant dispersion of two different airplane types, for various wind directions each. Calculations are performed with ADREA-HF, a 3D unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics code using a one-equation turbulence closure model. Moving plane source is considered as a series of jets emitting the one after the other. Concentration levels are presented through time and space and different cases' results are compared and discussed. The main objective of this work was to identify the high concentration areas throughout the take-off, in order to help in determining the best positioning for remote optical pollutant measurement instruments. Modelling reveals interesting plume propagation as the airplane moves, with a characteristic blister near the brake release point. The latter is proven to be the best place to have measurements, regardless of wind speed and direction. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Gravity wave activity is modulated on number of time scales, ranging from diurnal through seasonal to intraseasonal and interannual. A semiannual variation is particularly evident. In this paper we examine the possibility of using the wave variances in the MLT to estimate the momentum flux spectrum near the source height in the troposphere. To test our ideas we focus on modeling observations in April 1993 and April 1994, months which had very different background winds and tides. A linear gravity wave model is used in combination with ray-tracing techniques to investigate the propagation of wave spectra through representative zonal wind and temperature fields, including the effects of tidal winds and temperatures. The magnitude and diurnal variation of observed wave variance are used to constrain the momentum fluxes as a function of height and time. A number of source distributions were tested using this technique. It was found that the observations impose rather strong constraints on the source-level spectrum. A spectrum that has a bias to toward eastward propagating waves gave the best correspondence with observations. Our results have significance for the design and constraint of gravity wave parameterization schemes used in climate models. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Identified subpopulations, such as asthmatics, may carry multiple genetic susceptibilities to disease onset and progression and thus qualify for special protection under the CAA. Scientific advances accelerated as a result of the ground-breaking Human Genome Project enable the quantification of genetic information that underlies such human variability in susceptibility and the cellular mechanisms of disease. In epidemiology and regulatory toxicology, genetic information can more clearly elucidate human susceptibility essential to risk assessment, such as in support of air quality regulation. In an effort to encourage the incorporation of genomic information in regulation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued an Interim Policy on Genomics. Additional research strategy and policy documents from the National Academy of Science, the U.S. EPA, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services further promote the expansion of asthma genetics research for human health risk assessment. Through a review of these government documents, we find opportunities for the inclusion of genetic information in the regulation of air pollutants. In addition, we identify sources of information in recent scientific research on asthma genetics relevant to regulatory standard setting.

A long-term monitoring of snowmelt regimes in a Japanese alpine area revealed that the onset of the snowmelt season has been accelerated during the last 17 years in early snowmelt sites but that such a trend has not been detected in late snowmelt sites. This indicates that the global warming effect on the snowmelt pattern may be site-specific. The flowering phenology of fellfield plants in an exposed wind-blown habitat was consistent between an unusually warm year (1998) and a normal year (2001). In contrast, the flowering occurrence of snowbed plants varied greatly between the years depending on the snowmelt time. There was a large number of flowering species in the fellfield community from mid- to late to late June and from mid- to late July. The flowering peak of an early-melt snowbed plant community was in the middle of the flowering season and that of a late-melt snowbed community was in the early flowering season. These habitat-specific phenological patterns were consistent between 1998 and 2001. The effects of the variation in flowering timing on seed-set success were evaluated for an entomophilous snowbed herb, Peucedanum multivittatum, along the snowmelt gradient during a 5-year period. When flowering occurred prior to early August, mean temperature during the flowering season positively influenced the seed set. When flowering occurred later than early August, however, the plants enjoyed high seed-set success irrespective of temperature conditions if frost damage was absent. These observations are probably explained based on the availability of pollinators, which depends not only on ambient temperature but also on seasonal progress. These results suggest that the effects of climate change on biological interaction may vary depending on the specific habitat in the alpine ecosystem in which diverse snowmelt patterns create complicated seasonality for plants within a very localized area. © The Society of Population Ecology and Springer-Verlag 2005.","Alpine plants; Flowering phenology; Global warming; Seed production; Snowmelt time","alpine environment; climate change; flowering; global change; phenology; seed set; snowmelt; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Peucedanum; Peucedanum multivittatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31544434554

Methods and results: Twenty-nine patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 32 ± 10%) were investigated with ce-CMR and PET/SPECT. For the assessment of global and regional functions, cine CMR was performed at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. For ce-CMR, the segmental extent of hyperenhancement (SEH) was quantitated, and for PET/SPECT, different viability categories were defined according to a validated quantitative protocol. Functional improvement was related to the SEH by ce-CMR, as well as to the viability categories by PET/SPECT. Sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of functional recovery at follow-up was 97 and 68% for ce-CMR and 87 and 76% for PET/SPECT. The positive predictive value was identical for both techniques (73%). However, ce-CMR achieved a higher negative predictive value (93 vs. 77%, respectively), indicating that ce-CMR may be superior to PET/SPECT for the identification of segments unlikely to recover function after revascularization. Both methods had a similar yield in the prediction of global functional improvement. Conclusion: ce-CMR is comparable with a PET/SPECT imaging protocol for the prediction of regional and global functional improvement after revascularization. However, ce-CMR may be superior to nuclear imaging for the identification of segments that are unlikely to recover function at follow-up. © The European Society of Cardiology 2006.

The Kyoto Protocol addresses both the release and uptake of carbon. Canada is developing a National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System in support of its international obligations to report greenhouse gas sources and sinks. This system employs forest-inventory data, growth and yield information, and statistics on natural disturbances, management actions and land-use change to estimate forest carbon stocks, changes in carbon stocks, and emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. A key component of the system is the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS). The model is undergoing extensive revisions to enable analyses at four spatial scales (national, provincial, forest management unit and stand) and in annual time steps. The model and the supporting databases can be used to assess carbon-stock changes between 1990 and the present, and to predict future carbon-stock changes based on scenarios of future disturbance rates and management actions. © Springer 2006.","Accounting; Carbon budget model; CBM-CFS; Greenhouse gas emissions; Kyoto Protocol; Monitoring; Natural disturbances; NFCMARS; Reporting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645213821

These uncertainties are partly method related, i.e. until now only two C sources in released CO2 could be identified. We used a novel approach separating three carbon (C) sources in CO2 efflux from soil. The approach is based on combination of different substances originated from C3 or C4 plants in different treatments and identical transformation of substances like C3 sugar (from sugar beet) and C4 sugar (from sugar cane). We investigated the influence of the addition of two substances having different microbial utilizability, i.e. slurry and sugar on the SOM or/and slurry decomposition in two grassland soils with different levels of Corg (2.3 vs. 5.1% C). Application of slurry to the soil slightly accelerated the SOM decomposition. Addition of sugar lead to changes of SOM and slurry decomposition clearly characterized by two phases: immediately after sugar addition, the microorganisms switched from the decomposition of hardly utilizable SOM to the decomposition of easily utilizable sugar. This first phase was very short (2-3 days), hence was frequently missed in other experiments. The second phase showed a slightly increased slurry and SOM decomposition (compared to the soil without sugar). The separation of three sources in CO2 efflux from grassland soils allowed us to conclude that the C will be utilized according to its utilizability: sugar&gt;slurry&gt; SOM. Additionally, decomposition of more inert C (here SOM) during the period of intensive sugar decomposition was strongly reduced (negative priming effect). We conclude that, priming effects involve a chain of mechanisms: (i) preferential substrate utilization, (ii) activation of microbial biomass by easily utilizable substrate (iii) subsequent increased utilization of following substrates according to their utilizability, and (iv) decline to initial state. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that mean SO42- concentrations in precipitation declined by 37-43% between 1985 and 2002, while NO3- concentrations decreased by 1-32%, and NH 4+ concentrations exhibited declining concentrations at some sites and increasing concentrations at others. The change in SO 42- concentrations is in broad agreement with estimated reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions. Changes in NO3- concentrations appear to be less closely related to variations in emissions of oxides of nitrogen and exhibit a stronger dependence on weekly precipitation volume. Up to one quarter of the variability in log-transformed weekly NO 3- concentrations in precipitation is explicable by variations in precipitation volume. Trends in annual average log-transformed SO42- concentrations exhibit only a relatively small influence of variability in weekly precipitation amount but at each of the sites considered the variance explanation of annual average log-transformed SO 42- by sampling year was increased by removing the influence of precipitation volume. Annual mean log-transformed ion concentrations detrended for precipitation volume (by week) and emission changes (by year) exhibit positive correlations at all sites, indicating that the residual variability of SO42-, NO3- and NH4- may have a common source which is postulated to be linked to synoptic scale variability and air mass trajectories. © Springer 2006.","Midwestern USA; Precipitation chemistry; Temporal trends; Wet deposition","Ammonia; Composition; Concentration (process); Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Precipitation (chemical); Sulfate minerals; Trajectories; Midwestern USA; Precipitation chemistry; Temporal trends; Wet deposition; Air pollution; ammonia; nitrate; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; Air pollution; Ammonia; Composition; Concentration (process); Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Precipitation (chemical); Sulfate minerals; Trajectories; chemical composition; precipitation (climatology); spatial variation; temporal variation; wet deposition; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; article; chemical composition; precipitation; river ecosystem; seasonal variation; time; topography; United States; wet deposition; North America; Ohio River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645506133

The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear. Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations. Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2)mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors. Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95% CI, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 μg/m3) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95). Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations.

Methods: This was a 3-year retrospective study. All patients presenting with CO poisoning by burning charcoal from August 1999 to December 2002 were recruited. The demographic data, initial vital signs, blood results, treatment regimens and outcomes were collected. Association between clinical outcomes and parameters were calculated. Results: The study identified 148 patients (mean age 34.7 years) suffering from CO poisoning by burning charcoal. One hundred and forty-six cases (98.6%) were suicidal. Twenty-five patients (16.9%) were unconscious (GCS ≤ 8) on arrival. The mean initial carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level was 21.0%. The mortality rate was 5.4%. Fifteen cases (10.1%) required intensive care. Twelve cases (8.1%) had neurological complications and five (3.4%) suffered from delayed neurological sequelae. Initial blood results showing hyperkalemia and acidosis were associated with likelihood of unconsciousness on arrival (p = 0.007, p = 0.019 respectively). Hyperkalemia and unconsciousness on arrival were associated with longer hospital stay (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively) as well as likelihood of systemic complication (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively). There was no relationship between co-ingestion, age, initial COHb level, initial systolic and diastolic blood pressure with consciousness level on arrival (p = 0.188, p = 0.846, p = 0.264, p = 0.224, p = 0.755 respectively).

First, we review the general mechanisms through which the EU ETS influences size, timing and cashflows of an investment. Next, we discuss the projected changes in Finnish power producers' investment environment and examine the financial impacts due to the EU ETS on a case investment decision, a hypothetical condensing power plant (250 MWe). The standard discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is extended to take into account the value of two real options: the option to wait and the option to alter operating scale. In a quantitative investment appraisal, the impact of emissions trading not only depends on the expected level of allowance prices, but also on their volatility and correlation with electricity and fuel prices. The case study shows that the uncertainty regarding the allocation of emission allowances is critical in a quantitative investment appraisal of fossil fuel-fired power plants. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The lack of phenological observations can nevertheless be filled by herbarium specimens as long as some correction procedures are applied to take into account the different climatic conditions associated with sampling locations. In this study, we propose a new herbarium-based method for reconstructing the flowering dates of plant species that have been collected across large areas. Coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara L.) specimens from southern Quebec were used to test the method. Flowering dates for coltsfoot herbarium specimens were adjusted according to the date of disappearance of snow cover in the region where they were collected and compared using a reference point (the date of earliest snowmelt). In southern Quebec, coltsfoot blooms earlier at present (15-31 d) than during the first part of the 20th century. This phenomenon is likely associated with the climate warming trends recorded in this region in the last century, especially during the last three decades when the month of April became warmer, thereby favoring very early-flowering cases. The earlier flowering of coltsfoot is, however, only noticeable in large urban areas (Montreal, Quebec City), suggesting a strong urban heat island effect on the flowering of this plant. Herbarium specimens are useful phenological indicators; however, the databases should be carefully examined prior to analysis to detect biases or trends associated with sampling locations.","Asteraceae; Climate change; Flowering times; Herbarium specimens; Phenology; Quebec; Tussilago farfara; Urban climate","climate change; flowering; herbarium; methodology; phenology; Asteraceae; Tussilago; Tussilago farfara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645546031

However, it has been identified as the second most common volatile organic contaminant of urban aquifers in the United States. Methyl tertbutyl ether has also been blended into two types of gasoline sold in Mexico by the state oil company (Petróleos Mexicanos) but is currently not monitored in groundwater. Early research on MTBE determined that it is unable to sorb to soils and sediments. The objective of this study is to determine if fine-grained materials with high organic matter (0.25-15.3%) have the potential for sorption of MTBE. The experiment consisted of sorption isotherms of loess from DeKalb, Illinois, and lacustrine sediments from Chalco, Mexico. Experiments were performed with various concentrations of MTBE and benzene (10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μg/L) at 25°C and 10°C. Methyl tert-butyl ether showed a retardation factor (R) as high as 1.856 ± 0.0130 for lacustrine sediments and 1.095 ± 0.0010 for loess at 25°C. Benzene showed retardation factors as high as 1.996 ± 0.0150 in lacustrine sediments and 1.775 ± 0.0050 in loess at 25°C. These results showed that sorption, and therefore, the retardation of MTBE in groundwater, is possible in fine-grained materials especially with high organic matter. This research increases the understanding of the fate and transport of MTBE and improves the knowledge to implement the optimal remediation method for sites contaminated by MTBE. Copyright ©2006.

A modified dust emission flux scheme and an advanced nonlocal diffusion scheme for accurately determining the atmospheric eddy diffusivity in the atmospheric boundary layer were implemented to improve the chemical transport model. We specifically examined and analyzed dust storms that occurred in China and northern Africa. Four scenarios representing the global transport of dust from dust storms originating in the Loess region and the Gobi, Takla Makan, and Sahara deserts, respectively, were simulated. The results of each scenario were then compared with those resulting from all major dust source regions on earth, to identify which deserts have a major impact on dust transport and its deposition in Japan. The dust from the Sahara desert, most from the western part that was found in this study, reached Japan in 9-10 days, while Gobi and Loess region dust took 2 to 3 days, and 4 days for Takla Makan dust. The model-calculated monthly total deposition of dust mass from all major dust source regions was compared with comprehensive measurements of total deposition collected at sampling stations distributed over Japan, and good agreement was generally found. From these analyses, it was also indicated that dust emitted from other deserts, including the Turkestan, Iranian, and Arabian, could have a significant impact on dust deposition on Japan. © Springer 2006.","Asian dust; Atmospheric transport; Dust depositions; Dust storms; Global model simulation; Sahara dust","Atmospheric spectra; Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Mathematical models; Sampling; Asian dust; Atmospheric transport; Dust deposition; Dust storms; Global model simulations; Sahara dust; Dust; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; dust storm; particulate matter; accuracy; article; Asia; atmospheric deposition; calculation; chemical model; China; desert; diffusion; dust; Japan; North Africa; sampling; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29844443123

Apart from positive effects in both reducing emissions and increasing the sequestration of greenhouse gases, the production of bio-char and its application to soil will deliver immediate benefits through improved soil fertility and increased crop production. Conversion of biomass C to bio-char C leads to sequestration of about 50% of the initial C compared to the low amounts retained after burning (3%) and biological decomposition (&lt; 10-20% after 5-10 years), therefore yielding more stable soil C than burning or direct land application of biomass. This efficiency of C conversion of biomass to bio-char is highly dependent on the type of feedstock, but is not significantly affected by the pyrolysis temperature (within 350-500°C common for pyrolysis). Existing slash-and-burn systems cause significant degradation of soil and release of greenhouse gases and opportunies may exist to enhance this system by conversion to slash-and-char systems. Our global analysis revealed that up to 12% of the total anthropogenic C emissions by land use change (0.21 Pg C) can be off-set annually in soil, if slash-and-burn is replaced by slash-and-char. Agricultural and forestry wastes such as forest residues, mill residues, field crop residues, or urban wastes add a conservatively estimated 0.16 Pg C yr-1. Biofuel production using modern biomass can produce a bio-char by-product through pyrolysis which results in 30.6 kg C sequestration for each GJ of energy produced. Using published projections of the use of renewable fuels in the year 2100, bio-char sequestration could amount to 5.5-9.5 Pg C yr-1 if this demand for energy was met through pyrolysis, which would exceed current emissions from fossil fuels (5.4 Pg C yr-1). Bio-char soil management systems can deliver tradable C emissions reduction, and C sequestered is easily accountable, and verifiable. © Springer 2006.","Black carbon; Carbon sequestration; Charcoal; Emissions trading; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas emissions; Soils; Terra preta de indio","biomass; black carbon; carbon sequestration; charcoal; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; pyrolysis; soil fertility; soil management; terrestrial ecosystem",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745727778

Besides providing public goods, GHG reduction offers farmers new alternatives for income generation. This is especially interesting in marginal agricultural areas, e.g., in less-favoured areas (LFA) of the European Union (EU), where significant GHG reduction potential coincides with low productivity in the production of agricultural commodities. In this study, the effects of peatland cultivation restrictions were evaluated, where the objective was to decrease GHG fluxes deriving from agricultural production. The regional role of peatlands in GHG reduction and agricultural production is also evaluated. Ceasing the agricultural use of peatlands altogether could decrease Finnish agricultural sector carbon effluents by up to 10% according to a dynamic regional sector model of the Finnish agriculture (DREMFIA). Accompanying decreases in national and even in regional agricultural incomes do not appear drastic, but locally, in some municipalities and on individual farms they may be devastating. In an alternative scenario, where perennial grass production is allowed to continue and only cultivation of annual crops is forbidden, the (negative) income effects are very low. The most notable result is that significant GHG reductions can be reached with little decrease in national agricultural incomes. The two forms of restrictions were tested in two alternative agricultural policy settings: Agenda 2000 and the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform agreed in Luxembourg on 26th June 2003. These two agricultural policy alternatives are connected with both of the aforementioned climate policy alternatives and resulting scenarios are evaluated in the simulation. The simulation provides the second main result, which says that it is not so much the climate policy which determines aggregate agricultural production and income, but rather it is the general agricultural policy framework setting the stage. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Two contrasting populations of P. przewalskii were used in our study, which were from the wet and dry climate regions in western China, respectively. The results showed that there were significant differences in responses to three different watering regimes in both populations tested; drought not only significantly affected dry mass accumulation and partitioning but also significantly decreased chlorophyll pigment contents and accumulated free proline and total amino acids. On the other hand, drought also significantly increased the levels of abscisic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide radical as secondary messengers to induce the entire set of antioxidative systems including the increase of reduced ascorbic acid (ASA) content and the activities of superoxide dismutase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase (GR).

The temperature-programmed reduction of the starting Fe2O3 form by H2 is accelerated by rhodium, with the extent of oxygen removal at 450 °C corresponding to Fe3O4 formation. The corresponding reduction by CO proceeds further, in agreement with bulk thermodynamic expectations. However, rhodium has no effect on the oxygen removal rate, although it leads to substantially increased carbon deposition. The behavior with respect to reoxidation of reduced catalysts is somewhat similar. Rhodium greatly enhances H2 release during reoxidation by water, presumably by recombining hydrogen atoms transferred from oxide to metal by reverse spillover. The rate of H2 evolution from the Rh/Fe-Cr system at 280 °C is greater than that from Fe-Cr at 380 °C. Reoxidation by CO 2 is not promoted by Rh and is much slower than that by H 2O for the Rh-containing catalyst. Likewise, reoxidation by H 2O/CO2 mixtures results in a much higher yield of H 2 relative to CO for the promoted catalyst compared with the unpromoted one. The extent to which catalysts previously equilibrated in WGS feeds at 350 °C can then be reduced in pulses of CO or H2 depends on the composition of the WGS feed. Fe-Cr catalysts do not reduce in H 2 after exposure to H2O/CO (2:1) or a reformate (H 2O/CO/H2/CO2) feed. Hydrogen reduction is possible with Rh/Fe-Cr after exposure to H2O/CO but not after exposure to reformate, for which thermodynamic considerations suggest that the working oxidation state may be lower. The greater reducing power of CO leads to continuing reduction after treatment with both prior feeds. Overall, it is concluded that of the two steps that may restrict the rate of the WGS reaction over iron-chromium oxide catalysts (reduction by CO and H2 generation through reoxidation by water), rhodium acts primarily by accelerating the second. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, the presence of glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs) and the accumulation of nitrous oxide (N2O) can severely compromise the advantages of this process. In this study, these two issues were investigated using a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor performing SNDPR over a 5-month period. The reactor was highly enriched in polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) and GAOs representing around 70% of the total microbial community. PAOs were the dominant population at all times and their abundance increased, while GAOs population decreased over the study period. Anoxic batch tests demonstrated that GAOs rather than denitrifying PAOs were responsible for denitrification. N 2O accumulated from denitrification and more than half of the nitrogen supplied in a reactor cycle was released into the atmosphere as N 2O. After mixing SNDPR sludge with other denitrifying sludge, N 2O present in the bulk liquid was reduced immediately if external carbon was added. We therefore suggest that the N2O accumulation observed in the SNDPR reactor is an artefact of the low microbial diversity facilitated by the use of synthetic wastewater with only a single carbon source. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Three sets of model climate parameters are used to explore the robustness of the results and for traceability to earlier work. The model versions have climate sensitivity of 2.8-3.3°C and predict atmospheric CO2 close to present observations. Six idealized total fossil fuel CO2 emissions scenarios are used to explore a range of 1,100-15,000 GtC total emissions and the effect of rate of emissions. Atmospheric CO2 approaches equilibrium in year 3000 at 420-5,660 ppmv, giving 1.5-12.5°C global warming. The ocean is a robust carbon sink of up to 6.5 GtC year-1. Under ""business as usual"", the land becomes a carbon source around year 2100 which peaks at up to 2.5 GtC year-1. Soil carbon is lost globally, boreal vegetation generally increases, whilst under extreme forcing, dieback of some tropical and sub-tropical vegetation occurs. Average ocean surface pH drops by up to 1.15 units. A Greenland ice sheet melt threshold of 2.6°C local warming is only briefly exceeded if total emissions are limited to 1,100 GtC, whilst 15,000 GtC emissions cause complete Greenland melt by year 3000, contributing 7 m to sea level rise. Total sea-level rise, including thermal expansion, is 0.4-10 m in year 3000 and ongoing.

To determine current resuscitation practices of neonatologists in the United States. METHODS. A 15-question survey was developed and mailed to neonatal directors in May 2004. RESULTS. Of the total of 797 surveys mailed, 84 were returned undeliverable or unanswered and 450 were returned completed (63% response rate). Respondents were mainly (70%) from level III NICUs. Most programs resuscitate newborns in the delivery room (83%), rather than in a separate room. The number and background of individuals attending deliveries vary greatly, with 31% of programs having &lt;3 individuals attending deliveries. Flow-inflating bags are most commonly used (51%), followed by self-inflating bags (40%) and T-piece resuscitators (14%). Pulse oximeters are used during resuscitation by 52% of programs, and 23% of respondents indicated that there was a useful signal within 1 minute after application. Blenders are available for 42% of programs, of which 77% use pure oxygen for the initial resuscitation and 68% use oximeters to alter the fraction of inspired oxygen. Thirty-two percent of programs use carbon dioxide detectors to confirm intubation, 48% routinely and 43% when there is difficulty confirming intubation. Preterm infants are wrapped with plastic wrap to prevent heat loss in 29% of programs, of which 77% dry the infant before wrap application. A majority of programs (76%) attempt to provide continuous positive airway pressure or positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during resuscitation, most commonly with a flow-inflating bag (58%), followed by a self-inflating bag with PEEP valve (19%) and T-piece resuscitator (16%). A level of 5 cm H2O is used by 55% of programs. CONCLUSIONS. Substantial variations exist in neonatal resuscitation practices, some of which are not addressed in standard guidelines. Future guidelines should include recommendations regarding the use of blenders, oximeters, continuous positive airway pressure/PEEP, and plastic wrap during resuscitation.

Although these components (such as valves, pumps, compressors, flanges, etc.) represent <1% of the total component count, they are the major contributor to overall mass emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Optical imaging technologies allow greater efficiencies in simultaneously monitoring large numbers of process piping components. Therefore, locating very high leakers can be done more frequently at reasonable costs and quicker repair of these very high leakers will result in lower overall emissions. This new approach to leak detection and repair (LDAR), called ""Smart-LDAR,"" will result in better emissions control when compared with current U.S. federal and state work practices. Under Smart LDAR, plants will have the flexibility to implement inspection and maintenance procedures that are based on combinations of leak definitions for repair, monitoring frequencies, and components included.

Concerns about potential negative effects of large-scale biomass production and export, like deforestation or the competition between food and biomass production, have led to the demand for sustainability criteria and certification systems that can control biomass trade. Because neither such criteria and indicator sets nor certification systems for sustainable biomass trade are yet available, the objective of this study is to generate information that can help to develop them. For these purposes, existing certification systems, sets of sustainability criteria or guidelines on environmental or social sound management of resources are analyzed with the purpose to learn about the requirements, contents and organizational set ups of a certification system for sustainable biomass trade. First, an inventory of existing systems was made; second, their structures were analyzed. Key finding from the analysis of internationally applied certification systems was that they are generally led by an international panel that represents all countries and stakeholders involved in the biomass production and trade activities. In third and fourth steps different approaches to formulate standards were described and a list of more than 100 social, economic, ecological and general criteria for sustainable biomass trade was extracted from the reviewed systems. Fifth, methods to formulate indicators, that make sustainability criteria measurable, and verifiers that are used to control the performance of indicators are described. It is recommended to further develop the criteria and indicator (C&I) sets for sustainable biomass trade by involvement of the relevant stakeholders (e.g. biomass producer and consumer) and the analysis of local conditions (e.g. local production potentials and limits, and preferences of local people). © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that while the highest fractal levels can undergo significant microlensing magnification, when these light curves are superimposed to create an emission-line profile, the resultant emission-line profile remains relatively constant for physical models of the BLR.

After 3 weeks there was a 73-84% loss of A5, A6 and A7 tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive (ir) neurones along with 56-60% loss of C1 and C2 phenyl ethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT)-ir neurones.Over the 3 weeks, breathing frequency decreased significantly during air and 3 or 7% CO2 breathing in both wakefulness and non-REM (NREM) sleep. The rats spent significantly less time awake and more time in NREM sleep. REM sleep time was unaffected. The ventilatory response to 7% CO2 was reduced significantly in wakefulness at 7,14 and 21 days (-28%) and in NREM sleep at 14 and 21 days (-26%).Breathing variability increased in REM sleep but not in wakefulness or NREM sleep.We conclude that CA neurones (1) promote wakefulness, (2) participate in central respiratory chemoreception, (3) stimulate breathing frequency, and (4) minimize breathing variability in REM sleep. © 2006 The Authors.

The results showed that the Mo species were well dispersed on the internal and external surface of the zeolite ZSM-5, while the framework of ZSM-5 was retained. One part of Mo species inside the channels of ZSM-5 can be described as [Mo5O12]6+ units in the Mo/ZSM-5 with 8 wt% MoO3 loading. The [Mo5O 12]6+ units are situated at the cross-point of the zigzag channel and the straight channel. They interacted with the framework of ZSM-5, and decreased the Brönsted acid sites remarkably. There was about 0.47 [Mo5O12]6+ unit in every cell of the ZSM-5 on an average. The other part of Mo species is distributed on the external surface of the ZSM-5 crystals, and can be described as crystallites of molybdenum oxides. The distribution of Mo species on HZSM-5 increased the Lewis acid sites in the catalysts.

A major ancillary benefit of GHG mitigation is reduced local air toxins, which improves health. The purpose of the study is not to determine whether ancillary benefits of GHG mitigation can or cannot justify GHG mitigation. Rather, we discuss how an important benefit of addressing GHG emission - the local health effects - should and can be incorporated using the approaches put forth. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is used for simulating a carbon tax policy. A health effects submodel takes the local air emissions output from the CGE model and assesses the implications for ambient air concentration, health, and labor supply. Labor and medical expenditure changes are fed back into the economy. Applying this approach to Thailand, when health feedback is included, we find that: (1) negative impact on GDP under a carbon tax drops by 45%, and (2) welfare improves for households and cleaner producers. © 2006 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Such a technique does not explicitly utilize multichannel correlations of radiometer data, which are key information in separating RFI from natural radiations. Furthermore, it is not optimal for radiometer data observed over ocean regions due to the inherent large natural variability of spectral difference over ocean. In this paper, we first analyzed multivariate WindSat and Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) data in terms of channel correlation, information content, and principal components of WindSat and SMMR data. Then two methods based on channel correlation were developed for RFI detection over land and ocean. Over land, we extended the spectral difference technique using principal component analysis (PCA) of RFI indices, which integrates statistics of target emission/scattering characteristics (through RFI indices) and multivariate correlation of radiometer data into a single statistical framework of PCA. Over ocean, channel regression of X-band can account for nearly all of the natural variations in the WindSat data. Therefore, we use a channel regression-based model difference technique to directly predict RFI-free brightness temperature, and therefore RFI intensity. Although model difference technique is most desirable, it is more difficult to apply over land due to heterogeneity of land surfaces. Both methods improve our knowledge of RFI signatures in terms of channel correlations and explore potential RFI mitigation, and thus provide risk reductions for future satellite passive microwave missions such as the NPOESS Conical Scanning Microwave Imager/Sounder. The new RFI algorithms are effective in detecting RFI in the C- and X-band Windsat radiometer channels over land and ocean. © 2006 IEEE.","Microwave remote sensing; Radio-frequency interference (RFI); WindSat","Channel correlation; Microwave remote sensing; Radio-frequency interference; WindSat; Algorithms; Microwaves; Principal component analysis; Radiometers; Statistics; Remote sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33244456204

Through splitting the fuel injection process, two possible benefits were found: 1) High density liquid droplets piling up at the leading edge of the spray can be circumvented, subsequently the reduction of the spray tip penetration; 2) The quantity of ""over lean"" (φv&lt;0.7, φv: equivalence ratio of vapor) mixture in the spray can be significantly reduced. These are believed to contribute to the reduction of the engine-out smoke and HC emissions. In order to clarify the mechanism behind the effect of the split injection, the spray-induced ambient air motion was investigated by the LIF-PIV technique. The strong ambient air entrainment into the tail region of the spray and a counter-vortex structure were found in both the single and split injections. In the case of the single injection, the spray develops in extending its length, subsequently a larger volume results and thus it is diluted to ""over lean"" by the ambient air entrainment. In contrast, in the case of split injection, the second spray is injected into the tail region of the first spray and its evaporation is promoted by the ambient air motion induced by the first spray. Hence the replenishment of the liquid fuel into the leading edge of the first spray is reduced. As a consequence, the high density liquid droplets piling up at the leading edge is avoided. Furthermore, a more compact spray results so that the ambient air motion plays a positive role on evaporating the spray into ""more combustible"" (0.7 &lt; φv &lt; 1.3). This is especially true in the tail region of the spray and the region where the counter-vortex motion is occurring.

In general, the strongest features in our spectra are recombination lines of H I, He I, and (in some cases) He II. Half the sample shows emission from vibrationally excited H 2. Some of the observed PNs (e.g., M 1-13) display H 2 line ratios characteristic of shocked, thermalized gas, while others (e.g., BD +30 3639) have ratios intermediate between pure radiative (UV) and shock excitation, consistent with either a combination of the mechanisms or UV illumination of dense material. Our spectra of J900 and M 1-13 confirm that published narrowband images trace the H 2 emission, and we find that the H 2 emission in SwSt 1 has a larger spatial extent than previously reported. In IC 5117, SwSt 1, and NGC 40 we detect the [Kr III] 2.199 μm line identified by Dinerstein in 2001, with strengths indicating that krypton is enriched relative to the solar abundance, most markedly so in NGC 40. We also detect several lines from the 3G term of [Fe II] in Vy 2-2, SwSt 1, and marginally inCn 3-l. The [Kr II] and [Fe III] lines fall near in wavelength to H 2 transitions, which are often used as diagnostics for UV excitation because they arise from higher vibrationally excited levels (v = 2, 3). For moderate spectral resolving power, R ≤ 600, these lines may be blended with, or even mistaken for, the corresponding H 2 lines, leading to misinterpretation of the H 2 emission. The strength of both the Kr and Fe nebular emission lines can be enhanced by special circumstances, Kr because of nucleosynthetic self-enrichment in the progenitor star and Fe due to inefficient initial dust condensation or partial destruction of the dust after formation, causing a larger fraction of the elemental iron to reside in the gas phase. © 2006.

This protocol has been approved by 15 member countries and will be enforced in May 2005. Pollutants emitted from ships, such as nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, sulfur oxides, etc. will be regulated by this convention through ship inspections and issuance of certificates. Ships belonging to maritime countries such as Taiwan, which sail around the world and berth in commercial ports, must obey this convention. This study has investigated possible strategies, which may be adopted by maritime countries to conform to this IMO convention in order to reduce the air pollution from ships. A sea-going ship must prepare EIAPP and IAPP certificates for inspection by port-state-control officials, when the ship is anchored at a maritime port. These port-state-control officials may also require the continuous detection and sampling of a ship's emissions, while it is berthed at the port. Legislative support is necessary for successful implementation of these safeguards. It is suggested, therefore, that the administration of both navigational and environmental protection, in maritime countries, cooperate in the revision of relevant federal laws, to implement the provisions of the MARPOL 73/78/97 convention; in this way, the air pollution from ships can be effectively controlled. Installation of advanced detection equipment can effectively detect any ships' violations of air pollution regulations. The Harbor Affairs' Bureau should also establish a database of air pollution inspections for ships berthed within their harbor, requiring that ships' equipment comply with the requirements of the MARPOL convention, for the reduction of air pollution. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The emulsification method is one of the potentially effective techniques to reduce emission pollution from diesel engines. Ultrasonic waves are a kind of sound waves with a frequency larger than 20 kHz, and they cannot be detected by the human ear. The phenomena of cavitation and hot spots produced by the rather violent action of ultrasonic waves can cause rapid chemical and physical reactions. This allows immiscible liquids to be well stirred with each other by means of ultrasonics. An ultrasonically vibrating machine that provides ultrasonic waves of a 40-kHz frequency was employed to prepare two- and three- phase emulsions in this experimental study. The fuel properties and the emulsion stability of the diesel emulsions were measured and analyzed. Experimental results show that the ultrasonic emulsification method successfully prepared two- and three-phase emulsions with tiny dispersed-phase droplets that are very evenly distributed in the outer oil or water phase. The ultrasonic processing time, quantity and HLB of the emulsifying agent were noted to have determinative influences on the formation of the emulsion and the fuel properties. A longer ultrasonic processing time caused less un-emulsified diesel fuel, smaller sizes and a more even distribution of dispersed-phase droplets in the outer oil phase and larger emulsion viscosity. However, a longer ultrasonic processing time also produced a larger temperature rise in the emulsion, leading to the deterioration of the emulsion stability. The O/W emulsion was found to have the lowest percentage of separation and thus the highest emulsion stability among the O/W/O, O/W and W/O emulsions. In addition, in comparison with the W/O emulsion, the O/W emulsion was shown to have a smaller size and a more even distribution of the dispersed-phase droplets. It also had a lesser rise in emulsion temperature when the ultrasonic processing time increased. The control of the ultrasonic processing time is important to successfully prepare the three-phase O/W/O emulsion. Too long a vibration time at the second-stage of emulsification is shown to cause the dispersed-phase pellets to contract and congregate with the inner-phase droplets. The three-phase emulsion structure then finally disappears and transforms into a two-phase emulsion. The addition of 2% by volume of the emulsifier mixture of Span80 and Tween80 with a HLB = 8, as suggested by this study for the preparation of stable two- and three-phase emulsions, were observed to have the lowest percentage of separation of the W/O and O/W/O emulsions. For preparing a stable O/W emulsion, the proportion of the emulsifier could be as low as 1.5% by volume. The percentage of separation of the O/W/O emulsion was lower and less influenced by the change in emulsion temperature than was the W/O emulsion with the same water content.

Biomass is also available in Sweden owing to its large forest-covered areas. Incineration of biomass in an environmentally friendly manner is one of the key issues in Swedish policy for sustainable development. Hence there is ongoing research on the effects of biomass burning on the air quality in Swedish cities. The relative contributions of anthropogenic sources to pollution in the urban environment are usually difficult to evaluate owing to the complexity of the ambient aerosol. In order to investigate the contribution of biomass incineration to air quality, energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis was performed on aerosol particles sampled in the centre of the small city of Växjö. PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 fractions were sampled with the special aim of determining the contribution of biomass burning to particulate air pollution. In order to identify typical indicators for biomass burning, principle component analysis was performed on data on elemental contents and black carbon. Analysis suggests that the K/Zn ratio will be useful as an indicator for biomass incineration. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344455498

The initial aim of the study is to establish the impact of closure approximations for the scalar dissipation rate upon the relationship between turbulence fluctuations and predicted turbulent burning velocities. The cases considered feature stoichiometric methane-air flames with the chemical source term extracted from a detailed chemistry simulation of the corresponding unstrained laminar flame. The transported PDF approach is subsequently combined with a systematically reduced C/H/O mechanism featuring 142 reactions and 14 solved and 15 steady-state species and applied to piloted premixed stoichiometric methane-air flames investigated experimentally by Chen et al. [Combust. Flame 107 (1996) 223-226]. The cases considered here feature Re = 24, 200 (flame F3) and 52,500 (flame F1) and Damköhler numbers approaching unity. The effects of variations in the time-scale ratio ( 2 {less-than or slanted equal to} Cφ{symbol} {less-than or slanted equal to} 8) and heat losses to the burner were investigated, along with the impact of an extended algebraic relationship for the scalar dissipation rate that accounts for small-scale properties. Comparisons with experimental data show that the modified Curl's model and the extended scalar dissipation-rate closure produce turbulent burning velocities in close agreement with measurements. The study further indicates that a closure at the joint scalar level combined with comprehensive chemistry has the potential to reproduce the detailed chemical structure of premixed turbulent flames. The importance of boundary conditions and comprehensive scalar statistics, including the scalar dissipation rate, is also emphasized by the study. © 2006 The Combustion Institute.","Premixed turbulent combustion; Scalar dissipation rates; Systematically reduced chemistry; Transported PDF methods","Approximation theory; Combustion; Computer simulation; Enthalpy; Laminar flow; Mathematical models; Reynolds number; Stoichiometry; Turbulence; Turbulent flow; Premixed turbulent combustion; Scalar dissipation rates; Systematically reduced chemistry; Transported PDF methods; Flame research; methane; Approximation theory; Combustion; Computer simulation; Enthalpy; Flame research; Laminar flow; Mathematical models; Reynolds number; Stoichiometry; Turbulence; Turbulent flow; air; article; chemistry; combustion; heat; mathematical model; priority journal; simulation; stoichiometry; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646171529

This paper uses an areal measure of traffic density as a surrogate index of exposure to vehicular traffic. We present associations between county-level traffic density (annual vehicle-km traveled km -2), ambient air quality, and mortality in a cohort of about 70,000 male US veterans (the Washington University-EPRI Veterans Cohort) who were enrolled in 1976 and followed through 2001. Traffic density is seen to be a significant and robust predictor of survival in this cohort, more so than ambient air quality, with the possible exception of ozone. Stronger effects of traffic density are seen in the counties that have ambient air quality monitoring data, which also tend to have higher levels of traffic density. These proportional-hazard modeling results indicate only modest changes in traffic-related mortality risks over time, from 1976-2001, despite the decline in regulated tailpipe emissions per vehicle since the mid-1970s. This suggests that other environmental effects may be involved, such as particles from brake, tire, and road wear, traffic noise, psychological stress, and spatial gradients in socioeconomic status. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The main anthropogenic contributors to this increase are fossil fuel combustion, land use conversion, and soil cultivation. It is clear that overcoming the challenge of global climate change will require a combination of approaches, including increased energy efficiency, energy conservation, alternative energy sources, and carbon (C) capture and sequestration. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is sponsoring the development of new technologies that can provide energy and promote economic prosperity while reducing GHG emissions. One option that can contribute to achieving this goal is the capture and sequestration of CO 2 in geologic formations. An alternative approach is C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystsems through natural processes. Enhancing such natural pools (known as natural sequestration) can make a significant contribution to CO2 management strategies with the potential to sequester about 290 Tg C/y in U.S. soils. In addition to soils, there is also a large potential for C sequestration in above and belowground biomass in forest ecosystems. A major area of interest to DOE's fossil energy program is reclaimed mined lands, of which there may be 0.63 × 106 ha in the U.S. These areas are essentially devoid of soil C; therefore, they provide an excellent opportunity to sequester C in both soils and vegetation. Measurement of C in these ecosystems requires the development of new technology and protocols that are accurate and economically viable. Field demonstrations are needed to accurately determine C sequestration potential and to demonstrate the ecological and aesthetic benefits in improved soil and water quality, increased biodiversity, and restored ecosystems. The DOE's research program in natural sequestration highlights fundamental and applied studies, such as the development of measurement, monitoring, and verification technologies and protocols and field tests aimed at developing techniques for maximizing the productivity of hitherto infertile soils and degraded ecosystems. © Springer 2006.",,"Climate change; Earth atmosphere; Ecosystems; Energy conservation; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Reaction kinetics; Vegetation; Anthropogenic contributors; Geologic formations; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Terrestrial sequestration; Carbon dioxide; biodiversity; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; land use change; soil quality; water quality; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646806477

Although there is no universal agreement on the cause, it is generally understood that global warming is occurring, and many climate scientists believe that this is due, in part, to the buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This is evident from the finding presented in the National Academy of Science Report to the President on Climate Change which stated ""Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, ..."". In the United States, emissions of CO2 originate mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and other industrial processes. Roughly one third of U.S. anthropogenic CO 2 emissions come from power plants. Reduction of CO2 emissions through sequestration of carbon either in geologic formations or in terrestrial ecosystems can be part of the solution to the problem of global warming. However, a number of steps must be accomplished before sequestration can become a reality. Cost effective capture and separation technology must be developed, tested, and demonstrated; a database of potential sequestration sites must be established; and techniques must be developed to measure, monitor, and verify the sequestered CO2. Geographical differences in fossil fuel use, the industries present, and potential sequestration sinks across the United States dictate the use of a regional approach to address the sequestration of CO2. To accommodate these differences, the DOE has created a nationwide network of seven Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) to help determine and implement the carbon sequestration technologies, infrastructure, and regulations most appropriate to promote CO2 sequestration in different regions of the nation. These partnerships currently represent 40 states, three Indian Nations, four Canadian Provinces, and over 200 organizations, including academic institutions, research institutions, coal companies, utilities, equipment manufacturers, forestry and agricultural representatives, state and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and national laboratories. These partnerships are dedicated to developing the necessary infrastructure and validating the carbon sequestration technologies that have emerged from DOE's core R&amp;D and other programs to mitigate emissions of CO2, a potent greenhouse gas. The partnerships provide a critical link to DOE's plans for FutureGen, a highly efficient and technologically sophisticated coal-fired power plant that will produce both hydrogen and electricity with near-zero emissions. Though limited to the situation in the U.S., the paper describes for the international scientific community the approach being taken by the U.S. to prepare for carbon sequestration, should that become necessary. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To better understand the impacts of cropland management practices, we used the NCAR CAM3 general circulation model coupled to a slab-ocean model to simulate climate change under extreme scenarios of irrigation, tillage, and crop productivity. Compared to a control scenario, increases in irrigation and leaf area index and reductions in tillage all have a physical cooling effect by causing increases in planetary albedo. The cooling is most pronounced for irrigation, with simulated local cooling up to ∼8°C and global land surface cooling of 1.3°C. Increases in soil albedo through reduced tillage are found to have a global cooling effect (∼0.2°C) comparable to the biogeochemical cooling from reported carbon sequestration potentials. By identifying the impacts of extreme scenarios at local and global scales, this study effectively shows the importance of considering different aspects of crop management in the development of climate models, analysis of observed climate trends, and design of policy intended to mitigate climate change.

However, due to computational efforts calculating three-dimensional turbulent flames, there is the necessity for simplified models in order to simulate the combustion reactions and the NOx formation, respectively. Hitherto, models describing thermal NO and prompt NO formation, respectively, were applied in a post-processing step. Beforehand, the flow field including combustion has been determined in the three-dimensional geometry. However, in the former work, it was shown that prompt NO formation is of minor significance. For temperatures higher than 1600 °C, thermal NO formation is dominating. At lower temperatures, the N 2O/NO and NNH route have significant contribution. Though, the widely applied prompt NO model captures the observed trends acceptable, it lacks of physical bases. Besides low temperature NO formation is more related to N 2O/NO and NNH route, it assumes the prompt NO formation to be proportional to the fuel concentration. The detailed reaction mechanism show NO formation more related to fuel oxidation rate, i.e. radical concentration. Thus, in this work, a new simplified model combining thermal NO formation, N 2O/NO, and NNH route is proposed. It applies steady-state approximation for the intermediate species, i.e. N, N2O, NNH, and NH. In this way, their concentrations can be obtained by four algebraic equations and rate of NO formation can be calculated without any model parameter, solely based on reaction kinetics. Moreover, the concentrations of O2, N2, H2, and H2O as well as the radicals O, H, OH, and HO2 have to be known from combustion calculations. The model was evaluated against the predictions of a detailed reaction mechanism, showing good agreement in a wide range of conditions. Neglecting prompt NO formation affects predicted NO emissions only under very fuel rich conditions. Under these circumstances, total NO formation is low, anyway. Thus, the performance of the presented model is not influenced by the lack of prompt NO formation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We combined micro-spatial differentiations within small catchments (micro-scale), altitudinal changes of an oceanic and a continental mountain system (meso-scale), and oceanic-continental alteration between these two mountain regions (macro-scale). We analysed differences between micro-climatic site conditions at the spatial scales given above. It was assumed that different superior meteorological phenomena along altitudinal and regional gradients find their expression in local temperature conditions. It turned out that micro-topographic site conditions were superiorly determining thermal changes along altitudinal and oceanic-continental broad-scale gradients. The adiabatic lapse rate did not show high correlations with local temperature gradients. Regional climatic differences between the oceanic western and the continental eastern mountains were significant by means of local and altitudinal temperature gradients. We used isopleth-diagrams of temperature differences and corresponding histograms between each, site-site, low alpine-middle alpine, and oceanic mountain-continental mountain couples to quantify these over-laying phenomena.

Previously, this same protein was also identified by its robust induction by phase II inducers in HT29 cells. In HepG2 cells, both AKR1C2 and AKR1C1 (97% sequence homology) were induced by phase II inducers but not the highly related AKR1C3 and AKR1C4 family members (84% sequence homology). We now report the initial characterization of the proximal promoter of AKR1C2 in HepG2 cell line and the identification of a potent enhancer-like element responsive to phase II inducers located approximately 5.5 kilobases upstream from the transcription start site. DNA sequence analysis of this enhancer element revealed that it contained a consensus antioxidant response element (ARE), which was confirmed by mutation analysis. Treatment with phase II inducers leads to increased accumulation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor (NRF) 2 in the nucleus, which was associated with increased binding to this ARE as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Transient transfection with Nrf2 increased the transcriptional activity of the ARE of AKR1C2 comparable with that observed with phase II inducers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis also confirmed increased NRF2 binding to the ARE after induction by a phase II inducer. The AKR1C1 promoter also harbored this same ARE element in a highly homologous region, which was also bound by NRF2 in a ChiP analysis. No induction of the ARE of AKR1C2 was detected in Nrf2 -/- fibroblasts. The regulation of AKR1C2 by this distal ARE suggests that AKR1C2 detoxifies products of reactive oxidant injury, which has important implications for both hormone and xenobiotic metabolism.

These technologies must be able to capture nutrients, kill pathogens, and reduce emissions of ammonia and nuisance odors. To meet these needs, a full-scale wastewater treatment plant was installed as a demonstration project on one of three 4360-pig (Sus scrofa) production units in a finishing farm in Duplin County, North Carolina. Once the treatment plant was operational, flow of raw manure into the unit's corresponding lagoon was discontinued and tlie lagoon was used to store treated wastewater. Water quality was monitored in the converted lagoon and in the two conventional lagoons. A gas chromatographic method was developed to measure concentration of five selected malodorous compounds (phenol, p-cresol, 4-ethylphenol, mdole, and skatole) in liquid lagoon samples. Dramatic improvements in the water quality parameters TKN, NH3-N, sonds, COD, and BOD hi the converted waste lagoon paralleled reductions in malodorous compounds. Nine months after conversion, identified malodorous compounds in liquid extractions averaged 6.6 and 38.8 ng mL-1 in water from the converted lagoon and the conventional lagoons, respectively. The reduction was particularly marked for p-cresol, 4-ethylphenel, and skatole, all of which make important contributions to swine waste odors due to their characteristic odors and low detection thresholds. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Ammonia; Chromatographic analysis; Extraction; Liquid chromatography; Odors; Pathology; Threshold elements; Wastewater treatment; Liquid extractions; Malodorous compounds; Treatment plants; Treatment technologies; Environmental impact; 4 ethylphenol; indole; para cresol; phenol; skatole; article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; extraction; gas chromatography; lagoon; manure; nitrogen concentration; nutrient; odor; solid; swine; total kjeldahl nitrogen; United States; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; water quality; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Odors; Swine; Volatilization; Water Pollutants; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31844438505

Rock property measurements demonstrate that the Bowser Lake Group and underlying Hazelton Group have an identical mean density limiting the capacity of gravity to differentiate the two. The finding is important for the design of effective hydrocarbon exploration programs in the area. However, significant contrasts in magnetic susceptibility between basin fill and underlying basement rocks facilitate the use of magnetic data to map first-order variations in the thickness of fill in each of the basins. Results show a relatively uniform fill thickness in Sustut Basin, on the order of 2.5-3 km. In contrast, considerable topography on the basement interface beneath Bowser Basin is identified with variations in the thickness of overlying sedimentary rocks ranging from less than 2 km to more than 6 km. Resolving this topography is an important advance in understanding the hydrocarbon potential of the basin. A large (approximately 50 km × 60 km × 3.5 km) buried intrusion beneath the northeast part of Bowser Basin can account for an observed magnetic anomaly and explain the high coalification gradients and localized high maturation levels of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Neither of the latter can be adequately explained by the estimated burial depths. At least one regionally extensive (>150 km long) fault that cuts basement of Bowser Basin is delineated. The fault may have facilitated migration of hydrocarbons sourced in the basement into Bowser Basin. Correlation of magnetic data with published isotopic age dates indicates that Maitland volcanism spanned five polarity reversals during a 0.8 Ma period, and it facilitates a reduction in the errors associated with published isotopic ages.",,"Correlation methods; Hydrocarbons; Isotopes; Magnetic susceptibility; Surface topography; Coalification; Rock property measurements; Sedimentary fill; Sedimentary rocks; basement rock; fill; potential field; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rock property; sedimentary rock; Bowser Basin; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Sustut Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745428437

The econometric estimates are used to simulate landowner responses to sequestration policies. We treat key commodity prices as endogenous and predict carbon storage changes with a carbon sink model.

These emission inventories include (i) emission estimates for the year 1995 from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), (ii) regional emission inventory used in the Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) program with emission estimates for the year 2000 and (iii) national emission inventory used in the Chinese Ozone Research Programme (CORP) with emission estimates for the year 1995. Model simulations were performed for a summertime period and the results under clear-sky conditions were selected for comparison with GOME data of the years 1996 and 2000. The model generally reproduces high tropospheric NO2 column densities in polluted areas of China that have been observed by GOME. However, the model simulations do not agree with the GOME measurements in a quantitative sense for some regions. Region-to-region comparisons show that with all the emission inventories the model underestimates the tropospheric NO2 column density in remote and rural areas of China. It is found that TRACE-P underestimates the tropospheric NO2 column density in all the regions with respect to the GOME measurements (by more than 50%). CORP and EDGAR appear to behave well for the model simulations in the North of China (within 15% deviations), but poorer for the model simulations in other regions (within 30-80% deviations). Linear regressions were performed with the NO2 column densities available from GOME, Y, and the model, X, of each grid cell in selected regions. For all the region of China, comparison statistics are Y=0.361×X+0.935 with r2=0.360 and bias=-41% for EDGAR, Y=1.124×X+0.920 with r2=0.472 and bias=-67% for TRACE-P, and Y=0.431×X+0.835 with r2=0.509 and bias=-31% for CORP. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface-nitrogen removal processes show different angular distributions, i.e. normally directed N2 desorption takes place in process (i) 2N(a) → N2(g). Highly inclined N2 desorption towards the [0 0 1] direction is induced in process (ii) N2O(a) → N 2(g) + O(a). N2O or NH3 desorption follows the cosine distribution characterizing the desorption after the thermalization in process (iii) N2O(a) → N2O(g) or (iv) N(a) + 3H(a) → NH3(a) → NH3(g). Thus, a combination of the angular and velocity distributions provides the analysis of most of surface-nitrogen removal processes in the course of catalyzed NO reduction. At temperatures below 600 K, processes (ii) and (iii) dominate and process (iv) is enhanced at H2 pressures higher than NO. Process (i) contributes significantly above 600 K.

We critically test that hypothesis in this paper and a companion paper (part 2). Using data collected at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, we explore an analysis methodology that results in the characterization of the physical state of the atmospheric profile at time resolutions of 5 min and vertical resolutions of 90 m. The description includes thermodynamics and water vapor profile information derived by merging radiosonde soundings with ground-based data and continues through specification of the cloud layer occurrence and microphysical and radiative properties derived from retrieval algorithms and parameterizations. The description of the atmospheric physical state includes a calculation of the clear and cloudy sky solar and infrared flux profiles. Validation of the methodology is provided by comparing the calculated fluxes with top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface flux measurements and by comparing the total column optical depths to independently derived estimates. We find over a 1-year period of comparison in overcast uniform skies that the calculations are strongly correlated to measurements with biases in the flux quantities at the surface and TOA of less than 6% and median fractional errors ranging from 12% to as low as 2%. In the optical depth comparison for uniform overcast skies during the year 2000 where the optical depth varies over more than 3 orders of magnitude we find a mean positive bias of less than 1% and a 0.6 correlation coefficient. In addition to a case study where we examine the cloud radiative effects at the TOA, surface and atmosphere by a middle latitude cyclone, we examine the cloud top pressure and optical depth retrievals of ISCCP and LBTM over a period of 1 year. Using overcast periods from the year 2000, we find that the satellite algorithms tend to compare well with data overall but there is a tendency to bias cloud tops info the middle troposphere and underestimate optical depth in high optical depth events.

Large, evolved PNe may trace the latest stages of PN evolution, where material from the AGB wind is returned to the interstellar medium. However, the low surface brightness and spatially extended emission of large PNe have made accurate measurements of line fluxes difficult with traditional long-slit spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, distinguishing these nebulae from H II regions, supernova remnants, or interstellar gas ionized by a hot, evolved stellar core can be challenging. Here, we report on an ongoing survey of large Galactic PNe (r > 5′) with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM), a Fabry-Perot spectrograph designed to detect faint diffuse optical emission lines with high sensitivity and spectral resolution.

In the ground state, depending on the nature of solvents, HN32 exists as closed (intramolecular hydrogen bonded), open and intermolecular hydrogen bonded conformers. The closed conformer present in the hydrocarbon as well as other solvents, on excitation, undergoes intramolecular proton transfer across the pre-existing intramolecular hydrogen bond to form the keto tautomer having red shifted emission. In case of hydroxylic polar solvents, an additional low energy fluorescence band is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonded solvated complex of HN32 molecule.

The reactive transport model includes a solid-solution formulation to enable the use of the 234U/ 238U activity ratios in the solid and fluid as a tracer of mineral dissolution. The isotopic profiles are combined with profiles of the major element chemistry (especially alkalinity and calcium) to determine whether the apparent discrepancy between laboratory and field dissolution rates still exists when a mechanistic reactive transport model is used to interpret rates in a natural system. A suite of reactions, including sulfate reduction and methane production, anaerobic methane oxidation, CaCO3 precipitation, dissolution of plagioclase, and precipitation of secondary clay minerals, along with diffusive transport and fluid and solid burial, control the pore fluid chemistry in Site 984 sediments. The surface area of plagioclase in intimate contact with the pore fluid is estimated to be 6.9 m2/g based on both grain geometry and on the depletion of 234U/238U in the sediment via α-recoil loss. Various rate laws for plagioclase dissolution are considered in the modeling, including those based on (1) a linear transition state theory (TST) model, (2) a nonlinear dependence on the undersaturation of the pore water with respect to plagioclase, and (3) the effect of inhibition by dissolved aluminum. The major element and isotopic methods predict similar dissolution rate constants if additional lowering of the pore water 234U/238U activity ratio is attributed to isotopic exchange via recrystallization of marine calcite, which makes up about 10-20% of the Site 984 sediment. The calculated dissolution rate for plagioclase corresponds to a rate constant that is about 102 to 105 times smaller than the laboratory-measured value, with the value depending primarily on the deviation from equilibrium. The reactive transport simulations demonstrate that the degree of undersaturation of the pore fluid with respect to plagioclase depends strongly on the rate of authigenic clay precipitation and the solubility of the clay minerals. The observed discrepancy is greatest for the linear TST model (105), less substantial with the Al-inhibition formulation (103), and decreases further if the clay minerals precipitate more slowly or as highly soluble precursor minerals (102). However, even several orders of magnitude variation in either the clay solubility or clay precipitation rates cannot completely account for the entire discrepancy while still matching pore water aluminum and silica data, indicating that the mineral dissolution rate conundrum must be attributed in large part to the gradual loss of reactive sites on silicate surfaces with time. The results imply that methods of mineral surface characterization that provide direct measurements of the bulk surface reactivity are necessary to accurately predict natural dissolution rates. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

All are abundant in the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) except for cattail, but this species has a potential to proliferate in this environment. Senescent plant samples were immersed into ultrapure water with and without addition of 0.1% NaN3 (w/ and w/o NaN3, respectively) for 36 days. We replaced the water every 3 days. The amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), sugars, and phenols in the leachates were analyzed. The contribution of plant leachates to the ultrafiltered high molecular weight fraction of DOM (&gt;1 kDa; UDOM) in natural waters in the FCE was also investigated. UDOM in plant leachates was obtained by tangential flow ultrafiltration and its carbon and phenolic compound compositions were analyzed using solid state 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (13C CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy and thermochemolysis in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH thermochemolysis), respectively. The maximum yield of DOC leached from plants over the 36-day incubations ranged from 13.0 to 55.2 g C kg-1 dry weight. This amount was lower in w/o NaN3 treatments (more DOC was consumed by microbes than produced) except for periphyton. During the first 2 weeks of the 5 week incubation period, 60-85% of the total amount of DOC was leached, and exponential decay models fit the leaching rates except for periphyton w/o NaN3. Leached DOC (w/ NaN3) contained different concentrations of sugars and phenols depending on the plant types (1.09-7.22 and 0.38-12.4 g C kg-1 dry weight, respectively), and those biomolecules comprised 8-34% and 4-28% of the total DOC, respectively. This result shows that polyphenols that readily leach from senescent plants can be an important source of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) in wetland environments. The O-alkyl C was found to be the major C form (55±9%) of UDOM in plant leachates as determined by 13C CPMAS NMR. The relative abundance of alkyl C and carbonyl C was consistently lower in plant-leached UDOM than that in natural water UDOM in the FCE, which suggests that these constituents increase in relative abundance during diagenetic processing. TMAH thermochemolysis analysis revealed that the phenolic composition was different among the UDOM leached from different plants, and was expected to serve as a source indicator of UDOM in natural water. Polyphenols are, however, very reactive and photosensitive in aquatic environments, and thus may loose their plant-specific molecular characteristics shortly. Our study suggests that variations in vegetative cover across a wetland landscape will affect the quantity and quality of DOM leached into the water, and such differences in DOM characteristics may affect other biogeochemical processes. © Springer 2006.","13C CPMAS NMR; DOC composition; Everglades; Leaching; TMAH thermochemolysis; Vegetation; Wetland ecosystems","aquatic plant; dissolved organic carbon; leachate; oligotrophic environment; wetland; Everglades; Florida [United States]; North America; United States; Cladium jamaicense; Eleocharis; Eleocharis cellulosa; Rhizophora mangle; Testudines; Thalassia; Thalassia testudinum; Typha; Typha domingensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745131044

In order to protect this cathode, electrochemical potentiostatic deposition, a cheap and low-temperature technique, was used to produce CoOOH coating. It is well known that the lithiated cobalt oxide (LiCoO2, stable from produced at 650 °C in molten carbonates) is significantly less soluble than nickel oxide. Potential-acidity diagrams of the cobalt-water system with the presence of a complexing agent, glycine, established from a new critical data set, allowed to predict the thermodynamic stability of CoOOH in a range of 25-80 °C. The deposition process was optimised on dense nickel substrates, analysing thoroughly the effect of the temperature, imposed potential, pH, electrolysis duration and the role of glycine. The structure and morphology of the thin layers prepared were characterised by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD measurements showed the presence of the characteristic CoOOH lines in varied experimental conditions. The CoOOH coatings were spontaneously transformed into LiCoO2 in the molten carbonate melt. Preliminary results, obtained from ex situ and in situ techniques, on their behaviour and stability in MCFC conditions are given here. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A reference (REF) scenario is constructed in which most automobiles are driven by internal combustion engines (ICE) fuelled by gasoline. In the first alternative scenario (ALT1), hybrid electric-ICE gasoline-fuelled cars are introduced in 2006. In the same year, ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) is introduced as a replacement for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) oxygenate for gasoline. In the second alternative scenario (ALT2), in addition to the changes introduced in ALT1, flex fuel ICE technology fuelled by E85 is introduced in 2008 and electric motor vehicles driven by direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) fuelled by E100 in 2013. A comparison between the reference and alternate scenarios shows that while the total number of vehicles is the same in each scenario, energy consumption decreases by 9% (ALT1) and 17% (ALT2), the total non-biogenic CO2 emissions drop by 15% (ALT1) and 34% (ALT2), CO2 mitigation cost is 140.14 $US1997/ton CO2 (ALT2), and ALT1 has savings and is considered a ""no regrets"" scenario. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The oil sludge was produced in a refinery sited in SE Spain The composting system designed, which involved open air piles turned periodically over a period of 3 months, proved to be inexpensive and reliable. The influence on hydrocarbon biodegradation of adding a bulking agent (wood shavings) and inoculation of the composting piles with pig slurry (a liquid organic fertiliser which adds nutrients and microbial biomass to the pile) was also studied. The most difficult part during the composting process was maintaining a suitable level of humidity in the piles. The most effective treatment was the one in which the bulking agent was added, where the initial hydrocarbon content was reduced by 60% in 3 months, compared with the 32% reduction achieved without the bulking agent. The introduction of the organic fertiliser did not significantly improve the degree of hydrocarbon degradation (56% hydrocarbon degraded). The composting process undoubtedly led to the biodegradation of toxic compounds, as was demonstrated by ecotoxicity tests using luminescent bacteria and tests on plants in Petri dishes. © Springer 2006.","Bioremediation; Composting; Ecotoxicity; Oil sludge","Biomass; Bioremediation; Composting; Crude petroleum; Fertilizers; Toxicity; Ecotoxicity; Luminescent bacteria; Microbial biomass; Oil sludge; Sewage sludge; fertilizer; hydrocarbon; petroleum; Biomass; Bioremediation; Composting; Crude petroleum; Fertilizers; Sewage sludge; Toxicity; bioremediation; fertilizer; heavy oil; humidity; hydrocarbon; inoculation; semiarid region; toxic substance; aerobic metabolism; article; biotechnology; economics; industrial waste; metabolism; methodology; microbiology; physics; sewage; soil; toxicity testing; waste management; wood; Aerobiosis; Biotechnology; Fertilizers; Hydrocarbons; Industrial Waste; Petroleum; Physics; Sewage; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Toxicity Tests; Waste Management; Wood; Biomass; Composting; Crude Oil; Fertilizers; Sludge; Toxicity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646888202

Box model studies first pointed out that an increase in nutrient utilization in the high latitudes results in a strong decrease in the atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2). This early research led to two important ideas: high latitude regions are more important in determining atmospheric pCO2 than low latitudes, despite their much smaller area, and nutrient utilization and atmospheric pCO2 are tightly linked. Subsequent general circulation model simulations show that the Southern Ocean is the most important high latitude region in controlling pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 because it serves as a lid to a larger volume of the deep ocean. Other studies point out the crucial role of the Southern Ocean in the uptake and storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and in controlling global biological production. Here we probe the system to determine whether certain regions of the Southern Ocean are more critical than others for air-sea CO 2 balance and the biological export production, by increasing surface nutrient drawdown in an ocean general circulation model. We demonstrate that atmospheric CO2 and global biological export production are controlled by different regions of the Southern Ocean. The air-sea balance of carbon dioxide is controlled mainly by the biological pump and circulation in the Antarctic deep-water formation region, whereas global export production is controlled mainly by the biological pump and circulation in the Subantarctic intermediate and mode water formation region. The existence of this biogeochemical divide separating the Antarctic from the Subantarctic suggests that it may be possible for climate change or human intervention to modify one of these without greatly altering the other. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Atmospherics; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer simulation; Geochemistry; Partial pressure; Surface structure; Biogeochemical; Biological production; Surface nutrients; Oceanography; carbon dioxide; air-sea interaction; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; biogeochemical cycle; biological production; biological pump; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; nutrient cycling; nutrient use; research work; air; Antarctica; article; atmosphere; biogeochemical cycling; carbon cycle; carbon cycling; carbon dioxide tension; climate change; latitude; nutrient availability; nutrient concentration; nutrient cycle; nutrient cycling; ocean environment; priority journal; sea; simulation; southern ocean; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745553560

These hydrothermal systems are broadly coeval with magmatism, and also host numerous structurally controlled Fe oxide and Cu-Au deposits (ca 1.60 Ga, 1.55-1.50 Ga). Fluid-inclusion, stable-isotope, and geochemical data from Cu-Au deposits indicate that the ore-forming fluids were high-T (&gt;300-500°C), highly saline (&gt;26-70 wt% NaClequiv), typically CO2-bearing, and are mainly considered to be sourced by crystallising intrusions with contributions from other fluid sources and/or host rocks. Fe oxide and Cu-Au mineralisation in the district exhibit a range of interrelationships based upon the metal endowment, relative timing of Fe oxides and sulfides, and Cu:Au ratio. These interrelationships may be divided into four categories: (i) barren magnetite and/or hematite ironstones; (ii) Fe oxide-hosted Cu-Au mineralisation, where relatively Au-rich ore associated with pyrite and hematite overprints older magnetite-rich rocks; (iii) Fe oxide Cu-Au mineralisation, where both Fe oxides and Cu-Au mineralisation are cogenetically deposited; and (iv) Fe oxide-poor Cu-Au mineralisation, where relative Cu-rich mineralisation is associated with pyrrhotite and rare magnetite, and is hosted in relatively reduced rocks such as carbonaceous metasedimentary rocks. These categories reflect variations in fluid redox, fS, aFe, and temperature, as well as host-rock composition. The spectrum from Cu-rich to Au-rich mineralisation is a common phenomenon in Fe oxide-Cu-Au districts and predominantly reflects an increase in the redox of the ore-forming system. The apparent relationship between pH and metal solubility at different redox conditions suggests that Cu-Au mineralisation occurred as a result of decreasing fluid acidity by wall-rock reaction at the site of ore deposition, or potentially by mixing of fluids of different acidity. Fluid mixing provides an effective means to produce high-grade ore deposits via changing pH, cooling, and dilution in hydrothermal systems involving little wall-rock interaction. © Geological Society of Australia.","Fe oxide Cu-Au mineralisation; Hematite; Hydrothermal fluids; Ironstones; Magnetite; Na-Ca alteration; Proterozoic","copper; gold; metallogenesis; mineralization; Proterozoic; Australasia; Australia; Cloncurry; Mount Isa; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344478187

A complementary approach to examining species-specific associations is to assess associations between health outcomes and sources contributing to PM2.5. This approach could help target and regulate the sources that contribute most to adverse health effects. Various techniques have been developed to quantify source impacts on air quality, allowing examination of their health impacts. We compare two conceptually different approaches to source apportionment (SA): a receptor model and an emissions-based air-quality model. Daily source impacts for July 2001 and January 2002 at four sites in the southeastern US were calculated using CMB-LGO, an extended chemical mass balance receptor model incorporating the Lipschitz global optimizer, and EPA's Models-3 emissions-based air-quality modeling system (MM5-SMOKE-community multiscale air-quality (CMAQ)). The receptor model captured more of the temporal variation in source impacts at a specific receptor site compared to the emissions-based model. Driven by data at a single site, receptor models may have some significant shortcomings with respect to spatial representativeness (unless a reduced study area is used or data from multiple sites are available). SA results from emissions-based models, such as CMAQ, may be more spatially representative as they represent an average grid-cell value. Limitations in the ability to model daily fluctuations in emissions, however, lead to results being driven mainly by regional meteorological trends, likely underestimating the true daily variations in local source impacts. Using results from either approach in a health study would likely introduce an attenuation of the observed association, due to limited spatial representativeness in receptor modeling results and to limited temporal representativeness in emissions-based models results. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Grey to black and variegated lacustrine mudstones, laminites and carbonates of the Rudník member have a lateral extent of more than 400 km2. In the studied sections four facies associations were recognised: A) anoxic offshore, B) suboxic to oxic offshore, C) nearshore and mudflat, and D) slope deposits. In the northern part of the E-W elongated basin, anoxic to suboxic organic-rich offshore lacustrine facies dominate and form a succession up to 130 m thick. Fan-delta and turbidite facies occur locally along the faulted northern basin margin. The central part of the basin is occupied by anoxic to oxic offshore facies interfingering with nearshore carbonate and mudflat facies of the low-gradient lacustrine margin. In the central part of the basin, the thickness of the lacustrine deposits of the Rudník member reaches up to 60-70 m. In the southern part of the basin fluvial and alluvial plain facies dominate and alternate with minor lacustrine nearshore facies. The lateral facies distribution indicates that subsidence along the northern basin fault was the main mechanism generating the asymmetric infill geometry in the basin's half-graben setting. The δ18O values of primary and early diagenetic calcite range between - 11.0‰ and + 1.3‰ (V-PDB) and δ13C values between - 5.1‰ and + 3.7‰; most of the data fall within the range of freshwater limestones. Coarser-grained pure microspar laminae show more positive δ13C values in comparison to clayey organic-rich micrite laminae, and are interpreted as a record of bioinduced precipitation during seasonal eutrophication. The obtained δ13CTOC values range from - 29.0‰ to - 24.0‰, the total organic carbon (TOC) content from 0.26% to 23%. Maceral analysis and Rock-Eval pyrolysis indicate that most of the samples contain a mixture of aquatic and terrestrial organic matter, but two minor, distinctive groups of samples with algally-dominated and terrestrially-dominated organic matter composition, respectively, were also found. The study of vertical changes in boron content in the clay fraction of the lacustrine mudstones shows that high lake level stages were periods of lower salinity with the lowest boron contents (from 73 to 268 ppm), and periods of falling lake level were followed by significant increases in salinity with much higher boron values (293-603 ppm). Lake-level fluctuations of the Rudník lacustrine system, which are recorded by shallowing-up units of sedimentary facies within most of the sections throughout the basin, can also be traced within the monotonous black shale dominated sections, where no sedimentological evidence of these lake level changes exists. Good indicators for such changes seem to be the δ18O and δ13C values of primary calcite, δ13CTOC and HI.

Dispersal patterns can be affected by characteristics of the parent plant and by climatic or site characteristics, including community vegetation structure, but these factors have not been studied in the context of plant invasion processes. Cynara cardunculus (L.) is a polycarpic perennial thistle invasive in coastal grasslands in California that produces large numbers of wind-dispersed seeds. This study quantified and compared C. cardunculus dispersal patterns in an exotic grassland (vegetated site) and an agricultural field (non-vegetated site). Seed size variation in C. cardunculus was also quantified within inflorescences, between inflorescences, and between years of production, and compared across dispersal distances. Results indicate that dispersal distance increased dramatically from less than 20 m in the vegetated site to more than 40 m in the non-vegetated site. Plants producing fewer seeds produced heavier seeds and dispersal distance decreased over time, but seed size was not related to dispersal distance, which may serve to spread the risk to seeds or seedlings across the environment. C. cardunculus has great potential for dispersal in open areas such as agricultural fields or disturbed sites, but may be limited in highly structured natural communities. Management of C. cardunculus and other wind-dispersed plant invasions may be improved by prioritizing populations with open or disturbed areas downwind and minimizing the removal of vegetation during dispersal. © Springer 2006.","Artichoke thistle; Cynara cardunculus; Habitat; Plant invasion; Seed dispersal; Seed size; Seed weight; Thistle; Vegetation structure; Weed; Wind dispersal","biological invasion; community structure; field; grassland; invasive species; perennial plant; seed dispersal; California; North America; United States; Cirsium; Cynara cardunculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745658490

The UV-Vis spectra of 2 are not altered with change in solvent polarity indicating the absence of solvatochromism. However, the fluorescence spectra are progressively red shifted in more polar solvents on account of increasing charge transfer character of the excited state. In the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA), protonation of benzothiazole nitrogen results in the red shift of the absorption spectra. Contrary to expectation, the emission spectra suffers blue shift in the presence of TFAA. Presumably, the emission for the case 2+H+ occurs from higher vibrational energy levels which accounts for the blue shift. Unfortunately, selected alkali or alkaline earth metals ions examined for metal sensing applications have failed to induce significant perturbations either in the absorption or emission spectra. This may be attributed to poor electronic communication between the crown-bound metal ions and the benzothiazole fluorophore due to steric encumbrance between the ortho-substituted benzothiazole chromophore and the phenyl aza-crown moiety.","Aza-crown fluoroionophore; Intramolecular charge transfer; Metal-ion complexation; Optical spectral studies; Protonation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646456180

When this record is compared with numerous climate proxies, it appears that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) controls on wave climate and sediment flux have acted upon regional geomorphology at different sea levels to either accrete or erode the Holocene beaches of southern California. Tivela dates from the Santa Maria coast indicate that perennial sand beaches built by 9000 years ago in response to abundant riverine sediment contained by the natural groin at Point Sal, wave sheltering by the massive headland of Point Buchon, and Early Holocene El Niño events. On the western Santa Barbara coast, sand beaches were forming by 7000 years ago in response to high sand fluxes from the Santa Ynez Mountains to the many small littoral catchments, possibly aided by high local rates of uplift. Decline of these sand beach habitats 5000-4000 years ago coincides with increased El Niño-driven wave energy. In accord with slowing in sea-level rise ca. 6000 years ago, sand beaches were most widespread in the period 6000-5000 years ago on Estero Bay, the western Santa Barbara coast, and west of Point Dume. However, Tivela dates first appear 5000 years ago in the Oceanside and Silver Strand littoral cells of the San Diego region. This lag coincides with the Middle Holocene shift to a more variable climate and modern periodicity in El Niño events that increased sediment supply to the southern coast. The ontogeny of the littoral cells provides timelines for modeling coastal evolution with implications for sand beach ecology, prehistoric human coastal adaptations, and coastal planning for future climate change. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The existence of a school HIV/AIDS policy, a climate of equity and fairness, and good school-community relations were the school characteristics associated with teaching HIV/AIDS.

Divergences emerge also when dealing with the bonding topology given by each technique. For the methylalkalimetal tetramers, the ELF analysis shows that each methyl carbon atom interacts through a bond pair with each of the three hydrogen atoms belonging to the same methyl group and through an ionic bond with the triangular face of the tetrahedral metal cluster in front of which the methyl group is located. On the other hand, the AIM topological description escapes from the traditional bonding schemes, presenting hypervalent carbon and alkalimetal atoms.

Unlike earlier approaches aimed at exploring the tradability-technology linkage, we focus on climate-relevant ""carbon-saving"" technological change. This is achieved by incorporating endogenous investment in carbon productivity into the RICE-99 integrated assessment model of Nordhaus and Boyer (2000). Simulation analysis of various emission reduction scenarios with several restrictions on emissions trading reveals a pronounced dichotomy of effects across regions: Restrictions to trading raise the investments in carbon productivity in permit demanding regions while reducing them in permit supplying regions. In terms of per capita consumption, permit demanding regions lose and permit supplying regions gain from restrictions. In scenarios that involve ""hot air,"" restrictions to trade lower overall emissions, which results in reduced climate damage for most regions. Reduced damage, in turn, reduces the incentive to invest in carbon productivity. © Springer 2006.","Carbon-saving technological progress; Emissions trading; Flexibility mechanism; Induced technological change; Integrated assessment model","Carbon; Commerce; Pollution control; Carbon-saving technological progress; Emissions trading; Flexibility mechanism; Induced technological change; Integrated assessment model; Particulate emissions; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644758430

A model considering the dynamic state, the thiol mass balance, the effect of RSH dissociation, and the deviation from chemical equilibrium is developed and solved numerically. The assumption of chemical equilibrium between undissociated thiol and its ion (RS-) is valid at neutral pH, but at alkaline conditions, RS- → RSH is the rate controlling step, with k = 5 × 10-6 s-1 at 301 K and pH 11.7. The effectiveness of inert gas stripping is mainly governed by thiol's hydrophobic nature and its neutral/ionic form speciation. At pH values below 8.5, thiol concentration falls in an exponential form, whereas at pH values above 10.5, it tends toward a linear form. The mass balance model is extremely sensitive to uncertainty in γ∞, whereas k governs thiol emission rate out of the liquid system. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Alkalinity; Concentration (process); Inert gases; Nitrogen; pH effects; Solutions; Chemical equilibrium; Gas stripping; Mass balance; n-butyl mercaptan; Removal; Alkalinity; Concentration (process); Inert gases; Nitrogen; pH effects; Removal; Solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645002678

Active fluid seepage from these structures is indicated by chemosynthetic communities, authigenic carbonates and methane plumes in the water column. We estimate the methane output from the individual mud extrusions using two independent approaches. The first is based on the amount of CH 4 that becomes anaerobically oxidized in the sediment beneath areas covered by chemosynthetic communities, which ranges from 104 to 105 mol yr- 1. The remaining portion of CH4, which is released into the ocean, has been estimated to be 10 2-104 mol yr- 1 per mud extrusion. The second approach estimates the amount of CH4 discharging into the water column based on measurements of the near-bottom methane distribution and current velocities. This approach yields estimates between 104-10 5 mol yr-1. The discrepancy of the amount of CH 4 emitted into the bottom water derived from the two approaches hints to methane seepage that cannot be accounted for by faunal growth, e.g. focused fluid emission through channels in sediments and fractures in carbonates. Extrapolated over the 48 mud extrusions discovered off Costa Rica, we estimate a CH4 output of 20•106 mol yr- 1 from mud extrusions along this 350 km long section of the continental margin. These estimates of methane emissions at an erosional continental margin are considerably lower than those reported from mud extrusion at accretionary and passive margins. Almost half of the continental margins are described as non-accretionary. Assuming that the moderate emission of methane at the mud extrusions off Costa Rica are typical for this kind of setting, then global estimates of methane emissions from submarine mud extrusions, which are based on data of mud extrusions located at accretionary and passive continental margins, appear to be significantly too high. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Indium on protonated H-ZSM-5 showed a higher activity in dry conditions while indium on unprotonated ZSM-5 with a high loading of 7.3% prepared by ion exchange had a higher activity in the presence of 8% water. NO2 in feed promoted the methane oxidation and NOx reduction. In situ FTIR analysis revealed on In/ZSM-5 the presence of inhibiting compounds at lower temperatures and many carbonaceous surface compounds. In the reaction initiation conditions, the surface coverage of nitrogen containing carbonaceous compounds and any adsorbed species were low. It is proposed that the formation of NO2, partially oxidized methane surface derivatives and actual surface reductants containing NC or NH bondings are crucial in NO reduction. Intrazeolitic InO+ was proposed to be the active catalytic site in NO reduction. Free In 2O3, detected by XRD and XPS, has possibly a promoting effect on the reactions. A micro kinetic model, including the surface intermediates, was derived for an In/ZSM-5 catalyst by the NOCH 4O2 experiments where the reactant concentrations, space velocity and temperature were varied. The adsorbed H2NCO intermediate, formed in the reaction between NO2 and partially oxidized methane, was proposed to act as an actual NO reductant in the reaction mechanism and kinetic equations. The model was able to follow measured responses and predict the dynamic performance in NOCH4O2 reactions quantitatively in usual steady state lean conditions. Adsorbed oxygen and NO2 were simulated to exist with higher coverage on active sites in reaction conditions. Gas and adsorbed compounds were simulated as a function of reactor length in different unmeasured conditions, which simulations can be used as a tool in catalyst reactor design. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Designed to probe the inner ∼ 1 AU region of the circumstellar disks around the individual stellar components in these binary systems, this study increases the number of binaries with spatially resolved measurements at 10 μAm by a factor of ∼5. Combined with resolved near-infrared photometry and spectroscopic accretion diagnostics, we find that ∼ 10% of stars with a mid-infrared excess do not appear to be accreting. In contrast to an actively accreting disk system, these passive disks have significantly lower near-infrared colors that are, in most cases, consistent with photospheric emission, suggesting the presence of an inner disk hole. In addition, there appears to be a spectral type/mass dependence associated with the presence of a passive disk, with all passive disks occurring around M-type stars. The presence of a passive disk does not appear to be related to the fact that these objects are in visual binary systems; the passive disk systems span the entire range of binary separations present in the sample, and a similar fraction of passive disks is observed in a sample of single stars. The possibility that the passive disks are caused by the presence of an as yet undetected companion at a small separation (0.3-3 AU) is possible for any individual system; however, it cannot account for the spectral type dependence of the passive disk sample as a whole. We propose that these passive disks represent a subset of T Tauri stars that are undergoing significant disk evolution. The fraction of observed passive disks and the observed spectral type dependence can both be explained by models of disk evolution that include disk photoevaporation from the central star. © 2006.

For example, do plants associate with single fungi or multiple fungi simultaneously, and do the associations persist through a plant's lifetime or do plants support a succession of different fungi? We investigated these and other questions related to plant-fungus interactions in Goodyera pubescens, an evergreen terrestrial orchid of the eastern United States, that interacts with closely related fungi in the genus Tulasnella. Unlike the mycorrhizal associations of other plants, orchid-mycorrhizal associations only benefit the orchid, based on current evidence. Many terrestrial orchids have been found to associate with specific groups of fungi. This characteristic could potentially limit orchids to relatively narrow ranges of environmental conditions and may be a contributing factor in the decline of many orchids in the face of changing environmental conditions. We found that G. pubescens protocorms (developing embryos prior to leaf production) and adults associated with only one fungal individual at a time. The orchid-fungus association persists for years, but during a drought period that was associated with the death of many plants, surviving plants were able to switch to new fungal individuals. These results suggest that G. pubescens interacts with the same fungal partner during periods of modest environmental variation but is able to switch to a different fungal partner. We hypothesize that the ability to switch fungi allows G. pubescens to survive more extreme environmental perturbations. However, laboratory experiments suggest that switching fungi has potential costs, as it increases the risk of mortality, especially for smaller individuals. Our findings indicate that it is unlikely that switching fungi is a common way to improve tolerance of less severe environmental fluctuations and disturbances. These findings may have important implications for plant responses to severe climatic events or to more gradual environmental changes such as global warming. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Environmental change; Goodyera; Mycorrhiza; Orchid; Orchidaceae; Tulasnella","fungal DNA; environmental conditions; fungus; host-pathogen interaction; mortality; plant; symbiosis; article; classification; fungus; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; Orchidaceae; physiology; symbiosis; DNA, Fungal; Fungi; Orchidaceae; Symbiosis; North America; United States; Fungi; Goodyera; Goodyera pubescens; Orchidaceae; Tulasnella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646123084

To determine the safety of the use of Durasphere in patients receiving warfarin anticoagulation. Methods. This case series included patients requiring long-term anticoagulation who also had intrinsic sphincteric deficiency or mixed urinary incontinence, and bladder outlets without hypermobility. All patients, with the exception of the 1 man in the study, were treated under local anesthesia with periurethral carbon bead injections, while receiving therapeutic doses of warfarin. Results. Between 1999 and 2004, 20 such patients received carbon bead injections, on 36 different occasions, during therapeutic warfarin administration. Two complications related to the anticoagulation were encountered, one minor complication of a small periurethral hematoma and the other more severe, with a patient developing urinary retention and intravesical hemorrhage. Conclusions. In most cases, the injection of carbon beads under local anesthesia in patients receiving therapeutic warfarin anticoagulation can be safely performed without reversal of the anticoagulation. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",,"carbon; warfarin; anus sphincter disorder; article; bleeding; hematoma; human; implant; incontinence; local anesthesia; long term care; priority journal; safety; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anticoagulants; Biocompatible Materials; Female; Glucans; Humans; Injections; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Urinary Incontinence; Warfarin; Zirconium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30344446685

The surveys were undertaken in 1996 and 1998 to constrain how much CO2 might be reaching the ERZ after degassing beneath the summit caldera and whether the Puhimau thermal area might be a significant contributor to the overall CO2 budget of Kīlauea. The area was revisited in 2001 to determine the effects of surface disturbance on efflux values by the collar emplacement technique utilized in the earlier surveys. Utilizing a cutoff value of 50 g m-2 d-1 for the surrounding forest background efflux, the CO2 emission rates for the anomaly at Puhimau thermal area were 27 t d-1 in 1996 and 17 t d-1 in 1998. Water vapor was removed before analysis in all cases in order to obtain CO2 values on a dry air basis and mitigate the effect of water vapor dilution on the measurements. It is clear that Puhimau thermal area is not a significant contributor to Kīlauea's CO2 output and that most of Kīlauea's CO2 (8500 t d-1) is degassed at the summit, leaving only magma with its remaining stored volatiles, such as SO2, for injection down the ERZ. Because of the low CO2 emission rate and the presence of a shallow water table in the upper ERZ that effectively scrubs SO2 and other acid gases, Puhimau thermal area currently does not appear to be generally well suited for observing temporal changes in degassing at Kīlauea. © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 2006.","Carbon dioxide; Efflux; Kīlauea; Puhimau; Soil; Volcanic gases","carbon dioxide; degassing; dilution; emission; rift zone; volcanic gas; volcano; water vapor; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kilauea; Mauna Loa; North America; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646340925

Later, carefully controlled volunteer studies did not confirm the existence of the specific key symptoms, although one study of self-reported sensitive (SRS) people did suggest that a threshold at about 11-15% MTBE in gasoline may exist for SRSs in total symptom scores. Neurobehavioral and psychophysiological studies on volunteers, including SRSs, found no adverse responses associated with MTBE at likely exposure levels. MTBE is well and rapidly absorbed following oral and inhalation exposures. Cmax values for MTBE are achieved almost immediately after oral dosing and within 2 h of continuous inhalation. It is rapidly eliminated, either by exhalation as unchanged MTBE or by urinary excretion of its less volatile metabolites. Metabolism is more rapid humans than in rats, for both MTBE and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), its more persistent primary metabolite. The other primary metabolite, formaldehyde, is detoxified at a rate very much greater than its formation from MTBE. MTBE has no specific effects on reproduction or development, or on genetic material. Neurological effects were observed only at very high concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies of MTBE, TBA, and methanol (included as an endogenous precursor of formaldehyde, without the presence of TBA), some increases in tumor incidence have been observed, but consistency of outcome was lacking and even some degree of replication was observed in only three cases, none of which had human relevance: α2u-globulin nephropathy-related renal tubule cell adenoma in male rats; Leydig-cell adenoma in male rats, but not in mice, which provide the better model of the human disease; and B-cell-derived lymphoma/leukemia of doubtful pathogenesis that arose mainly in lungs of orally dosed female rats. In addition, hepatocellular adenomas were significantly higher in female CD-1 mice and thyroid follicular-cell adenomas were increased in female B6C3F1 mice treated with TBA, but these results lack any independent confirmation, which would have been possible from a number of other studies.

Historically, Britain has been fortunate in having abundant coal, oil and gas. At an EU level, biomass is seen as an important element of energy, environment and agriculture/forestry policy. In the European context, biomass is taken to include agricultural and industrial wastes in addition to forest woodfuel, and it is regarded as a potential source of heat, fuels and electricity. In the UK, energy policy as a whole is based on four considerations - environment, energy reliability and security, affordability for the poorest in society and competitive pricing for businesses, industries and households. Within UK policy, the dominant driver for greater use of biomass as a renewable source of energy is climate change mitigation; energy security is an emerging driver; all other potential benefits of biomass as a renewable resource are of limited significance. At the moment, the UK focus is narrower than in Europe. National targets are set only for electricity generation. Furthermore, expansion of energy crops, which are defined in the major regulations as 'crops planted since 1989 and grown primarily for the purpose of being used as a fuel' and, therefore, do not include material from extant forests, is seen as the main way to ensure energy security and minimise carbon expended to transport the raw material to the point of end use. Nevertheless, woody biomass from forests, sawmills, urban areas and transportation corridors is already available in vastly greater quantities than 'energy crops'. At a regional and local scale, global environmental issues are of lower relative importance and a much wider range of potential benefits tend to be taken into consideration. For example, the economic benefits of woodfuel heating in areas without connections to the gas grid have been an important consideration in the steady increase in woodheat developments. In other areas where there is a less obvious financial driver, rural development is a powerful determinant of support for woodfuel projects. Crown Copyright © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study reports the impact of year-round SM status on trace gas fluxes in three semiarid vegetation zones, mesquite (30 g organic C kg-1 soil), open/ forb (6 g organic C kg-1 soil), and sacaton (18 g organic C kg-1 soil) from July 2002-September 2003 in southeastern Arizona. Carbon dioxide and N2O emissions were highly dependent on available SM and T. During the heavy rains of the 2002 monsoon (238 mm total rainfall), large differences in soil C content did not correlate with variations in CO 2 production, as efflux averaged 235.6 ± 39.5 mg CO 2 m-2 h-1 over all sites. In 2003, limited monsoon rain (95 mm total rainfall) reduced CO2 emissions by 19% (mesquite), 40% (open), and 30% (sacaton), compared with 2002. Nitrous oxide emissions averaged 21.1 ± 13.4 (mesquite), 2.1 ± 4.4 (open), and 3.9 ± 5.2 μg N2O m-2 h-1 (sacaton) during the 2002 monsoon. Limited monsoon 2003 rainfall reduced N2O emissions by 47% in the mesquite, but N2O production increased in the open (55%) and sacaton (5%) sites. Following a dry winter and spring 2002 (15 mm total rainfall), premonsoon CH4 consumption at all sites was close to zero, but following monsoon moisture input, the CH4 sink averaged 26.1 ± 6.3 μg CH4 m-2 h-1 through April 2003. Laboratory incubations showed potentials for CH4 oxidation from 0 to 45 cm, suggesting that as the soil surface dried, CH 4 oxidation activity shifted downward in the sandy soils. Predicted climate change shifts in annual precipitation from one dominated by summer monsoon rainfall to one with higher winter precipitation may reduce soil CO 2 and N2O emissions while promoting CH4 oxidation rates in semiarid riparian soils of the Southwest, potentially acting as a negative feedback for future global warming. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Precipitation (meteorology); Soils; Atmospheric exchanges; Gas flux; Semiarid regions; Trace gases; Moisture control; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Methane; Moisture control; Nitrogen oxides; Precipitation (meteorology); Soils; carbon dioxide; gas exchange; methane; nitrous oxide; riparian zone; seasonal variation; soil moisture; soil temperature; trace gas; Arizona; North America; United States; Prosopis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645060470

Both mono- and bifunctionalized spermine compounds were studied. The photophysical properties of each compound were studied by using time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence and absorption spectroscopies. The fluorescence decay of the mononaphthalimides was adequately fit to a single exponential decay, and in all cases, the lifetime (2.4 ns) was independent of the imide substitutent. In the case of the bisnaphthalimide, emission from both the monomer and ground-state dimer forms was observed. The fluorescence quantum yield of the monomer (0.03) was significantly smaller than that of the mononaphthalimides (0.27). The dimer emission was red-shifted relative to that of the monomer. The singlet-state lifetime of the dimer was found to be 20 ns. In all cases, only absorption from the triplet excited state was observed, indicating no evidence of a naphthalimide radical anion from dimer excitation. The ground-state interactions of the naphthalimides with four nucleotides were investigated. Nucleotide selectivity was evaluated by determining their individual binding constants (Keq). The association constants were measured by using absorption, time-resolved fluorescence, and combined time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence. The equilibrium binding constant was largest for association of the spermine-substituted mononaphthalimide with adenosine monophosphate (Keq = 550 M-1) or guanosine monophosphate (Keq = 440 M-1). The dimer form of the disubstituted spermine also showed binding constants in excess of 200 M -1 with the purine nucleotides.

Findings indicate that valued gains from reduced air pollution mortality can average 3% of a city's GDP. Moreover, the growing auto fleet may generate a ten-fold increase in NO2 -based mortality costs and offset other, ongoing cleanup efforts in many Chinese cities.

Software tools that bring together data on pollutant sources, their respective contributions to atmospheric concentrations and human exposure, together with information on potential technological and other measures that may be used to reduce concentrations and their economic costs, can be used to identify cost-effective strategies for improving air quality, and hence aid policy development. The Urban Scale Integrated Assessment Model (USIAM) has been developed in this context, illustrated in this paper by application to traffic emissions which are a major contributor to exceedance of air quality objectives for fine particulate matter, PM10, in London. In such a multidisciplinary approach the aim has been to provide a tool for rapid assessment of a wide range of scenarios to identify those that are most cost effective, maintaining a balance between the level of sophistication in the model and the uncertainties and assumptions involved. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In a meta-analysis based on the city-specific regression models, several city characteristics were evaluated as effect modifiers. During the warm season, the 2-day cumulative effect of a 5-ppb increase in ozone was a 0.27% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08, 0.47) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions and a 0.41% (95% CI: 0.26, 0.57) increase in pneumonia admissions. Similarly, a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 during the warm season resulted in a 1.47% (95% CI: 0.93, 2.01) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at lag 1 and a 0.84% (95% CI: 0.50, 1.19) increase in pneumonia at lag 0. Percentage of households with central air conditioning reduced the effect of air pollution, and variability of summer apparent temperature reduced the effect of ozone on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study confirmed, in a large sample of cities, that exposure to ozone and PM10 is associated with respiratory hospital admissions and provided evidence that the effect of air pollution is modified by certain city characteristics.

In March 2001, the US government announced that it was withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) and it has not replaced this participation with a credible program of greenhouse gas reduction. This decision could be analyzed through different angles. In this article, we would like to look at these hesitations through an institutional angle, through the American institutions themselves. Few elements from their institutional and historical past prepare the United States to initiate a vigorous program of GHG reduction, other than through technological innovation or voluntary actions. Even though the institutional concept of path dependency is identified as the concept most helpful in explaining, from an institutional point of view, these hesitations, other institutional explanations are called upon to explain and understand these decisions.

If that challenge is to be met, domestic energy consumption must be controlled: it currently accounts for 40% of the total, making it one of the biggest sources of emissions. EU Directives 93/76 and 2002/91 make it compulsory for energy rating systems to be set up to report on consumption in buildings. This paper looks at the various rating systems now up and running, with varying levels of success, in EU countries. However, Denmark's is the only system that can be considered as providing a full energy rating in the sense of awarding a graded score to buildings rather than a simple pass/fail rating, and proposing ways of improving the score obtained. Indeed, many regulations on energy saving in the residential sector are extremely recent, and it is too soon to assess their results. In some States they may also be modified by reforms currently being studied or processed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It first summarizes and classifies equity principles proposed in the published literature of the field. Of these, the authors selected three major equity principles, i.e., egalitarian equity, horizontal equity, and proportional equality (often referred to also as sovereign equity) to carry out a detailed examination of two sets of quantitative emission entitlements, which are based on two burden-sharing rules, i.e., the equal emissions per capita approach and the carbon intensity approach. The two burden-sharing rules were chosen as not only particularly popular, but also because their application results in distinctly different burden sharing among countries. To make the two rules comparable, we used a global carbon-emission path until the year 2050 that leads to an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 550 ppm. We then used the two rules for allocating the global emissions described by that path to allocate carbon emission entitlements to 67 countries and 9 world regions. In general, developing countries receive relatively higher entitlements under the equal emissions per capita approach whereas industrialized countries are relatively better off under the carbon intensity approach. In some countries and regions, emission entitlements as calculated by any of the two burden-sharing rules are so low that it would be unrealistic to assume that actual emissions can be limited to the emission entitlements assigned to them without using flexibility mechanisms such as those defined in the Kyoto Protocol. In this sense, the calculated entitlements can be also interpreted as the initial allocation of tradable emission allowances of countries or regions. Nonetheless, we considered any numerical determination of resulting carbon trade flows to be outside the scope of our paper. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A central objective is to decouple conventional resource use (and its corollary, waste generation) from economic development through technological innovation, improved efficiency and changes in individual practices. As the global population becomes urbanized and human activity is concentrated in urban areas, settlement planning is a key aspect of sustainability. The widespread inclusion of environmental objectives in urban plans at all scales provides an opportunity for the incorporation of urban climate knowledge into the planning process on a routine basis. Many of the stated objectives have both direct and indirect connections to climate. However, for this to happen, climate research and results must be linked more explicitly to the objectives of the sustainable settlement. In this paper, the relevance of sustainability to urban design and climate is discussed and the potential contribution of current urban climatology is assessed, identifying areas of special consideration for transfer to achieve sustainable urban planning and design. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",,"settlement planning; sustainable development; urban climate; urban design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644806837

Here, we show that astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the brain, can secrete one or more factors capable of modulating microglial activation by regulating the microglial levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment of microglia with astrocyte culture-conditioned media (ACM) increased the expression level and activity of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). ACM also induced nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 transcription factor, increased the binding activity of the antioxidant response element (ARE), and enhanced HO-1 promoter activity in an ARE-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with ACM suppressed interferon-γ(IFN-γ)- induced ROS production, leading to reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) release. In agreement with these results, mimickers of HO-1 products, such as bilirubin, ferrous iron, and a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule, reduced IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and/or NO release. Finally, we found that the active component(s) in ACM was heat labile and smaller than 3 kDa. Together, these results suggest that astrocytes could cooperate with microglia to prevent excessive inflammatory responses in the brain by regulating microglial expression of HO-1 and production of ROS.

Three ensemble experiments are performed: the A2 scenario experiment with greenhouse-gas (GHG) plus sulfate aerosol forcing (referred to as A2), and the A2 and B2 scenario experiments, with GHG forcing only (A2G and B2G respectively). All experiments show that East Asian near surface temperature (T2m) and precipitation (PCP) will increase in the 21st century with larger amplitudes than global means. Seasonally varying changes are found as a larger warming in winter and fall and a stronger PCP in summer. Relative roles of large-scale and convective precipitations (LSP and CP) are analyzed extensively. A mass flux scheme with an adjustment closure is used for cumulus parameterization. In the global mean, LSP dominates total PCP increase whereas CP controls PCP reductions near the equator in December-January-February (DJF) and 30-40°S in June-July-August (JJA). The latter originates from a weakening of the northern winter Hadley circulation and an increased static stability in the Southern Hemisphere, supporting previous results. For the East Asian mean, the CP change explains most of the increase of total PCP in JJA while the LSP change plays a more critical role in DJF. The LSP increase over the North Pacific in DJF is well associated with strengthened [weakened] baroclinicity north [south] of 40°N, i.e., a poleward shift of storm track. Aerosol effects on East Asian climate change (A2 minus A2G patterns) are characterized by cooling and drying with patterns similar to those of the mean changes. This is inconsistent with localized features found in previous works, indicating large uncertainty in regional responses to aerosol forcing. A possible impact of GHG mitigation over the late 21st century (A2G minus B2G patterns) is more pronounced in T2m than in PCP changes, with similar patterns as in aerosol effects. Simulated CP and LSP contributions to PCP changes are insensitive to the aerosol effect as well as that of GHG mitigations. © 2006, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"atmospheric forcing; climate change; climate modeling; greenhouse gas; simulation; twenty first century; Asia; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646403444

The detected J and H variations are synchronized with the flux variation in the V band, which indicates that the intraday-variable component of near-infrared continuum emission of the NGC 4395 nucleus is an extension of power-law continuum emission to the near-infrared and originates in an outer region of the central accretion disk. On the other hand, from our regular program of long-term optical BVI and near-infrared JHK monitoring observation of NGC 4395 from 2004 February 12 until 2005 January 22, we found large flux variations in all the bands on timescales of days to months. The optical BVI variations are almost synchronized with each other but not completely with the near-infrared JHK variations. The color temperature of the near-infrared variable component is estimated to be T = 1320-1710 K, in agreement with thermal emission from hot dust tori in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We therefore conclude that the near-infrared variation consists of two components having different timescales, so that a small K-flux variation on a timescale of a few hours would possibly be veiled by large variation of thermal dust emission on a timescale of days. © 2006.

We examined the role of membrane-bound and soluble carbonic anhydrases (CA) by which H+ is neutralized, CO2 is absorbed, and HCO3- is secreted. Rat duodena were perfused with solutions of different pH and PCO2 with or without a cell-permeant CA inhibitor methazolamide (MTZ) or impermeant CA inhibitors. Flow-through pH and PCO2 electrodes simultaneously measured perfusate and effluent pH and PCO2. High CO2 (34.7 kPa) perfusion increased net CO2 loss from the perfusate compared with controls (pH 6.4 saline, PCO2≈ 0) accompanied by portal venous (PV) acidification and PCO2 increase. Impermeant CA inhibitors abolished net perfusate CO2 loss and increased net HCO3- gain, whereas all CA inhibitors inhibited PV acidification and PCO2 increase. The changes in luminal and PV pH and [CO2] were also inhibited by the Na+ - H+ exchanger-1 (NHE1) inhibitor dimethylamiloride, but not by the NHE3 inhibitor S3226. Luminal acid decreased total CO2 output and increased H+ loss with PV acidification and PCO2 increase, all inhibited by all CA inhibitors. During perfusion of a 30% CO2 buffer, loss of CO2 from the lumen was CA dependent as was transepithelial transport of perfused 13CO2. H+ and CO2 loss from the perfusate were accompanied by increases of PV H+ and tracer CO2, but unchanged PV total CO2, consistent with CA-dependent transmucosal H+ and CO2 movement. Inhibition of membrane-bound CAs augments the apparent rate of net basal HCO3- secretion. Luminal H+ traverses the apical membrane as CO2, is converted back to cytosolic H+, which is extruded via NHE1. Membrane-bound and cytosolic CAs cooperatively facilitate secretion of HCO3- into the lumen and CO2 diffusion into duodenal mucosa, serving as important acid-base regulators. © 2006 The Authors.

Approximately 80% of humans develop dermatitis upon exposure to the carbon-based active compound, urushiol. It is not known how poison ivy might respond to increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), but previous work done in controlled growth chambers shows that other vines exhibit large growth enhancement from elevated CO2. Rising CO2 is potentially responsible for the increased vine abundance that is inhibiting forest regeneration and increasing tree mortality around the world. In this 6-year study at the Duke University Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiment, we show that elevated atmospheric CO2 in an intact forest ecosystem increases photosynthesis, water use efficiency, growth, and population biomass of poison ivy. The CO2 growth stimulation exceeds that of most other woody species. Furthermore, high-CO2 plants produce a more allergenic form of urushiol. Our results indicate that Toxicodendron taxa will become more abundant and more ""toxic"" in the future, potentially affecting global forest dynamics and human health. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Forest ecology; Global change; Rhus radicans","carbon dioxide; urushiol; water; article; atmosphere; biomass; contact dermatitis; controlled study; ecosystem regeneration; forest; forest dynamics; gas chromatography; global change; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant leaf; poison ivy; priority journal; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Catechols; Dermatitis, Toxicodendron; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Toxicodendron; Trees; United States; Anacardiaceae; Anacardium occidentale; Hedera; Toxicodendron; Toxicodendron radicans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745134364

Because plant species composition affects soil moisture profiles, and is likely to shift under elevated [CO2], it is also important to test whether the indirect effects of [CO2] on soil water content may depend on species composition. We examined the effects of elevated [CO2] and species composition on soil moisture profiles in an annual grassland of California. We grew monocultures and a mixture of Avena barbata and Hemizonia congesta - the dominant species of two phenological groups - in microcosms exposed to ambient (∼ 370 μmol mol-1) and elevated (∼ 700 μmol mol-1) [CO2]. Both species increased intrinsic and yield-based water use efficiency under elevated [CO2], but soil moisture increased only in communities with A. barbata, the dominant early-season annual grass. In A. barbata monocultures, the [CO2] treatment did not affect the depth distribution of soil water loss. In contrast to communities with A. barbata, monocultures of H. congesta, a late-season annual forb, did not conserve water under elevated [CO2], reflecting the increased growth of these plants. In late spring, elevated [CO2] also increased the efficiency of deep roots in H. congesta monocultures. Under ambient [CO2], roots below 60 cm accounted for 22% of total root biomass and were associated with 9% of total water loss, whereas in elevated [CO2], 16% of total belowground biomass was associated with 34% of total water loss. Both soil moisture and isotope data showed that H. congesta monocultures grown under elevated [CO2] began extracting water from deep soils 2 weeks earlier than plants in ambient [CO2]. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Avena barbata; Elevated CO2; Grassland; Hemizonia congesta; Isotopes; Soil moisture; Water uptake","carbon dioxide enrichment; community composition; grassland; plant water relations; soil moisture; water uptake; California; North America; United States; Avena barbata; Hemizonia congesta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644995617

These systems use a traditional pinhole geometry to project an image of the source onto a two-dimensional scintillator array, and a CCD records the resulting scintillation image. The recent history of ICF neutron images has produced images with qualities that have improved as the fusion neutron yields have increased to nearly 10'4 neutrons. Anticipated future neutron yields in excess of 1016 at the National Ignition Facility and LMJ have raised the prospect of neuron imaging diagnostics which simultaneously probe several different characteristics of burning fusion targets. The new measurements rely on gated-image recording to select images corresponding to specific bands of neutron energies. Gated images of downscattered neutrons with energies from 5 to 8 MeV can emphasize regions of the target which contain DT fuel which is not burning. At the same time, gated images which select different portions of the 14-MeV spectral peak can produce spatial temperature maps of a burning target. Since the neutron production depends on the DT fuel density and temperature, simultaneous images of temperature and neutron emission can be combined to infer the an image of the source density using an Abel inversion method that is analogous to the method that has been used in x-ray imaging. Thus, with higher-yield sources, neutron imaging offers the potential to record simultaneously several critical features that characterize the performance of an ICF target: the neutron emission distribution, the temperature and density distributions, and the distribution of nonburning fuel within the target. © EDP Sciences.",,"Charge coupled devices; Density (specific gravity); Inertial confinement fusion; Neutron emission; Neutron scattering; Phosphors; Downscattered neutrons; National Ignition Facility; Neutron energies; Neutron imaging; Imaging systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749342021

At a central elementary school in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria, 163 children aged 7-10 yrs underwent repeated examinations at the same time of day during 1 school year, yielding a total of 11-12 lung function tests per child. Associations to mass concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured continuously at a nearby monitoring station were tested, applying the Generalised Estimating Equations model. Reductions per 10 μg· m-3 (both for particles and for NO2) were in the magnitude of 1% for most lung function parameters. The most sensitive indicator for acute effects of combustion-related pollutants was a change in maximal expiratory flow in small airways. NO2 at concentrations below current standards reduced (in the multipollutant model) the forced expiratory volume in one second by 1.01%, maximal instantaneous forced flow when 50% of the forced vital capacity remains to be exhaled (MEF50%) by 1.99% and MEF25% by 1.96%.

Resistance is less influenced by the child's cooperation and should be utilised more often in environmental epidemiology when screening for early signs of small airway dysfunction from urban air pollution, but cannot replace the measurement of MEF50% and MEF25%. In the basic model, the reduction of these parameters per 10 μg·μ-3 was highest for NO2, followed by PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, while exposure to coarse dust (PM10-PM2.5) did not change end-expiratory flow significantly. All acute effects of urban air pollution found on the lung function of healthy pupils were evident at levels below current European limit values for nitrogen dioxide. Thus, planned reduction of nitrogen dioxide emission (Euro 5; vehicles that comply with the emission limits as defined in Directive 99/96/EC) of 20% in 2010 would seem to be insufficient.

The latter process is mediated by interaction between HPr and the carbon catabolite repression master transcription regulator, carbon catabolite protein A (CcpA), q1a member of the LacI-GalR family of DNA-binding proteins. We investigated, with a combination of computational and experimental tools, whether HPr can also interact with other transcriptional regulators. To allow rapid identification of paralogous LacI-GalR family members that might interact with HPr in a similar fashion to CcpA, a structure-based computational approach was developed which relies on the analysis of the similarity of protein-protein interfaces between different complexes. A key element of this method is an empirical pair potential derived from a group of orthologous complexes and subsequently used to identify paralogs that exhibit similar properties of their protein interfaces. Application of this method to the family of LacI-GalR repressors in Bacillus subtilis predicted the ribose operon repressor (RbsR) as a novel interaction partner of HPr. This interaction was subsequently confirmed experimentally and suggests that HPr plays an even larger role in transcriptional control than previously expected. © 2006 FEBS.","Empirical pair potential; Interface; Modeling; Protein interactions; Transcription","histidine; protein; protein rbsr; unclassified drug; article; Bacillus subtilis; catalysis; controlled study; gene control; genetic transcription; mathematical computing; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; protein analysis; protein family; protein interaction; protein protein interaction; repressor gene; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Histidine; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Operon; Phosphoproteins; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Repressor Proteins; Sequence Homology; Threonine; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Bacillus subtilis; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644772777

In a climate of scarce resources, policy-makers need to know which interventions represent value for money. The prohibitive cost of performing multiple economic evaluations has generated interest in transferring the results of studies from one setting to another. This paper aims to bridge the gap in the current literature by critically evaluating the available published data on economic evaluations of NCD interventions in developing countries. Methods: We identified and reviewed the methodological quality of 32 economic evaluations of NCD interventions in developing countries. Developing countries were defined according to the World Bank classification for low- and lower middle-income countries. We defined NCDs as the 12 categories listed in the 1993 World Bank report Investing in Health. English language literature was searched for the period January 1984 and January 2003 inclusive in Medline, Science Citation Index, HealthStar, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Embase using medical subheading terms and free text searches. We then assessed the quality of studies according to a set of pre-defined technical criteria. Results: We found that the quality of studies was poor and resource allocation decisions made by local and global policy-makers on the basis of this evidence could be misleading. Furthermore we have identified some clear gaps in the literature, particularly around injuries and strategies for tackling the consequences of the emerging tobacco epidemic. Conclusion: In the face of poor evidence the role of so-called generalised cost-effectiveness analyses has an important role to play in aiding public health decision-making at the global level. Further research is needed to investigates the causes of variation among cost, effects and cost-effectiveness data within and between settings. Such analyses still need to take a broad view, present data in a transparent manner and take account of local constraints. © 2006 Mulligan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"communicable disease; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; data base; decision making; developing country; economic evaluation; evidence based medicine; health care cost; health care policy; income; information retrieval; Internet; medical information; medical literature; medical research; MEDLINE; program development; public health service; quality control; resource allocation; review; SciSearch; socioeconomics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745058126

The parasite plastid synthesizes fatty acids, heme, iron sulfur clusters and isoprenoid precursors and is indispensable, making it an attractive target for antiparasite drugs. How parasite plastid biosynthetic pathways are fuelled in the absence of photosynthetic capture of energy and carbon was not clear. Here, we describe a pair of parasite transporter proteins, PfiTPT and PfoTPT, that are homologues of plant chloroplast innermost membrane transporters responsible for moving phosphorylated C3, C5, and C6 compounds across the plant chloroplast envelope. PfiTPT is shown to be localized in the innermost membrane of the parasite plastid courtesy of a cleavable N-terminal targeting sequence. PfoTPT lacks such a targeting sequence, but is shown to localize in the outermost parasite plastid membrane with its termini projecting into the cytosol. We have identified these membrane proteins in the parasite plastid and determined membrane orientation for PfoTPT. PfiTPT and PfoTPT are proposed to act in tandem to transport phosphorylated C3 compounds from the parasite cytosol into the plastid. Thus, the transporters could shunt glycolytic derivatives of glucose scavenged from the host into the plastid providing carbon, reducing equivalents and ATP to power the organelle. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Apicoplast; Endosymbiosis; Plasmodium; Translocator","adenosine triphosphate; carbon; carrier protein; fatty acid; glucose; heme; iron sulfur protein; membrane protein; amino terminal sequence; article; cell organelle; chloroplast; cytosol; energy; fatty acid synthesis; glycolysis; host; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; plastid; priority journal; protein analysis; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; protein targeting; Animals; Intracellular Membranes; Membrane Proteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Microscopy, Immunoelectron; Plasmodium; Plastids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745453189

Except for some protected or inaccessible areas, all of these forests are used by humans. The influence of different silvicultural treatments on timber production and the amount of carbon in tree biomass is well known. In contrast, data on the impacts of forest management, particularly of moderate silvicultural practices in hardwood forestry, on the amount of organic carbon in the mineral soil (SOC) are very limited. A case study on differently managed European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests in Germany showed that the successive removal of trees in a shelterwood system and a selection system reduces the amount of carbon stored in tree biomass on average by about 30% compared to an unmanaged forest. Biomass carbon at the even-aged stands of the shelterwood system showed a clear age-related maximum curve (maximum at a stand age of about 100 years: 230 tC ha-1). Leaf litter resting on the mineral soil at the end of September before litter fall began (0.8-2.8 tC ha-1) was mainly affected by annual leaf litter fall of the previous year and the basal area (R2=0.67). Excluding the effect of variations in the clay content and the C:N ratio via statistical analysis soil organic carbon in the upper mineral soil (0-15 cm soil depth, SOC0-15) did not correlate with stand age, and mean SOC0-15 of the study sites or silvicultural systems (ranging between 40 and 48 tC ha-1) did not differ significantly. These results indicate that the effects of disturbances due to shelterwood cuttings or selection cuttings on SOC0-15 are small compared to the high small-scaled variability of soils, the favourable growing conditions at the Hainich-Dün region that allow for a rapid canopy closure after tree harvesting, and potential long-term effects of historical forest use. However, there was a trend to lower mean SOC0-15 at the managed sites (42 tC ha-1) as compared to the unmanaged site (48 tC ha-1). This trend may represent a cumulative effect of the cessation of timber use at the unmanaged forest for the last 35 years. The impacts of the investigated moderate silvicultural practices on the carbon budget of European beech forests were lower than tquothose reported for clear cuttings in temperate forests. A major challenge of future research is to quantify the long-term effects of historical forest use on the current amount of SOC and to separate them from the effects of recent forest management. A crucial precondition for these investigations is the establishment of representative long-term, managed and unmanaged study sites.","Biomass; Carbon budget; Forest use history; Natural forests; Selection system; Shelterwood system; Silviculture; Soil organic carbon","Fagus; Fagus sylvatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646684285

It was observed that the reduction of Co2+ on oxide free p-Si occurs at the negative side of the flat band potential involving the discharge of photogenerated electrons at the conduction band edge and/or surface state levels. The formation of an oxide film of dox &lt; 2 nm introduces an energy barrier that increases the overpotential for electrodeposition. The morphology of deposits, on the other hand, changes from layer like to grain like after surface oxidation, indicating a substantial modification of the nature and density of nucleation sites. The number density of deposited clusters on an oxidized surface showed a proportionality with the field strength in the oxide, indicating the presence of a certain high-field assisted mechanism in the generation of active sites. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Tropospheric ozone (O3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are significant drivers of plant growth and chemical composition. We hypothesized that exposure to elevated concentrations of O3 and CO2, singly and in combination, would modify the chemical composition of Trifolium and thus alter its digestibility and nutritive quality for ruminant herbivores. 2. We tested our hypothesis by collecting samples of Red Clover (Trifolium pratense) and White Clover (Trifolium repens) from the understoreys of Trembling Aspen (Populus tremuloides)-Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) communities that had been exposed since 1998 to ambient air, elevated CO2, elevated O3 or elevated CO2 + O 3 at the Aspen Free-Air CO2 and O3 Enrichment (FACE) site located near Rhinelander, WI, USA. Foliage samples were analysed for (1) concentrations of N, total cell wall constituents, lignin and soluble phenolics; and (2) in vitro dry-matter digestibility (IVDMD) and in vitro cell-wall digestibility (IVCWD) using batch cultures of ruminal micro-organisms. 3. Significant air-treatment effects were observed for lignin concentration, IVDMD and IVCWD, and between Red and White Clover for all dependent variables. No air treatment x clover species interactions were detected. 4. Exposure to elevated O3 resulted in increased concentration of lignin and decreased IVDMD and IVCWD compared with exposure to ambient air, and the response was similar regardless of whether plants had been coexposed to elevated CO2. Exposure to elevated CO2 alone did not affect chemical composition or in vitro digestibility, nor did it ameliorate the negative effect of elevated O3 on these determinants of nutritive quality for ruminant herbivores. 5. In contrast to recent reports of a protective effect of elevated CO2 against growth reduction in plants under O3 stress, our results indicate that elevated CO2 would not be expected to ameliorate the negative impact of elevated O 3 on nutritive quality of Trifolium under projected future global climate scenarios. © 2006 British Ecological Society.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Digestibility; FACE; Lignin; Nutritive quality; Ozone; Trifolium","allometry; carbon dioxide; chemical composition; digestibility; fumigation; herb; ozone; North America; Rhinelander; United States; Wisconsin; Acer; Acer saccharum; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bovidae; Populus tremuloides; Saccharum hybrid cultivar; Trifolium; Trifolium pratense; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646555753

In a typical FC system, various alloys are used in hydrogen environments and are subjected to cyclic loading due to pressurization, mechanical vibrations, etc. The materials investigated were three austenitic stainless steels (SUS304, SUS316 and SUS316L), one ferritic stainless steel (SUS405), one martensitic stainless steel (0.7C-13Cr), a Cr-Mo martensitic steel (SCM435) and two annealed medium-carbon steels (0.47 and 0.45%C). In order to simulate the pick-up of hydrogen in service, the specimens were charged with hydrogen. The fatigue crack growth behaviour of charged specimens of SUS304, SUS316, SUS316L and SUS405 was compared with that of specimens which had not been hydrogen-charged. The comparison showed that there was a degradation in fatigue crack growth resistance due to hydrogen in the case of SUS304 and SUS316 austenitic stainless steels. However, SUS316L and SUS405 showed little degradation due to hydrogen. A marked increase in the amount of martensitic transformation occurred in the hydrogen-charged SUS304 specimens compared to specimens without hydrogen charge. In case of SUS316L, little martensitic transformation occurred in either specimens with and without hydrogen charge. The results of S-N testing showed that in the case of the 0.7C-13Cr stainless steel and the Cr-Mo steel a marked decrease in fatigue resistance due to hydrogen occurred. In the case of the medium carbon steels hydrogen did not cause a reduction in fatigue behaviour. Examination of the slip band characteristics of a number of the alloys showed that slip was more localized in the case of hydrogen-charged specimens. Thus, it is presumed that a synergetic effect of hydrogen and martensitic structure enhances degradation of fatigue crack resistance. © Springer 2006.","Cr-Mo steel; Crack growth; Ductility loss; Fatigue; Hydrogen; Medium carbon steel; Slip behaviour; Stainless steel","Carbon steel; Crack propagation; Ductility; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Martensitic transformations; Stainless steel; Chromium-molybdenum steel; Fatigue resistance; Hydrogen charge; Slip behaviour; Synergetic effect; Fatigue of materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745231168

To fully understand the results of pilot scale tests and to accurately predict scale-up performance through CFD modeling, accurate rate expressions are needed to describe coal char combustion under these unconventional combustion conditions. In the work reported here, the combustion rates of two pulverized coal chars have been measured in both conventional and oxygen-enriched atmospheres. A combustion-driven entrained flow reactor equipped with an optical particle-sizing pyrometry diagnostic and a rapid-quench sampling probe has been used for this investigation. Highvale subbituminous coal and a high-volatile eastern United States bituminous coal have been investigated, over oxygen concentrations ranging from 6 to 36 mol% and gas temperatures of 1320-1800 K. The results from these experiments demonstrate that pulverized coal char particles burn under increasing kinetic control in elevated oxygen environments, despite their higher burning rates in these environments. Empirical fits to the data have been successfully performed over the entire range of oxygen concentrations using a single-film oxidation model. Both a simple nth-order Arrhenius expression and an nth-order Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic equation provide good fits to the data. Local fits of the nth-order Arrhenius expression to the oxygen-enriched and oxygen-depleted data produce lower residuals in comparison to fits of the entire dataset. These fits demonstrate that the apparent reaction order varies from 0.1 under near-diffusion-limit oxygen-depleted conditions to 0.5 under oxygen-enriched conditions.

Environmental changes in the course of the postglacial (Holocene) transgression are detectable from quantitative analysis of three ostracod assemblages. Three phases of the transgression are established based on ostracode assemblages from the AMS 14C-dated core from the ancient valley of Yana River, central part of the Laptev Sea eastern shelf. After the first phase of coastal brackish-water environment (11.3-11.1 ka), shallow-water marine taxa appeared in the transitional phase (11.1-10.3 ka), and the third phase of modern sea conditions commenced 10.3 ka ago. Spore and pollen assemblages from the core indicate that the early Holocene land vegetation was dominated by tundra plant communities adapted to climatic conditions not warmer than at present. In the interval of 9.3-8.0 ka, climate was increasingly humid and warm, and forest-tundra vegetation occupied more favorable zones of the region. © MAIK ""Nauka/Interperiodica"" 2006.","Holocene climate; Ostracodes; Shelf sediments; Siberian Arctic region; Spores and pollen spectra","environmental change; fauna; foraminifera; Holocene; mollusc; ostracod; paleoclimate; paleogeography; palynology; spore; taxonomy; transgression; Arctic Ocean; Eurasia; Laptev Sea; Siberia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Foraminifera; Mollusca; Ostracoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750907871

Heterologous gene expression driven by the PMOD1 and PMOD2 promoters was found to be strong and tightly regulated by carbon source at the transcriptional level. PMOD was induced not only by methanol but also by glycerol. PMOD2 was induced only by methanol, although it was not repressed on the addition of glycerol to a methanol medium, suggesting that PMOD2 is regulated in a manner distinct from that of other AOD-gene promoters. On the other hand, methanol and oxygen level-influenced gene expression mediated by PMOD1, and PMOD2. PMOD1 expression was optimal at low methanol concentrations, whereas PMOD2 was predominantly expressed at high methanol and high oxygen concentrations. Based on these results, both PMOD2 and PMOD1 should be useful tools for controlling heterologous gene expression in P. methanolica. In particular, it should be possible to differentially control the production phases of two heterologous proteins, using PMOD1 and PMOD2 in the same host cell and in the same flask.

However, no proof of this effect has been provided by clinical trials and related clinical research. Hence, we investigated the radiation biological aspects of high LET carbon beam therapy on cervical cancer. Experimental Design: This study involved 49 patients with stage IIIb bulky and stage IVa cervical cancer treated with high LET carbon beams between October 1995 and June 2000. Oxygen partial pressure (pO2) was measured by using a needle-type polarographic oxygen electrode. Results: The 4-year disease-free survival rates of patients with pO2≤20 mm Hg (hypoxic tumor) and pO2 &gt; 20 mm Hg (oxygenated tumor) before treatment were 37% and 21%, respectively. The local control rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors before treatment were 58% and 54%, respectively. The disease-free survival rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors assessed by oxygen status at the 5th day of irradiation were 33% and 32%, respectively. The local control rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors at the 5th day were 60% and 58%, respectively. There was no significant prognostic difference between hypoxic and oxygenated tumors. Conclusion: The similar disease-free survival and local control rates between hypoxic and oxygenated tumors before and during treatment indicated that the role of the tumor oxygenation status was not so important in local control in carbon beam therapy. These results indicated that high LET carbon beam irradiation might reduce the radiation-resistant nature stemming from tumor hypoxia. © 2006 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"adult; aged; article; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; hypoxia; ion therapy; linear energy transfer; oxygen electrode; oxygen tension; polarography; priority journal; prognosis; radiosensitivity; uterine cervix cancer; Carbon; Cell Hypoxia; Disease-Free Survival; Dose Fractionation; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Electrodes; Female; Heavy Ions; Humans; Linear Energy Transfer; Middle Aged; Oxygen; Partial Pressure; Particle Accelerators; Polarography; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiation Tolerance; Survival Rate; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646249643

Its gas-like diffusivity and liquid-like density in the supercritical phase allow replacing conventional, often noxious, solvents with supercritical CO2. Though only a few polymers are soluble in supercritical CO2, it is quite soluble in many molten polymers. CO2 dissolution in a polymer has been interpreted physically but FT-IR studies lead to an explanation in terms of weak interactions between basic and acidic sites. Various experimental methods and equations of state are available to measure or predict the solubility of CO2. Dissolved CO2 causes a considerable reduction in the viscosity of molten polymer, a very important property for the applications stated above. CO2 mainly acts as a plasticizer or solvent when contacted with a polymer. Gas solubility and viscosity reduction can be predicted theoretically from pure-component properties. In this review, experimental and theoretical studies of solubility and viscosity of several polymer melts are discussed in detail. Detailed attention is also given to recently reported applications along with aspects related to polymer processing. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Periodical flow reversal has also been proposed for the treatment of gases with traces of N2O. At higher temperatures a hybrid reaction can arise, i.e., in addition to the heterogeneous catalytic reaction a homogeneous thermal reaction also takes place. The following paper examines the influence of an axially structured monolith catalyst on the hybrid N2O decomposition process in order to understand the coupling mechanisms in more detail using the reverse flow reactor as a diagnostic tool. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of the direct calculation of cyclic steady states, in which the regular initial-value problem is transformed into a cyclic steady-state boundary-value problem. In combining this technique with standard bifurcation analysis tools, it is now possible to study the influence of key parameters on the process in a very efficient and elegant way. Both simulations and experimental investigations were required to design an appropriate arrangement for spatial and temporal resolution of the two underlying reaction routes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

(2000) on the interaction of energetic Zn projectiles in partially ionized laser produced carbon targets, and with similar type experiments. Particular attention is paid to the specific contributions of the K and L shell target electrons to electron recombination in the energetic Zn ionic projectile. The classical Bohr-Lindhard model was used for describing recombination, while quantum mechanical models were also introduced for scaling the L to K cross-section ratios. It was found that even for a hydrogen-like carbon target, the effect of the missing five bound electrons brings about an increase of only 0.6 charge units in the equilibrium charge state as compared to the cold target value of 23. A collisional radiative calculation was employed for analyzing the type of plasma produced in the experimental study. It was found that for the plasma conditions characteristic of this experiment, some fully ionized target plasma atoms should be present. However in order to explain the experimentally observed large increase in the projectile charge state a very dominant component of the fully ionized plasma must comprise the target plasma. A procedure for calculating the dynamic evolvement of the projectile charge state within partially ionized plasma is also presented and applied to the type of plasma encountered in the experiment of Roth et al. (2000). The low temperature and density tail on the back of the target brings about a decrease in the exiting charge state, while the value of the average charge state within the target is dependent on the absolute value of the cross-sections.

A new generation of quantitative research has provided new evidence of the limited (and sometimes counter-intuitive) extent of displacement, supporting broader theoretical and political arguments favouring mixed-income redevelopment and other forms of gentrification. This paper offers a critical challenge to this interpretation, drawing on evidence from a mixed-methods study of gentrification and displacement in New York City. Quantitative analysis of the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey indicates that displacement is a limited yet crucial indicator of the deepening class polarisation of urban housing markets; moreover, the main buffers against gentrification-induced displacement of the poor (public housing and rent regulation) are precisely those kinds of market interventions that are being challenged by advocates of gentrification and dismantled by policy-makers. Qualitative analysis based on interviews with community organisers and residents documents the continued political salience of displacement and reveals an increasingly sophisticated and creative array of methods used to resist displacement in a policy climate emphasising selective deregulation and market-oriented social policy. © 2006 The Editors of Urban Studies.",,"gentrification; housing market; social policy; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30744436355

The soils contrasted with respect to texture and fertility. N2O emissions decreased with diversity and increased in the presence of legumes. Soils were sinks for CH4 at all times; legume monocultures were a smaller sink for atmospheric CH4 than non-legume monocultures, but no effect of species richness per se was detected. However, both the exchange of CH4 and N2O strongly depended on plant community composition, and on the interaction of composition with soil type, indicating that the functional role of species and their interactions differed between soils. N2O fluxes were mainly driven by effects on soil nitrate and on nitrification while soil moisture had less of an effect. Soil microbial C and N and N mineralisation rates were not altered. The driver of the interactive soil type×plant community composition-effects was less clear. Because soil methanotrophs may take longer to respond to alterations of N cycling than the 1/2 year treatment in this study, we also tested species richness-effects in two separate 5-year field studies, but results were ambiguous, indicating complex interactions with soil disturbance. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that plant community composition can affect the soil trace gas balance, whereas plant species richness per se was less important; it also indicates a potential link between the botanical composition of plant communities and global warming. © Springer 2006.","Biodiversity; Grassland; Greenhouse warming; Nitrogen cycling; Soils and soil microbial biomass; Trace gases","legume; methane; microbial activity; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen oxides; plant community; soil chemistry; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; species diversity; species richness; trace gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745488833

However, the emission of the lowest-order cavity mode was strongly enhanced when the excitation wavelength was resonant with higher-order cavity modes.

Three major elements of urban development are considered: construction materials for infrastructure (including residential dwellings, utilities, and roads), building operations, and transportation (private automobiles and public transit). Two case studies from the City of Toronto are analyzed. An economic input-output life-cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) model is applied to estimate the energy use and GHG emissions associated with the manufacture of construction materials for infrastructure. Operational requirements for dwellings and transportation are estimated using nationally and/or regionally averaged data. The results indicate that the most targeted measures to reduce GHG emissions in an urban development context should be aimed at transportation emissions, while the most targeted measures to reduce energy usage should focus on building operations. The results also show that low-density suburban development is more energy and GHG intensive (by a factor of 2.0-2.5) than high-density urban core development on a per capita basis. When the functional unit is changed to a per unit of living space basis the factor decreases to 1.0-1.5, illustrating that the choice of functional unit is highly relevant to a full understanding of urban density effects. © 2006 ASCE.","Buildings; Canada; Emissions; Energy consumption; Residential; Residential location","Building materials; Buildings; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Houses; Life cycle; Building operations; Canada; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life-cycle analysis; Residential location; Urban density effects; Urban development; Urban planning; carbon emission; energy use; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32944461554

However, transition of this acute hypercapnia into chronic sustained hypercapnia during wakefulness remains unexplained. We hypothesized that respiratory-renal interactions would play a critical role in this transition. Because this transition cannot be readily addressed clinically, we modified a previously published model of whole-body CO 2 kinetics by adding respiratory control and renal bicarbonate kinetics. We enforced a pattern of 8 h of periodic breathing (sleep) and 16 h of regular ventilation (wakefulness) repeated for 20 days. Interventions included varying the initial awake respiratory CO 2response and varying the rate of renal bicarbonate excretion within the physiological range. The results showed that acute hypercapnia during periodic breathing could transition into chronic sustained hypercapnia during wakefulness. Although acute hypercapnia could be attributed to periodic breathing alone, transition from acute to chronic hypercapnia required either slowing of renal bicarbonate kinetics, reduction of ventilatory CO 2 responsiveness, or both. Thus the model showed that the interaction between the time constant for bicarbonate excretion and respiratory control results in both failure of bicarbonate concentration to fully normalize before the next period of sleep and persistence of hypercapnia through blunting of ventilatory drive. These respiratory-renal interactions create a cumulative effect over subsequent periods of sleep that eventually results in a self-perpetuating state of chronic hypercapnia.

At present, among the obstacles that this technology encounters, odor control and biogas utilization or disposal should be properly addressed. In fact, in most of small and medium size anaerobic municipal treatment plants, biogas is just vented, transferring pollution from water to the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse gas inventory. Anaerobic municipal sewage treatment should not be considered as an energy producer, unless a significant wastewater flow is treated. In these cases, more than half of the methane produced is dissolved and lost in the effluent so yield values will be between 0.08 and 0.18 N m3 CH 4/kg COD removed. Diverse technologies for odor control and biogas cleaning are currently available. High pollutant concentrations may be treated with physical-chemical methods, while biological processes are used mainly for odor control to prevent negative impacts on the treatment facilities or nearby areas. In general terms, biogas treatment is accomplished by physico-chemical methods, scrubbing being extensively used for H2S and CO2 removal. However, dilution (venting) has been an extensive disposal method in some small- and medium-size anaerobic plants treating municipal wastewaters. Simple technologies, such as biofilters, should be developed in order to avoid this practice, matching with the simplicity of anaerobic wastewater treatment processes. In any case, design and specification of biogas handling system should consider safety standards. Resource recovery can be added to anaerobic sewage treatment if methane is used as electron donor for denitrification and nitrogen control purposes. This would result in a reduction of operational cost and in an additional advantage for the application of anaerobic sewage treatment. In developing countries, biogas conversion to energy may apply for the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. This would increase the economic feasibility of the project through the marketing of certified emission reductions (CERs). © Springer 2006.","Anaerobic sewage treatment; Biogas; Biogas utilization; Denitrification; Hydrogen sulfide; Kyoto protocol; Methane; Odor control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32344432001

One of the major problems associated with solar process heat application is fluctuation in system temperature during unsteady state radiation conditions which may cause significant thermal and operation problems. In this paper a transient simulation model is developed for analysing the performance of industrial water heating systems using parabolic trough solar collectors. The results showed that to prevent dramatic change and instability in process heat during transient radiation periods thermal storage tank size should not be lower than 14.51 m-2 of collector area.

Case studies were conducted in both developing and developed countries. 1. In southern Sumatra, Indonesia, 88,369 Mg-C year-1 of wood residue from a plantation forest and excess bark from a pulp mill would be converted into 15,571 Mg-C year-1 of the net carbon sink by biochar for soil improvement. The fixed carbon recovery of the system is 21.0%. 2. In a semiarid region in western Australia, the carbonization of wood residue was incorporated with multipurpose projects of a mallee eucalyptus plantation that involved the function of salinity prevention. During the project period of 35 years, the total carbon sink would reach 1,035,450 Mg-C with 14.0% by aboveground biomass, 33.1% by belowground biomass and 52.8% by biochar in soil. 3. In southern Kyushu, Japan, the study was focused on the effective use of surplus heat from a garbage incinerator for carbonizing woody materials. Sawdust of 936.0 Mg-C year-1 would be converted into the net carbon sink of 298.5 Mg-C year-1 by carbonization, with the fixed carbon recovery of the system being 31.9%. Consequently, the CFC project could encourage the creation of a carbon sink in soil. However, we recognize that the quality standard of biochar, the stability of biochar in soil, and the methods for monitoring biochar utilization must be clarified before incorporating biochar carbon into the carbon credit system. © Springer 2006.","Biochar; Biomass utilization; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sink; Carbonization","biomass allocation; carbon sequestration; energy use; nature conservation; soil improvement; water treatment; Asia; Australasia; Australia; Eurasia; Far East; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Japan; Kyushu; Malay Archipelago; Southeast Asia; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; Western Australia; Eucalyptus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745620756

Superimposed on the first eigenmode of the data with interdecadal changes on the order of 15 to 30-year band, the second mode reflects oscillations with the period of about 10 years. The cold and dry winters generally take place within the first half of each decade, and they switch to mild and warm winters during the second halves. All the water column physical and biogeochemical properties examined respond accordingly to such oscillations. For example, the years with the cold (mild) winters correspond to the periods of increasing (decreasing) nutrient and hydrogen sulfide concentrations, phytoplankton biomass. These variations appear to be governed by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and East Atlantic-West Russia (EAWR) teleconnection patterns comprising various combinations of the low and high surface pressure anomaly centers over the North Atlantic and Eurasia. The NAO teleconnection to the Black Sea is opposite to that taking place in the eastern North Atlantic and its marginal seas. The relatively cold and dry winters occur during the positive phase of the NAO, and visa versa for the milder and wetter winters. The Black Sea Climate Index, constructed using more than 100-year-long time series of the North Atlantic Oscillation, the sea surface temperature, air temperature, sea level anomaly, provides a composite representation of the dominant mode of regional climate variability, and explains 46% of the total variance. The results point to a very efficient coupling between the anthropogenic and climatic forcing for driving the dramatic ecosystem changes observed during the 1980s and 1990s. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This contribution utilizes the fragmented authoritarianism model to explain this slow diffusion by examining the structure of bureaucratic decision making and changes in incentives that have accompanied fiscal decentralization and enterprise deregulation. Case studies on the diffusion of two CCTs - flue gas desulphurization (FGD) and coal washing - highlight challenges of environmental policy design and implementation during the economic reforms of the past decade. Enterprises had little incentive to adopt FGD when central government agencies disagreed on promoting the technology and local agencies did not rigorously enforce national air pollution control policies. For washed coal, production slowed when coal pricing reform and coal industry restructuring were not co-ordinated with environmental policies. Further promotion of CCTs in China requires changes in incentive structures for local governments and enterprises, as well as enhanced policy co-ordination among central government agencies. © Institute of Social Studies 2006.",,"atmospheric pollution; deregulation; environmental economics; pollution control; pollution policy; reform process; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646017374

Evidence accumulated over the last several decades indicates that this change has intimate links with anthropogenic - that is, human-induced - activities that are essentially responsible for substantially enhanced levels of emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), established in 1988, has conducted several assessments, which show that unless deliberate steps are taken to reduce GHG emissions in the coming decades, irreversible changes will occur in the global climate system. Most vulnerable to change are Global and regional temperature precipitation and other parameters Soil structure and moisture Global mean sea levels Frequency of extreme events associated with changes in absolute temperatures The changes will, in turn, lead to a number of adverse effects, on, inter alia Ecological systems Health and epidemiological patterns Hydrological and water resource balance Food and fiber production Coastal and marine systems Human settlements Other socioeconomic sectors This clearly poses an enormous challenge for international and domestic governance. THE GLOBAL FRAMEWORK The Climate Change Convention Confronted with the evidence, the international community has, in the last decade, been involved in discussions about the steps necessary for mitigating or facilitating orderly adaptation to these changes and impacts.

The Tribunal's famous pronouncement, “that under the principles of international law, as well as the law of the United States, no state has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties of persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence,” had in many ways irrevocably confirmed that transboundary environmental damage, and specifically transboundary air pollution, entailed state responsibility. The precedential value of this passage had been acknowledged in diverse contexts such as water disputes, pollution of the seas, and in various neighbourhood disputes between European States, as well as in the extensive literature that proliferated in the period after the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. It substantially informed the work of the International Law Commission on the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses, and on Liability for Injurious Consequences of Acts not Prohibited by International Law. It also was unequivocally endorsed, either directly or in form, in the many environmental treaties that were enacted in the wake of the Stockholm Conference. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349178353

Box 50, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark","Agriculture is an important contributor to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), in particular for methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Emissions from farms with a stock of ruminant animals are particularly high due to CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and manure handling, and due to the intensive nitrogen (N) cycle on such farms leading to direct and indirect N2O emissions. The whole-farm model, FarmGHG, was designed to quantify the flows of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) on dairy farms. The aim of the model was to allow quantification of effects of management practices and mitigation options on GHG emissions. The model provides assessments of emissions from both the production unit and the pre-chains. However, the model does not quantify changes in soil C storage. Model dairy farms were defined within five European agro-ecological zones for both organic and conventional systems. The model farms were all defined to have the same utilised agricultural area (50 ha). Cows on conventional and organic model farms were defined to achieve the same milk yield, so the basic difference between conventional and organic farms was expressed in the livestock density. The organic farms were defined to be 100% self-sufficient with respect to feed. The conventional farms, on the other hand, import concentrates as supplementary feed and their livestock density was defined to be 75% higher than the organic farm density. Regional differences between farms were expressed in the milk yield, the crop rotations, and the cow housing system and manure management method most common to each region. The model results showed that the emissions at farm level could be related to either the farm N surplus or the farm N efficiency. The farm N surplus appeared to be a good proxy for GHG emissions per unit of land area. The GHG emissions increased from 3.0 Mg CO2-eq ha -1 year-1 at a N surplus of 56 kg N ha-1 year-1 to 15.9 Mg CO2-eq ha-1 year-1 at a N surplus of 319 kg N ha-1 year-1. The farm N surplus can relatively easily be determined on practical farms from the farm records of imports and exports and the composition of the crop rotation. The GHG emissions per product unit (milk or metabolic energy) were quite closely related to the farm N efficiency, and a doubling of the N efficiency from 12.5 to 25% reduced the emissions per product unit by ca. 50%. The farm N efficiency may therefore be used as a proxy for comparing the efficiencies of farms with respect to supplying products with a low GHG emission. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Lead (Pb) is a naturally occurring element that poses environmental hazards when present at elevated concentration. It is being released into the environment because of industrial uses and from the combustion of fossil fuels. Hence, Pb is ubiquitous throughout global ecosystems. The existence of potentially harmful concentrations of Pb in the environment must be given full attention. Emissions from vehicles are major source of environmental contamination by Pb. Thus, it becomes imperative that concentrations of Pb and other hazardous materials in the environment not only in the Philippines, but elsewhere in the world be adequately examined in order that development of regulations and standards to minimize risk associated with these materials in urban areas is continued. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the levels of Pb in soil from selected urbanized cities in central region of the Philippines; (2) to identify areas with soil Pb concentration values that exceed estimated natural concentrations and allowable limits; and (3) to determine the possible sources that contribute to elevated soil Pb concentration (if any) in the study area. Methods. This study was limited to the determination of Pb levels in soils of selected urbanized cities located in central region in the Philippines, namely: Site 1 - Tarlac City in Tarlac; Site 2 - Cabanatuan City in Nueva Ecija; Site 3 - Malolos City in Bulacan; Site 4 - San Fernando City in Pampanga; Site 5 - Balanga City in Bataan; and Site 6 - Olongapo City in Zambales. Soil samples were collected from areas along major thoroughfares regularly traversed by tricycles, passenger jeepneys, cars, vans, trucks, buses, and other motor vehicles. Soil samples were collected from five sampling sites in each of the study areas. Samples from the selected sampling sites were obtained approximately 2 to 3 meters from the road. Analysis of the soil samples for Pb content was conducted using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. This study was conducted from 2003 to 2004. Since this study assumed that vehicular emission is the major source of Pb contamination in urban soil, other information which the researchers deemed to have bearing on the study were obtained such as relative quantity of each gasoline type disposed of in each city within a given period and volume of traffic in each sampling site. A survey questionnaire for gasoline station managers was prepared to determine the relative quantity of each fuel type (diesel, regular gasoline, premium gasoline, and unleaded gasoline) disposed of or sold within a given period in each study area. Results and Discussion. Analysis of soil samples for Pb content showed the presence of Pb in all the soil samples collected from the 30 sampling sites in the six cities at varying concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 251 mg kg-1. Elevated levels of Pb in soil (i.e. greater than 25 mg kg-1 Pb) were detected in five out of the six cities investigated. Site 4 recorded the highest Pb concentration (73.9 ± 94.4 mg kg-1), followed by Site 6 (56.3 ± 17.1 mg kg-1), Site 3 (52.0 ± 33.1 mg kg-1), Site 5 (39.3 ± 19.0 mg kg-1), and Site 2 (38.4 ± 33.2 mg kg-1). Soil Pb concentration in Site 1 (16.8 ± 12.2 mg kg -1) was found to be within the estimated natural concentration range of 5 to 25 mg kg-1. Site 1 registered the least Pb concentration. Nonetheless, the average Pb concentration in the soil samples from the six cities studied were all found to be below the maximum tolerable limit according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The high Pb concentration in Site 4 may be attributed mainly to vehicular emission. Although Site 4 only ranked 3rd in total volume of vehicles, it has the greatest number of Type B and Type C vehicles combined. Included in these categories are diesel trucks, buses, and jeepneys which are considered the largest contributors of TSP (total suspended particles) and PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns) emissions. Conclusion. Only one (San Juan in Site 4) of the thirty sampling sites recorded a Pb concentration beyond the WHO permissible limit of 100 mg kg-1. San Juan in Site 4 had a Pb concentration of &gt;250 mg kg-1. On the average, elevated Pb concentration was evident in the soil samples from San Fernando, Olongapo, Malolos, Balanga, and Cabanatuan. The average soil Pb concentrations in these cities exceeded the maximum estimated natural soil Pb concentration of 25 mg kg-1. Average soil Pb concentration in Site 1 (16.8 mg kg-1) was well within the estimated natural concentration range of 5 to 25 mg kg-1. Data gathered from the study areas showed that elevated levels of Pb in soil were due primarily to vehicular emissions and partly to igneous activity. Recommendation and Outlook. The findings of this study presented a preliminary survey on the extent of Pb contamination of soils in urban cities in central region of Philippines Island. With this kind of information on hand, government should develop a comprehensive environmental management strategy to address vehicular air pollution in urban areas, which shows as one of the most pressing environmental problems in the country. Basic to this is the continuous monitoring of Pb levels and other pollutants in air, soil, and water. Further studies should be conducted to monitor soil Pb levels in the six cities studied particularly in areas with elevated Pb concentration. The potential for harm from Pb exposure cannot be understated. Of particular concern are children who are more predisposed to Pb toxicity than adults. Phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated sites is strongly recommended to reduce Pb concentration in soil.

Two emission inventories (EI) were developed: emissions for the first EI were based upon the National Emission Trend 1996 (NET96) database and the BEIS2 biogenic emission model, and emissions for the second EI were developed through a ""bottom up"" approach that included biogenic emissions obtained from the GLOBEIS model. The two simulations showed that elevated PM2.5 concentrations occurred near and downwind of the Interstate-5 corridor along the foothills of the Cascade Mountains and in forested areas of central Idaho. The relative contributions of organic and inorganic aerosols varied by region, but generally organic aerosols constituted the largest fraction of PM2.5. In wilderness areas near the 1-5 corridor, organic carbon from anthropogenic sources contributed approximately 50% of the total organic carbon with the remainder from biogenic precursors, while in wilderness areas in Idaho, biogenic organic carbon accounted for 80% of the total organic aerosol. Regional analysis of the secondary organic aerosol formation in the Columbia River Gorge, Central Idaho, and the Olympics/Puget Sound showed that the production rate of secondary organic carbon depends on local terpene concentrations and the local oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, which was strongly influenced by anthropogenic emissions. Comparison with observations from 12 IMPROVE sites and 21 ozone monitoring sites showed that results from the two EI simulations generally bracketed the average observed PM parameters and that errors calculated for the model results were within acceptable bounds. Analysis across all statistical parameters indicated that the NW-AIRQUEST EI solution performed better at predicting PM2.5, PM1, and βext even though organic carbon PM was over-predicted, and the NET96 EI solution performed better with regard to the inorganic aerosols. For the NW-AIRQUEST EI solution, the normalized bias was 30% and the normalized absolute error was 49% for PM2.5 mass. The NW-AIRQUEST solution slightly overestimated peak hourly ozone downwind of urban areas, while the NET96 solution slightly underestimated peak values, and both solutions over-predicted average O 3 concentrations across the domain by approximately 6 ppb. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosols; Concentration (process); Database systems; Error analysis; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Anthropogenic sources; Biogenic emissions; Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system; Regional analysis; Ozone; acetic acid derivative; aldehyde; alkane; alkene; ammonia; carbon; carbon monoxide; cresol; ethane; ethylene; formaldehyde; isoprene; ketone; methane; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; organic carbon; ozone; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; sulfuric acid; terpene; toluene; xylene; Aerosols; Concentration (process); Database systems; Error analysis; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Ozone; aerosol formation; air quality; ozone; aerosol; air quality; article; exhaust gas; meteorology; model; particulate matter; simulation; United States; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Idaho; Models, Theoretical; Nitrates; Oregon; Ozone; Particle Size; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Reproducibility of Results; Sulfates; Washington; Cascade Range; Columbia River; Idaho; North America; Puget Sound; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33144486882

Models to estimate particulate matter emissions from windblown dust are generally based on the local wind speed, the threshold wind speed to initiate erosion, and the soil texture of a given surface. However, precipitation, soil crusting, and soil disturbance can dramatically change the threshold wind speed and erosion potential of a surface, making modeling difficult. A low-cost sampling and analysis method was developed to account for these surface changes in a wind erosion model. Windblown dust emissions measured as PM10 (particulate matter less than a nominal 10 μm aerodynamic diameter) have been found to be generally proportional to sand flux (also known as saltation flux). In this study, a model was used to estimate sand flux using the relationship Q=AρG/g, where Q is horizontal sand flux, A is a surface erosion potential factor, ρ is air density, g is the gravitational constant, and G = ∫ u* ( u*2 - u*t 2 ) d t, where u* is friction velocity and u*t is the threshold friction velocity of the surface. The variable A in the model was derived by comparing the measured sand flux for a given period and area to G for the same period. Sand flux was monitored at Owens Lake, CA using low-cost Cox Sand Catchers (CSCs) for monthly measurements, and more expensive electronic sensors (Sensits) to measure hourly flux rates and u*t. Monitors were spaced 1 km apart at 114 sites, covering one clay and three sand-dominated soil areas. Good model results relied primarily on the erosion potential A, which could be determined from CSC measurements and wind speed data. Annual values for A were found to range from 1.3 to 3.5 in the three sand areas. The value of A was an order of magnitude lower (0.2) in the less erodible clay area. Previous studies showed similar values for A of 0.7 and 2.9 for a sandy site at Owens Lake, and 1.1 for a site in the Chihuahuan desert in New Mexico. The model performed well using annual values for A and better with monthly values, with R2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.87 for hourly sand flux rates in the four study areas. Monthly changes in A accounted for temporal surface changes, such as precipitation and surface crusting in the model predictions. This study demonstrated that low-cost periodic sand flux sampling using CSCs can provide a practical method to determine values for A in a simple wind erosion model, and that this model can provide good hourly and monthly estimates of sand flux rates in windblown dust areas. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study presents an evaluation of the MMF through a comparison of its output with the output from the CAM and with data from two observational sites operated by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program, one at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in Oklahoma and one at the island of Nauru in the tropical western Pacific (TWP) region. Two sets of one-year-long simulations are considered: one using climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and another using 1999 SST. Each set includes a run with the MMF as well as a CAM run with traditional or standard cloud and radiation treatments. Time series of cloud fraction, precipitation intensity, and downwelling solar radiation flux at the surface are analyzed. For the TWP site, the distributions of these variables from the MMF run are shown to be more consistent with observation than those from the CAM run. This change is attributed to the improved representation of convective clouds in the MMF compared to the conventional climate model. For the SGP, the MMF shows little to no improvement in predicting the same quantities. Possible causes of this lack of improvement are discussed. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Clouds; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Solar radiation; Cloud fraction; Cloud-resolving model; Community atmospheric model; Sea surface temperatures; Climatology; atmospheric modeling; climate modeling; convective cloud; radiometric survey; sea surface temperature; time series analysis; Great Plains; Micronesia; Nauru; North America; Oklahoma [United States]; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; United States; Strawberry green petal phytoplasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744465029

Managers undertaking nutrient-reduction strategies aimed at controlling estuarine eutrophication are faced with the challenge that upstream freshwater segments often are phosphorus (P)-limited, whereas more saline downstream segments are nitrogen (N)-limited. Management also must consider climatic (hydrologic) variability, which affects nutrient delivery and processing. The interactive effects of selective nutrient input reductions and climatic perturbations were examined in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, a shallow estuary with more than a 30-year history of accelerated nutrient loading and water quality decline. The NRE also has experienced a recent increase in Atlantic hurricanes and record flooding, which has affected hydrology and nutrient loadings. The authors examined the water quality consequences of selective nutrient (P but not N) reductions in the 1980s, followed by N reductions in the 1990s and an increase in hurricane frequency since the mid-1990s. Selective P reductions decreased upstream phytoplankton blooms, but increased downstream phytoplankton biomass. Storms modified these trends. In particular, upstream annual N and P concentrations have decreased during the elevated hurricane period. Increased flushing and scouring from storms and flooding appear to have enhanced nutrient retention capabilities of the NRE watershed. From a management perspective, one cannot rely on largely unpredictable changes in storm frequency and intensity to negate anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and eutrophication. To control eutrophication along the hydrologically variable freshwater-marine continuum, N and P reductions should be applied adaptively to reflect point-source-dominated drought and non-point-source-dominated flood conditions. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Climate change; Estuaries; Eutrophication; Hurricanes; Nitrogen; Nutrient management; Phosphorus; Water quality","Climate change; Eutrophication; Floods; Storms; Water quality; Watersheds; Freshwater; Nutrient management; Storm frequency; Estuaries; nitrogen; phosphorus; climate change; environmental management; eutrophication; algal bloom; article; biomass; climate change; disaster; environmental monitoring; estuary; eutrophication; flooding; freshwater environment; hydrology; marine environment; nutrient; nutrient loading; nutrient management; phytoplankton; United States; water quality; watershed; Biomass; Chlorophyll; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Eutrophication; Natural Disasters; Nitrogen; North Carolina; Phosphorus; Water; Water Movements; Neuse Estuary; North America; North Carolina; United States; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32444451112

Understanding the physical processes, relating SST variations to changes in the amount and distribution of African rainfall, is a key factor in improving weather and climate forecasts in this highly vulnerable region. Here, we present sensitivity experiments from a regional climate model with prescribed warmer tropical SSTs, according to enhanced greenhouse conditions at the end of the 21st century. This dynamical downscaling approach provides information about the nonlinear response of the atmosphere to oceanic heating. It has been suggested that the response is at least partly accounted for by the linear theory of tropical dynamics, involving a Kelvin and Rossby wave response to a tropical heat source. We compute the major modes of the linear Matsuno-Gill model for geopotential height and horizontal wind components and project the simulated response patterns onto these linear modes, in order to evaluate to which extent the simple linear theory may explain the SST-induced climate anomalies over Africa. A multivariate Hotelling T2 test is used to evaluate whether these anomalies are statistically significant. Forcing the regional climate model by warmer SSTs leads to substantial climate anomalies over tropical Africa: Rainfall is increases over the Guinea Coast region (GCR) and tropical East Africa, but decreases over the Congo Basin and the Sahel Zone (SHZ). At the 850hPa level, a trough develops over southern West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea, and is associated with stronger surface wind convergence over the GCR. These changes in the atmospheric dynamics strongly project onto the leading modes of the linear Matsuno-Gill model at various zonal wave numbers. The corresponding atmospheric heating pattern is highly reminiscent of the simulated nonlinear model reponse. The T2 test statistics reveal that the SST forcing induces a statistically significant climate anomaly over tropical Africa if the climate state vector is reduced by projecting the simulated data onto the leading 10 linear modes.

Our results confirmed that the band gap of semiconductor zigzag carbon nanotubes is reduced on addition of F or Cl atoms on the walls of the nanotubes. For metallic armchair nanotubes, the doubly degenerate states crossing the Fermi level were separated by the introduction of F or Cl atoms. An additional energy level emerged near the Fermi level, due to coupling between the carbon nanotube and the F or Cl atom. For zigzag nanotubes, charge transfers of 0.27e from the tube to the Cl atom and of 0.41e to the F atom took place, while for armchair nanotubes, the charge transfers from the nanotube to Cl and F are 0.25 and 0.42e, respectively. The Cl-C and F-C bond lengths were found to be 2.09 and 1.49, respectively. The systems show semiconducting behaviour when charged with one electron per halogen atom, but remain metallic under hole injection, regardless of the chirality of the carbon nanotubes. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Adsorption; Atoms; Charge transfer; Chlorine compounds; Electron energy levels; Energy gap; Fermi level; Fluorine; Semiconductor materials; Hole injection; Metallic armchair nanotubes; Semiconducting behavior; Single wall carbon nanotubes; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744488267

These toxic emissions have been reduced by the help of various inhibitors added to fuel before incineration. Knowledge of the congener pattern and homologue profiles of PCDD/F, PCB and PCBz is important to elaborate the mechanism of formation and inhibition of the toxic compounds formed during co-combustion of solid waste and coal. Principle component analysis (PCA) is used in order to find the similarity between the samples and separate them according their toxicity. By the help of the component analysis (CA) the best correlated congeners are effectively detected. Using linear regression between the independent variables and the indicator parameters various good correlated pairs between PCDD/F, PCB and PCBz have been elaborated. Generally it was found that the samples with higher toxicity show a good correlation between tetra- and pentachlorinated benzenes and tetra- and pentachlorinated dibenzo-p-furans. The best indicator parameter for PCDD/F World Health Organization toxic equivalent (WHO-TEQ) among the PCBz congeners investigated is 1,2,4,5-TCBz. This isomer is also significantly correlated with PCDD/F WHO-TEQ and with the sum of PCDD/F WHO-TEQ and PCB WHO-TEQ. However for samples with higher percentage of inhibitors the above mentioned relationship between the surrogate and WHO-TEQ disappeared.

Objectives: To summarize the current state of evidence for prophylaxis of contrast-induced nephropathy, provide evidence-based recommendations regarding management of high-risk patients undergoing angiographic procedures, and identify new avenues for research. Data Sources: Systematic searches of peer-reviewed publications were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database from 1966 to January 2006. Search terms included radio contrast nephropathy, contrast media, acetylcysteine, theophylline, sodium bicarbonate, HMGCo-A reductase inhibitors, ascorbic acid, kidney diseases, renal insufficiency, kidney failure, nephropathy, fenoldopam, diuretics, and saline or half saline. Study Selection: Observational studies of risk factors and randomized controlled trials of prophylaxis strategies for contrast-induced nephropathy that specified a definition of contrast-induced nephropathy or postprocedure creatinine level as an outcome measure. Evidence Synthesis: Important patient-related risk factors for contrast-induced nephropathy include chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, older age, anemia, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Non-patient-related risk factors include high-osmolar contrast, ionic contrast, contrast viscosity, and contrast volume. Practice guidelines recommend obtaining preprocedural serum creatinine levels among patients with renal disease, diabetes, proteinuria, hypertension, gout, or congestive heart failure. Available evidence, largely based on small- to medium-sized trials, supports the use of hydration, bicarbonate, and low volumes of iso- or low-osmolar contrast in patients at risk. N-acetylcysteine or ascorbic acid may be of value in very high-risk patients. Conclusions: While several risk factors for contrast-induced nephropathy have been identified, the development of an effective prophylaxis strategy for contrast-induced nephropathy has been limited by our poor understanding of the pathophysiology and the clinical significance of this condition. Future research should focus on correctly identifying higher-risk patients and testing therapies in the setting of large well-powered clinical trials. ©2006 American Medical Association.

Terrestrial studies demonstrate that jarosite requires a unique environment for its formation, crystallizing from highly acidic (pH &lt; 4) S-rich brines under highly oxidizing conditions. A likely scenario for jarosite formation on Mars is that degassing of shallow magmas likely released SO2 that reacted with aqueous solutions in shallow aquifers or on the martian surface. This interaction forms both H2SO4 and H2 S. A martian oxidant must be identified to both oxidize H2S to produce the required acidity of the fluid, and to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+. We suggest that reactions involving both sulfur and the reduction of CO2 to CO may provide part of the answer. The jarosite crystal structure is truly remarkable in terms of its tolerance for the substitution of a large number of different cations with different ionic radii and charges. The structure accommodates hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, the stable isotope systematics of which are strong recorders of low-temperature fluid-rock-atmosphere interactions. Jarosite has been proven to be a robust chronometer for Ar-Ar and K-Ar dating techniques, and there is every reason to believe that U-Pb, Rb-Sr, and Nd-Sm techniques for older jarosite from Mars will also be robust. Although the discovery of jarosite on Mars alone, with no other analytical measurements on the phase, has given us insights to martian surficial processes, the true power of jarosite can not be exploited until jarosite is sampled and returned from Mars. Mars sample return is a long way off but, until then, we should be vigilant about examining martian meteorites for alteration assemblages that contain jarosite. A suite of jarosite samples representing a significant time span on Mars may hold the key to reading the record of martian atmospheric evolution. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed a pronounced diurnal pattern: the proportional contribution of natural gas combustion varied from 30-40% of total anthropogenic CO2 during evening rush hour to 60-70% at pre-dawn. In addition, over a warming period of several days, the proportional contribution of natural gas combustion decreased with air temperature, likely related to decreased residential heating.

It is thought that AhR mediates these effects through the untimely and disproportionate expression of specific genes. However, the exact mechanism, or the genes involved, through which TCDD leads to these effects is still unknown. This study reports the discovery of a novel target gene, epiregulin, which is regulated by TCDD-activated AhR. Epiregulin is a growth regulator which belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family. Using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR), it was established that TCDD upregulates epiregulin gene expression. The promoter region of epiregulin has a dioxin responsive element (DRE) 56 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site, along with three potential Sp1 binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with an anti-AhR antibody showed promoter occupancy upon TCDD treatment. Luciferase reporter assays using a vector harboring the first 125 base pairs of the epiregulin rat promoter revealed an increase in signal on TCDD treatment, which was lost upon mutation of the DRE. Epiregulin and TCDD treatment mediated a dose-dependent increase in primary mouse keratinocyte growth. These results demonstrate that AhR directly increases epiregulin expression, which could play an important role in TCDD mediated tumor promotion observed in rodent models. © The Author 2005.

The membranes consist of a polyamide copolymer (IPC) layer or a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer on top of a polyethersulfone (PES) support membrane. For both membranes, the carbon dioxide permeance has a maximum as a function of the feed pressure at about 8 MPa. A good description of the maximum in the carbon dioxide permeance is possible with a model based on the ratio of the density to viscosity. A comparison with permeation results for nitrogen for feed pressures up to 16 MPa, supports the findings that viscous flow is the main mechanism for mass transport across the membranes. Both membranes show an increase in the carbon dioxide permeance as a function of the exposure time to supercritical carbon dioxide. Cross-linking of the IPC layer resulted in a stable IPC-based membrane at the cost of a small reduction in the carbon dioxide permeance. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to continuous deterioration of soil quality with conventional tillage and chemical fertilizer application, the economic viability and sustainability of cotton production in Georgia are questionable. Residue management systems (RMSs) comprising winter cover crops were analyzed as an alternative to the existing system, which consists of conventional tillage and chemical fertilizer using yield benefit, net revenue, carbon sequestration, and yield efficiency criteria. Four different RMSs were examined for profitability and input efficiency. Four RMSs encompassing tillage versus no-till and chemical versus organic sources of plant nutrients were compared for their yield and net return differences. No-till and poultry litter with a cover crop was the only system with a positive return and crop yield based on the results from experimental data. Limited results from the experimental field were reinforced using a simulation study. When cotton yield is simulated with an alternative level of organic matter and nitrogen application, production function shows efficiency in input application at the higher level of organic matter. Regression results based on an erosion productivity impact calculator/environmental policy integrated climate (EPIC) simulation indicated that, in the long term, a no-till and poultry litter system may have promise in the region. The results from simulation confirm the results from the experimental study. This study reflected a need to change the cotton management system from the 200-year-old practice of employing intensively cultivated conventional tillage and chemical fertilizers to a new renewable resource-based system where residue management and organic sources of nutrients would be the key components. © CAB International 2006.","Cotton yield; Organic matter; Production efficiency; Residue management systems","agricultural management; cotton; crop production; crop yield; Georgia; North America; United States; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744811149

Many UK local authorities have recently completed a review and assessment of local air quality, which has culminated in the declaration of Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) in many urban areas, where air pollution objectives are likely to be exceeded. Those local authorities who declare AQMAs are required to undertake a further stage of assessment, which involves the determination of the contribution of various sources of air pollution, such as airports. Many studies of this nature only consider an airport as one source, however, this study considers the impact of different airport related sources on local air quality from a dispersion modelling study of a large urban area. This paper describes the methodology, results and draws conclusions from a study that assesses the impact of a regional airport's sources (such as it's contribution from road traffic and aircraft). The paper also considers the effect of modelling the above ground aircraft emissions sources (climbout and approach) to different altitude heights.

Our goal is to review the issues surrounding the design of monitoring and regional upscaling of field-measured N2O emissions for Canadian conditions. Management history creates a range of controlling conditions and emission responses for each land use present in the study region and multiple fields should be sampled within each land use class. The requirement for multiple sample fields necessitates chamber-based sampling designs (ideally in conjunction with site-specific micrometeorological measurements). Uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVU) estimators have been recommended for estimation of the mean and variance of the sample distributions, but use of these estimators is limited where zero or negative values occur. Three basic annual emission patterns are observed across a range of N2O studies: background, seasonal, and event + seasonal. The event + seasonal pattern (where short duration, high emission events are superimposed on an underlying seasonal pattern) is common in Canadian agroecosystems. Background and seasonal annual patterns can be effectively captured with biweekly or even triweekly samplings. For the event + seasonal patterns more frequent samplings at periods when emission are believed to be higher (e.g., snow melt or post-fertilization events) are required. Linear interpolation of emissions between the sporadic measurements is the simplest and most reproducible method of temporal interpolation. Spatial extrapolation of the measured emissions is typically done by a measure and multiply approach, where the measured emissions for a given class are multiplied by the area of the class. The methods used to define the soil wetness, land use, and management classes should be clearly defined and consistently applied. The lack of information on the duration and magnitude of event-based emissions and the diurnal pattern of emissions is a major limitation to temporal interpolation.","Geographical information systems; Greenhouse gas; Landscape; Upscaling","background level; emission; estimation method; land use; nitrous oxide; pollution monitoring; sampling; seasonal variation; Canada; North America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845964763

The diagenetic reactions operating within carbonate sediments that fall under the influence of iron-rich (terrigenous) sediment input are less clearly understood. Such inputs should modify carbonate diagenetic reactions both by minimizing bacterial sulphate reduction in favour of bacterial iron reduction, and by the reaction of any pore-water sulphide with iron oxides, thereby minimizing sulphide oxidation and associated acidity. To test this hypothesis sediment cores were taken from sites within Discovery Bay (north Jamaica), which exhibit varying levels of Ferich bauxite sediment contamination. At non-impacted sites sediments are dominated by CaCO3 (up to 99% by weight). Pore waters from the upper few centimetres of cores show evidence for active sulphate reduction (reduced SO4/Cl-) ratios) and minor CaCO3 dissolution (increased Ca2+/Cl-) ratios). Petrographic observations of carbonate grains (specifically Halimeda and Amphiroa) show clear morphological evidence for dissolution throughout the sediment column. In contrast, at bauxite-impacted sites, the sediment is composed of up to 15% non-carbonate and contains up to 6000 μg g-1 Fe. Pore waters show no evidence for sulphate reduction, but marked levels of Fe(II), suggesting that bacterial Fe(III) reduction is active. Carbonate grains show little evidence for dissolution, often exhibiting pristine surface morphologies. Samples from the deeper sections of these cores, which pre-date bauxite influence, commonly exhibit morphological evidence for dissolution implying that this was a significant process prior to bauxite input. Previous studies have suggested that dissolution, driven by sulphate reduction and sulphide oxidation, can account for the loss of as much as 50% of primary carbonate production in localized platform environments. The finding that chemical dissolution is minor in a terrigenous-impacted carbonate environment, therefore, has significant implications for carbonate budgets and cycling, and the preservation of carbonate grains in such sediment systems. © 2006 The Authors.

This upward evolution in the face of a reluctant administration is historically consistent with the development of national legislation on other environmental and social issues in the US. At the heart of this movement is the need to resolve conflicts between high-intensity use of low-cost fossil energy supplies, and the dominating impact of carbon dioxide emissions on global climate change. US states are among the largest carbon dioxide emitters in the world and play a critical role in supplying and transforming energy, as well as consuming it, for economic advantage. State governments are also likely to have to shoulder some of the cost of potentially extensive climate damages and bear the brunt of the cost of implementing future federal mandates. As a result, many are taking proactive stances on the development of climate mitigation policy to prepare for, accelerate, and/or guide national policy. As US states show leadership on addressing greenhouse gas emissions, they also play an important role in forging policies and measures that reduce economic conflict between energy and climate goals. A number have launched or completed greenhouse gas mitigation plans and other major policies in the past few years that address these conflicts through: (1) finding ways to reduce mitigation costs, including the use of incentive-based policy instruments; (2) promoting an open and democratic policy process that includes major stakeholders; (3) promoting equity across socioeconomic groups, regions, and generations; and (4) promoting interregional cooperation. The results are promising and suggest that the state arena for climate and energy policy is evolving quickly and constructively toward alternatives that reduce conflict. Regional efforts are also unfolding, along with greater congressional attention to the lessons learned and commitments made by sub-federal actions. In the next few years many national energy and climate conflicts are likely to be tested and addressed by states. Among these, Pennsylvania is likely to be an important player due to its high profile of energy production and potential for leadership. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

For each metal, the unsaturated product has a triplet ground state; thus, spin crossover occurs during the reaction. All relevant stationary points on the two potential energy surfaces (PES) and the minimum energy crossing point (MECP) were optimized. Spin crossover occurs very near the σ-CH4 complex local minimum for the Co system, whereas the heavier Rh and Ir systems remain in the singlet state until the CH4 molecule is almost completely expelled from the metal co-ordination sphere. No local σ-CH4 minimum was found for the Ir system. The energetic profiles agree with the non-existence of the CoIII methyl hydride complex and with the greater thermal stability of the Ir complex relative to the Rh complex. Reductive elimination of methane from the related oxidized complexes [CpM(PH3)(CH3)(H)]+ (M = Rh, Ir) proceeds entirely on the spin doublet PES, because the 15-electron [CpM(PH 3)]+ products have a doublet ground state. This process is thermodynamically favored by about 25 kcal mol-1 relative to the corresponding neutral system. It is essentially barrierless for the Rh system and has a relatively small barrier (ca. 7.5 kcal mol-1) for the Ir system. In both cases, the reaction involves a σ-CH4 intermediate. Reductive elimination of ethane from [CpM(PH3)-(CH 3)2]+ (M = Rh, Ir) shows a similar thermodynamic profile, but is kinetically quite different from methane elimination from [CpM(PH3)(CH3)(H)]+: the reductive elimination barrier is much greater and does not involve a σ-complex intermediate. The large difference in the calculated activation barriers (ca. 12.0 and ca. 30.5 kcal mol-1 for the Rh and Ir systems, respectively) agrees with the experimental observation, for related systems, of oxidatively induced ethane elimination when M = Rh, whereas the related Ir systems prefer to decompose by alternative pathways. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

A reaction is deemed up- or downregulated if it is constrained to assume flux values significantly above or below its steady-state before the genetic manipulations. The developed framework is demonstrated by studying the overproduction of ethanol in Escherichia coli. Computational results reveal the existence of synergism between reaction deletions and modulations implying that the simultaneous application of both types of genetic manipulations yields the most promising results. For example, the downregulation of phosphoglucomutase in conjunction with the deletion of oxygen uptake and pyruvate formate lyase yields 99.8% of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield.

One approach for clarifying the diverse forces influencing plantderived C in the rhizosphere involves defining how elevated [CO2] alters the fundamental process of C transfer from plant roots to the soil. We examine here how a step increase in [CO2) affects the innate influx and efflux components of root exudation in axenic plants, as one foundation for understanding how climate change may affect rhizodeposition. Increasing [CO2] from 425 to 850 lmol mol-1 during short-term trials enhanced shoot and root dry weight (P&lt;0.01) of annual rye grass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and medic (Medicago truncatula L.) but had no effect on growth of maize (Zea mays L.). Root amino-acid flux in the same plants changed only in maize, which increased the efflux rate (nmol g root fresh weight-1 h-1) of six amino acids (arginine, alanine, proline, tyrosine, lysine and leucine) significantly (P&lt;0.05) under elevated [CO2]. None of the three plant species altered the steady-state concentration of 16 amino acids released into a hydroponic solution with changing [CO2], apparently because amino-acid influx rates, measured at 2.5 μ M, consistently exceeded efflux rates. Indeed, plants recovered amino acids at rates 94-374% higher than they were lost from roots regardless of [CO2]. These results indicate that, in theory, any effect of [CO2] doubling on amino-acid efflux can be offset by innately higher rates of influx. In practice, however, higher rates of amino-acid cycling (i.e., efflux + influx) for each root segment (in C4 maize) or from more root tissue two C3 species) should increase root exudation by plants exposed to elevated [CO2] as additional amino acids would be adsorbed to soil particles or be taken up by soil microorganisms. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amino-acid efflux; Amino-acid uptake; C3 plants; C4plants; ElevatedCO2","amino acid; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon flux; exudation; root system; Lolium; Lolium multiflorum; Medicago truncatula; Secale cereale; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645003490

This study's objective was to determine effects of elevated CO2 on production, mortality, and standing crops of fine root length over 2 years in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facility in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada, USA. Three replicate 25m diameter FACE rings were maintained at ambient (∼ 370 μmol mol-1) and elevated CO2 (∼ 550 μmol mol-1) atmospheric concentrations. Twenty-eight minirhizotron tubes were placed in each ring to sample three microsite locations: evergreen Larrea shrubs, drought-deciduous Ambrosia shrubs, and along systematic community transects (primarily in shrub interspaces which account for ∼ 85% of the area). Seasonal dynamics were similar for ambient and elevated CO2: fine root production peaked in April-June, with peak standing crop occurring about 1 month later, and peak mortality occurring during the hot summer months, with higher values for all three measures in a wet year compared with a dry year. Fine root standing crop, production, and mortality were not significantly different between treatments except standing crop along community transects, where fine root length was significantly lower in elevated CO2. Fine root turnover (annual cumulative mortality/mean standing crop) ranged from 2.33 to 3.17 year-1, and was not significantly different among CO2 treatments, except for community transect tubes where it was significantly lower for elevated CO2. There were no differences in fine root responses to CO2 between evergreen (Larrea) and drought-deciduous (Ambrosia) shrubs. Combined with observations of increased leaf-level water-use efficiency and lack of soil moisture differences, these results suggest that under elevated CO2 conditions, reduced root systems (compared with ambient CO2) appear sufficient to provide resources for modest aboveground production increases across the community, but in more fertile shrub microsites, fine root systems of comparable size with those in ambient CO2 were required to support the greater aboveground production increases. For community transects, development of the difference in fine root standing crops occurred primarily through lower stimulation of fine root production in the elevated CO2 treatment during periods of high water availability. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Belowground standing crop; CO2; Desert; FACE; Fine roots; Mortality; Production; Turn over","carbon dioxide enrichment; ecological impact; fine root; global change; nutrient uptake; plant water relations; Mojave Desert; North America; United States; Ambrosia; Larrea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645892565

As measures of the ""reproducibility"" of continental climate for different initial conditions, spatiotemporal correlations are computed across paired realizations of 11 model land surface variables in which the seasonal cycle is either included or excluded - the former case being pertinent to climate simulation and the latter to seasonal prediction. It is foun d that the land surface variables that include the seasonal cycle are impacted only marginally by changes in initial conditions; moreover, their seasonal climatologies exhibit high spatial reproducibility. In contrast, the reproducibility of a seasonal land surface anomaly is generally low, although it is substantially higher in the Tropics; its spatial reproducibility also markedly fluctuates in tandem with warm and cold phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. However, the overall degree of reproducibility depends on the particular land surface anomaly considered. It is also shown that the predictability of a land surface anomaly implied by its reproducibility statistics is consistent with what is inferred from more conventional predictability metrics. Implications of these results for climate model intercomparison projects and for operational forecasts of seasonal continental climate also are elaborated. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"climate modeling; general circulation model; land surface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645538996

The structural setting of the GTZ is due to syn- to late-metamorphic deformation, followed by a brittle thrusting that occurred in the Late Aquitanian times and can thus be related to one of the main contractional tectonic events suffered by northern Apennines. The GTZ was then sealed by Lower Burdigalian carbonate platform sediments (Visone Formation). Transtensive faulting followed in post-Burdigalian times along NW-SE regional faults and displaced the previously coupled sedimentary and metamorphic units. The GTZ thus underwent a plastic-to-brittle evolution, during which carbonate-rich fluids largely sustained the deformation. In these stages, a complex vein network originated within both the metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Field data and stable isotopic analyses (13C and 18O) of bulk rocks and veins show that fluid-rock interaction caused the carbonatisation of the rocks in the late-metamorphic stages and the cataclasis and recementation, by the action of isochemical cold carbonate groundwater during the thrusting events. Carbonate veins largely developed also during the transtensive faulting stages, with composition clearly different from that of the veins associated to thrust faults, as indicated by the strong depletion in 13C of carbonate fillings, suggesting the presence of exotic fluids, characterised by a high content of organic matter. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Faulting; Ligurian Alps; Methane-bearing fluids; Miocene tectonics; Stable isotopes; Tertiary Piemonte Basin","deformation; faulting; isotopic analysis; metamorphic rock; sedimentary rock; shear zone; thrust; Alps; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Liguria; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646405479

The alphastat regulation hypothesis of physiological pH sensitivity suggests that proteins sense [H +] through changes in the ionization state of imidazole groups (alphaIm). To test whether imidazole is involved with IPC CO 2 sensitivity, we administered diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) intravenously while recording from IPC exposed to varying levels of inspired CO2. At physiological pH, DEPC converts pH sensitive imidazole groups to pH-insensitive N-carbethoxyhistidyl residues. Single cell extracellular neural recordings were made from vagal filaments in anesthetized, unidirectionally ventilated Anas platyrhynchos. Without DEPC, IPC discharge rate was inversely proportional to inspired CO2 with characteristic dynamic responses to rapid CO2 alterations (n = 10). After DEPC treatment (≥15 mM), mean sensitivity of IPC discharge to static inspired CO2 levels was decreased 75% (P &lt; 0.05), and mean peak dynamic IPC discharge rate was decreased 80% (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, we tested whether DEPC might alter IPC discharge by binding imidazole groups in the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), but we found no effect on CA catalytic rate. We conclude that DEPC inhibits IPC CO2 signal transduction by modifying imidazole groups on acid-sensitive proteins other than CA, possibly membrane acid-base exchangers or ion channels. These data support the alphastat regulation hypothesis in IPC CO2 respiratory chemoreception and suggests a more direct link between H+ and membrane excitability. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, protein productivity and cell yield on substrate are almost double that of the Mut+ (18.2 vs 9.3 mg A33 sc per gram of methanol). Induction at wet cell weight of 350 g · L -1 for the MutS also has a positive effect on the final product concentration. Both Mut+ and MutS phenotypes reach a maximum biomass density around 450 g · L-1 wet cell weight, independent of methanol concentration, reactor scale, or induction density. This reactor configuration allows for reproducible fermentation schemes with different Pichia pastoris phenotypes with AOX promoters, without prior knowledge of the culture growth parameters. © 2006 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.",,"Antibodies; Biomass; Bioreactors; Cells; Concentration (process); Feedback control; Fermentation; Genes; Organic compounds; Proteins; Substrates; Extracellular secretion; Fermentation schemes; Induction density; Pichia pastoris phenotypes; Methanol; Pichia pastoris; methanol; monoclonal antibody; article; biological model; bioreactor; biosynthesis; comparative study; drug effect; feedback system; fermentation; genetics; immunoglobulin variable region; metabolism; phenotype; Pichia; time; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Bioreactors; Feedback, Biochemical; Fermentation; Immunoglobulin Variable Region; Methanol; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Pichia; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745037971

Petrographic and chemical data for tufas and the siliciclastic detritus contained within them allow (1) assessment of possible diagenetic effects, (2) a development of a strategy for selection of carbonate samples with low initial Th contents, and (3) assessment of the uncertainty due to initial Th. This strategy allows us to produce precise U-Th dates from lacustrine carbonates. The principal consideration in dating such carbonates is the composition and quantity of initial Th incorporated into the carbonate, and additional uncertainty is introduced because this initial Th may have two sources in lacustrine deposits. Isochron plots, measured (230Th/ 232Th), and X-ray diffraction and trace element chemistry of silicic residues all favor regional soil and dust as the sole source of initial Th in carbonates from the Bolivian Altiplano, a situation that simplifies single-sample dating of Altiplano carbonates.

To understand the future evolution of the climate system and find ways to manage the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the processes and feedbacks that drive the carbon cycle must first be understood. However, our current knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns is uncertain, particularly over land and in regions of potentially high sensitivity to change like the boreal zone.

The service will feature estimation of global burned area, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), leaf area index (LAI) and Vegetation Growth Cycle. The demonstrator will focus on ten complete years, from 1998 to 2007 when overlap exists between ESA Earth Observation sensors and others that are synergistic.

Preclinical studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that prefrontal rTMS can induce dopamine release in mesostriatal and mesolimbic regions. We therefore investigated whether rTMS also modulates striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission in depressed patients using a dynamic [123I] iodobenzamide (IBZM) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) approach. Five patients with a major depressive episode (DSM-IV) underwent an acute 10 Hz rTMS challenge with 3000 stimuli over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during an [123I] IBZM-SPECT bolus and constant infusion protocol. In four subjects the protocol was repeated after a three week rTMS standard treatment. Striatal IBZM binding to dopamine D2 receptors was assessed with a region-of-interest (ROI) technique. The change in striatal IBZM binding after the rTMS challenge was regarded as measure of change in endogenous striatal dopamine. Data of nine SPECT investigations showed a significant reduction by 9.6 ± 6.2% in IBZM binding to striatal dopamine D2 receptors after rTMS challenge compared to baseline (p = 0.01, Wilcoxon test). In this preliminary study, the reduction of IBZM binding observed after rTMS challenge is suggestive of a release in endogenous dopamine induced by prefrontal rTMS. In future, this approach can be used to differentiate specific and non-specific reward-related effects of rTMS on dopaminergic neurotransmission. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This phenomenon has major implications for hydrological processes, including meltwater production and runoff. Furthermore, as indicated by aircraft observations, it affects land-surface-atmosphere exchanges, leading to a high degree of variability in surface energy terms during melt. The heterogeneity and related differences when certain parts of the landscape become snow free also affects the length of the growing season and the carbon cycle. Small-scale variability in arctic snowmelt is addressed here by combining a spatially distributed end-of-winter snow cover with simulations of variable snowmelt energy balance factors for the small arctic catchment of Trail Valley Creek (63 km2). Throughout the winter, snow in arctic tundra basins is redistributed by frequent blowing snow events. Areas of above- or below-average end-of-winter snow water equivalents were determined from land-cover classifications, topography, land-cover-based snow surveys, and distributed surface wind-field simulations. Topographic influences on major snowmelt energy balance factors (solar radiation and turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat) were modelled on a small-scale (40 m) basis. A spatially variable complete snowmelt energy balance was subsequently computed and applied to the distributed snow cover, allowing the simulation of the progress of melt throughout the basin. The emerging patterns compared very well visually to snow cover observations from satellite images and aerial photographs. Results show the relative importance of variable end-of-winter snow cover, spatially distributed melt energy fluxes, and local advection processes for the development of a patchy snow cover. This illustrates that the consideration of these processes is crucial for an accurate determination of snow-covered areas, as well as the location, timing, and amount of meltwater release from arctic catchments, and should, therefore, be included in hydrological models. Furthermore, the study shows the need for a subgrid parameterization of these factors in the land surface schemes of larger scale climate models. Copyright © 2005 Crown in the right of Canada.

We take advantage of the marked difference between the energy spectra of the unscattered and scattered photons, and use the detailed energy information that comes with the list-mode data for the estimation of the scattered events distribution in the data space. Also, inside the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM) image reconstruction algorithm, we introduce energy-dependent factors that individualize the correction terms for each event, given its position and energy information. The central piece of our approach is the two-dimensional detector energy response model represented as a linear combination of four components, each one representing a particular state a PET event can be found in: both photons unscattered, the second scattered while the first not, the first photon scattered while the second not and both photons scattered. For a set of events collected in the vicinity of a point in the projection space, the coefficient of each component is determined by applying a statistical estimator. As a result we obtain the number of scattered events that are in the given set. The model also gives us the variation of scatter fraction with the photon pair energies for that particular position in the data space.

The latter can be well constrained with present knowledge. We present a detailed, up-to-date compilation of the atmospheric parameters, chemical composition, multiplicity, and degree of chromospheric activity for the astrobiologically interesting solar-type stars within 10 parsecs of the Sun. We determined their state of evolution, masses, ages, and space velocities, and produced an optimized list of candidates that merit serious scientific consideration by the future space-based interferometry probes aimed at directly detecting Earth-sized extrasolar planets and seeking spectroscopic infrared biomarkers as evidence of photosynthetic life. The initially selected stars number 33 solar-type within the total population (excluding some incompleteness for late M-dwarfs) of 182 stars closer than 10 parsecs.

The distribution of sodium emission over the surface was generally non-uniform and changeable. When the dawn terminator was in view, the terminator was generally brighter than the limb, as expected for evaporation of condensed sodium at the dawn terminator. Also, the excess emission reached its largest values when radiation acceleration reached one or the other of its two maxima, as expected for the effect of radiation acceleration on sodium distribution. When the dusk terminator was in view, the limb was generally brighter than the terminator. The difference was larger than would be expected for a uniform sodium exosphere, suggesting that there is a deficit of sodium near the dusk terminator. There was no apparent effect of radiation acceleration on the ratio, which might be the result of a very large deficit of sodium near the dusk terminator. For the northern and southern hemispheres, excess sodium was observed about a third of the time in one or the other hemisphere, appearing at random intervals of true anomaly and longitude. The random nature of these occurrences suggests an external cause, one not correlated with any characteristic of the planetary orbit or planetary geochemistry. We suggest that the northern or southern excess sodium events are the result of solar weather, whereby solar particles are precipitated to the surface at high latitudes, and produce localized sources of sodium. IMF configurations for which solar particles can precipitate to high latitudes on the surface occur about 30% of the time, in general agreement with the observed frequency of north or south excess emission. Near periods of maximum radiation acceleration, some images displayed two peaks of sodium emission, one peak at high northern latitudes, the other at high southern latitudes. One possible cause could be the accumulation of sodium near the terminator, pushed there by radiation acceleration. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming. Seventeen years ago, in the mountains of Costa Rica, the Monteverde harlequin frog (Atelopus sp.) vanished along with the golden toad (Bufo periglenes). An estimated 67% of the 110 or so species of Atelopus, which are endemic to the American tropics, have met the same fate, and a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is implicated. Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures, we conclude with 'very high confidence' (>99%, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) that large-scale warming is a key factor in the disappearances. We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium, thus encouraging outbreaks. With climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity, the urgency of reducing greenhouse-gas concentrations is now undeniable. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Air; Biodiversity; Diseases; Fungi; Marine biology; Natural sciences; Pathology; Epidemic disease; Golden toad; Harlequin frog; Pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis); Global warming; amphibian; extinction; global warming; air temperature; Amphibia; climate; Costa Rica; epidemic; frog; fungus; fungus growth; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; priority journal; review; sea surface temperature; species extinction; toad; Amphibia; Anura; Atelopus; Batrachochytrium; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bufo periglenes; Fungi",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30544434293

Moreover, effects of reductant (carbon) amount and smelting time on TiO2 and FeO content of slag and iron recovery were studied. It is found that addition of carbon excess to stoichiometric amount decreases the iron recovery and TiO2 content in slag. If the smelting time keeps between 0 to 17 min, the TiO2 content and iron recovery will be increased, whereas smelting time in excess of 17 min will cause products decline significantly. At optimum conditions, TiO2 content in slag and the iron recovery are 70 wt.% and 84%, respectively. Kinetic studies proved that the reduction of equivalent FeO was first-order reaction. The studies made by X-ray diffraction analysis showed that formation of the titanium sub-oxides (Ti3O 5 and Ti2O3) causes the decrease in iron recovery and TiO2 content. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

All this must be achieved with expected increase in capacity and demand. Such a challenge has to be in a background where the understanding of physics of flight has changed very little over the years and where industrial growth is driven primarily by cost rather than new technology. The way forward to meet the challenges is to introduce innovative technologies and develop an integrated, effective and efficient process for the life cycle design of aircraft, known as systems engineering (SE). SE is a holistic approach to a product that comprises several components. Customer specifications, conceptual design, risk analysis, functional analysis and architecture, physical architecture, design analysis and synthesis, and trade studies and optimisation, manufacturing, testing validation and verification, delivery, life cycle cost and management. Further, it involves interaction between traditional disciplines such as Aerodynamics, Structures and Flight Mechanics with people- and process-oriented disciplines such as Management, Manufacturing, and Technology Transfer. SE has become the state-of-the-art methodology for organising and managing aerospace production. However, like many well founded methodologies, it is more difficult to embody the core principles into formalised models and tools. The key contribution of the paper will be to review this formalisation and to present the very latest knowledge and technology that facilitates SE theory. Typically, research into SE provides a deeper understanding of the core principles and interactions, and helps one to appreciate the required technical architecture for fully exploiting it as a process, rather than a series of events. There are major issues as regards to systems approach to aircraft design and these include lack of basic scientific/practical models and tools for interfacing and integrating the components of SE and within a given component, for example, life cycle cost, basic models for linking the key drivers. The paper will review the current state of art in SE approach to aircraft design and identify some of the major challenges, the current state of the art and visions for the future. The review moves from an initial basis in traditional engineering design processes to consideration of costs and manufacturing in this integrated environment. Issues related to the implementation of integration in design at the detailed physics level are discussed in the case studies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of this study and assay suggest coherency and complementarity of the multiple methodology used. Furthermore, bio-geographical, bio-physical and economic particularities of Switzerland, that differ largely from canton to canton, determine an important variation of local sustainability levels and capacity of response to climate forcing in action. We thus propose next to a general Swiss approach of sustainability, a subsequent differential treatment of cantons, based on spatial inequalities that are linked to primary physical, biological and economical structures and potentials. Despite of a unifying, global and federal approach, the implementation of sustainability measures and laws should be afterwards modulated in the case of each canton, by accounting for all these physical, biological, and anthropogenic disparities (equity treatment).","Cantons; Sustainability; Switzerland; Vulnerability","Cantons; Switzerland; Vulnerability; Climate change; Economic analysis; Regulatory compliance; Sustainable development; Ecology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247235076

These variably fossiliferous heterozoan deposits accumulated on a low-energy, mesotrophic, centripetal epeiric ramp during a gradual shift in climate from cool, wet conditions and abundant continent-derived nutrients to a seasonal, and climate with reduced delivery of trophic resources to the marine realm. Temporal trends in d13C and 6δ18O from unaltered brachiopods record an epeiric sea response to this warming. The globally recognized middle Miocene Monterey Event (∼ 17 to 13.5 Ma) dominates the carbon isotope record, albeit with higher (∼ 0.5‰) than open-ocean δ13C values. Such higher δ13C values are attributed to an increase in benthic carbonate production that accompanied climate change and the relatively short seawater mixing times characteristic of epeiric-sea systems. The Murray Basin oxygen isotope curve contains lower δ18O values (∼ 2.0‰ lower) than those of the deep-sea record. This difference is ascribed to the warmer seawater temperatures (∼ 17 to 22°C) that prevailed across the Miocene Murray Basin. These results show that the isotope chemistry of epeiric-sea brachiopods can be a reliable gauge of regional and global environmental evolution. Although diagenetic overprinting from meteoric cement-filled punctae and local forcing factors introduce ""noise"" that mutes isotopic signals, the open-ocean secular record is clearly discernible.

Application of the methodology is demonstrated using the land disposal boundary within Clark County, NV as the study area, which is currently classified as a non-attainment area by United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). The estimated PM-10 emissions depend on the extent of disturbed vacant land area, undisturbed vacant land area, emission factors by soil group, and wind speeds. Portable wind tunnel field test data were used to estimate emission factors at 78 sites in the study area. Portable wind tunnel results were categorized by the wind speed range and the corresponding site soil group in order to estimate emission factors by soil group and the wind speed range. Wind speed data were obtained from the Clark County Health District's air quality monitoring stations. The proximal area over which the wind speeds are same is obtained by constructing ""Thiessen"" polygons around each wind speed monitoring station. PM-10 emissions were estimated as a function of the extent of disturbed vacant lands, the measured or estimated erodibility of the soil surfaces, and the intensity, duration and frequency of erosive wind events. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Ashland Ave., Chicago, IL 60607, United States","The Bacillus subtilis PhoPR two-component system is directly responsible for activation or repression of Pho regulon genes in response to phosphate deprivation. The response regulator, PhoP, and the histidine kinase, PhoR, are encoded in a single operon with a complex promoter region that contains five known transcription start sites, which respond to at least two regulatory proteins. We report here the identification of another direct regulator of phoPR transcription, carbon catabolite protein A, CcpA. This regulator functions in the presence of glucose or other readily metabolized carbon sources. The maximum derepression of phoPR expression in a ccpA mutant compared to a wild-type stain was observed under excess phosphate conditions with glucose either throughout growth in a high-phosphate defined medium or in a low-phosphate defined medium during exponential growth, a growth condition when phoPR transcription is low in a wild-type strain due to the absence of autoinduction. Either HPr or Crh were sufficient to cause CcpA dependent repression of the phoPR promoter in vivo. A ptsH1 (Hpr) crh double mutant completely relieves phoPR repression during phosphate starvation but not during phosphate replete growth. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that CcpA repressed phoPR transcription by binding directly to the cre consensus sequence present in the promoter. Primer extension and in vitro transcription studies revealed that the CcpA regulation of phoPR transcription was due to repression of PA6, a previously unidentified promoter positioned immediately upstream of the cre box. EσA was sufficient for transcription of PA6, which was repressed by CcpA in vitro. These studies showed direct repression by CcpA of a newly discovered EσA-responsive phoPR promoter that required either Hpr or Crh in vivo for direct binding to the putative consensus ere sequence located between PA6 and the five downstream promoters characterized previously.

The molten slag, discharged at high temperature over 1700 K from smelting industries such as steelmaking or municipal waste incineration. It has enough potential for replacing energy required for hydrogen production due to the catalytic steam reforming or carbon decomposition of hydrocarbon. However, heat recovery of hot slag has never been established. Therefore, the objective of this work is to generate hydrogen from methane using heated slag particles as catalyst, in which the effect of temperature on the hydrogen generation was mainly investigated at range from 973 to 1273 K. In the experiments a mixed gas of CH4 and CO2 was continuously introduced into the packed bed of hot slag at constant flow-rate and atmospheric pressure and then the outlet gas was monitored by gas chromatography. The results indicate that slag acted as not only thermal media but also good catalyst, for promoting decomposition. The product gases were mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide with/without solid carbon deposition on the surface of slag, depending on the reaction temperature. Increasing temperature led to large hydrogen generation with decreasing un-reacted methane in the outlet gas, at when the largest methane conversion was about 96%. The results suggested a new energy-saving process of hydrogen production, in which the waste heat from molten slag can replace the energy required for hydrogen production, reducing carbon dioxide emission. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

It is proved in recent studies that human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells induced and cultured in vitro by recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhG-MCSF) and recombinant human interleukin4 (rhIL-4) can generate a great many dendritic cells and promote the lethal effect of T cells on human neuroblastoma, but it is unclear that whether the lethal effect is associated with the most proper concentration of dendritic cells. Objective: To investigate the lethal effect of human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells induced in vitro by cytokines differentiating into dendritic cells on human neuroblastoma, and its best concentration range. Design: Open experiment. Setting: Department of Pediatrics, the Medical School Hospital of Qingdao University. Materials: The study was carried out in the Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory (Laboratory for the Department of Pediatrics of the Medical School Hospital of Qingdao University) during September 2005 to May 2006. Human umbilical cord blood samples were taken from the healthy newborn infants of full-term normal delivery during October to November 2005 in the Medical School Hospital of Qingdao University, and were voluntarily donated by the puerperas. Main instruments: type 3111 CO2 incubator (Forma Scientific, USA), type 550 ELISA Reader (Bio-Rad, USA). Main reagents: neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH (Shanghai Institute of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences), RPMI-1640 culture fluid and fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), rhIL-4 (Promega, USA), rhG-MCSF (Harbin Pharmaceutic Group Bioengineering Co.Ltd), rat anti-human CD1a monoclonal antibody and FITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat IgG (Xiehe Stem cell Gene Engineering Co.Ltd). Methods: 1 Human umbilical cord blood mononuclear celis obtained with attachment methods differentiated into human umbilical cord blood dendritic cells, presenting typical morphology of dendritic cells after in vitro induction by rhG-MCSF and rhIL-4. 2 Different concentrations of dendritic cells [dendritic cells: neuroblastoma cells=20:1,50:1,100:1 (2× 108 L-1, 5× 108 L-1, 1 ×109 L-1)], 1 × 109 L-1 T cells and 1 × 107 L-1 neuroblastoma cells were added in the experimental group. 1 × 109 L-1 T cells and 1 × 107 L-1 neuroblastoma cells were added in the control group. 3 Main surface marker CD1a molecules of dendritic cells were detected with indirect immunofluorescence, and the percent rate of dendritic cells was counted with ultraviolet light and expressed as the expression rate of CD1a+ cells. 4 Single effector cells and target cells were respectively set in the experimental group and control group to obtain the lethal effect. The lethal effect of dendritic cells on neuroblastoma cells was indirectly evaluated by detecting cellular survival with MTT assay. The lethal effect(%)= (1-A experimental well-A effected cell well/A target cell well) × 100%.5 The experimental data were presented as Mean ±SD, and paired t test was used. Main outcome measures: 1 Morphological characters of dendritic cells in the process of induction and differentiation. 2CD1a+ cellular expression rate. 3 Lethal effect of dendritic cells on neuroblastoma cells. Results: 1 Morphological characters of dendritic cells in the process of induction and differentiation: On the 15th day after human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells were induced by rhG-MCSF and rhIL-4, typical morphology of dendritic cells could be seen under an inverted microscope. 2Expression rate of CD1a+ cells was (43.12±5.83)%. 3Lethal effect of dendritic cells on neuroblastorna cells: Lethal effect of dendritic cells stimulated T cells in each experimental group (dendritic cells: neuroblastoma cells=100:1,50:1, 20:1 respectively) on neuroblastoma cells was significantly higher than that in control group [(31.00 ±4.41)%, (30.92±5.27)%,(33.57±5.35)%,(26,23±5.20)%, t=3.51,2.98,4.24, P &lt; 0.01); But the lethal effect of dendritic Gells; on neuroblastoma was significantly lower when their ratio was 100:1 and 50:1 in comparison with 20:1 (t=2.01,2.36, P &lt; 0.05), and no significant difference in lethal effect existed between the ratio at 100:1 and 50:1 (t=0.06, P &gt; 0.05).

In the last years the toxicity of these compounds has been analyzed in details. For years PCDD/F inventories have pointed out the significant role of municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerators in the overall balance. Recently, thanks to new regulations on PCDD/F emissions, in a few countries this scenario is changing: it can be demonstrated that modern MSW incinerators can play a secondary role even if the percentage of MSW sent to combustion has increased. In the latest inventories an unconventional source of PCDD/F has appeared: in nineties some biogas characterizations have demonstrated that there is a release of PCDD/F from MSW sanitary landfills. In addition, the combustion of collected biogas can generate not negligible amounts of PCDD/F. A new question can be put: does the MSW contribute with other management options to the overall balance of PCDD/F? The present work points out that a detailed inventory should take into account also the PCDD/F release from bio-mechanical treatment plants (both composting and bio-drying/bio-stabilization plants). However the contribution from this option is secondary when it is compared with the one from old MSW incinerators. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The automobile emissions are the significant sources of gaseous pollutants and ultra fine particles in the atmosphere. In India, petrol and diesel engine vehicles emit a wide variety of pollutants principally benzene, carbon-monoxide (CO), lead (Pb) organic compounds (OCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and suspended particulate matter (SPM) like smoke, metals (Cd, Co, Cu, Zn, etc.), and inert dust.

Terminalia was more affected from toxic effects of auto exhaust, in comparison to Nyctanthes and Quisqualis.

Using a combination of genetic engineering and transgenic technology, three approaches to reduce photorespiration have been taken; two of these focused on increasing the carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco either by reducing the oxygenase reaction directly or by manipulating the Rubisco enzyme by concentrating CO 2 in the region of Rubisco through the introduction of enzymes of the C4 pathway. The third approach attempted to reduce photorespiration directly by manipulation of enzymes in this pathway. The progress in each of these areas is discussed, and the most promising approaches are highlighted. Under saturating CO2 conditions, Rubisco did not limit photosynthesis, and limitation shifted to ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration capacity of the C3 cycle.

Using scenarios it shows that, in order to meet stringent emissions targets over the coming half-century, technology and pricing policies may have to be supplemented by strategies to change life-styles and land uses in ways that effectively reduce car dependence. In the medium to long term, bold initiatives that treat vehicle users as citizens capable of shifting their interests and behaviour could form kernels of social change that in turn provide opportunities for removing many of the social and political constraints. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The above fluxes were related to regional variations in salinity, temperature and nutrient distribution. Annual fluxes of diatom opal range between 3 and 28 g m-2 yr-1, while planktonic foraminifera carbonate fluxes range between 6 and 23 g m-2 yr-1 and coccolithophorid carbonate fluxes range between 4 and 24 g m-2 yr-1. Annual planktonic foraminifera carbonate to coccolithophorid carbonate ratios range between 0.8 and 2.2 and coccolithophorid carbonate to diatom opal ratios range between 0.5 and 3.3. In the western Arabian Sea, coccolithophorids are the major contributors to biogenic flux during periods of low nutrient concentrations. Coccolithophorid carbonate fluxes decrease and planktonic foraminiferal carbonate and diatom opal fluxes increase when nutrient-rich upwelled waters are advected over the trap site. In the oligotropic eastern Arabian Sea, coccolithophorid carbonate fluxes are high throughout the year. Planktonic foraminiferal carbonate fluxes are the major contributors to biogenic flux in the EIOT. In the northern and central Bay of Bengal, when surface salinity values drop sharply during the SW monsoon, there is a drastic reduction in planktonic foraminiferal carbonate fluxes, but coccolithophorid carbonate and diatom opal fluxes remain steady or continue to increase. Distinctly higher annual molar Sibio/Cinorg (&gt;1) and C org/Cinorg (&gt;1.5) ratios are observed in the northern and central Bay of Bengal mainly due to lower foraminiferal carbonate production as a result of sharp salinity variations.

Nor do studies systematically explore a range of CO 2 capture efficiencies to identify the most cost-effective levels of CO 2 control and the key factors that affect such levels. An exploration of these issues is the focus of this paper. As part of the United States Department of Energy's Carbon Sequestration Program, we have developed an integrated modeling framework (called IECM-cs) to evaluate the performance and cost of alternative CCS technologies and power systems in the context of plant-level multipollutant control requirements. This paper uses IECM-cs to identify the most cost-effective level of CO 2 control using currently available amine-based CO 2 capture technology for PC plants. Two general cases are of interest. First, we examine the effects of systematically increasing the CO 2 capture efficiency of an amine-based system for PC applications over a broad range. We report two measures of cost: (i) capital cost and (ii) cost-effectiveness (cost per tonne of CO 2 avoided) relative to similar plants without CCS. Second, we examine the cost-effectiveness of plant designs that partially bypass the amine capture unit so as to achieve low to moderate reductions of CO 2, but at lower overall cost. Results from these cases are compared to the conventional case of a capture unit treating the entire flue gas stream. In each case, we identify the most cost-effective strategies and the key factors that affect those results. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Capture systems; Carbon Sequestration Programmes; CCS technologies; Coal-fired power plants; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Flue gases; Power plants; Strategic planning; Gas absorption; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Flue gases; Gas absorption; Power plants; Strategic planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646252954

We use the energy-systems optimization model MESSAGE considering endogenous learning for various technologies, such that they experience cost reductions as a function of accumulated capacity installations. We find that the existence of technological learning while reducing overall energy system costs becomes particularly important in the context of a long-term climate policy. Diversity in technological portfolios is emphasized and results indicate deployment of a range of energy technologies in reducing emissions. An important finding is that technological learning by itself is not sufficient for climate stabilization and that climate policies are an absolute necessary complimentary element. Under a climate constraint, spillovers across technologies and regions due to learning results in increased upfront investments and hence lower costs of carbon free technologies, thus resulting in technology deployment and emissions reductions, especially in developing countries. We conclude that learning and spillover effects can lead to technologically advanced cost-effective global energy transition pathways. We suggest that coordinated climate stabilization policies can serve as important institutional mechanisms that facilitate the required technological investments, especially in developing countries and thus ensure long-term cost reductions.

In situ XRD and TPR-MS techniques were applied to monitor the changes in the specimens when heating in H2 and H2 + Ar mixtures, respectively. The postactivation state of the catalysts (i.e., the state corresponding to ammonia synthesis conditions) was characterised chemically via interaction of the reduced samples with water vapour at 50 °C (H2 evolution) and also via interaction with oxygen at 0 °C. These experiments were supplemented with those of ammonia synthesis. Ruthenium was shown to facilitate the decomposition of caesium nitrate; whereas the Ru-free CsNO3/C reference materials are stable in a flowing H2 + Ar mixture up to about 400 °C, the CsNO3 decomposition starts at 100-120 °C for the CsNO3-Ru/C catalysts (XRD, TPR-MS) and proceeds via a CsOHṡH2O-intermediate product that turns into an amorphous species at elevated temperatures, as indicated by XRD. Characterisation studies of the postactivation catalysts showed that caesium is partially reduced during operations and reacts with oxygen (O2 consumption) and water vapour (H2 evolution). The degree of promoter reduction resulting from H2 liberation varies from 0.25 to 0.45, depending on the Cs loading, Ru loading, and kind of carbon. Combining the O2 consumption and H2 evolution data suggests that a substoichiometric oxide (CsxOy; x / y = 2.7 - 3.6) exists on the catalyst surface rather than Cs0 + CsOH. High activities (TOFs) of the optimally promoted Cs-Ru/C systems in ammonia synthesis (63 bar, 370 and 400 °C) were ascribed to the strong promotional effect of partly reduced caesium (CsxOy) covering the Ru surface. A peculiar S-like shape of the TOF trace versus Cs loading is suggested to be a consequence of the promoter distribution between the carbon surface and surface of ruthenium. Clearly, the trend in TOF reflects that in Ru coverage by the CsxOy groups, the latter being controlled by the heats of CsxOy adsorption on ruthenium and on carbon, respectively. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a proof-of-concept evaluation of partitioning net CO2 exchanges for soil and plants in an arid, exclusively CAM mesocosm, with soil depth and succulent plant biomass approximating that of natural Sonoran Desert ecosystems. We present the first evidence that an enclosed CAM-dominated soil and plant community exposed to a substantial day/night temperature difference (30/20°C), exhibits a diel gas exchange pattern consisting of four consecutive phases with a distinct nocturnal CO2 uptake. These phases were modulated by plant assimilation and soil respiration processes. Day-time stomatal closure of the CAM cycle during phase III was used to eliminate aboveground photosynthetic assimilation and respiration and thereby to estimate belowground plant plus soil respiration. Rapid changes in temperature appeared to synchronize single plant gas exchange but individual plant gas exchange patterns were desynchronized at constant day/night temperatures (25°C), masking the distinct mesocosm pattern. Overall, the mean carbon budget of this CAM model Sonoran Desert system was negative, releasing an average of 22.5 mmol CO2 m-2 d -1. The capacity for nocturnal CO2 assimilation in this exclusively CAM mesocosm was inadequate to recycle CO2 released by plant and soil respiration. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Agave schottii; Carnegiea gigantea; Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM); Cylindropuntia versicolor; Ferocactus wislizeni; Gas exchange; Mesocosm; Opuntia engelmannii","carbon dioxide; crassulacean acid metabolism; agave; article; Cactaceae; circadian rhythm; desert climate; metabolism; microclimate; photosynthesis; soil; Agave; Cactaceae; Carbon Dioxide; Circadian Rhythm; Desert Climate; Ecological Systems, Closed; Photosynthesis; Soil; Agave; Agave schottii; Carnegiea gigantea; Crassulaceae; Ferocactus wislizeni; Opuntia; Opuntia engelmannii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31644450290

However, strenuous exercise, especially in the heat, appears to reduce MCA Vmean more than can be accounted for by the reduction in the arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2). This study evaluated whether the apparently large reduction in MCA Vmean at the end of exhaustive exercise relates to an enhanced cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity. The CO2 reactivity was evaluated in six young healthy male subjects by the administration of CO2 as well as by voluntary hypo- and hyperventilation at rest and during exercise with and without hyperthermia. At rest, PaCO2 was 5.1±0.2 kPa (mean ± SEM) and MCA Vmean 50.7±3.8 cm s-1 and the relationship between MCA Vmean and PaCO2 was linear (double-log slope 1.1±0.1). However, the relationship became curvilinear during exercise (slope 1.8±0.1; P &lt; 0.01 vs. rest) and during exercise with hyperthermia (slope 2.3±0.3; P &lt; 0.05 vs. control exercise). Accordingly, the cerebral CO2 reactivity increased from 30.5±2.7% kPa-1 at rest to 61.4±10.1% kPa-1 during exercise with hyperthermia (P &lt; 0.05). At exhaustion PaCO2 decreased 1.1±0.2 kPa during exercise with hyperthermia, which, with the determined cerebral CO2 reactivity, accounted for the 28±10% decrease in MCA Vmean. The results suggest that during exercise changes in cerebral blood flow are dominated by the arterial carbon dioxide tension. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Arterial carbon dioxide tension; Cerebral blood flow; End tidal carbon dioxide tension; Hyperthermia; Transcranial Doppler","carbon dioxide; adult; analysis of variance; arterial carbon dioxide tension; article; blood vessel reactivity; brain blood flow; cognition; controlled study; Doppler echography; flow rate; human; human experiment; hyperthermia; hyperventilation; hypoventilation; male; middle cerebral artery; muscle exercise; normal human; oxygen consumption; oxygen transport; priority journal; rest; blood; blood flow velocity; body temperature; endurance; exercise; fever; hypocapnia; metabolism; middle cerebral artery; regression analysis; Adult; Blood Flow Velocity; Body Temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Exercise; Fever; Humans; Hypocapnia; Male; Middle Cerebral Artery; Physical Endurance; Regression Analysis; Rest; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32044432134

Vehicular emissions are mainly caused due to high volume of traffic and changes in driving speeds. Traffic management measures can reduce the vehicular emissions by smoothing traffic flow. One way to achieve a smoother flow of traffic is to synchronise the signals. Implementation of this method can lead to lower vehicular emission levels compared to that of interrupted traffic flow. This paper presents a study on evaluation of signal interruptions on vehicular emissions through a case study. Essentially, the study methodology relies on field runs of selected vehicles in interrupted and uninterrupted modes. In the process of these runs, tailpipe emissions [carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitric oxide (NO)] were measured using a portable gas analyser. Three motor vehicles-a two-wheeler, an auto-rickshaw and a van were selected for test runs. Tailpipe emissions from the individual vehicles were used to evaluate the total emissions from the vehicles for each test run. Several test runs were conducted on the study corridor. Emissions were compared for the interrupted and uninterrupted flow cases, to evaluate the influence of signal interruptions on emissions. © 2006 - Kalpana Corporation.","Interrupted and uninterrupted movements; Vehicular emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746449134

The type of fuel shown to decrease combustion emissions components versus traditional diesel fuel, is the diesel emulsion. The Lubrizol Corporation, in conjunction with Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and several subcontracting laboratories, recently conducted a health assessment of the combustion emissions of PuriNOxTMdiesel fuel emulsion (diesel-water-methanol) in rodents. Combustion emissions from either of two, 2002 model Cummins 5.9L ISB engines, were diluted with charcoal-filtered air to exposure concentrations of 125, 250 and 500 mg total PM/m3. The engines were operated on a continuous, repeating, heavy-duty certification cycle (US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter I) using Rotella-T® 15W-40 engine oil. Nitrogen oxide (NO) and PM were reduced when engines were operated on PuriNOxTMversus California Air Resources Board diesel fuel under these conditions. Male and female F344 rats were housed in Hazleton H2000 exposure chambers and exposed to exhaust atmospheres 6 h/day, five days/week for the first 11 weeks and seven days/week thereafter. Exposures ranged from 61 to 73 days depending on the treatment group. Indicators of general toxicity (body weight, organ weight, clinical pathology and histopathology), neurotoxicity (glial fibrillary acidic protein assay), genotoxicity (Ames assay, micronucleus, sister chromatid exchange), and reproduction and development were measured. Overall, effects observed were mild. Emulsion combustion emissions were not associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive/developmental toxicity, or in vivo genotoxicity. Small decreases in serum cholesterol in the 500-mg/m3exposure group were observed. PM accumulation within alveolar macrophages was evident in all exposure groups. The latter findings are consistent with normal physiological responses to particle inhalation. Other statistically significant effects were present in some measured parameters of other exposed groups, but were not clearly attributed to emissions exposure. Positive mutagenic responses in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium were observed subsequent to treatment with emulsion emissions subfractions. Based on the cholesterol results, it can be concluded that the 250-mg/m3exposure level was the no observed effect level. In general, biological findings in exposed rats and bacteria were consistent with exposure to petroleum diesel exhaust in the F344 rat and Ames assays. © 2006, Sage Publications.

High specific discharge from ice melt often dominates flow for considerable distances downstream, particularly where other sources of runoff are limited, providing a major water resource. Should Himalayan glaciers continue to retreat rapidly, water shortages might be widespread within a few decades. However, given the difference in climate between the drier western and monsoonal eastern ends of the region, future warming is unlikely to affect river flow uniformly throughout. A simple temperature-index-based hydro-glaciological model, in which glacier dimensions are allowed to decline through time, has been developed with a view to assessing, in data-sparse areas, by how much and when climate warming will reduce Himalayan glacier dimensions and affect downstream river flows. Two glaciers having the same initial geometries were located (one each) in the headwaters of two identical nests of hypothetical catchments, representing contrasting climates in the west and east of the region. The hypothetical catchments were nested such that percentage ice cover declined with increasing basin area. Model parameters were validated against available but limited mass-balance and river flow measurements. The model was applied for 150 years from an arbitrary start date (1990), first with standard-period (1961-1990) climate data and then with application of a 0.06°C year-1 transient climatic warming scenario. Under this warming scenario, Himalayan rivers fed by large glaciers descending through considerable elevation range will respond in a broadly similar manner, except that summer snowfall in the east will suppress the rate of initial flow increase, delay peak discharge and postpone eventual disappearance of the ice. Impacts of declining glacier area on river flow will be greater in smaller and more highly glacierized basins in both the west and east, and in the west, where precipitation is scarce, for considerable distances downstream. © Crown Copyright 2006.

Fresh bottom ash samples were subjected to an accelerated carbonation using pure CO2. The aim of this work was to quantify the volume of CO 2 that could be sequestrated with a view to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and investigate the possibility of upgrading some specific properties of the material with accelerated carbonation. Carbonation was performed by putting 4 mm-sieved samples in a CO2 chamber. The CO2 pressure and the humidity of the samples were varied to optimize the reaction parameters. Unsieved material was also tested. Calcite formation resulting from accelerated carbonation was investigated by thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) and metal leaching tests were performed. The volume of sequestrated CO2 was on average 12.5 L/kg dry matter (DM) for unsieved material and 24 L/kg DM for 4 mm-sieved samples. An ash humidity of 15% appeared to give the best results. The reaction was drastically accelerated at high pressure but it did not increase the volume of sequestrated CO 2. Accelerated carbonation, like the natural phenomenon, reduces the dangerous nature of the material. It decreases the pH from 11.8 to 8.2 and causes Pb, Cr and Cd leaching to decrease. This process could reduce incinerator CO2 emissions by 0.5-1%. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

There is growing scientific interest in urban dew, but urban dew data are rare. Weather is a primary control on dew wherever it forms but, especially in cities, site geometry can be important. In this paper sky view and weather controls on nocturnal surface moisture deposition are explored using data collected in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, during summer. For residential lawns and grassed parks in the city, similar spatial trends were evident in surface moisture amount measured at dawn by blotting and the sky view factor ψ. That is, more water accumulated where sky view was large, less under trees, and near buildings. Moisture accumulation at open sites was strongly controlled by weather conditions. Correlation was seen between moisture accumulation and wind and cloud conditions expressed as the semi-empirical ""weather factor,"" Φw. Results suggest ψ and Φw may together have potential to predict surface moisture accumulation, provided humidity is not limiting. Given the several important implications of surface moisture for urban physical systems, more studies of urban dew seem warranted. Copyright © 2006 by V. H. Winston &amp; Son, Inc.

For a medium-term mitigation scenario, we calculate regional mitigation costs resulting from global allocation schemes based on the Brazilian Proposal that solely incorporate historical responsibility as a burden sharing criterion. We find that they are likely to violate ability-to-pay principles. In spite of less stringent abatement requirements, developing country regions experience cost burdens (as a percentage of GDP) in the same range as those of developed countries. We also assess the policy options available for calculating historical responsibility. The periodic updating of responsibility calculations over time, concerns over the robustness and availability of emissions data, and the question of whether past emissions were knowingly harmful, may lead to policy choices that increase the relative historical responsibility attributed to developing countries. This, in turn, would increase their mitigation cost burden. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the sometimes high correlation between air pollutants, the results from studies that focus on a single air pollutant can be difficult to interpret. In addition, the high correlation between air pollutants can produce problems of interpretation for the standard method of investigating the adverse health effects due to multiple air pollutants. The standard method involves simultaneously including the multiple air pollutants in a single statistical model. Because of this, the development of new models to concurrently estimate the adverse health effects of multiple air pollutants has recently been identified as an important area of future research. In this article, a new model for disentangling the joint effects of multiple air pollutants in air pollution mortality time-series studies is introduced. This new model uses the time-series data to assign each air pollutant a weight that indicates the pollutant's contribution to the air pollution mixture that affects mortality and to estimate the effect of this air pollution mixture on mortality. This model offers an improvement in statistical estimation precision over the standard method. It also avoids problems of interpretation that can occur if the standard method is used. This new model is then illustrated by applying it to time-series data from two U.S. counties.

And there has been little systematic examination of how these linkages may be fostered in practice. This paper examines climate change through a sustainable development lens. To illustrate how this might change the approach to climate change issues, it reports on the findings of a panel of business, local government, and academic representatives in British Columbia, Canada, who were appointed to advise the provincial government on climate change policy. The panel found that sustainable development may offer a significantly more fruitful way to pursue climate policy goals than climate policy itself.

This paper uses data from previous and ongoing projects to: (i) investigate geographical variability in wet deposition chemistry over the Alps; (ii) assess temporal trends of the major chemical variables in response to changes in the atmospheric emission of pollutants; (iii) discuss the potential relationship between the status of atmospheric deposition and its effects on forest ecosystems in the alpine and subalpine area, focusing particularly on nitrogen input. We also present results of studies performed at a local level on specific topics such as long-term changes in lead deposition and the role of occult deposition in total nitrogen input. The analysis performed here highlights the marked geographical variability of atmospheric deposition in the Alpine region. Apart from some evidence of geographically limited effects, due to local sources, no obvious gradients were identified in the major ion deposition. The highest ionic loads were recorded in areas in the foothills of the Alps, such as the pre-alpine area in North-Western Italy and the area of Canton Ticino, Switzerland. Trend analysis shows a widespread decrease in the acidity of precipitation in the last 15-20 years as a consequence of the reduced emission of S compounds. On the other hand, nitrate concentrations in rain have not changed so much, and ammonium has decreased significantly only at the Austrian sampling sites. The deposition of N is still well above the estimated critical loads of nutrient N at some forest sites in the alpine and subalpine areas, thus confirming the critical situation of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems regarding N inputs. Existing data highlights the importance of continuously monitoring atmospheric deposition chemistry in the Alpine area, taking account of acidifying elements, nutrients and other pollutants such as heavy metals and organic compounds. There is also a need for unifying sampling and analytical methods in order to obtain comparable data from the different regions of the Alps. © Springer 2006.","Forest; Nitrogen; Precipitation chemistry; Trend; Wet deposition","Ammonium compounds; Chemical variables control; Deposition; Ecosystems; Forestry; Nitrogen; Pollution; Precipitation (chemical); Sampling; Precipitation chemistry; Trend; Wet deposition; Earth atmosphere; acidification; atmospheric chemistry; forest ecosystem; geographical variation; wet deposition; Alps; Austria; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Southern Europe; Switzerland",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645887860

This paper presents some examples of the experiences of community-based organisations (CBOs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) of variations in climate, and looks at how they have incorporated their findings into the design and implementation of local adaptation strategies. Local organisations integrate climate change and climatic hazards into the design and development of their projects as a means of adapting to their new climatic situation. Projects designed to boost the resilience of local livelihoods are good examples of local adaptation strategies. To upscale these adaptation initiatives, there is a need to improve information exchange between CBOs, NGOs and academia. Moreover, there is a need to bridge the gap between scientific and local knowledge in order to create projects capable of withstanding stronger natural hazards. © Overseas Development Institute, 2006.","Adaptation to climate change; Climate change; Climate hazards; Local initiatives; Upscale local initiatives","climate change; community organization; hazard management; local planning; natural hazard; nongovernmental organization; article; community care; disaster; greenhouse effect; information dissemination; organization; organization and management; risk management; Community Networks; Greenhouse Effect; Information Dissemination; Natural Disasters; Organizations; Risk Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644760401

The variables studied in non-catalytic gasification series with air were the temperature (215-270 °C) and the time (1-16 h) and the influence of the addition of one catalyst (Co) and the time (1-2 h) in catalytic gasification. In the case of activation with CO 2 , the influence of the temperature (700-950 °C) and the time (1-8 h) was studied. The resulting carbons were characterized in terms of their BET surface, porosity, and pore size distribution. The N 2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K for both series showed a type I behaviour, typical of microporous materials. The isotherms showed that with both gasificant agents the temperature rise produced an increase in the carbon porosity. With regards to the activation time, a positive effect on the N 2 adsorbed volume on the carbons was observed. The best carbons of each series, as well as the CNA (carbon currently used in the CNA), were characterized by mercury porosimetry and iodine solution adsorption isotherms. The results obtained allowed to state that several of the carbons produced had characteristics similar to the carbon that is target of reproduction (which has S BET of 741 m 2 g -1 , V mi of 0.39 cm 3 g -1 and a iodine retention capacity of 429.3 mg g -1 ): carbon C (gasification with CO 2 at 850 °C during 1 h), with S BET of 523 m 2 g -1 , V mi of 0.33 cm 3 g -1 and a iodine retention capacity of 402.5 mg g -1 , and carbon D (gasification with CO 2 at 900 °C during 1 h), whose S BET is 672 m 2 g -1 , V mi is 0.28 cm 3 g -1 and has a iodine retention capacity of 345.2 mg g -1 . © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In agreement with a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer study, we have found that carbon dioxide activation by Zr+ presents a spin-forbidden mechanism because of a spin inversion process occurring during reaction in the rate- determining step.

Cost-efficient operation of a CHP system can be planned using an optimisation model based on hourly load forecasts. A long-term planning model decomposes into hourly models, which can be formulated as linear programming (LP) problems. Such problems can be solved efficiently using the specialized Power Simplex algorithm. However, Power Simplex can only manage one heat and one power balance. Since heat cannot be transported over long distances, Power Simplex applies only for local CHP planning. In this paper we formulate the hourly multi-site CHP planning problem with multiple heat balances as an LP model with a special structure. We then develop the Extended Power Simplex (EPS) algorithm for solving such models efficiently. Even though the problem can be quite large as the number of demand sites increases, EPS demonstrates very good efficiency. In test runs with realistic models, EPS is from 29 to 85 times faster than an efficient sparse Simplex code using the product form of inverse (PFI). Furthermore, the relative efficiency of EPS improves as the problem size grows. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The sun-shade acclimation and plasticity of 16 functional leaf traits of 38 tropical tree species were studied in relation to their light demand, maximum adult stature and ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. 2. Species differed significantly in all leaf traits, which explained a large part of the observed variation (average R2 = 0·72). Light had a significant effect on 12 traits and species showed a similar proportional response to light, indicating that the species ranking in trait performance is largely maintained in different light environments. 3. Specific leaf area, leaf nutrient content and chlorophyll: nitrogen ratio showed the largest plasticity to irradiance. These traits are important for maximizing growth in different light conditions because they are closely linked to the photosynthetic capacity and carbon balance of the plant. 4. Plasticity is generally thought to be greatest for pioneer species that occupy early successional habitats with a large variation in irradiance. This hypothesis was rejected because short-lived pioneers showed the lowest plasticity to irradiance. 5. An alternative hypothesis states that plasticity is largest for tall species that experience large ontogenetic changes in irradiance during their life cycle. Yet plasticity was barely related to adult stature or ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. Short-lived pioneers that experience consistently high light levels did have low plasticity, but shade-tolerant species that experience consistently low light levels had high plasticity. 6. Tropical rainforest species show a large variation in plasticity. Plasticity is a compromise between many factors and constraints, and all of these may explain the observed patterns to some extent. © 2006 British Ecological Society.","Acclimation; Adult stature; Bolivia; Functional leaf traits; Shade tolerance","carbon; chlorophyll; environmental factor; leaf area; light effect; nitrogen; photosynthesis; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646588656

Chemical shifts of perdeuterated [U-15N]CYP1 backbone amide (NH) resonances were monitored as a function of cytochrome b5 concentration by 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC experiments. The association of cytochrome b5 with the reduced CYP101-camphor-carbon monoxide complex (CYP-S-CO) perturbs many of the same resonances that Pdx does, including regions of the CYP101 molecule implicated in substrate access and orientation. The perturbations are smaller in magnitude than those observed with Pdxr due to a lower binding affinity (a Kd of 13 ± 3 mM, for the reduced cytochrome b5-CYP-S-CO complex compared to a Kd of 26 ± 12 μM for the Pdx-CYP-S-CO complex). The results are in accord with our previous suggestion that the observed perturbations are related to effector activity and support the proposal that the primary role of the effector is to populate the active conformation of CYP101 to prevent uncoupling [Pochapsky, S. S., et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 5649-5656]. A titratable perturbation is observed at the 1H resonance of the 8-CH3 group of CYP101-bound camphor upon addition of cytochrome b5, a phenomenon also associated with the formation of the CYP101·Pdx complex, albeit with larger perturbations [Wei, J. Y., et al. (2005) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 127, 6974-6976].

The soils in the region have a high contribution of black carbon to soil organic matter and high erosion rates. The aim of the study was to quantify the erosion of black carbon and to identify the processes involved. The conceptual approach included the measurement of contents of SOM, black carbon and mineral bound SOM in bulk soils, sediments eroded from 1 m2 plots and in sediments at the outlet of the 0.6 ha catchment. Additionally, the enrichment factors of bulk SOM, BC and mineral bound SOM were calculated for eroded sediments. Carbon content of eroded sediments was higher than carbon content in bulk soil. The C enrichment factors in the sediments eroded from 1 m2 plots ranged between 1.7 and 2.7, which confirms that SOM rich material such as clay or silt along with particulate organic matter such as black carbon and plant debris is preferentially eroded. At the watershed level a mean carbon enrichment factor of 1.5 showed that part of the eroded carbon is lost from the watershed. Analysis of the carbon types showed that mineral bound SOM is representing on average 30% and black carbon 15% of the carbon of the bulk soil. Mineral bound organic matter is not eroded preferentially from the soil. Enrichment factors from 1.1 to 1.8 were recorded for black carbon in sediments eroded from 1 m2 plots. At the watershed level, black carbon represents 30% of carbon in eroded sediments. The average enrichment factor of black carbon in sediments eroded from the watershed is 2.3 compared to bulk soil C content. These results show a continuous enrichment of sediments in black carbon during the whole process of soil erosion. The preferential erosion of black carbon compared to other SOM types can be explained by its light nature, absence of mineral interactions right after its formation and its resistance to biodegradation during transport. Carbon erosion in these tropical soils may thus lead to a decrease of their ability to act as a sink for CO2 due to the preferential exportation of a very stable SOM form. These results further suggest that erosion of black carbon could be a crucial process determining its fate in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, black carbon erosion could be conceptually simpler than soil erosion and could therefore be tackled by specific models. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Comparisons in energy consumption among hot-, warm-, and cold-water wash and rinse cycles, horizontal- and vertical-axis washing machines, and gas and electric water heaters, were calculated on a per-wash-load basis. Demographic data for current laundering practices in the United States and Canada were then incorporated to estimate household and national energy consumption on an annual basis for each country. On average, the thermal energy required to heat water using either gas or electric energy constitutes 80% to 85% of the total energy consumed per wash in conventional, vertical-axis (top-loading) washing machines. The balance of energy used is mechanical energy. Consequently, the potential energy savings per load in converting from hot-and-warm- to cold-wash temperatures can be significant. Annual potential energy and cost savings and reductions in carbon dioxide emissions are also estimated for each country, assuming full conversion to cold-wash water temperatures.

This rate decreases over time and frequently a residual concentration remains in the soil. This kinetic has been attributed primarily to the enrichment of more recalcitrant fractions, as well as to the lack of resting hydrocarbon bioavailability. Thus, at the end of the bioremediation process, a part of the residual hydrocarbon soil concentration represents the non-bioavailable fraction, which is difficult to degrade by microbial populations and which poses a minor hazard. Therefore, determination of the bioavailable fraction in a bioremediation project represents both an estimation of the maximum level of achievable biodegradation, as well as an additional indication of the environmental health hazard. In the present study, aged creosote-contaminated soil was subjected to biostimulation processes, and the bioavailable fraction for several target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was calculated using a mild extraction with cyclodextrines. The amount of PAH extracted corresponded to the desorbing fraction and can be regarded as the bioavailable fraction. The non-desorbing fraction data obtained from this procedure were compared to the remaining PAH concentrations following bioremediation treatment of soil microcosms. These results permitted the establishment of a theoretical biodegradation limit based on the desorbing fraction. In addition, neither accumulation of intermediate metabolites, nor the formation of bound-residues or reduced acute toxicity was observed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Plausibly, critical steps of natural selection takes place at limiting conditions, near equilibrium, in the linear range response of entropy production, and consequently the trend to lower the rate of entropy production could be the fitness arrow of biological evolution. The evolutionary relevance of the Prigogine theorem is discussed in connection with the ergodic hypothesis of Boltzmann.

A central question in ecology is to separate the relative contribution of density dependence and stochastic influences to annual fluctuations in population size. Here we estimate the deterministic and stochastic components of the dynamics of different European populations of white stork Ciconia ciconia. We then examined whether annual changes in population size was related to the climate during the breeding period (the 'tap hypothesis'sensu Sæther, Sutherland & Engen (2004, Advances in Ecological Research, 35, 185-209) or during the nonbreeding period, especially in the winter areas in Africa (the 'tube hypothesis'). 2. A general characteristic of the population dynamics of this long-distance migrant is small environmental stochasticity and strong density regulation around the carrying capacity with short return times to equilibrium. 3. Annual changes in the size of the eastern European populations were correlated by rainfall in the wintering areas in Africa as well as local weather in the breeding areas just before arrival and in the later part of the breeding season and regional climate variation (North Atlantic Oscillation). This indicates that weather influences the population fluctuations of white storks through losses of sexually mature individuals as well as through an effect on the number of individuals that manages to establish themselves in the breeding population. Thus, both the tap and tube hypothesis explains climate influences on white stork population dynamics. 4. The spatial scale of environmental noise after accounting for the local dynamics was 67 km, suggesting that the strong density dependence reduces the synchronizing effects of climate variation on the population dynamics of white stork. 5. Several climate variables reduced the synchrony of the residual variation in population size after accounting for density dependence and demographic stochasticity, indicating that these climate variables had a synchronizing effect on the population fluctuations. In contrast, other climatic variables acted as desynchronizing agents. 6. Our results illustrate that evaluating the effects of common environmental variables on the spatio-temporal variation in population dynamics require estimates and modelling of their influence on the local dynamics. © 2006 British Ecological Society.","Climate effects on population dynamics; Density dependence; Environmental stochasticity; Population synchrony; White stork","climate; density dependence; migratory species; population dynamics; spatiotemporal analysis; animal; article; bird; breeding; climate; environment; Europe; female; male; physiology; population density; population dynamics; population migration; season; statistics; Animal Migration; Animals; Birds; Breeding; Climate; Environment; Europe; Female; Male; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Stochastic Processes; Africa; Eurasia; Europe; Ciconia ciconia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645100669

These cases reveal that designers are in need for a climate scheme of Turkey, which indicates regions that require special provisions to prevent moisture degradation. Hence, this paper presents an approach for defining climate regions for Turkey. Initially, annual driving rain index (aDRI) based on monthly data is calculated and a driving rain map of Turkey is produced. Then, population-weighted heating degree-days (PW HDD) zones of Turkey are presented. Based on the aDRI and PW HDD zones, three climate regions of Turkey are established. Region 1 represents sheltered locations, i.e. locations which have aDRI less than 3. Region 2 represents locations (aDRI between 3 and 6 and PW HDD<1600), which are exposed to moderate driving rain between September and the end of May when the mean temperatures are above zero. Region 3 includes locations (aDRI between 3 and 6 and PW HDD between 1601 and 2500) which are moderately exposed to driving rain all throughout the year when the mean temperature is well above zero. As a conclusion, the proposed climate regions suggest that the design of wall assemblies located at Regions 2 and 3 must incorporate special provisions to prevent moisture degradation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

NOx emission peaks of two light duty freight diesel vehicles which have different emission levels were evaluated by using an on-board measurement system. Tests were carried out with various payload conditions and road conditions. As a result many NOx emission peaks were observed when the vehicles were starting or accelerating at intersections. The test vehicle which has higher emission level caused higher frequency and level of NOx emission peaks. Shifting up at lower engine speed in combination with lower acceleration brought out not only reduction of NOx emission peaks level but also of CO2 mass emission.

The closely related analogue epirubicin induces less cardiotoxicity, but the determinants of its different behavior have not been elucidated. We developed a translational model of the human heart and characterized whether epirubicin exhibited a defective conversion to ROS and secondary alcohol metabolites. Small myocardial samples from cardiac surgery patients were reconstituted in plasma that contained clinically relevant concentrations of doxorubicin or epirubicin. In this model only doxorubicin formed ROS, as detected by fluorescent probes or aconitase inactivation. Experiments with cell-free systems and confocal laser scanning microscopy studies of H9c2 cardiomyocytes suggested that epirubicin could not form ROS because of its protonation-dependent sequestration in cytoplasmic acidic organelles and the consequent limited localization to mitochondrial one-electron quinone reductases. Accordingly, blocking the protonation-sequestration mechanism with the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 relocalized epirubicin to mitochondria and increased its conversion to ROS in human myocardial samples. Epirubicin also formed ∼60% less alcohol metabolites than doxorubicin, but this was caused primarily by its higher K m and lower Vmax values for two-electron carbonyl reduction by aldo/keto-reductases of human cardiac cytosol. Thus, vesicular sequestration and impaired efficiency of electron addition have separate roles in determining a defective bioactivation of epirubicin to ROS or secondary alcohol metabolites in the human heart. These results uncover the molecular determinants of the reduced cardiotoxicity of epirubicin and serve mechanism-based guidelines to improving antitumor therapies. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Alcohols; Cardiology; Laser beam effects; Patient treatment; Toxicity; Tumors; Anticancer anthracycline doxorubicin; Cardiotoxicity; Reactive oxygen species (ROS); Metabolites; aconitate hydratase; aldehyde reductase; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; bafilomycin A1; doxorubicin; epirubicin; mitochondrial enzyme; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone); adult; aged; article; cell organelle; confocal laser microscopy; controlled study; cytosol; drug distribution; drug effect; drug inhibition; electron; enzyme inactivation; female; heart; heart muscle cell; human; human cell; human tissue; male; priority journal; proton transport; reduction; surgical patient; Aconitate Hydratase; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Aged; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Antineoplastic Agents; Area Under Curve; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Membrane; Cell-Free System; Cells, Cultured; Cytoplasm; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Electrons; Epirubicin; Female; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Kinetics; Macrolides; Male; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Middle Aged; Mitochondria; Models, Chemical; Myocardium; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Protein Biosynthesis; Protons; Reactive Oxygen Species; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744959330

Experimental data have been obtained under kinetic control at steady state in a three-phase fixed bed reactor with concurrent up flow. The kinetic model is able to predict the appearance and disappearance of phenol and the cyclic organic intermediates formed along the phenol oxidation progress. As some cyclic oxidation intermediates - such as hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone - are two orders of magnitude more toxic than phenol, this detailed model is required to design a CWO process achieving the detoxification of the influent. Influences of oxygen pressure and temperature have been quantified (in the ranges 127-160°C and 3.4-16 bar, respectively). This model also considers the formation of refractory compounds to the CWO (short-chain acids as, i.e., acetic, maleic and formic acids, which are biodegradable). Besides, a constant value of the overall fractional yield for the oxidation of phenol, as target pollutant to CO2, has been obtained. The discriminated kinetic model fits quite well the experimental data for the whole range of variables used. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Discharge curves of EC/DEC cells in the 3.5-1.5 V region, were different to that observed for NASICON titanium phosphates but the related capacity can be associated to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. Another sample, C-TiP, obtained by using nitrogen atmosphere during the thermal treatment, was able to provide 75% more capacity in this region. This sample contained carbon because of the incomplete pyrolysis of the surfactant present in the precursor. Carbon is supposed to stay occluded inside the pores considering the values of pores surface area, total conductivity and HRTEM measurements. These titanium phosphates were also tested as negative electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements suggest that both titanium phosphates are reduced to yield titanium, lithia and phosphorus at 0.0 V. In our opinion, the presence of carbon in C-TiP is the key factor for the enhanced reactivity in the 3.2-1.5 V region but is not enough to obtain a good electrochemical performance, in terms of cycling efficiency. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To assist in interpreting the photocatalytic behaviour of Ru-TiO2/SiO2, reference systems consisting of Ru doped TiO2 and TiO2 supported on SiO2 were also analyzed and the conditions were optimized. Ru/TiO2 photocatalysts with metal loadings of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 wt% were prepared by impregnation method and a series of TiO2/ SiO2 catalysts with low TiO2 (1, 3, 5 and 10 wt%) contents were prepared by solid-state dispersion method. The photocatalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis DRS, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that TiO2 particles with Ru ions have higher photocatalytic activity than undoped TiO2 and the optimum Ru loading was found to be 0.5 wt%. Nevertheless, the yield increased notably when TiO2 was supported on SiO2. This strong enhancement suggests that in 10 wt% TiO2/SiO2 the efficiency of charge separation is strongly influenced through the presence of TiOSi bridging bonds. On the contrary, Ru-TiO2/SiO2 has no significant improvement in activity over TiO2/SiO2 except that it shows nearly quadruple times higher activity for the formation of methanol than Ru/TiO2. The difference in the photocatalytic activity is related to its physico-chemical properties. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We measured soil CO2 efflux along a chronosequence (3-, 9-, and 11-yr-old stands) of hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x Populus x petrowskyana var. Walker) plantations and a control agricultural field from June to August 2004. Measurements were made between 0800 and 1800 with a portable Li-Cor 6400-09 system and were based on 4-5 min averaging. We also measured the response to simulated rainfall and the diurnal fluctuation of soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux ranged from 1.30 μmol CO2 m -2 s-1 in the 3-yr-old plantation to 5.41 μmol CO 2 m-2 s-1 in the agricultural control field, or from 0.17 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 kg-1 C (based on soil organic C content to a 0.4 m depth) in the 3-yr-old plantation to 1.09 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 kg-1 C in the 11-yr-old plantation. Simulated rainfall applied in the 3-yr-old plantation and a newly planted site resulted in an immediate pulse of CO 2 efflux, 2.90 and 2.54 μmol CO2 m-2 s -1, respectively, followed by an efflux rate sustained slightly above pre-irrigation levels. No secondary pulse of soil respiration was observed in the 2-h period following water application. Diurnal variation of soil respiration was found to be small between 0600 and 1900 in the agricultural control field, with values that varied from 2.66 to 3.17 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Continued monitoring of soil respiration and other C cycling processes in the chronosequence will improve our understanding of the potential for C sequestration in hybrid poplar plantations in northern Alberta.","Biomass; Boreal forest; Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hybrid poplar; Land-use change","agricultural land; boreal forest; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; diurnal variation; greenhouse gas; hybrid; land use change; plantation forestry; rainfall; soil respiration; Alberta; Canada; North America; Populus; Populus deltoides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845688191

The high-resolution BL model (lowest point at 30 cm) was equipped with an adequate turbulence scheme and a narrow-band long-wave (LW) radiation scheme, the latter validated using data from the International Comparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models (ICRCCM). In off-line ICRCCM experime nts, ground emissivity ε &lt; 1 led to extra LW cooling of air near the surface compared to ε = 1. However, much stronger LW cooling at heights of 1-3 m, and warming below 1 m, was obtained by setting the ground colder than air at screen height, a typical condition during clear nights. Conversely, a warm surface anomaly typical of sunny days leads to strong LW warming at 1-3 m, with LW cooling just above the ground. These ground temperature anomalies dominated the LW heating/cooling patterns at heights of up to 3-4 m, perhaps explaining controversies in the observed LW flux divergences close to the ground. Interactive model results indicate that the middle part of a windy clear-air nocturnal BL (NBL) is dominated by turbulent cooling, while the upper and lower NBL is dominated by LW cooling. Below about 1 m, a fourth layer is formed with LW warming and turbulent cooling, in agreement with the off-line experiments. When the surface winds fall below about 1-1.5 m s-1 LW cooling dominates in the whole NBL, except very near the surface. In these light wind conditions the Monin-Obukhov theory should be revised to include radiative effects. In clear-air daytime conditions strong convective BL heating dominates over weak LW cooling except at 1-3 m heights where the cooler air absorbs the thermal emission of the hot ground. The subsequent LW warming of the superadiabatic surface layer appears to be strong enough to induce local turbulent cooling (despite the hot surface) in an 'hour glass' pattern independently of wind speed, such that the total diabatic heating rate remains nearly constant with height. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2006.","Convective surface layer; Nocturnal boundary layer; Radiative fluxes; Turbulent fluxes","Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric turbulence; Boundary layers; Cooling; Earth atmosphere; Heating; Mathematical models; Speed; Wind effects; Ground emissivity; Long-wave radiation; Monin-Obukhov theory; Nocturnal boundary layer; Radiative heating; Superadiabatic surface layer; Thermal emission; Total adiabatic heating rate; Turbulent cooling; Turbulent heating; Climatology; convective boundary layer; longwave radiation; nocturnal boundary layer; turbulent boundary layer; wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644591131

A multidisciplinary study has identified the onshore Bowen Basin as having potential for geological storage of CO2. Storage potential has been documented within a 295-km2 (113-mi2) area on the eastern flank of the Wunger Ridge using a simplified regional three-dimensional model and is based on estimating injection rates of 1.2 million t CO2 /yr for 25 yr. Paleogeographic interpretations of the Showgrounds Sandstone reservoir in the targeted injection area indicate a dominantly meandering-channel system that grades downdip into a deltaic system. Seismic interpretation indicates a relatively unfaulted seal and reservoir section. The depth to the reservoir extends to 2700 m (8858 ft). CO2 injection simulations indicate that at least one horizontal or two vertical wells would be required to inject at the proposed rate into homogeneous reservoirs with a thickness of approximately 5 m (16 ft) and permeability of 1 d. The existence of intrareservoir shale baffles necessitates additional wells to maintain the necessary injection rate; this is also true for medium-permeability reservoirs. The long-term storage of the injected CO2 involves either stratigraphic and residual gas trapping along a 10-15-km (6-9-mi) migration path and, ultimately, potentially, within updip depleted hydrocarbon fields or trapping in medium-permeability rocks. Trapping success will be a function of optimal reservoirs characteristics and the distribution of seals and baffles. This optimization may target specific, as-yet to be determined, permeability ranges. Copyright © 2006. The American Association of Petroleum Geologists/Division of Environmental Geosciences.

We investigated the level of awareness of these factors among US clinicians who refer patients for imaging for suspected acute pulmonary embolism. Materials and Methods: Between September 2004 and February 2005, we conducted a mail survey of 855 physicians selected at random from three professional organizations. We asked participants how important the availability of state-of-the-art equipment was in their imaging decisions, whether V-P scintigraphy was performed with planar or single-photon emission CT (SPECT) equipment in their communities, to identify the most advanced type of CT scanner used for CTPA, and whether CT venography (CTV) was performed routinely after CTPA. Results: We received completed surveys from 240 (29.8%) physicians practicing in 44 states. One hundred sixty-six respondents (70.9%) indicated that state-of-the-art equipment was an extremely or very important factor when they made imaging decisions. However, 191 clinicians (80.3%) did not know whether SPECT equipment was used for V-P scintigraphy, and 119 (50.6%) did not know the type of CT scanner used for CTPA in their communities. Of respondents, 39.2% reported access to multidetector row CT technology for CTPA, whereas 10.2% referred patients to facilities using single-detector CT. Only 9.3% of respondents indicated that CTV was performed routinely after CTPA. Conclusion: Although state-of-the-art equipment is important to them, clinicians practicing in the United States have limited knowledge of the equipment being used during CTPA and V-P scintigraphy scanning in their communities. Radiologists should intensify efforts to familiarize their clinical colleagues with the equipment they use. © 2006 AUR.","Acute Pulmonary Embolism; Awareness; Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography; Computed Tomographic Vernography; Computed Tomography; Imaging Equipment; Imaging Technology; Multidetector Computed Tomography; SPECT; Survey; Ventilation-Perfusion Scintigraphy","adult; article; clinical practice; clinical protocol; computed tomographic angiography; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; health survey; human; imaging system; lung angiography; lung embolism; lung scintiscanning; medical education; phlebography; physician; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography; Attitude of Health Personnel; Delivery of Health Care; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Physician's Practice Patterns; Physicians; Professional Competence; Pulmonary Embolism; Questionnaires; Random Allocation; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; United States; Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646182578

BRAVO included the measurement of aerosols throughout Texas from July to October 1999 and extensive modeling of these aerosols. In support of BRAVO, the potential contributions from source regions to particulate sulfur at Big Bend during the BRAVO period were examined via an airmass history analysis. This was done using residence time analysis and a new technique of decomposing the residence time probability density function into its basic components, an airmass transport directional frequency and inverse characteristic transport speed. Trajectory heights over potential source regions were also examined. The system was validated using inert perfluorocarbon tracers that were released from four Texas sites. Airmass transport to Big Bend was examined on days with high (&gt;80th percentile), and days with low (&lt;20th percentile), particulate sulfur. High particulate sulfur concentrations were associated with low-level and low-speed airmass transport from the eastern United States, eastern Texas, and northeastern Mexico. All three of these regions have high SO2 emissions that could contribute to Big Bend's haze. Examination of individual trajectories showed that the highest particulate sulfur concentrations occurred when transport over several of these regions coincided. Low particulate sulfur concentrations coincided with low-level but high-speed airmass transport from the Gulf of Mexico and along the Mexico-Texas border. Precipitation often occurred along these trajectories. Low sulfur was also associated with transport from low SO2 emission regions north and west of Big Bend. Days with high SO2 or selenium concentrations were also examined. High SO 2 concentrations were associated with prior transport from nearby sources, particularly the Carbón power plants located in Mexico ∼230 km southeast of Big Bend. High selenium concentrations were associated with prior transport over Carbón and eastern Texas. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to ameliorate air pollution from the beginning of 2001, Tier 1 emission standards became mandatory for all new model year sold in the country.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the Tier 1 vehicles will stand the certification values for at least 162000 km with the regular fuel available at the MAMC. Mileage accumulation and deterioration show that certified carbon monoxide emissions will stand for the useful life of the vehicles but in the case of non-methane hydrocarbons will be shorter by 40%, and nitrogen oxides emissions above the standard will be reached at one third of the accumulated kilometers. The effect of gasoline sulfur content, on the current in use Tier 1 vehicles of the MAMC and the impact on the emissions inventory in year 2010 showed that 31000 extra tons of NOx could be added to the inventory caused by the failure of the vehicles to control this pollutant at the useful life of vehicles. © Springer 2006.","Air pollution; Certification standards; Mexico-City; Tier1 vehicles; Vehicle exhaust emissions","Certification standards; Gasoline sulfur content; Mexico; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Tier1 vehicles; Vehicle exhaust emissions; Vehicles emissions; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Exhaust gases; Ground vehicles; Hydrocarbons; Particulate emissions; carbon monoxide; fuel; nitrogen oxide; sulfur; atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental assessment; standard (regulation); traffic emission; air analysis; air pollution control; air quality; article; certification; content analysis; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Mexico; motor vehicle; standard; waste component removal; Air; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Mexico; Motor Vehicles; Petroleum; Reference Standards; Vehicle Emissions; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; Mexico City; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645822561

The importance of collisional relaxation processes in the generation of the photoacoustic signal is reported in the particular case of CH4 detection in dry O2 and O2-N2 mixtures. The negative influence of these effects results in a strongly reduced and phase-shifted photoacoustic signal, induced by a fast resonant coupling between the vibrational states of methane and oxygen, associated with the slow relaxation of the excited oxygen molecules. An unusual parabolic response of the sensor with respect to the methane concentration has been observed and is discussed.

We believe that this conflict can be attributed primarily to a lack of interaction and institutional overlap among the three communities of practice. Differences in language, method and political relevance may also contribute to the intellectual divide. Thus, this paper seeks to review the theoretical and policy linkages among disaster risk reduction, climate change and development.

However, unless individual EU Member States (MS) decide differently, the transfer of unused allowances from the period of 2005-2007 into the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, i.e. 2008-2012, will be prohibited. In this paper, we first explore the implications of such a ban on banking when initial emission targets are lenient. This analysis is based on a simulation which was recently carried out in Germany with companies and with a student control group. The findings suggest that a EU-wide ban on banking would lead to efficiency losses in addition to those losses which arise from the lack of inter-temporal flexibility. Second, we use simple game-theoretic considerations to argue that, under reasonable assumptions, such a EU-wide ban on banking will be the equilibrium outcome. Thus, to avoid a possible prisoners' dilemma, MS should have co-ordinated their banking decisions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, results from controlled exposure laboratory studies are difficult to relate to actual community health results because of ambiguities in simulated PM mixtures, inconsistent concentration measurements, and the wide range of different biological endpoints. The use of concentrated ambient particulates (CAPs) coupled with factor analysis has provided an improved understanding of biological effects from more realistic laboratory-based exposure studies. Epidemiological studies have provided information concerning sources of potentially toxic particles or components, adding insight into the significance of exposure to secondary particles, such as sulfate, compared with primary emissions, such as elemental and organic carbon from transportation sources. Recent epidemiological approaches incorporate experimental designs that take advantage of broadened speciation monitoring, multiple monitoring stations, source proximity designs, and emission intervention. However, there continue to be major gaps in knowledge about the relative toxicity of particles from various sources, and the relationship between toxicity and particle physicochemical properties. Advancing knowledge could be facilitated with cooperative toxicological and epidemiological study designs, with the support of findings from atmospheric chemistry.

Karst. being economically the most important one. Forestry is of major economic importance in this region. Forestry planning and climate change scenarios are based on similar (long-term) timescales, i.e. between 70 and 120 yr. Within the EU project 'Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes' (MICE), we have used 'present day' runs (1961-1990) and future scenarios (2070-2100, emission scenarios A2 and B2 from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios [SRES]) of the HadRM3 regional climate model to study and model direct and indirect effects of changing climate on Norway spruce in Sweden and northern Europe. According to our results, extreme climate events like spring temperature backlashes and summer drought will increase in frequency and duration. In combination with a raised mean temperature, climate extremes will negatively precondition trees (i.e. increase their susceptibility) to secondary damage through pests and pathogens. Decreased forest vitality also makes stands more susceptible to windthrow. Storm damage is discussed based on a 100 yr storm damage record for Sweden. Marginally increased frequencies and windspeeds of storms may cause disproportionate increases in windthrow. Increased economic hazards can be expected from a combination of the increased volumes of wind-thrown timber, and a greater likelihood of additional generations of spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (further encouraged by the increase in fallen timber), as a result of a changing climate with warmer summers. © Inter-Research 2006.","Drought; Forestry; Frost; Insect damage; Modelling; Windstorm damage","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Computer simulation; Drought; Forestry; Softwoods; boreal forest; climate change; climate effect; coniferous tree; drought; forestry; frost; insect; storm damage; Eurasia; Europe; Coleoptera; Ips typographus; Picea; Picea abies; Scolytinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746410948

Regular monitoring subsequently revealed that the deep water of the lake was gradually recharged with CO2. To preclude a similar event in the future, a degassing pipe was installed in the lake in 2001. In the present study a one-dimensional model is used to predict the effects of this pipe and other degassing options on the CO2 concentrations and the stratification within the lake for the next 50 years. The results of the simulations show that without degassing, total CO2 content would reach the preeruption value within a few decades. The presently installed pipe is sufficient to reduce CO2 pressures in the entire water column above the pipe inlet to &lt;5 bar within 10 years, and a steady state is reached within 50 years. Depending on the assessment of the risk due to the gas currently remaining in the lake and the costs involved, the installation of additional pipes could be considered (1) to remove the gas more quickly and (2) as a backup for long-term failures and maintenance. Once the steady state is reached, degassing with one pipe is a practicable long-term solution which can also be used for monitoring the approximate deep water CO2 concentrations by nonprofessionals. Assuming a doubled deep water input in the future as an upper limit of the expected source strength, the pipe is still able to prevent a CO2 accumulation. As a side effect, the degassing operation strongly changes the stratification in the lake. It transforms the lake from a meromictic to an oligomictic system and gradually removes the dissolved salts from the lake.

Between the years 2000 and 2010, particulate matter (PM) exhaust emissions from traffic in Flanders, a region of Belgium, will be reduced by about 44% without taking any extra reduction measures (baseline scenario). The PM emissions from road traffic were calculated using the MIMOSA model. Furthermore, we explored a range of options to increase attempts to reduce PM exhaust emission from traffic in 2010. When installing particle filters on heavy-duty trucks and buses, introducing biodiesel and diesel/hybrid cars, as well as slowing down the increase of private diesel cars, only an extra reduction of about 8% PM can be achieved in Flanders. The costs to achieve this small reduction are very high. To justify these costs, benefits for public health have been calculated and expressed in external costs. We demonstrate that only an enhanced effort to retrofit trucks and buses with particle filters has a net benefit. We have used Monte Carlo techniques to test the validity of this conclusion. It is concluded that a local or national policy that goes beyond European policies is not always beneficial and that additional measures should be assessed carefully. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To effect CCR, CcpA binds a phosphoprotein, either HPr-Ser46-P or Crh-Ser46-P. Although Crh and histidine-containing protein (HPr) are structurally homologous, CcpA binds Crh-Ser46-P more weakly than HPr-Ser46-P. Moreover, Crh can form domain-swapped dimers, which have been hypothesized to be functionally relevant in CCR. To understand the molecular mechanism of Crh-Ser46-P regulation of CCR, we determined the structure of a CcpA-(Crh-Ser 46-P)-DNA complex. The structure reveals that Crh-Ser46-P does not bind CcpA as a dimer but rather interacts with CcpA as a monomer in a manner similar to that of HPr-Ser46-P. The reduced affinity of Crh-Ser46-P for CcpA as compared with that of HPr-Ser46P is explained by weaker Crh-Ser46-P interactions in its contact region I to CcpA, which causes this region to shift away from CcpA. Nonetheless, the interface between CcpA and helix α2 of the second contact region (contact region II) of Crh-Ser46-P is maintained. This latter finding demonstrates that this contact region is necessary and sufficient to throw the allosteric switch to activate cre binding by CcpA. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Carbon; Dimers; DNA; Molecular biology; Monomers; Catabolite regulation; Phosphoproteins; Transcriptional regulators; Proteins; bacterial protein; catabolite control protein A; histidine; phosphoprotein; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; carbon; catabolite control protein, bacteria; Crh protein, Bacillus subtilis; DNA binding protein; HPr kinase; protein serine threonine kinase; repressor protein; article; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; catabolite repression; Gram positive bacterium; nonhuman; priority journal; protein structure; transcription regulation; amino acid sequence; chemistry; comparative study; DNA responsive element; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; protein binding; protein secondary structure; protein tertiary structure; Posibacteria; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; DNA, Bacterial; DNA-Binding Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphoproteins; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Repressor Proteins; Response Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646588334

Many of the post-Variscan fluorite-barite-quartz veins are considered to have precipitated through mixing of a deep saline brine with meteoric, low salinity waters. This hypothesis was tested using carbon, sulfur, and oxygen isotope data of sulfides, sulfates and calcite, coupled with fluid inclusion studies. Primary hydrothermal calcites from the deposits show a positive correlation of their δ13C (V-PDB) and δ18O (V-SMOW) values, which range from -12 to -3‰ and from 12 to 18.5‰, respectively. Carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of paragenetically young, remobilized calcite types are shifted towards higher values and range from -12 to -1‰ and from 20 to 25‰, respectively. We developed an improved calculation procedure for modeling the covariation of carbon and oxygen isotopes in calcite resulting from mixing of two fluids with different isotopic compositions and total carbon concentrations. In our model, the carbon speciation in the two model fluid end-members and the fluid mixtures are calculated using a speciation and reaction path code. The carbon and oxygen isotope covariation of primary Schwarzwald calcites can effectively be modeled by a mixing trend of a deep saline brine and a meteoric, low salinity water. Sulfur isotope data of barites from 44 hydrothermal fluorite-barite-quartz veins vary from 9 to 18‰ (CDT), sulfide ore minerals show δ34S values between -14.4 and 2.9‰. Calculated sulfide-sulfate equilibrium temperatures are in the range between 300 and 350 °C. These temperatures differ significantly from the formation temperatures of 150 to 200 °C of most of the deposits as estimated from fluid inclusions, and are interpreted as preserved paleotemperatures of the deep aquifer. This assumption has been carefully checked against possible contamination of an equilibrated sulfide-sulfate system from the deep aquifer with sulfate from surface-derived sources, considering also the kinetics of the sulfide-sulfate isotope exchange. A combination of the S isotopic results with microthermometric fluid inclusion data and constraints on the temperature of the meteoric water was used to calculate mixing ratios of the two fluid end-members. The results indicate that mass fractions of the deep saline brine in the mixed fluid were between 0.5 and 0.75. Considering all geologic, geochemical and isotopic information, we propose that the majority of the post-Variscan hydrothermal veins in the Schwarzwald area were precipitated by district-scale mixing of a homogeneous deep saline brine with meteoric waters. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Allen Road, Tucson, AZ 85719, United States","Across many dryland regions, historically grass-dominated ecosystems have been encroached upon by woody-plant species. In this paper, we compare ecosystem water and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes over a grassland, a grassland-shrubland mosaic, and a fully developed woodland to evaluate potential consequences of woody-plant encroachmenton important ecosystem processes. All three sites were located in the riparian corridor of a river in the southwest US. As such, plants in these ecosystems may have access to moisture at the capillary fringe of the near-surface water table. Using fluxes measured by eddy covariance in 2003 we found that ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) and net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) increased with increasing woody-plant dominance. Growing season ET totals were 407, 450, and 639mm in the grassland, shrubland, and woodland, respectively, and in excess of precipitation by 227, 265, and 473mm. This excess was derived from groundwater, especially during the extremely dry premonsoon period when this was the only source of moisture available to plants. Access to groundwater by the deep-rooted woody plants apparently decouples ecosystem ET from gross ecosystem production (GEP) with respect to precipitation. Compared with grasses, the woody plants were better able to use the stable groundwater source and had an increased net CO2 gain during the dry periods. This enhanced plant activity resulted in substantial accumulation of leaf litter on the soil surface that, during rainy periods, may lead to high microbial respiration rates that offset these photosynthetic fluxes. March-December (primary growing season) totals of NEE were -63, -212, and -233 gCm-2 in the grassland, shrubland, and woodland, respectively. Thus, there was a greater disparity between ecosystem water use and the strength of the CO2 sink as woody plants increased across the encroachment gradient. Despite a higher density of woody plants and a greater plant productivity in the woodland than in the shrubland, the woodland produced a larger respiration response to rainfall that largely offset its higher photosynthetic potential. These data suggest that the capacity for woody plants to exploit water resources in riparian areas results in enhanced carbon sequestration at the expense of increased groundwater use under current climate conditions, but the potential does not scale specifically as a function of woody-plant abundance. These results highlight the important roles of water sources and ecosystem structure on the control of water and carbon balances in dryland areas. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon dioxide exchange; Carbon sequestration; Ecohydrology; Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration; Mesquite(Prosopis velutina); Riparian; Woody-plant encroachment","carbon dioxide; ecohydrology; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; grassland; net ecosystem exchange; riparian vegetation; semiarid region; Poaceae; Prosopis; Prosopis velutina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645885325

Carbon monoxide is of particular interest because it represents a key reactant during the abiotic synthesis of reduced carbon compounds via Fischer-Tropsch-type processes. Laboratory experiments were conducted to constrain reactions that regulate the speciation of aqueous single carbon species under hydrothermal conditions and determine kinetic parameters for the oxidation of CO according to the water water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O). Aqueous fluids containing added CO2, CO, HCOOH, NaHCO3, NaHCOO, and H2 were heated at 150, 200, and 300 °C and 350 bar in flexible-cell hydrothermal apparatus, and the abundances of carbon compounds was monitored as a function of time. Variations in fluid chemistry suggest that the reduction of CO2 to CH3 OH under aqueous conditions occurs via a stepwise process that involves the formation of HCOOH, CO, and possibly CH2O, as reaction intermediaries. Kinetic barriers that inhibit the reduction of CH3OH to CH4 allow the accumulation of reaction intermediaries in solution at high concentrations regulated by metastable thermodynamic equilibrium. Reaction of CO2 to CO involves a two-step process in which CO2 initially undergoes a reduction step to HCOOH which subsequently dehydrates to form CO. Both reactions proceed readily in either direction. A preexponential factor of 1.35 × 106 s-1 and an activation energy of 102 kJ/mol were retrieved from the experimental results for the oxidation of CO to CO2. Reaction rates amongst single carbon compounds during the experiments suggest that ∑CO2 (CO2 + HCO3- + CO3 2-), CO, ∑HCOOH (HCOOH + HCOO-), and CH3OH may reach states of redox-dependent metastable thermodynamic equilibrium in subseafloor and other hydrothermal systems. The abundance of CO under equilibrium conditions is strongly dependent on temperature, the total carbon content of the fluid, and host-rock lithology. If crustal residence times following the mixing of high-temperature hydrothermal fluids with cool seawater are sufficiently long, reequilibration of aqueous carbon can result in the generation of additional reduced carbon species such as HCOOH and CH3OH, and the consumption of H2. The present study suggests that abiotic reactions involving aqueous carbon compounds in hydrothermal systems are sufficiently rapid to influence metabolic pathways utilized by organisms that inhabit vent environments. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show that δ18O and δ13C values in fossil and modern ratite eggshells collected in the aeolianite deposits of the southern and central Namib Desert track regional distinctions and global climate shifts throughout the Neogene. δ18O values, although variable, are consistently higher in the central compared to the southern Namib throughout the record. δ18O trends during the Miocene differ for the two regions, but track each other post-Miocene. Throughout the Miocene, δ13C values for ratite eggshells from both the central and southern Namib regions are indistinguishable showing that the flora remained C3 throughout. The overall negative (- 3‰) shift in mean values for Miocene biostratigraphic zones is consistent with the response of C3 photosynthesis to pCO2 shifts from 180 to 320 ppmv as estimated from marine alkenone studies and/or evolution of the δ13C of the atmospheric CO2. Evidence for C4 plants occurs post-Miocene, with the development of the southern, winter rainfall and central/northern, summer rainfall zonation apparent today. These data provide independent corroboration that the expansion of C4-dominated ecosystems after ∼ 7 Ma cannot be attributed to a reduction of pCO2 below a 500 ppmv threshold, as earlier proposed. Proliferation of C4 plants in the Namib after ∼ 5 Ma and, elsewhere, may be related rather to energy budgets and rainfall seasonality shifts resulting from large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation reorganisation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The former is applied using two different horizontal resolutions: coarse (84 km) and fine (16.7 km). More than 96% of the power plant Hg emissions are calculated with the plume model to be transported beyond 50 km from the plants. The grid–based model predicts a lower fraction to be transported beyond 50 km: >91% with a coarse resolution and >95% with a fine resolution. The contribution of the power plant emissions to total Hg deposition within a radius of 50 km from the plants is calculated to be <8% with the plume model, <14% with the Eulerian model with a coarse resolution, and <10% with the Eulerian model with a fine resolution. The Eulerian grid–based model predicts greater local impacts than the plume model because of artificially enhanced vertical dispersion; the former predicts about twice as much Hg deposition as the latter when the area considered is commensurate with the resolution of the grid–based model. If one compares the local impacts for an area that is significantly less than the grid–based model resolution, then the grid–based model may predict lower local deposition than the plume model, because two compensating errors affect the results obtained with the grid–based model: initial dilution of the power plant emissions within one or more grid cells and enhanced vertical mixing to the ground. © 2006 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Deposition; Dispersions; Fossil fuel power plants; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Coarse resolution; Eulerian grid-based model; Gaussian plume model; Vertical dispersion; Mercury deposits; mercury; air pollution; article; atmospheric deposition; electric power plant; mathematical model; particle size; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745463757

Multilevel analyses can separate determinants operating at an individual level from those operating at a contextual level. This paper aims to systematically review multilevel studies of school contextual effects on pupil outcomes. Design: Key word searching of five databases yielded 17 cross sectional or longitudinal studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Results are summarised with reference to type of school contextual determinant. Main results: Four main school effects on pupil outcomes were identified. Having a health policy or antismoking policy, a good school climate, high average socioeconomic status, and urban location had a positive effect on pupil outcomes. Outcomes under study were smoking habits, wellbeing, problem behaviour, and school achievement. Conclusions: Despite the different pupil outcomes and the variety of determinants used in the included papers, a school effect was evident. However, to improve our understanding of school effects, presentations of results from multilevel studies need to be standardised. Intraclass correlation and explained between school variance give relevant information on factors in the school environment influencing pupil outcomes, and should be included in all multilevel studies. Inclusion of pupil level predictors in the multilevel models should be based on theoretical considerations of how schools and communities are interconnected and how pupils and their families are influenced by school contextual factors.",,"child development; educational attainment; schooling behavior; academic achievement; behavior disorder; correlation analysis; data base; environmental factor; health behavior; health care policy; human; longitudinal study; prediction; prevalence; review; risk factor; school; smoking habit; standardization; student; theory; wellbeing; Achievement; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Child; Child Behavior; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Organizational Culture; Schools; Social Environment; Social Values; Students",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144471369

The main focus of the paper is to examine the stakeholders' reactions to the mitigation option of capturing CO2 from power stations and storing it in suitable off-shore geological reservoirs. Five energy scenarios were developed which involved a range of levels of CO2 capture and storage (CCS): Fossilwise, Nuclear Renaissance, Renewable Generation and Spreading the Load high and low scenarios. A multi-criteria assessment method (MCA) was used as a way of elucidating stakeholders' views on the desirability or otherwise of each scenario against nine stakeholder-derived criteria. We found that stakeholders were either business-focused or environment/society-focused with respect to weighting of the criteria. Scoring of the scenarios did not follow such a straightforward pattern. Most respondents scored and weighted strategically and tended to express a clear preference for a form of energy generation. The results suggest that there is unlikely to be a wide-ranging consensus amongst energy stakeholders on the desirability of specific future forms of energy generation. On balance, the results support the inclusion of CCS within scenarios of a low-carbon energy system. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the results of on-road emissions testing of 11 HDD vehicles (model years 1996-2000) over the ARB Four Phase driving schedule and the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS). Emission rates were found to be highly dependent on vehicle operating mode. Per mile NOx emission rates for vehicle operation at low speeds, in simulated congested traffic, were three times higher per mile emissions then while cruising on the freeway. Comparisons of NOx emission factors to EMFAC baseline emission factors were within 5-40% for vehicles of various model years tested over the UDDS. A comparison of NOx emission factors for a weighted average of the ARB four phase driving schedule yielded values within 17-57% of EMFAC values. Generally, particulate matter (PM) emission rates were lower than EMFAC values. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Six scenarios have been defined, analysing three policy strategies in two different contexts of energy supply - A, generally accepted energy supply forecast and B, worst-case energy supply forecast (scarcity of energy). Policies include: business as usual; investment in infrastructure and technology; and a demand regulation based approach involving changes in taxation and tolls. The paper assesses the impact and robustness of each policy against assumptions about future oil supply/demand. Our results demonstrate three key issues. First, scarcity of oil will accelerate the development and take-up of alternative fuel technologies; second, investment in alternative technologies alone will alleviate the impact of local emissions and reduce energy consumption per kilometre travelled but will only reduce yearly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions after a time lag of about 15 years; so that, third, some form of regulation of demand will be necessary to reduce total emissions and externalities caused by congestion. Research is required to define the necessary level of regulation in combination with technology investments. However, we suggest that a policy involving improvements in infrastructure coupled with investments in fuel technology and differentiated fuel taxes will be required in the future.","Infrastructure planning; Mathematical modelling; Transport planning","Crude petroleum; Energy utilization; Fuels; Land use; Public policy; Taxation; Infrastructure planning; Mathematical modelling; Transport planning; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745043827

Modeling efforts to attribute these differences to changes in orbital parameters and greenhouse gas (GHG) levels have had limited success, especially over North America. In this study, the importance of a possibly cooler tropical Pacific Ocean during the epoch (akin to a permanent La Niña-like perturbation to the present climate) in causing these differences is emphasized. Systematic sets of atmospheric general circulation model experiments, with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific basin and an interactive mixed layer ocean elsewhere, are performed. Given the inadequacies of current fully coupled climate models in simulating the tropical Pacific climate, this intermediate coupling model configuration is argued to be more suitable for quantifying the contributions of the altered orbital forcing, GHG levels, and tropical Pacific SST conditions to the different mid-Holocene climates. The simulated responses in this configuration are in fact generally more consistent with the available evidence from paleovegetation and sedimentary records. Coupling to the mixed layer ocean enhances the wind-evaporation-SST feedback over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The net response to the orbital changes is to shift the North Atlantic intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) northward, and make North Africa wetter. The response to the reduced GHG levels opposes, but does not eliminate, these changes. The northward-shifted ITCZ also blocks the moisture supply from the Gulf of Mexico into North America. This drying tendency is greatly amplified by the local response to La Niña-like conditions in the tropical Pacific. Consistent with the paleoclimatic evidence, the simulated North American drying is also most pronounced in the growing (spring) season. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Evaporation; Greenhouse effect; Wind effects; Atmospheric general circulation; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ); Sea surface temperature (SST); Climatology; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate modeling; Holocene; intertropical convergence zone; La Nina; paleoclimate; sea surface temperature; Africa; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Atlantic Ocean (Tropical); Gulf of Mexico; North Africa; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746034945

The presumption is that this is possible within the current regulatory context. However, design for natural ventilation of public buildings is still innovative, at least within the regulatory framework. Two case studies involving the implementation of natural ventilation schemes indicate the concern and barriers raised by local authority Building Control departments, the fire authorities and various prospective insurers in response to design proposals. The design strategies devised fell outside the provisions of the prevailing codes and regulations in their approach to ensuring safe and effective fire control and smoke clearance using natural ventilation. The destabilizing effects of the current regulatory system impact negatively on the use of natural ventilation and hinder innovation. Schemes proposing to incorporate natural ventilation may be rejected through risk- and value-engineering exercises because of perceived uncertainties about compliance with current fire regulations and codes, and the time and cost implications of embarking on an exercise to prove at least equivalence in the creation of a safe environment.","Fire and smoke modelling; Fire engineering; Fire regulations; Governance; Innovation; Natural ventilation; Performance-based regulation; Regulation; Sustainability; UK","Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Smoke; Ventilation; Fire and smoke modeling; Fire engineering; Fire regulations; Governance; Innovation; Natural ventilation; Performance-based regulations; Sustainability; UK; Fire control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144439141

These forests hold the key to current and future supply of coniferous industrial wood and at the same time play a significant role in regulating Earth's climatic system. Expected to be one of the most rapidly impacted regions of the world by future climate change, the boreal biome has already been substantially affected by global change. It is likely that if unabated, continued change will lead to impoverishment and degradation of boreal ecosystems, with consequent loss of vital services upon which human society depends. An improved systems understanding of the functioning of circumpolar boreal forests is a pressing challenge for boreal forest science and is needed in order to estimate their resilience to perturbations, to predict likely responses to the changing environment, and to design mitigation strategies. With such understanding, coordinated international efforts can be focused on developing anticipatory strategies for adaptation to, and mitigation of dangerous consequences of global change for boreal resources. The International Boreal Forest Research Association (IBFRA) provides a focus for international research on these issues and serves as a global window for boreal forest science and sustainable forest management in the boreal region. © Springer 2006.","Biogeochemical cycles; Boreal biome; Carbon; Circumpolar; Climate change; Disturbance; Ecology; Forest science; Global change; IBFRA; Sustainable forest management","boreal forest; forestry; global change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645218882

Road transport energy is provided by diesel and petrol, of which 60 % is sourced from imported crude oil, the rest from a once unique and still world-leading synthetic fuels (synfuels) industry that converts local coal and natural gas into liquid fuels. South Africa grows maize and sugar crops in excess of local needs, so is well positioned to produce bio-ethanol. Bio-ethanol can replace petrol from imported crude oil and save valuable foreign exchange, contribute to the local economy, generate or save jobs and enhance energy security. The South African approach is based on a proposed 10 % blend of ethanol into the petrol pool of about 11 billion litres. High oil prices and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions make investment in biofuels desirable. This article examines the economics of investments in liquid biofuel production, both from a national interest and a commercial perspective. It concludes that fuel bio-ethanol investment is desirable from a national economic perspective and thus fiscal support is justified. Support is necessary to cater for low oil price scenarios and to warrant commercial investment. The government needs to balance the needs of investors and feedstock crop-growers with those of the public, in particular the fuel consumers, by providing the right level of support.

There has been recent progress in identifying potential risk factors for the tumor, and in the use of emerging technologies for diagnosis and palliative treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Hepatitis B and C, cirrhosis and alcohol have been described as risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma. A morphology-based classification for cholangiocarcinoma is proposed that will facilitate future descriptive epidemiology, diagnosis and comparative therapeutic studies. Diagnosis may be improved by new approaches to enhance the diagnostic yield and utility of biliary cytology. The role of new imaging approaches such as positron emission tomography scanning, endoscopic ultrasound or optical coherence tomography for diagnosis are being examined and defined. Long-term results for transplantation protocols for curative intent in non-resectable localized disease have been described.

The implementation of these policies involves large expenditures, and it is reasonable for policymakers to ask what degree of certainty can be attached to the underlying critical load and exceedance estimates. This paper is a literature review of studies which attempt to estimate the uncertainty attached to critical loads. Critical load models and uncertainty analysis are briefly outlined. Most studies have used Monte Carlo analysis of some form to investigate the propagation of uncertainties in the definition of the input parameters through to uncertainties in critical loads. Though the input parameters are often poorly known, the critical load uncertainties are typically surprisingly small because of a ""compensation of errors"" mechanism. These results depend on the quality of the uncertainty estimates of the input parameters, and a ""pedigree"" classification for these is proposed. Sensitivity analysis shows that some input parameters are more important in influencing critical load uncertainty than others, but there have not been enough studies to form a general picture. Methods used for dealing with spatial variation are briefly discussed. Application of alternative models to the same site or modifications of existing models can lead to widely differing critical loads, indicating that research into the underlying science needs to continue. © Springer 2006.","Acid deposition; Emission control; Environmental policy; GLUE; Monte Carlo analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Steady state mass balance model; Steady state water chemistry model; Uncertainty analysis","Acidity; Monte Carlo methods; Public policy; Sensitivity analysis; Acidic substances; Critical load; Policymakers; Gas emissions; acid deposition; atmospheric deposition; critical load; emission control; environmental modeling; literature review; policy implementation; uncertainty analysis; analytical error; analytical parameters; classification; mathematical model; Monte Carlo method; quantitative analysis; review; sensitivity analysis; soil; soil analysis; soil pollution; statistical model; steady state; water pollution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29844452620

Despite the importance of the soil gas phase, the study of the processes of production, consumption, and transport of gases in soils still suffers from many uncertainties, particularly methods of measurement. Most frequently, soil gases are monitored as fluxes, or net gas flows at the surface, from which the soil capacity to adsorb or release some gaseous substances is assessed. Surface flux measurements ignore the processes that operate in the soil, and thus many questions remain regarding the mechanisms controlling the fluxes. Another shortcoming is that often the gaseous phase of soil is studied separately from the liquid and solid phases, resulting in serious errors in quantitative evaluation of the soil's capacity to produce, absorb, release and accumulate gaseous substances. The problem concerning the mechanisms and forms of gas transport in such a complicated porous medium also remains open and this restrains the modelling of the gaseous phase dynamics, its vertical and lateral distribution in different types of soils. The spatial and temporal irregularities in gas dynamics require changes to the standard approach of the field studies being carried out only in warm vegetated seasons. Some of these problems will be discussed in this chapter as related to quantitative analyses of the gaseous phase composition and its state in the soil. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and 2009.",,"Gas dynamics; Gases; Porous materials; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Climate condition; Gas transport; Gaseous substances; Global sources; Lateral distributions; Methods of measurement; Porous medium; Quantitative evaluation; Soil surveys",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927083332

However, this regional energy strategy is unique to every region as each region differs from each other. Strategies must become embedded within regional and local policies to converge to deliver low carbon.

The model predicted O3 concentrations reasonably well with a normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean error (NME) of 13.3% and 51.2% over all measurement sites and hours. It showed an excellent performance in predicting daily O3 peaks with a NMB and NME of -2.2% and 24.3%. The model also did well in predicting the time at which the peaks occurred. The model captured the diurnal variations and spatial distributions of O3 concentrations very well, with some difficulty at locations deep in the valley. Model predictions of PM2.5 concentrations over all sites and hours had a moderate NMB and NME of 30.9% and 66.2%. The model did well in predicting the general temporal trend of PM2.5 concentration levels. However, the high hourly variability in PM2.5 measurements was not possible for the model to capture. In addition, the temporal variations of modelled concentrations change more dramatically than the measured. The model performed poorly in predicting PM sulphate, ammonium, and nitrate concentrations. The extreme over-prediction in nitrate concentrations was partially related to an overabundance of total ammonia in the system. Sensitivity tests of NH3 emission reductions showed that reducing NH3 supply to the system could help reduce the over-predictions of both ammonium and nitrate concentrations, although the model science also needs to be improved. To evaluate the PM organics performance, carbon multiplication factors (CMFs) of 1.4 and 1.9 were applied to an urban site and an urban-to-rural transition site, respectively. The model showed satisfactory performance for PM2.5 organics with a NMB and NME of -6.0% and 50.5%.

However, significant carbon oxidation of the iron oxide/graphite pellets by H 2O generated from the reduction of Fe 2O 3 by H 2 was observed. At higher temperatures, reduction by carbon complicates the overall reduction mechanism, with the iron oxide/graphite composite pellet found to be more reactive than the iron oxide/char composite pellet. From the scanning electron micrographs, partially reduced composite pellets showed a typical topochemical interface with an intermediate region between an oxygen-rich unreacted core and an iron-rich outer shell. To determine the possibility of reduction by volatiles, a layer of iron oxide powders was spread on top of a high volatile containing bituminous coal and heated inside a reactor using infra-red radiation. By separating the individual reactions involved for an iron oxide/coal mixture where a complex set of reactions occur simultaneously, it was possible to determine the sole effect of volatile reduction. It was found that the light reducing gases evolve initially and react with the iron oxide, with complex hydrocarbons evolving at the later stages.

This shift in the supply of land for plantations could have large effects on above-ground carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Subsidies of approximately $12-27 per ha per year would maintain the area of hardwood forests and reduce carbon emissions from the above-ground and product pool carbon stocks over the next 30 years.

Specifically, decreasing dimension sizes may limit the effectiveness of liquid-based removal of photoresist and plasma etch residues. In addition, the hazardous solvents currently in use pose environmental concerns. Gas-expanded liquids (GXLs) and supercritical fluids may offer cleaning or residue removal approaches that overcome some of the drawbacks of current surface preparation methods. Removal of PHOST (polyhydroxystyrene) photoresist films has been demonstrated with CO2 -expanded ethanol (up to 75 mol % CO2), indicating that the inclusion of CO2 does not inhibit photoresist removal. In situ interferometry measurements of the PHOST layers allowed insight into the removal mechanism. The GXL mixtures were also invoked to remove post-plasma etch residues using CO2 -expanded TMAHCO3 CH3 OH. At a temperature of 90°C and pressures above 1000 psig the GXL mixture removed the photoresist and etch residue. Cleaning efficiency depended on CO2 pressure; at lower pressures the CO2 reduced the mole fraction of the TMAHCO3 CH3 OH while at higher pressures the CO2 assisted removal. © 2006 The Electrochemical Society.

M5S 1A8, Canada","Although exogenous serotonin at the hypoglossal motor nucleus (HMN) activates the genioglossus muscle, endogenous serotonin plays a minimal role in modulating genioglossus activity in awake and sleeping rats (Sood S, Morrison JL, Liu H, and Horner RL. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 172: 1338-1347, 2005). This result therefore implies that medullary raphe neurons also play a minimal role in the normal physiological control of the HMN, but this has not yet been established because raphe neurons release other excitatory neurotransmitters onto respiratory motoneurons in addition to serotonin. This study tests the hypothesis that inhibition of medullary raphe serotonergic neurons with 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) suppresses genioglossus and diaphragm activities in awake and sleeping rats. Ten rats were implanted with electrodes to record sleep-wake states and genioglossus and diaphragm activities. Microdialysis probes were also implanted into the nucleus raphe obscurus (NRO). Experiments in 10 anesthetized and vagotomized rats were also performed using the same methodology. In anesthetized rats, microdialysis perfusion of 0.1 mM 8-OH-DPAT into the NRO decreased genioglossus activity by 60.7 ± 9.0% and diaphragm activity by 13.3 ± 3.4%. Diaphragm responses to 7.5% CO2 were also significantly reduced by 8-OH-DPAT. However, despite the robust effects observed in anesthetized and vagotomized rats, there was no effect of 0.1 mM 8-OH-DPAT on genioglossus or diaphragm activities in conscious rats awake or asleep. The results support the concept that endogenously active serotonergic medullary raphe neurons play a minimal role in modulating respiratory motor activity across natural sleep-wake states in freely behaving rodents. This result has implications for pharmacological strategies aiming to manipulate raphe neurons and endogenous serotonin in obstructive sleep apnea.

N2O is a commonly used anesthetic that has amnestic and analgesic properties. Recently, devices that estimate depth of consciousness have been introduced in an attempt to better titrate anesthesia, however the effect of N2O on these monitors is unclear. Methods. General anesthesia was induced and titrated to mainta in normal blood pressure and pulse in healthy adults. Data were collected in three 10 minute intervals (Sevo, Sevo + N2O, Sevo). In Phase A, sevoflurane concentration was held constant during the N2O trial in 60 subjects monitored with either BIS, PSI, or Entropy. In Phase B, sevoflurane concentration was reduced as N2O was added, maintaining a constant overall ""MAC"" in 20 subjects monitored concurrently with BIS and Entropy. Sample size for both phases was designed to detect a 10 unit change in measure of processed EEG with alpha = .05 and statistical power = .80. Results. In Phase A, supplementing sevoflurane with &gt;65% N2O increased MAC from 1.3 ± 0.05 to 2.2 ± 0.10, but did not significantly alter BIS nor PSI (p-value for differential MAC is &lt;0.05). Entropy, however, dropped significantly, with a change in state entropy (SE) from 31.1 ± 7.3 to 18.9 ± 3.7 and a corresponding rise when N2O was discontinued. In Phase B, supplementing sevoflurane with &gt;65% N2O with a concomitant reduction in sevoflurane resulted in an increase in both BIS (from 34 ± 5 to 53.9 ± 11.5) and SE (from 32 ± 8.2 to 55.4 ± 21.3). Conclusion. Supplementing sevoflurane with &gt;65% N2O did not result in a significant change in either BIS or PSI when sevoflurane concentration was kept constant.

Under simulated diesel exhaust gas conditions (500 ppm NO, 10% O2, 6% H2O, GHSV of ca. 30,000 h-1) with 525 ppm propene as reductant, maximum conversion levels to N2 reached 62% for NO and 47% for NO2, while maximum NOx reduction was observed at 550 °C. Increasing the propene concentration to 1315 ppm (corresponding to a [C1]/[NO] ratio of 8) resulted in a maximum NO reduction level of 96%, while the temperature corresponding to the maximum shifted to 525 °C. Propane was also found to function as an efficient reductant; maximum NO conversion levels were only slightly lower than for propene, although the temperature window for NO conversion was shifted by ∼25 °C to higher temperature relative to propene. While the presence of oxygen was found to be essential for SCR activity, water significantly inhibited NOx reduction by competing for adsorption sites with the propene and/or NOx reactants. Optimum SCR activity was observed for sol-gel catalysts at bismuth loadings of 3-7 wt%, XRD and XPS measurements showing that the bismuth oxide in these catalysts was present as a highly dispersed phase. The results of steady-state and transient DRIFTS measurements suggested a reaction scheme in which surface nitrate and acetate groups react to afford N-containing intermediates, including organo-nitrite and/or nitrate species, as well as isocyanate, which react further to form ultimately N2. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The study considers emissions of reactive nitrogen gases, their transport, transformations, deposition and effects on algal growth together with management options to reduce these effects. We conclude that atmospheric deposition is an important source of fixed nitrogen to the region particularly in summer, when nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth, and contributes to the overall eutrophication pressures in this region. However, we also conclude that it is unlikely that atmospheric deposition can, on its own, induce algal blooms in this region. A reduction of atmospheric nitrogen loads to this region will require strategies to reduce emissions of ammonia from local agriculture and Europe wide reductions in nitrous oxide emissions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Aquatic and terrestrial plant and sediment carbon:nitrogen (C:N) suggested most buried C was aquatic. The rate of long-term total C burial averaged 31 g·m-2·year-1 (range: 0-84 g·m-2·year-1); this was recently 79 g·m-2-year-1 (range: 40-180 g·m2·year-1) (higher and more variable rates than previously reported for Boreal lakes). Long-term C accrual rate and sediment depth increased with increasing ZT. In each landform, a relatively low base elevation (EB = ES - ZT) lake began accumulating sediment thousands of years before a high EB lake. GF depressions were deeper and had accrued more C·m-2 (and infilled) faster than M and GL lakes; a large GF lake had no organic sediment, perhaps because of large groundwater inputs. Increasing A T:AO corresponded with increasing C accrual rates where precipitation and evaporation dominated (surface runoff infrequent) (M and GL) but not where groundwater dominated (GF lakes) lake water budgets, illustrating the importance of landform and depression characteristics in regionalizing lake-C burial estimates. © 2006 NRC.",,"catchment; evaporation; lake ecosystem; nitrogen; precipitation (climatology); sediment; trophic status",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744457270

The Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the IPCC (2001) said that ""The linkages among local, regional, and global environmental issues, and their relationship to meeting human needs, offer opportunities to capture synergies in developing response options and reducing vulnerabilities to climate change..."" and ""The capacity of countries to adapt and mitigate can be enhanced when climate policies are integrated with national development policies including economic, social and other environmental dimensions."". Whereas the components of what is being defined today as sustainable development have been the object of international deliberation for several decades, it is the issue of climate change that has caught the imagination of the developed world. Poverty alleviation, education, desertification, and biodiversity conservation have all received considerable attention, but were still perceived as problems primarily of the developing world. It is only in recent times that the inter-dependencies of the developed and developing worlds around these issues, affecting social stability and internal security, have been recognized and acknowledged-leading to the Johannesburg summit in 2002. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report is further assessing the inter-linkages between the issues of sustainable development and climate change, touched upon in the TAR, thereby tying together the environmental securities of the developed and developing countries. Yet, as brought out once again during the COP 11 deliberations in Montreal, there exists substantial differences between countries in their understanding of the drivers and pathways of development that need to be adopted to achieve a common global security. This commentary uses India as an example to compare and contrast the implications of using climate change and/or sustainable development as the primary driver for defining future development pathways. It argues that adopting policies and measures aimed at promoting sustainable development is a more appropriate form of ""meaningful participation"" for India in the climate agenda, than setting quantified emissions reductions objectives. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Dayton Street, Madison, WI 53706, United States","Near-IR absorption of methane in the 2000-9500 cm-1 spectral region plays a major role in outer planet atmospheres. However, the theoretical basis for modeling the observations of reflectivity and emission in these regions has had serious uncertainties at temperatures needed for interpreting observations of the colder outer planets. A lack of line parameter information, including ground-state energies and the absence of weak lines, limit the applicability of line-by-line calculations at low temperatures and for long path lengths, requiring the use of band models. However, prior band models have parameterized the temperature dependence in a way that cannot be accurately extrapolated to low temperatures. Here we use simulations to show how a new parameterization of temperature dependence can greatly improve band model accuracy and allow extension of band models to the much lower temperatures that are needed to interpret observations of Uranus, Neptune, Titan, and Saturn. Use of this new parameterization by Irwin et al. [Irwin, P.G.J., Sromovsky, L.A., Strong, E.K., Sihra, K., Bowles, N., Calcutt, S.B., 2005b. Icarus.

Here we compare model predictions to 77 K laboratory observations and to Uranus spectra, which show much improved agreement between observed and modeled spectral features, allowing tighter constraints on pressure levels of Uranus cloud particles, implying that most scattering contributions arise from pressures near 2 bars and 6 bars rather than expected pressures near 1.25 and 3.1 bars. Between visible and near-IR wavelengths, both cloud layers exhibit strong decreases in reflectivity that are indicative of low opacity and submicron particle sizes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The ability of ""spectral nudging"" to improve the eddy statistics determined from model simulations of this current system is investigated. Spectral nudging differs from standard nudging in that only specified frequency and wave number bands of the simulated potential temperature and salinity fields are nudged toward the observed climatology. Therefore the simulated eddy field can develop and evolve with time while the model is prevented from drifting far from the observed climatology. The Parallel Ocean Program (POP) is used to do the simulations, with 0.25° horizontal resolution and 23 vertical levels. The simulated standard deviation and skewness fields for the sea surface height are compared with those estimated from ten years of TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry observations. This comparison shows that spectral nudging allows the model to simulate the eddy statistics of the current system with significantly more accuracy than when the nudging is not used.

Of the variation in soil properties, 17.4% was described by spatial structure, 5.4% by land use (cultivation time and time since abandonment), 3.9% by soil type and 2.6% by vegetation and leaf litter cover. There were differences in individual soil properties between old-field and remnant soils at two sites. Soil compaction, probable erosion as evident by a higher percentage of coarse fragments, increased Colwell phosphate that we interpret as fertiliser residue and reduced organic carbon were evident in one old field, after 60 years of cultivation and 14 years abandonment. Increased Colwell phosphate was evident at the second old field, despite only 1 year in cultivation and 45 years in recovery. The third site showed no evidence of its 4 year period in cultivation 43 years ago despite similar farming practices and soil type to the second. Phosphate fertiliser residues could account for the dominance of non-native annual grasses in the re-assembly of wheatbelt old-fields. © Springer 2006.","Land abandonment; Old-fields; Phosphorus; Secondary succession; Soil nutrients; Spatial variation","land use; phosphorus; secondary succession; soil nutrient; wheat; Australasia; Australia; Western Australia; Poaceae; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644602155

These questions are the principle topic of this chapter. Family law is again in turmoil, and the Principles are an ambitious and sometimes inspired effort to increase clarity and fairness. This turmoil can be attributed to two major factors. First, to paraphrase Professor June Carbone, family law is ground zero in the gender wars. Second, family law is reeling from the upheavals of globalization. These factors provide the backdrop against which the dilemmas addressed in Chapter 7 pertaining to agreements play out. As the introductory quotation from the Principles suggests, Chapter 7 focuses on a particularly intriguing tension between commercial contracts and premarital agreements. This tension is grounded in the broader tension between American views on freedom of contract and autonomy in general, on the one hand, and on freedom of contract and autonomy in the specific context of the family, on the other. While the emphasis on freedom of contract may be peculiarly American, tension between legal regimes and private contractual regimes governing the family is quite common from an international perspective. As it is in the United States, the tension between competing regimes in other countries reflects deep cultural tensions. © Robin Fretwell Wilson 2006 and Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927113770

Results from three 2030 emissions scenarios, broadly representing ""optimistic,"" ""likely,"" and ""pessimistic"" options, are compared to a base year 2000 simulation. This base case realistically represents the current global distribution of tropospheric ozone. A further set of simulations considers the influence of climate change over the same time period by forcing the central emissions scenario with a surface warming of around 0.7K. The use of a large multimodel ensemble allows us to identify key areas of uncertainty and improves the robustness of the results. Ensemble mean changes in tropospheric ozone burden between 2000 and 2030 for the 3 scenarios range from a 5% decrease, through a 6% increase, to a 15% increase. The intermodel uncertainty (±1 standard deviation) associated with these values is about ±25%. Model outliers have no significant influence on the ensemble mean results. Combining ozone and methane changes, the three scenarios produce radiative forcings of -50, 180, and 300 mW m-2, compared to a CO2 forcing over the same time period of 800-1100 mW m-2. These values indicate the importance of air pollution emissions in short- to medium-term climate forcing and the potential for stringent/lax control measures to improve/worsen future climate forcing. The model sensitivity of ozone to imposed climate change varies between models but modulates zonal mean mixing ratios by ±5 ppbv via a variety of feedback mechanisms, in particular those involving water vapor and stratosphere-troposphere exchange. This level of climate change also reduces the methane lifetime by around 4%. The ensemble mean year 2000 tropospheric ozone budget indicates chemical production, chemical destruction, dry deposition and stratospheric input fluxes of 5100, 4650, 1000 and 550 Tg(O3) yr-1, respectively. These values are significantly different to the mean budget documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR). The mean ozone burden (340 Tg(O3)) is 10% larger than the IPCC TAR estimate, while the mean ozone lifetime (22 days) is 10% shorter. Results from individual models show a correlation between ozone burden and lifetime, and each model's ozone burden and lifetime respond in similar ways across the emissions scenarios. The response to climate change is much less consistent. Models show more variability in the tropics compared to midlatitudes. Some of the most uncertain areas of the models include treatments of deep tropical convection, including lightning NOx production; isoprene emissions from vegetation and isoprene's degradation chemistry; stratosphere-troposphere exchange; biomass burning; and water vapor concentrations.

This technique is capable of translating the high spatial resolution of a bright field image into a sampling of the spectral information with similar resolution. Here we evaluate the contributions of chromatic aberration and the various acquisition parameters to the spatial sampling resolution of the spectral information, and show that this can reach 0.5 nm, in a system not ordinarily capable of forming electron probes smaller than 2 nm. We use this high spatial sampling resolution to study the plasmon energy variation across amorphous carbon superlattices, in order to extract information about their structure and electronic properties. By modelling the interaction of the relativistic incident electrons with a dielectric layer sandwiched between outer layers, we show that, due to the screening of the interfaces and at increased collection angles, the plasmon energy in the sandwiched layer can still be identified for layer thicknesses down to 5 Å. This allows us to measure the change in the well bandgap as a function of well width and to interpret it in terms of the changes in the sp2-fractions due to the deposition method, as measured from the carbon K-edges, and in terms of quantum confinement of the well wavefunction by the adjacent barriers. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

One criticism of the models used in many of these studies is that they exclude some forcings of potential importance, notably from fossil fuel black carbon, biomass smoke, and land use changes. Herein transient simulations with a new model, the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 1 (HadGEM1), are described, which include these forcings in addition to other anthropogenic and natural forcings, and a fully interactive treatment of atmospheric sulfur and its effects on clouds. These new simulations support previous work by showing that there was a significant anthropogenic influence on near-surface temperature change over the last century. They demonstrate that black carbon and land use changes are relatively unimportant for explaining global mean near-surface temperature changes. The pattern of warming in the troposphere and cooling in the stratosphere that has been observed in radiosonde data since 1958 can only be reproduced when the model includes anthropogenic forcings. However, there are some discrepancies between the model simulations and radiosonde data, which are largest where observational uncertainty is greatest in the Tropics and high latitudes. Predictions of future warming have also been made using the new model. Twenty-first-century warming rates, following policy-Televant emissions scenarios, are slightly greater in HadGEM1 than in the Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model (HadCM3) as a result of the extra forcing in HadGEM1. An experiment in which greenhouse gases and other anthropogenic forcings are stabilized at 2100 levels and held constant until 2200 predicts a committed twenty-second-century warming of less than 1 K, whose spatial distribution resembles that of warming during the twenty-first century, implying that the local feedbacks that determine the pattern of warming do not change significantly.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Computer simulation; Cooling; Global warming; Radiosondes; Troposphere; Upper atmosphere; Greenhouse gas concentrations; Natural forcings; Near-surface temperature; Climatology; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; global warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646356573

Globally, landfill sites produce about 10% of the methane entering the atmosphere, and soils above landfill sites have been shown to contain methanotrophic populations with the highest methane oxidation capacity measured. Landfill site simulating lysimeters were set up in which different vegetation regimes were tested for their effect on methane oxidation. Four different plants (Miscanthus, poplar, grass, alfalfa-grass mixture alongside with an unplanted control) were grown with and without landfill gas (LFG) supply. One year after planting, rhizosphere samples in the upper layer of the lysimeters were collected and the methanotroph community was analysed using a cultivation-independent approach. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and RNA dot blot hybridisations with primers/probes targeting specifically type I and type II methanotrophs were used. In addition, methanotrophic 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were compared and dominant clones were sequenced. Methylobacter and Methylocystis were found to be dominant members of the type I and type II methanotroph communities, respectively. The type of plant cover affected both type I and type II methanotrophs, however, biogas had more impact on type I populations displaying higher diversity and abundance in samples supplied with LFG than in the LFG-free controls. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is an option available to governments and industry to help meet emission reduction levels. In addition to increasing the production of oil, the CO 2 can be stored in the oil reservoir for a very long period of time. However, CO2 capture and CO2 EOR operation result in significant costs and energy penalties, for example, CO2 capture from a point source, transportation to the site of use, and recycling produced CO2. This article evaluates the life cycle of CO2 storage from delivery to the oil field through the production, transportation, and refining of the oil and identifies opportunities for optimization. Information from the IEA GHG Weyburn Monitoring and Storage Project is used to provide baseline information for the storage of CO2. The value of this life-cycle study lies in the development of an understanding of the ""carbon"" economics of the EOR process and the impact on net storage of changes to the value of different components in the chain.

In contrast, comparatively little is known about the metabolic consequences of activating resistance responses. In this study we investigated the hypothesis that the activation of both race-specific (Mla12) and broad-spectrum (mlo) resistance pathways in barley leaves infected with Blumeria graminis represents a cost to the plant in terms of carbon production and utilization. We have shown, using quantitative imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence, that during a susceptible interaction, photosynthesis was progressively reduced both in cells directly below fungal colonies and in adjacent cells when compared with uninoculated leaves. The lower rate of photosynthesis was associated with an increase in invertase activity, an accumulation of hexoses and a down-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression. During both Mla12- and mlo-mediated resistance, photosynthesis was also reduced, most severely inhibited in cells directly associated with attempted penetration of the fungus but also in surrounding cells. These cells displayed intense autofluorescence under ultraviolet illumination indicative of the accumulation of phenolic compounds and/or callose deposition. The depression in photosynthesis was not due only to cell death but also to an alteration in source-sink relations and carbon utilization. Apoplastic (cell wall-bound) invertase activity increased more rapidly and to a much greater extent than in infected susceptible leaves and was accompanied by an accumulation of hexoses that was localized to areas of the leaf actively exhibiting resistance responses. The accumulation of hexoses was accompanied by a down-regulation in the expression of Rubisco (rbcS) and chlorophyll a/b binding protein (cab) genes (although to a lesser extent than in a compatible interaction) and with an up-regulation in the expression of the pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1). These results are consistent with a role for invertase in the generation of hexoses, which may supply energy for defence reactions and/or act as signals inducing defence gene expression. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Blumeria graminis; Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging; Hordeum vulgare; Invertase; Photosynthesis; Resistance; Sugar metabolism","beta fructofuranosidase; carbon; hexose; pathogenesis related proteins, plant; pathogenesis-related proteins, plant; peroxidase; phenylalanine ammonia lyase; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; sucrose; vegetable protein; carbon flux; defense mechanism; fungal disease; gene expression; inoculation; photosynthesis; ultraviolet radiation; article; Ascomycetes; barley; cytology; fluorescence microscopy; gene expression regulation; genetics; innate immunity; light harvesting system; metabolism; microbiology; photosynthesis; physiology; plant disease; plant leaf; Ascomycota; beta-Fructofuranosidase; Carbon; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hexoses; Hordeum; Immunity, Innate; Immunity, Natural; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Peroxidase; Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase; Photosynthesis; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Sucrose; Blumeria graminis; Erysiphales; Fungi; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646562521

We examine emissions from 1993 to 2002 and discuss possible explanatory factors. Annual NOx and SO 2 emissions fell nationally, mostly due to decreases in emission limits driven by state and Federal regulations. CO2 emissions have increased almost proportionately with increased generation. Generation increased more than it would have, partly due to energy efficiency spending reductions that accompanied deregulation. The fuel mix shifted slightly from coal to gas, offsetting some CO2 emissions increases and contributing to SO2 and NOx emissions decreases. While the percentage share of generation from renewable sources remained at about 2%, recent and expected future increases in wind generating capacity promise future emissions reductions. Although deregulation lacks clear environmental advantages, the deregulation process creates an opportunity for implementation of state policies to reduce emissions. Regulated and deregulated states with renewable portfolio standards (RPS) have a higher average percent of generation from renewable sources. Average energy efficiency savings are higher in regulated states, but slightly higher in deregulated states with a system benefits charge (SBC) than in regulated states without a SBC. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These technologies must be able to capture nutrients, kill pathogens, and reduce emissions of ammonia (NH 3) and nuisance odors from manure. To meet these needs, a wastewater treatment plant was demonstrated at full-scale in one of two 4,360-pig production units on a finishing farm in Duplin County, North Carolina. The treatment system installed in the first production unit combined new treatment technologies consisting of solid-liquid separation with removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the liquid phase. The second production unit was used as a control to evaluate emission improvements using traditional anaerobic lagoon technology. Both production units had similar production management and lagoons with similar surface area (about 0.9 ha each) and wastewater design. As the treatment system recovered the manure solids and replaced the anaerobic lagoon liquid with cleaner water, it converted the anaerobic lagoon into a treated water pond. Our objective was to study changes in NH 3 emissions as a result of improved water quality. The study was done one year after lagoon conversion into aerated pond as a result of manure treatment and included cold and warm weather conditions. Passive flux samplers were used to measure NH 3 gas fluxes from both lagoon systems. Average total ammoniacal N (TAN) concentrations in lagoon liquid were 31 and 388 mg/L for the treated and traditional systems, respectively. We found that free NH 3 (FA) concentration, which integrates TAN, temperature, and pH into a single factor, explained 90% of the variation in NH 3 emissions from these lagoon systems. Lower N concentrations in the converted lagoon substantially reduced annual NH 3 emissions by 90% with respect to those found in the traditional anaerobic lagoon. Ammonia emissions from the converted lagoon totaled 1,210 kg N/lagoon/year (or 1,311 kg N/ha/year). This annual rate compares with NH 3 emissions of 12,540 kg N/lagoon/year (13,633 kg N/ha/year) from the traditional lagoon. Overall, these results demonstrate that production of clean water using new wastewater technologies can accelerate lagoon cleanup and substantially reduce ammonia emissions from confined animal production.","Ammonia emissions; Ammonia flux; Ammonia volatilization; Anaerobic swine lagoons; Free ammonia; Manure; Nitrogen","Ammonia emissions; Ammonia flux; Ammonia volatilization; Anaerobic swine lagoons; Free ammonia; Manure; Ammonia; Environmental impact; Nitrogen; Odors; Particulate emissions; Pathology; Phosphorus; Sewage lagoons; ammonia; emission; manure; Animalia; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645456798

The result of the MD calculation indicates that the intrinsic diffusivity of methane decreases by an order of magnitude due to the presence of the intercrystalline region, although the adsorption properties do not change except at higher pressure (> 2000 kPa) where the adsorption increased slightly. The estimated permeability using these parameters based on the combined method of molecular simulation and permeation theory agree well with experiments. These results indicate the importance of considering the effect of an intercrystalline region on the permeability in zeolite membranes. © 2006.","Diffusion; Methane; Molecular dynamics; Permeability; Zeolite membranes","Adsorption; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Membranes; Methane; Molecular dynamics; Monte Carlo methods; Methane permeation; Permeation theory; Zeolite membranes; Zeolites; Adsorption; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Membranes; Methane; Molecular dynamics; Monte Carlo methods; Zeolites; membrane; methane; zeolite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645900578

This paper presents an experimental set-up to study the process employing a new approach of heterogeneous photocatalysis using pellet form of catalyst instead of immobilized catalysts on solid substrates. In the experiment, CO2 mixed with water vapour in saturation state was discharged into a quartz reactor containing porous TiO2 pellets and illuminated by various UV lamps of different wavelengths for 48 h continuously. The gaseous products extracted were identified using gas chromatography. The results confirmed that CO2 could be reformed in the presence of water vapour and TiO2 pellets into CH4 under continuous UV irradiation at room conditions. It showed that when UVC (253.7 nm) light was used, total yield of methane was approximately 200 ppm which was a fairly good reduction yield as compared to those obtained from the processes using immobilized catalysts through thin-film technique and anchoring method. CO and H2 were also detected. Switching from UVC to UVA (365 nm) resulted in significant decrease in the product yields.

Columbia was characterized using spatially resolved measurements of fluorescence and leaf temperature, as well as leaf gas exchange,. First instars made small holes with a large perimeter-to-area ratio and avoided veins, while 4th instars made large holes with a low perimeter-to-area ratio and consumed veins. Herbivory by 1st instars reduced photosynthesis more strongly in the remaining leaf tissue than that by 4th instars. Photosystem II operating efficiency (ΦPSII) was correlated with the rate of CO2 exchange, and reductions in ΦPSII in areas around the missing tissues contributed to a 15.6% reduction in CO2 assimilation on the first day following removal of 1st instars. The corresponding increases in non-photochemical quenching and greater rates of non-stomatal water loss from these regions, as well as the partial reversal of low ΦPSII by increasing the ambient CO 2 concentration, suggests that localized water stress and reduced stomatal conductance contributed to the inhibition of photosynthesis. Damage by 1st but not 4th instars reduced the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry (Fv/Fm) by 4-8%. While herbivory by both 1st and 4th instars increased dark respiration rates, the rates were too low to have contributed to the observed reductions in CO2 exchange. The small holes produced by 1st instars may have isolated patches of tissue from the vascular system thereby contributing to localized water stress. Since neither 1st nor 4th instar herbivory had a detectable effect on the expression of the Rubisco small subunit gene, the observed differences cannot be attributed to changes in expression of this gene. The mode of feeding by different instars of T. ni determined the photosynthetic response to herbivory, which appeared to be mediated by the level of water stress associated with herbivore damage. © The Author [2005].

To contribute towards an improvement of actual estimates, soil-atmospheric CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were measured in three successional subtropical forests at the Dinghushan Nature Reserve (hereafter referred to as DNR) in southern China. Soils in DNR forests behaved as N2O sources and CH4 sinks. Annual mean CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes (mean ± SD) were 7.7 ± 4.6MgCO2-Cha-1 yr-1, 3.2 ± 1.2 kg N2ONha-1 yr-1, and 3.4 ± 0.9 kgCH4-Cha-1 yr-1, respectively. The climate was warm and wet from April through September 2003 (the hot-humid season) and became cool and dry from October 2003 through March 2004 (the cool-dry season). The seasonality of soil CO2 emission coincided with the seasonal climate pattern, with high CO2 emission rates in the hot-humid season and low rates in the cool-dry season. In contrast, seasonal patterns of CH4 and N2O fluxes were not clear, although higher CH4 uptake rates were often observed in the cool-dry season and higher N2O emission rates were often observed in the hot-humid season. GHG fluxes measured at these three sites showed a clear increasing trend with the progressive succession. If this trend is representative at the regional scale, CO2 and N2O emissions and CH4 uptake in southern China may increase in the future in light of the projected change in forest age structure. Removal of surface litter reduced soil CO2 effluxes by 17-44% in the three forests but had no significant effect on CH4 absorption and N2O emission rates. This suggests that microbial CH4 uptake and N2O production was mainly related to the mineral soil rather than in the surface litter layer. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Dinghushan Nature Reserve; GHG fluxes; Seasonal difference; Soil-atmospheric exchange; Succession stage; Successional forests","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide; forest ecosystem; methane; nitrous oxide; soil emission; Asia; China; Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644940665

The new discipline of Comparative Planetary Climatology deals with the climate on Earth-like planets and addresses the physical processes that determine environmental conditions, the stability in each case against climate change, and the development of new experiments to further investigate these. By comparing the processes at work on Mars, Venus and Titan to those on our own planet we may gain a deeper understanding of global change on the Earth, the origin and evolution over the long term of this habitable world, and the processes behind threats such as greenhouse warming. Model temperature profiles which give a description of the state of the climate for all four of the terrestrial planet atmospheres in terms of simple physics, can be employed to study, and eventually to answer, questions of climate stability and change, such as: What do the climate systems on all four planets have in common? How stable are their current climates? What controls their stability? What change has taken place and why? What is the chronology of past changes? Can we make plausible predictions of future change?

Here we argue that these characteristics stem from difficulty in binding the featureless CO2 molecule, which forces specificity for the gaseous substrate to be determined largely or completely in the transition state. We hypothesize that natural selection for greater CO2/O2 specificity, in response to reducing atmospheric CO2:O2 ratios, has resulted in a transition state for CO2 addition in which the CO2 moiety closely resembles a carboxylate group. This maximizes the structural difference between the transition states for carboxylation and the competing oxygenation, allowing better differentiation between them. However, increasing structural similarity between the carboxylation transition state and its carboxyketone product exposes the carboxyketone to the strong binding required to stabilize the transition state and causes the carboxyketone intermediate to bind so tightly that its cleavage to products is slowed. We assert that all Rubiscos may be nearly perfectly adapted to the differing CO2, O2, and thermal conditions in their subcellular environments, optimizing this compromise between CO2/O2 specificity and the maximum rate of catalytic turnover. Our hypothesis explains the feeble rate enhancement displayed by Rubisco in processing the exogenously supplied carboxyketone intermediate, compared with its nonenzymatic hydrolysis, and the positive correlation between CO2/O2 specificity and 12C/13C fractionation. It further predicts that, because a more product-like transition state is more ordered (decreased entropy), the effectiveness of this strategy will deteriorate with increasing temperature. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Enzyme mechanisms; Isotope fractionation; Transition states","carbon; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; carboxylic acid; ketone; oxygen; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; article; atmosphere; autotrophy; carbon dioxide fixation; carboxylation; catalysis; concentration (parameters); conformational transition; entropy; enzyme kinetics; enzyme mechanism; enzyme specificity; enzyme substrate complex; fractionation; hydrolysis; nonhuman; oxygenation; priority journal; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Catalysis; Ketones; Kinetics; Molecular Structure; Oxygen; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Substrate Specificity; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646583168

The controls over leaf-atmosphere exchange of NOx (NOx=NO+NO2) have been characterized for a few plant species and important drivers have been identified including stomatal conductance, the partial pressure gradient from the interior to the exterior of the leaf, and, most recently the level of ultraviolet radiation. However, our ability to predict leaf fluxes has been hampered by a dearth of information describing the reactions occurring between NOx and internal constituents of the leaf (often referred to as the mesophyllic resistance). In this study, we investigated NOx uptake in four important agricultural plant species and specifically tested the hypothesis that ascorbic acid within the leaf was a significant control over mesophyllic resistance. Measurements were made using a dynamic leaf chamber at ambient mixing ratios typical of urban atmospheres. Measured NO and NO2 leaf fluxes were lower than the potential flux calculated assuming stomatal conductance as the sole limitation (i.e., no mesophyllic resistance). The ratios of leaf intercellular to ambient concentrations (Ci/Ca) for NO across partial pressures and plant species was usually &gt;0.99 and the leaf uptake rates of NO were negligible within the ranges examined. In contrast, leaf uptake for NO2 was much greater and Ci/Ca were often as low as 0.75. For both gases, Ci/Ca ratios&gt;1 were observed at low ambient mixing ratios indicating emission from leaves. Across plant species, plants with higher leaf nitrogen contents showed higher NO 2 emission rates and plants with higher leaf ascorbate concentrations had higher leaf NO2 uptake rates. These results suggest that in addition to the known effects of stomatal conductance and incident UV radiation, leaf nitrogen content and the capacity for the scavenging of NOx by ascorbic acid may explain the variation in the ability of plants to absorb atmospheric nitrogen oxides. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This species was selected because it is restricted to the cloud forest, where it is a dominant element and has not been considered for protection in any national or international law. It is probably threatened due to the fact that it plays an important social role as a source of food and furnishing. We used a floristic database and a bioclimatic modeling approach including 19 climatic parameters, in order to obtain the current potential distribution pattern of the species. Currently, its potential distribution pattern shows that it is distributed in six different Mexican Priority Regions for Conservation. In addition, we also selected a future climate scenario, on the basis of some climate changes predictions already proposed. The scenario proposed is characterized by +2 °C and -20% rainfall in the region. Under this predicted climatic condition, we found a drastic distribution contraction of the species, in which most of the remaining populations will inhabit restricted areas located outside the boundaries of the surrounding reserves. Consequently, our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of possible future climate changes on the selection of conservation areas and the urgency to conserve some remaining patches of existing cloud forests. Accordingly, we believe that our bioclimatic modeling approach represents a useful tool to undertake decisions concerning the definition of protected areas, once the current potential distribution pattern of some selected species is known. © Springer 2006.","BIOCLIM; Bioclimatic modeling; Climate change; Cloud forest; Fagus; Sierra Madre Oriental","climate change; climate modeling; cloud forest; population distribution; protected area; species conservation; Mexico [North America]; North America; Sierra Madre; Sierra Madre Oriental; Fagus; Fagus grandifolia; Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745457990

Antiepileptic drugs may act on the serotonergic system, as shown in animal models, and thus affect receptor-binding measurements. Methods: We analyzed the effect of AEDs on 5-HT1A-receptor binding in 31 patients and 10 normal controls. Patients with structural lesions, progressive neurologic disorders, or taking other medications were excluded. None had a seizure for ≥2 days before positron emission tomography (PET). [18F]FCWAY PET was performed on a GE Advance scanner with continuous EEG monitoring. Functional images of the distribution volume (V) were generated. Anatomic regions of interest were applied to coregistered PET images, after correction for partial-volume effect. Results: Patients had significantly higher [18F]FCWAY free fraction (f1) than did controls. No AED effects were observed on interictal [18F]FCWAY binding after correction for plasma free fraction. [ 18F]FCWAY V/f1 reduction in epileptic foci was not affected by AEDs. Conclusions: 5-HT1A-receptor binding is reduced in temporal lobe epileptic foci after partial-volume correction.

In particular, it is hydro-meteorological hazards that affect an increasing number of people and cause increasingly large economic losses. Arising from the realisation that these four communities have been largely working in isolation and enjoyed only limited success in reducing vulnerability, there is an emerging perceived need to strengthen significantly collaboration and to facilitate learning and information exchange between them.

The future of this region will be determined in large part by how global climatic changes impact regional conditions and by actions taken to mitigate or adapt to climate change impacts. One potential mitigation strategy is to promote management practices that have the potential to sequester carbon in the soils. The IPCC estimates that 40 Pg of C could be sequestered in cropland soils worldwide over the next several decades; however, changes in global climate may impact this potential. Here, we assess the potential for soil C sequestration with conversion of a conventional till (CT) continuous wheat system to a wheat-corn double cropping system and by implementing no till (NT) management for both continuous wheat and wheat-corn systems. To assess the influence of these management practices under a changing climate, we use two climate change scenarios (A2 and B2) at two time periods in the EPIC agro-ecosystem simulation model. The applied climate change scenarios are from the HadCM3 global climate model for the periods 2015-2045 and 2070-2099 which projects consistent increases in temperature and precipitation of greater than 5°C and up to 300 mm by 2099. An increase in the variability of temperature is also projected and is, accordingly, applied in the simulations. The EPIC model indicates that winter wheat yields would increase on average by 0.2 Mg ha-1 in the earlier period and by 0.8 Mg ha-1 in the later period due to warmer nighttime temperatures and higher precipitation. Simulated yields were not significantly affected by imposed changes in crop management. Simulated soil organic C content was higher under both NT management and double cropping than under CT continuous wheat. The simulated changes in management were a more important factor in SOC changes than the scenario of climate change. Soil C sequestration rates for continuous wheat systems were increased by an average of 0.4 Mg ha-1 year -1 by NT in the earlier period and by 0.2 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the later period. With wheat-corn double cropping, NT increased sequestration rates by 0.8 and 0.4 Mg ha-1 year -1 for the earlier and later periods, respectively. The total C offset due to a shift from CT to NT under continuous wheat over 16 million hectares in the Huang-Hai Plain is projected to reach 240 Tg C in the earlier period and 180 Tg C in the later period. Corresponding C offsets for wheat-corn cropping are 675-495 Tg C. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

One of the oldest tools to modify people's environment is fire, which has ominated fire regimes in many regions over long time scales. This paper focuses on a German case study region, where 80-90% of the fires are human-caused. The objectives of this study are the application of the Regional Fire Model (Reg-FIRM), a process-based fire model that is incorporated into the LPJ Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, to temperate forests under historic climate conditions and to explore ranges of potential impacts of future climate change on fire and vegetation dynamics. Simulation experiments are designed to simulate historic fire pattern and to explore influences of vegetation on fire. Simulated fire pattern reproduced the observed average fire conditions reasonably well although with a smaller amplitude. This leads to underestimation of extreme fire years as well as an overestimation of low fire years. Vegetation composition influenced fire spread conditions in the temperate forest and had little impact on fire ignition potentials, except when only broad-leaved deciduous forests were assumed. Fire is likely to change under climate change conditions. Simulated experiments were conducted to explore the effects of climate change and rising CO2 concentration given the potential natural vegetation as the best-case for Brandenburg. Three GCM scenarios predicting different future climatic changes were applied, and resulted in quantitatively different future fire patterns. Depending on future precipitation pattern and the influence of the CO2 effect on canopy conductance and thus litter moisture, fire was predicted to either decrease or slightly increase in Brandenburg forests, but the burnt area would not exceed current, extreme fire years. Generally, fire changes had no implication for vegetation composition in Brandenburg, but reduced vegetation carbon gain after 2050. In the HadCM3 application, simulated increase in grass cover due to a large burnt area after 2075 accelerated fire spread conditions, thus still increasing the burnt area, while climatic fire danger and number of fires already began to decline. These interactions underline the importance to consider the full range of fire processes and interactions with vegetation dynamics in a simulation model. © Springer 2006.","Brandenburg; Climate change; Human-caused fires; Regional fire model; Vegetation-fire interaction","climate change; computer simulation; forest fire; natural hazard; vegetation; Brandenburg; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645856148

We used both niche-based models (NBM) to evaluate the sensitivity of 159 endemic species to climate change (of an original 1020 plant species modeled) and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to assess the impacts of climate change on vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning. Endemic species modeled by NBM are moderately sensitive to projected climate change. Fewer than 5% are predicted to experience complete range loss by 2080, although more than 47% of the species are expected to be vulnerable (range reduction &gt;30%) by 2080 if they are assumed unable to migrate. Disaggregation of results by life-form showed distinct patterns. Endemic species of perennial herb, geophyte and tree life-formsare predicted to be negatively impacted in Namibia, whereas annual herb and succulent endemic species remain relatively stable by 2050 and 2080. Endemic annual herb species are even predicted to extend their range north-eastward into the tree and shrub savanna with migration, and tolerance of novel substrates. The current protected area network is predicted to meet its mandate by protecting most of the current endemicity in Namibia into the future. Vegetation simulated by DGVM is projected to experience a reduction in cover, net primary productivity and leaf area index throughout much of the country by 2050, with important implications for the faunal component of Namibia's ecosystems, and the agricultural sector. The plant functional type (PFT) composition of the major biomes may be substantially affected by climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 - currently widespread deciduous broad leaved trees and C4 PFTs decline, with the C4 PFT particularly negatively affected by rising atmospheric CO2 impacts by ∼ 2080 and deciduous broad leaved trees more likely directly impacted by drying and warming. The C3 PFT may increase in prominence in the northwestern quadrant of the country by ∼ 2080 as CO2 concentrations increase. These results suggest that substantial changes in species diversity, vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning can be expected in Namibia with anticipated climate change, although endemic plant richness may persist in the topographically diverse central escarpment region. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM); Ecosystem functioning; Namibia; Niche-based model (NBM); Protected areas; Species' range shift","anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem dynamics; global change; net primary production; species diversity; species richness; vegetation structure; Africa; Namibia; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745815147

More, the surface concentration of formate, carbonate and carbonyl species was similar in each case. The presence of well-resolved IR bands allowed an unequivocal relative quantitative analysis of each species, avoiding the use of the carboxylate stretching region (1600-1200 cm-1). However, the quantitative analysis in the case of an isotopic study was complicated due to the overlapping of the various isotope bands, yet this problem could be overcome by integrating the high-wavenumber part of the bands. The reactivity of the surface species formed under RWGS conditions was followed under two different gaseous streams. Firstly, the reactivity of these intermediates were followed under an inert gas (i.e., Ar), in which case carbonates were essentially stable and less reactive than formates. Secondly, the reactivity of the same surface species was followed when switching to the corresponding 13C-labelled feed (i.e., 13CO2 + H2), in which case carbonates were exchanged significantly faster than formates. While carbonates species have been reported as reaction intermediate under reaction conditions, the increased stability or surface poisoning by these carbonates in the absence of reaction mixture was highlighted. Ultimately, this work re-emphasises the need to use steady-state conditions if the true operando reactivity of the adsorbates and structure of the solid are to be determined. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For the automotive sector, the European car manufacturers' commitment (reduction of the average fuel consumption for new vehicles to 140 grams of CO2 produced per kilometer by 2008) appears to be a valuable contribution towards meeting the recommendations of the European Commission. A sharp CO2 emission reduction requires efforts both to reduce vehicle's fuel consumption, and to widen the use of fuel with advantageous molecular hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio. Alongside vehicle's optimization itself, improving engine efficiency remains the main target. Reduction of engine displacement volume (commonly named downsizing) is an efficient way to achieve this target. Due to its interesting chemical properties, Natural Gas can be used to achieve low carbon dioxide levels (H/C ratio close to 4), while at the same time maintaining high thermal efficiency through dedicated engine development. The main objective of this project is to confirm (with a dedicated demonstrator vehicle) the high efficiency of CNG fuel when used in urban conditions. The target is to achieve low CO2 emissions with a maximum level of 90 g/km on the MVEG driving cycle, while keeping pollutant emissions below EURO IV level. The first step was dedicated to CNG specific engine parts design (pistons, connecting rod, crankshaft, etc.) in order to optimize CNG configuration. During the following steps, the engine has been optimized on a test bench. Valve timing and turbocharger selection have been optimized in order to obtain the best trade-off in terms of power, consumption and pollutants. The final step has been spent to calibrate the engine, firstly on the test bench and secondly on the vehicle. This work allows coping with EURO IV emissions level with optimized catalyst light-off, transient running conditions, driveability, etc. Copyright © 2006, Institut français du pétrole.",,"Greenhouse gases emissions; Hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio; Automotive fuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen; Natural gas; Automotive fuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen; Natural gas; exhaust emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645155215

The modified three-step sequential extraction procedure proposed by the European Bureau of References (BCR), now the Standards, Measurements and Testing Programme, was used in order to evaluate trace elements mobility in soil samples, and heavy-metal uptake by vegetables. Three operationally defined fractions were isolated using the BCR procedure: acid extractable (i.e. bound to carbonates), reducible (bound to Fe/Mn oxides), and oxidizable (bound to organic matter and sulphides). The vegetable samples were prepared to analysis using the wet-ashing procedure. To estimate the accuracy of the method used in analysis of the vegetable samples, the standard reference material (NIST SRM 1573a, Tomato leaves) was used. The results of recovery for all the elements were relatively satisfactory (87.7-108%). For the soil samples, the recovery values were calculated by proportioning the sum of the steps of the BCR procedure to those of the pseudototal digestion (i.e. aqua regia).

To activate the synthesized nanoparticles for the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose, nanoparticles were treated at 300 °C for 2 h. Heat-treated nanoparticles surfaces were characterized by FT-IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The elimination of C-H alkyl chains and thiolates from DT capped Au and Au/Ag nanoparticles was evident post heat-treatment by TGA, FT-IR and XPS investigations. In DT-Ag nanoparticles, C-H chains from DT were eliminated by heat-treatment, though thiolate was still present on nanoparticle surfaces. However, the thiolate from DT was eventually removed by further oxidation and reduction cycle treatments in an alkaline solution. After heat-treatment at 300 °C for 2 h, the surface content ratio of Au and Ag changed from Au:Ag(84:16) to Au:Ag(73:27). This tendency to increase the surface content ratio of Ag after heat-treatment was also observed in other Au-Ag alloy nanoparticle content ratios. Results from cyclic voltammograms at Au/Ag nanoparticles modified PFC electrodes in H2SO4 and NaOH solutions indicated that the distribution of Au and Ag atoms of Au/Ag nanoparticles on nanocrystal surfaces is homogeneous. Electrocatalytic peaks for glucose oxidation in a 0.1 mol dm-3 NaOH solution were observed around -0.4 and 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at heat-treated Au nanoparticle modified carbon electrode and around -0.4 and 0.6 V at heat-treated Au/Ag nanoparticle modified electrode, which correspond to the oxidation of glucose and further oxidation of gluconolactone generated by the first oxidation peak (-0.4 V), respectively. It is interesting to note that the catalytic current at Au/Ag nanoparticle modified electrodes was observed from ca. -0.75 V, which represents a negative potential shift of ca. 0.1 V compared to that at Au nanoparticle modified electrodes. This result indicates that Au-Ag alloy nanoparticles are effective catalysts for the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. At both Au and Au/Ag nanoparticles, aldose-type monosaccharides showed catalytic oxidation peaks in an alkaline solution, however ketose-type monosaccharides did not show any catalytic peaks in the potential region of -0.8 ∼ 0.8 V. After the controlled-potential electrolysis at a potential of -0.3 V, gluconolactone (or gluconate, a two-electron oxidation product) was only detected at a current efficiency of 100% at Au and Au/Ag nanoparticles modified carbon electrodes. In the case at 0.3 V, oxalate (an 18-electron oxidation product) and gluconolactone as the main product were detected at Au nanoparticle modified electrodes, and formate (a 12-electron oxidation product) in addition to oxalate and gluconolactone as the main products were detected at both Au/Ag and Ag nanoparticles modified electrodes. These results indicate that the catalytic selectivity at a potential of 0.3 V would be strongly governed by silver atoms containing Au/Ag nanoparticles surfaces. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We find that increased NOx emissions in rural areas around Atlanta increase human exposure to ambient O3 twice as much as suburban emissions. However, increased NOx emissions in central city Atlanta actually reduce O3 exposures. For downtown emissions, the reduction in human exposures to O3 from titration by NO in the central city outweighs the effects from increased downwind O3. The results indicate that the marginal damage from NOx emissions varies greatly across a metropolitan area.

The ion emission from the plasma was measured with an electrostatic ion energy analyzer either for the energy-to-charge ratio or for the ion energy distributions. The ion emission occurs mainly along the normal to the target surface; the ion stream has a maximum charge state of 10+; the ions' kinetic energy ranges from hundreds of eV up to values of about 6 keV. In order to evaluate the production and acceleration processes a theoretical framework was defined and cross-checked with experimental results. The ion energy distributions can be fitted with Boltzmann-Coulomb-shifted functions giving the ion plasma temperature, the thermal velocity, the adiabatic expansion velocity of the plasma, and the Coulomb velocity. The ion energy distribution increased with the charge state (about 600 eV /charge state). This result and the emission normal to the target surface indicate the presence of an electrical field inside the plasma which can be calculated by the method described hereinafter.

We used a radiocarbon (14C) tracer to test for uptake of litter carbon by ectomycorrhizal fungi as part of the Enriched Background Isotope Study (EBIS) in Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee. In EBIS, leaf litter from a highly 14C-labeled Quercus alba (white oak) forest was reciprocally transplanted with litter from a nearby low-labeled forest that had not been as strongly exposed to 14C. These litter transplants were conducted yearly. We measured Δ14C signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi collected from each forest four months and 2.25 years after the first litter transplant. The ectomycorrhizas were associated with white oak trees. We found no significant differences in 14C signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi exposed to low-labeled versus high-labeled litter, indicating that less than 2% of the carbon in ectomycorrhizal biomass originated from transplanted litter. In contrast, ectomycorrhizal Δ14C signatures from the high-labeled forest were 117-140‰ higher than those from the low-labeled forest. This pattern suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi acquired most (or all) of their carbon from their host plants, probably via direct transfer of photosynthate through the roots. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, stack gas emissions from any type of thermal treatment system are perceived by a segment of the public and regulatory agencies as a concern. This study included compiling stack emission factors from thermal desorption systems operating at six different MGP sites. Emission parameters were compiled for polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX); total hydrocarbons (THC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulates and lead. Dispersion modeling was then conducted to estimate the ground level concentration of each parameter resulting from stack emissions. In order to put data on stack emissions and ambient impacts resulting from thermal desorber operations into perspective for the public, comparisons were made to the three different benchmarks. These benchmarks included: (1) ambient air quality criteria, (2) mass emissions from diesel trucks transporting soil to a landfill, and (3) measured ambient air quality impacts from other sources (including background, excavation, soil transportation, and soil treatment) at several MGP remediation projects.","Air quality; Emissions; Manufactured gas plant; Remediation; Thermal desorption","air quality; atmospheric pollution; desorption; remediation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744525080

While photosynthesis is a single process with a well-established theoretical underpinning, respiration integrates the variety of plant and microbial processes by which CO2 returns from ecosystems to the atmosphere. Limits to current capacity forpredicting ecosystem respiration fluxes across biomes or years result from the mismatch between what is usually measured - bulk CO2 fluxes - and what process-based models can predict - fluxes of CO2 from plant (autotrophic) or microbial (heterotrophic) respiration. Papers in this Thematic Issue and in the recent literature, document advances in methods for separating respiration into autotrophic and heterotrophic components using three approaches: (1) continuous measurements of CO2 fluxes and assimilation of these data into process-based models; (2) application of isotope measurements, particularly radiocarbon; and (3) manipulation experiments. They highlight the role of allocation of C fixed by plants to respiration, storage, growth or transfer to other organisms as a control of seasonal and interannual variability in soil respiration and the oxidation state of C in the terrestrial biosphere. A second theme is the potential for comparing C isotope signatures in organic matter, CO2 evolved in incubations and microbial biomarkers to elucidate the pathways (respiration, recycling, or transformation) of C during decomposition. Together, these factors determine the continuum of timescales over which C is returned to the atmosphere by respiration and enable testing of theories of plant and microbial respiration that go beyond empirical models and allow predictions of future respiration responses to future change in climate, pollution and land use. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Below ground; Carbon cycle; Carbon isotopes; Decomposition; Ecosystem respiration; Radio carbon; Root respiration; Soil respiration","carbon cycle; carbon isotope; soil respiration; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645893190

Methods and Results: The kinetics of A. lipoferum Sp 59b grown at steady states in a microaerobic chemostatic environment deviated from a typical Monod kinetics in both low and high dilution rates (D) due to several metabolic shifts that occurred in the microbial cell. When NH 4Cl was exhausted (at low D), the microbial cell partitioned carbon flow in order to sustain growth, nitrogen fixation and assimilation processes (occurred via the glutamate synthase reaction). Increasing D the specific activities of the enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiration rate were decreased. At transitory states, under optimal for nitrogen fixation dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, ammonium nitrogen negatively affected, besides nitrogen fixing activity, the bacterial growth. At sub-optimal for nitrogen fixation DO concentration (i.e. 1.56 μM) and 0.1 g l-1 NH4Cl in the fed medium, the activities of citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase were significantly reduced. Conclusions: Important shifts in both carbon and nitrogen metabolism occur in A. lipoferum grown in the presence of the ammonium nitrogen, while the boundaries of ammonium nitrogen concentration in which A. lipoferum can be adapted depend on the DO concentration in the growth environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: Studies on growth dynamics and physiology of A. lipoferum, grown in experimental model systems, can contribute to an efficient application of these bacteria as plant-growth-promoting-agents. © 2006 The Society for Applied Microbiology.","Ammonium nitrogen; Azospirillum lipoferum; Continuous culture; Transitory states","ammonia; ammonium chloride; citrate synthase; dissolved oxygen; glutamate synthase; nitrogen; succinate dehydrogenase; adaptation; bacterium; article; Azospirillum lipoferum; bacterial growth; bacterial kinetics; breathing rate; carbon metabolism; cell separation; citric acid cycle; concentration (parameters); enzyme activity; enzyme mechanism; evolutionary adaptation; experimental model; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; oxygen concentration; steady state; Aerobiosis; Ammonium Chloride; Azospirillum lipoferum; Carbon; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Culture Media; Glutamate Synthase; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Models, Biological; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Fixation; Oxygen; Polysaccharides, Bacterial; Succinate Dehydrogenase; Azospirillum lipoferum; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645124654

Crops suitable for temperate and Mediterranean climates were selected from four groups: oilseeds (e.g. oilseed rape, sunflower), starch crops (e.g. potatoes), cereals (e.g. barley) and solid biofuel crops (e.g. sorghum, Miscanthus). The impact of climate change under different scenarios and GCMs on the potential future distribution of these crops was determined, based on predicted future climatic conditions. Climate scenarios based on four IPCC SRES emission scenarios, A1FI, A2, B1 and B2, implemented by four global climate models, HadCM3, CSIRO2, PCM and CGCM2, were used. The potential distribution of temperate oilseeds, cereals, starch crops and solid biofuels is predicted to increase in northern Europe by the 2080s, due to increasing temperatures, and decrease in southern Europe (e.g. Spain, Portugal, southern France, Italy, and Greece) due to increased drought. Mediterranean oil and solid biofuel crops, currently restricted to southern Europe, are predicted to extend further north due to higher summer temperatures. Effects become more pronounced with time and are greatest under the A1FI scenario and for models predicting the greatest climate forcing. Different climate models produce different regional patterns. All models predict that bioenergy crop production in Spain is especially vulnerable to climate change, with many temperate crops predicted to decline dramatically by the 2080s. The choice of bioenergy crops in southern Europe will be severely reduced in future unless measures are taken to adapt to climate change. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Projections using CGCM2 and HADCM3 models and CCCM and GISS models provided information on future climatic conditions. The results indicate that annual average stream temperatures may rise by 0·5°C (HADCM3 short term) to 2.9°C (CGCM2 long term) due to climate change.

We found that this unknown expressed protein (UEP) was encoded in the genome of C. reinhardtii. Three other phosphorylated peptides belonged to Lci5 protein encoded by the low-CO 2-inducible gene 5 (lci5). The phosphorylation sites were mapped in the tandem repeats of Lci5 ensuring phosphorylation of four serine and three threonine residues in the protein. Immunoblotting with Lci5-specific antibodies revealed that Lci5 was localized in chloroplast and confined to the stromal side of the thylakoid membranes. Phosphorylation of Lci5 and UEP occurred strictly at limiting CO2; it required reduction of electron carriers in the thylakoid membrane, but was not induced by light.

Br.) Hitchcock includes both C3 and C4 subspecies: the C3 subspecies eckloniana and the C 4 subspecies semialata. We examined the leaf structural and photosynthetic characteristics of these plants. A. semialata ssp. semialata showed high activities of photosynthetic enzymes involved in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-type C4 photosynthesis and an anomalous Kranz anatomy. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; pyruvate, Pi dikinase and glycine decarboxylase (GDC) were compartmentalized between the mesophyll (M) and inner bundle sheath cells, whereas ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) occurred in both cells. A. semialata ssp. eckloniana also showed an anomalous non-Kranz anatomy, in which the mestome sheath cells included abundant chloroplasts and mitochondria. Rubisco and GDC accumulated densely in the M and mestome sheath cells, whereas the levels of C4 enzymes were low. The activity levels of photorespiratory enzymes in both subspecies were intermediate between those in typical C3 and C4 plants. The values of CO2 compensation points in A. semialata ssp. semialata were within the C4 range, whereas those in A. semialata ssp. eckloniana were somewhat lower than the C3 range. These data suggest that the plants are C3-like and C4-like but not typical C3 and C4, and when integrated with previous findings, point to important variability in the expression of C4 physiology in this species complex.

The A1B, B1, and CLE forecasts all suggest large increases in surface O3 and sulfate baseline pollution at tropical and subtropical latitudes, especially over the Indian subcontinent, where the pollution increases may be as large as 100%. The ranges of annual mean regional ground level O3 and sulfate changes across all scenarios are -10 to +30 ppbv and -1200 to +3000 pptv, respectively. Physical climate changes reduce future surface O3, but tend to increase ground level sulfate locally over North Africa because of an enhancement of aqueous-phase SO2 oxidation. For all examined future scenarios the combined sum of the CH4, O3, and sulfate radiative forcings is positive, even for the MFR scenario, because of the large reduction in sulfate. For A1B the forcings are as much as half of that of the preindustrial to present-day forcing for each species. For MFR the sign of the forcing for each species is reversed with respect to the other scenarios. At 2030, global changes in climate-sensitive natural emissions of CH4 from wetlands, NOx from lightning, and dimethyl sulfide from the ocean appear to be small (<5%).

Participating dust models utilize a variety of dust emission schemes, horizontal and vertical resolutions, numerical methods, and different meteorological models. Two huge dust episodes occurred in spring 2002 and were used for the DMIP study. Meteorological parameters, dust emission flux and dust concentration (diameter < 20 μm) are compared within the same domain on the basis of PM and NIES lidar measurements. We found that modeled dust concentrations between the 25% and 75% percentiles generally agreed with the PM observations. The model results correctly captured the major dust onset and cessation timing at each observation site. However, the maximum concentration of each model was 2-4 times different. Dust emission fluxes from the Taklimakan Desert and Mongolia differ immensely among the models, indicating that the dust source allocation scheme over these regions differs greatly among the various modeling groups. This suggests the measurements of dust flux and accurate updated land use information are important to improve the models over these regions. The dust vertical concentration profile at Beijing, China, and Nagasaki, Japan, has a large scatter (more than two times different) among the models. For Beijing, the scaled dust profile has a quite similar vertical profile and shows relatively good agreement with the lidar extinction profile. However, for Nagasaki, the scaled dust profiles do not agree. These results indicate that modeling of dust transport and removal processes between China and Japan is another important issue in improving dust modeling.

We show here that cyt c554 also has significant NO reductase activity. The protein contains one high-spin and three low-spin c-type hemes. HAO catalyzed reduction of the cyt c 554, ligand binding, intermolecular electron transfer, and kinetics of NO reduction by cyt c554 have been investigated. We detect the formation of a NO-bound ferrous heme species in cyt c554 by EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopies during the HAO catalyzed oxidation of hydroxylamine, indicating that N-oxide intermediates produced from HAO readily bind to cyt c554. In the half-reduced state of cyt c554, we detect a spin interaction between the [FeNO]7 state of heme 2 and the low-spin ferric state of heme 4. We find that ferrous cyt c554 will reduce NO at a rate greater than 16 s-1, which is comparable to rates of other known NO reductases. Carbon monoxide or nitrite are shown not to bind to the reduced protein, and previous results indicate the reactions with O2 are slow and that a variety of ligands will not bind in the oxidized state. Thus, the enzymatic site is highly selective for NO. The NO reductase activity of cyt c554 may be important during ammonia oxidation in N. europaea at low oxygen concentrations to detoxify NO produced by reduction of nitrite or incomplete oxidation of hydroxylamine. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Ammonia; Carbon monoxide; Catalysis; Detoxification; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Reduction; Enzymatic site; Hemes; Hydroxylamine; Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO); Nitrite; Nitrosomonas europaea; Reductases; Spin interaction; Tetraheme cytochrome; Proteins; ammonia; carbon monoxide; cytochrome c554; hydroxylamine; hydroxylamine oxidase; ligand; nitric oxide reductase; nitrite; oxygen; unclassified drug; article; binding kinetics; catalysis; concentration response; electron transport; enzyme activity; ligand binding; Nitrosomonas europaea; nonhuman; reduction kinetics; Catalysis; Cytochrome c Group; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Heme; Hydroxylamine; Kinetics; Nitrosomonas europaea; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Spectroscopy, Mossbauer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645462692

The approach is based on a representation that an adsorbed fluid forms an ordered structure close to a smoothed solid surface. This ordered structure is modelled as a collection of parallel molecular layers. Such a structure allows us to express the Helmholtz free energy of a molecular layer as the sum of the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy specific to that layer and the potential energy of interaction of that layer with all other layers and the solid surface. The intrinsic Helmholtz free energy of a molecular layer is a function (at given temperature) of its two-dimensional density and it can be readily obtained from bulk-phase properties, while the interlayer potential energy interaction is determined by using the 10-4 Lennard-Jones potential. The positions of all layers close to the graphite surface or in a slit pore are considered to correspond to the minimum of the potential energy of the system. This model has led to accurate predictions of nitrogen and argon adsorption on carbon black at their normal boiling points. In the case of adsorption in slit pores, local isotherms are determined from the minimization of the grand potential. The model provides a reasonable description of the 0-1 monolayer transition, phase transition and packing effect. The adsorption of nitrogen at 77.35 K and argon at 87.29 K on activated carbons is analyzed to illustrate the potential of this theory, and the derived pore-size distribution is compared favourably with that obtained by the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The model is less time-consuming than methods such as the DFT and Monte-Carlo simulation, and most importantly it can be readily extended to the adsorption of mixtures and capillary condensation phenomena.",,"Activated carbon; Computer simulation; Free energy; Mathematical models; Molecular structure; Monte Carlo methods; Phase transitions; Pore size; Potential energy; Fluid forms; Molecular layer structure; Slit pores; Sub-critical fluid adsorbed; Adsorption; Activated carbon; Adsorption; Computer simulation; Free energy; Mathematical models; Molecular structure; Monte Carlo methods; Phase transitions; Pore size; Potential energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747725282

The analysis of rating systems comprises the study of the effects on numerous receptors such as ecosystems, buildings, and human beings (e.g. cancer, respiratory diseases, etc.) caused by different types of pollutions (acid rain, photochemical air pollution, noise pollution, and global warming, etc.). The methodology described, known as Ecoscore, is based on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach which considers the contribution of emissions to certain types of damage (e.g. by using the Exposure-Response damage function). Total emissions include oil extraction, transport and refinery, fuel distribution, and electricity generation and distribution (Well-to-Wheel approach). Emissions due to the production, use, and dismantling of the vehicle (Cradle-to- Grave approach) could be considered as well. Assessment is made possible by normalising the different types of damage. A reference value assigned to a predetermined reference vehicle is defined as a target value (the normalised value thus determines a kind of 'distance to target' consideration). The contribution of the different normalised types of damage to a single value, Ecoscore, is based on a panel weighting method. This new approach has been especially developed for the evaluation of the environmental damage caused by vehicle emissions in an urban context, such as the Brussels Capital Region and differs in that option from other methodologies. Additionally this methodology does not only consider conventional vehicles, but it can also assess all alternative fuels and propulsion systems with new vehicle technologies, such as electric and hybrid vehicles. A detailed description of the methodology itself can be found in reference [1]. In this paper the methodology is summarised and illustrated by some examples of Ecoscore calculation. Additionally new recent amendments of the methodology are highlighted. Finally, a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the Ecoscore model. © 2006 selection and editorial matter, Bart Jourquin, Piet Rietveld and Kerstin Westin; individual chapters, the contributors.

Box 1, 3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands","An integrated approach to climate change and regional air pollution can harvest considerable ancillary benefits in terms of environmental impacts and costs. This is because both problems are caused to a large extent by the same activity (fossil fuel combustion). Substantial ancillary benefits were found for regional air pollution (SO2, NOx, VOC and particulate matter) of implementing the Kyoto Protocol (intended to control greenhouse gas emissions) in Europe. For instance, while three different scenarios on Kyoto implementation were found to reduce European CO2 emissions by 4-7%, they also reduced European emissions of SO2 by 5-14% compared with a no Kyoto policies case. The magnitude of ancillary benefits depends on how flexible mechanisms and surplus emission allowances are used in meeting the Kyoto targets. The total cost savings for implementing current policies for regional air pollution of the Kyoto Protocol are of an order of 2.5-7 billion Euro. In all cases, this is in the order of half the costs of the climate policy (4-12 billion Euro). Using flexible mechanisms reduces emissions of air pollutants for Europe as a whole even further than domestic implementation (e.g. 10-14% versus 5% for SO2 emissions), but the reductions are shifted from Western Europe to Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. The use of surplus emission allowances to achieve the Kyoto targets decreases the ancillary benefits, in particular for the latter group of countries (e.g. unprotected area against acidification increases from 1.3 to 1.7 million ha). © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Major themes in the environmental balance are eco-efficiency, climate change, manure policy, air quality and urban environment, and the general developments in Dutch environmental policy in the past 15 years. Main conclusions are that European policy results in a considerable emission reduction, however not enough to meet EU environmental quality standards. Compared to other EU member states, The Netherlands is densely populated and built, resulting in high emissions per square kilometre. Moreover, The Netherlands has a substantial contribution of contamination from abroad, although it is itself a net exporter of pollution. Therefore, additional national measures are necessary to meet the EU quality standards. The wish to have a 'level playing field' for industry may conflict with the wish to protect citizens equally against a low environmental quality. Spatial solutions are frequently chosen as additional measures, by separating sources of pollution from citizens or nature.

According to their different uses, such as calcium carbonate in the paper and paint industries, the final products have rigorous quality specifications which are currently difficult to meet for local producers in Brazil. Therefore, large quantities of high-grade carbonates are transported long distances inside the country to supply the different industrial plants. In southern Brazil, carbonate ores are used mainly for agricultural purposes. In Caçapava do Sul, the selectively mined ore is currently hand-picked at low throughputs to produce high-grade (white) carbonate. This paper presents applied research work to improve the product quality and gives an overview of the market situation for the regional producers. The aim of the work is threefold: - to characterize the raw ore and determine the potential for production of the required quality and quantity for the Brazilian market; - to develop an industrial process incorporating optical sorting and comminution (high intensity magnetic separation was tested too); - to control the quality of the products by application tests, including the measurement of brightness. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is less clear to what extent determining the spatial distribution of engineering properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, pressures, and fluid saturations) can improve predictions (i.e., improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty) of hydrocarbon recovery, given the multiple non-linear and often noisy transformations required to make a prediction. Determining the worth of seismic data in predicting dynamic fluid production is one of the goals of this paper. We have approached the problem of assessing uncertainty in production forecasts by constructing a synthetic reservoir model that exhibits much of the geometrical and petrophysical complexity encountered in clastic hydrocarbon reservoirs. This benchmark model was constructed using space-dependent, statistical relationships between petrophysical variables and seismic parameters. We numerically simulated a waterflood in the model to reproduce time-varying reservoir conditions. Subsequently, a rock physics/fluid substitution model that accounts for compaction and pressure was used to calculate elastic parameters. Pre-stack and post-stack 3D seismic amplitude data (i.e., time-domain amplitude variations of elastic responses) were simulated using local one-dimensional approximations. The seismic data were also contaminated with additive noise to replicate actual data acquisition and processing errors. We then attempted to estimate the original distribution of petrophysical properties and to forecast oil production based on limited and inaccurate spatial knowledge of the reservoir acquired from wells and 3D seismic amplitude data. We compared the multiple realizations of the various predictions against predictions with a reference model. The use of seismic amplitude data to construct static reservoir models affected production performance variables in different ways. For example, seismic amplitude data did not uniformly improve the variability of the predictions of water breakthrough time; other quantities, such as cumulative recovery after the onset of production, did exhibit an uncertainty reduction as did a global measure of recovery. We evaluate how different degrees of spatial correlation strength between seismic and petrophysical parameters may ultimately affect the ensuing uncertainty in production forecasts. Most of the predictions exhibited a bias in that there was a significant deviation between the medians of the realizations and that the value from the reference case. This bias was evidently caused by noise in the various transforms (some of which we introduced deliberately) coupled with nonlinearity. The key nonlinearities seem to be in the numerical simulation itself, specifically in the transformation from porosity to permeability, in the relative permeability relationships, and in the conservation equations themselves. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Because it is readily influenced by metabolic processes, pH i is controlled physiologically. Classical models of intracellular pH regulation comprise acid/base transport proteins expressed in the sarcolemma, acting in concert with intracellular buffers. These two processes are coupled via a diffusive movement of protons. Because intracellular H+ buffering is high, Hi+-diffusion occurs through a passive shuttling on intrinsic mobile buffers such as acetylated carnosine, anserine and homocarnosine: low molecular weight imidazole compounds. This mechanism is assisted by carbonic buffer, a system regulated biochemically by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Hi+-mobility via the buffer shuttles is low, and this can result in significant pHi non-uniformity under conditions of high proton flux across the sarcolemma or within the cell. Spatial regulation of pHi is complemented by passive H+ permeation between cells through gap junctions. This permeation is also mediated via protonated buffers. The control of pHi is therefore dependent on carrier molecules that spatially shuttle protons within and between cells. In this review, we consider the physiological regulation of Hi +-mobility and permeation, and its relevance to pH i-control in normal and pathophysiological states such as myocardial ischaemia, a clinical condition associated with severe intracellular acidosis. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjects and methods: A whole body PET/CT protocol for tumour staging and a protocol for PET/CT colonography were integrated into one examination. Fourteen prospective patients with suspected colorectal cancer underwent whole body PET/CT after aqueous bowel distension and pharmacological bowel relaxation. Colonoscopy and histopathology served as the standards of reference in all patients. Results: The modified PET/CT examination detected all but one lesion in the colon. One additional lesion was detected in a patient with incomplete colonoscopy due to high grade luminal stenosis. One polyp with malignant conversion was identified with the modified PET/CT protocol. PET/CT colonography proved accurate in local lymph node staging and staged nine out of 11 patients correctly. Six additional extracolonic tumour sites were detected based on the whole body staging approach. Conclusion: Whole body PET/CT with integrated colonography is technically feasible for whole body staging in patients with colorectal cancer. Based on these initial diagnostic experiences, this integrated protocol may be of substantial benefit in staging patients with colorectal cancer, focusing on patients with incomplete colonoscopy and those with small synchronous bowel lesions.",,"iodinated contrast medium; scopolamine butyl bromide; accuracy; article; cancer staging; clinical article; colon injury; colon tumor; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; computed tomographic colonography; computer assisted emission tomography; histopathology; human; human tissue; intestine distension; priority journal; prospective study; whole body radiation; Aged; Clinical Protocols; Colonography, Computed Tomographic; Colorectal Neoplasms; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prospective Studies; Whole Body Imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29244488779

A regional intensification of this circulation to the east of the Andes Mountains is called the South American low-level jet (SALLJ), with the strongest winds found over eastern Bolivia. SALLJ is present all year and channels moisture to the La Plata basin, which is analogous to the better-known Amazon basin in terms of its biological and habitat diversity, and far exceeds the latter in its economic importance to southern and central South America in terms of hydroelectricity and food production. The relatively small SALLJ spatial scale (compared with the density of the available sounding network) has a limited understanding of and modeling capability for any variations in the SALLJ intensity and structure as well as its possible relationship to downstream rainfall. The SALLJ Experiment (SALLJEX), aimed at describing many aspects of SALLJ, was carried out between 15 November 2002 and 15 February 2003 in Bolivia, Paraguay, central and northern Argentina, western Brazil, and Peru. Scientists, collaborators, students, National Meteorological Service personnel, and local volunteers from South American countries and the United States participated in SALLJEX activities in an unprecedented way, because SALLJEX was the most extensive meteorological field activity to date in subtropical South America, and was the first World Climate Research Program/Climate Variability and Prediction Program international campaign in South America. This paper describes the motivation for the field activity in the region, the special SALLJEX observations, and SALLJEX modeling and outreach activities.

Methane emission from rice fields is the result of a complex array of soil processes involving plant-microbe interactions. The cumulative effects of these processes at the level of individual plants influence the global atmospheric composition and make it necessary to expand our research focus from small plots to large landscapes and regions. However, present extrapolations ('upscaling') are tenuous at best because of methodological and practical problems. The different steps taken to calculate regional emission strengths are discussed and illustrated by calculations for a case-study in the Philippines. The applicability of high quality, process-based, models of methane emission at the level of individual plants is limited for regional analysis by their large data requirements. Simplified models can be used at the regional level but are not able to capture the complex emission situation. Data availability and model accuracy are therefore often difficult to match. Other common sources of uncertainty are the quality of input data. A critical evaluation of input data should be made in every upscaling study to assess the suitability for calculating regional emissions. For the case-study we show effects of differences in input data caused by data source and interpolation technique. The results from the case-study and similar studies in literature indicate that upscaling techniques are still troublesome and a cause of large uncertainties in regional estimates. The results suggest that some of the stumbling blocks in the conventional upscaling procedure are almost impassable in the near future. Based on these results, a plea is made for meso-level measurements to calibrate and validate upscaling methods in order to be better able to quantify and reduce uncertainties in regional emission estimates. © Springer 2006.","Climate change; Methane emission; Rice paddy fields; Uncertainty; Upscaling","climate change; crop production; cultivation; data acquisition; emission; greenhouse gas; interpolation; methane; microbial ecology; paddy field; rice; uncertainty analysis; upscaling; Asia; Eurasia; Philippines; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745189820

Coal weakening by the introduction of CO2 to a coal seam may induce fracturing, causing a permeability increase under in situ conditions. Such effects present significant implications for proposals regarding the storage of CO2 in coal seams. A uniaxial and triaxial laboratory study was carried out to explore the effects of the adsorption of CO2 on the compressive strength and permeability of southeast Australian brown coal. Comparison of the stress-strain response of air-saturated and CO2-saturated specimens revealed a compressive strength decrease in the order of 13% and an elastic modulus decrease of about 26% for the uniaxial testing, but no significant strength or elastic modulus decrease for the triaxial testing. The absence of an adsorptive effect on the mechanical behaviour of the triaxial specimens may have been due to an insufficient saturation period under simulated ground conditions, or due to mechanical variability in the brown coal test specimens, however, further testing is required to reveal the reason for the apparent negligible strength reduction with CO2 adsorption at the higher confinement. Carbon dioxide outflow measurements during the stress-strain process demonstrated an initial permeability decrease with pore closure, followed by a significant increase in specimen permeability with fracturing. Issues that require consideration in the application of these results to coal seam CO2 sequestration include: whether the expected regional and localised in situ stresses are sufficient to initiate fracturing with adsorptive weakening; how coal properties (e.g. rank, moisture content) are likely to affect the geomechanical influence of CO2 adsorption, and the expected magnitude of the proposed fracture related permeability increase. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Here, carbon isotope ratios of light hydrocarbons were used to characterise in-reservoir biodegradation in the Gullfaks oil field, offshore Norway. Increasing biodegradation, as characterised, for example, by increasing concentration ratios of Pr/ n-C17 and Ph/n-C18, and decreasing concentrations of individual light hydrocarbons were correlated to 13C- enrichment of the light hydrocarbons. The δ13C values of C4 to C9 n-alkanes increase by 7-3‰ within the six oil samples from the Brent Group of the Gullfaks oil field, slight changes (1-3‰) being observed for several branched alkanes and benzene, whereas no change (&lt;1‰) in δ13C occurs for cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, and toluene. Application of the Rayleigh equation demonstrated high to fair correlation of concentration and isotope data of i- and n-pentane, n-hexane, and n-heptane, documenting that biodegradation in reservoirs can be described by the Rayleigh model. Using the appropriate isotope fractionation factor of n-hexane, derived from laboratory experiments, quantification of the loss of this petroleum constituent due to biodegradation is possible. Toluene, which is known to be highly susceptible to biodegradation, is not degraded within the Gullfaks oil field, implying that the local microbial community exhibits rather pronounced substrate specificities. The evaluation of combined molecular and isotopic data expands our understanding of the anaerobic degradation processes within this oil field and provides insight into the degradative capabilities of the microorganisms. Additionally, isotope analysis of unbiodegraded to slightly biodegraded crude oils from several oil fields surrounding Gullfaks illustrates the heterogeneity in isotopic composition of the light hydrocarbons due to source effects. This indicates that both source and also maturity effects have to be well constrained when using compound-specific isotope analysis for the assessment of biodegradation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

M3H 5T4, Canada","The Pacific 2001 Air Quality Study was undertaken to characterize the physical and chemical properties of particulate matter in the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV) airshed of British Columbia. Aerosol transport in the LFV was observed to occur through several regional scale mechanisms, including seabreeze-landbreeze flows, upslope-downslope flows and north-south valley flows. Enhanced aerosol concentrations were observed in the eastern portion of the LFV, the north-south tributary valleys and the Gulf/San Juan islands convergence zone. Particle composition was found to vary according to proximity to emission sources relative to surface flows. Approximately half of the particle mass was comprised of organic carbon, with the rest being inorganic species. Sodium nitrate was an important component of the coarse particle fraction, while ammonium sulphate was concentrated in the fine fraction. A broad suite of organic substances were detected, and both anthropogenic and biogenic sources were found to contribute to secondary organic aerosol formation. Particle formation and growth was observed to occur via nucleation, condensation and coagulation. In general, the western part of the LFV airshed was dominated by combustion-related compounds, sea salt chemistry and organics (both anthropogenic and biogenic), while the eastern part of the airshed was dominated by NH3 chemistry and biogenic organics. The extent of processing of air masses was found to increase in a west to east direction, although the occasional accumulation of photochemically aged pollutants in the Gulf/San Juan islands convergence zone was observed to reverse this gradient. NH3 was found not to be a limiting species in the formation of fine mode inorganic aerosols, suggesting that NH3 emission reductions would have to be substantial in order to confer a significant improvement in PM and visibility. This coupled with the non-linear relationships between NOx, VOC and secondary particulates, suggests that PM and visibility improvement in the LFV would most likely require concurrent reductions in NH3, SOx, NOx and VOC emissions.

The month-long measurements were carried out in the framework of the Basel Urban Boundary Layer Experiment (BUBBLE). Two Li7500 open path analysers were installed at z/zH = 1.0 and 2.2 above a street canyon with zH the average building height of 14.6m and z the height above street level. Additionally, profiles of CO2 concentration were sampled at 10 heights from street level up to 2 zH. The minimum and maximum of the average diurnal course of CO2 concentration at 2 zH were 362 and 423 ppmv in late afternoon and early morning, respectively. Daytime CO2 concentrations were not correlated to local sources, e.g. the minimum occurred together with the maximum in traffic load. During night-time CO2 is in general accumulated, except when inversion development is suppressed by frontal passages. CO2 concentrations were always decreasing with height and correspondingly, the fluxes - on average - always directed upward. At z/zH = 2.2 low values of about 3 μmol m-2s-1 were measured during the second half of the night. During daytime average values reached up to 14 μmol m-2s-1. The CO2 fluxes are well correlated with the traffic load, with their maxima occurring together in late afternoon. Daytime minimum CO2 concentrations fell below regional background values. Besides vertical mixing and entrainment, it is suggested that this is also due to advection of rural air with reduced CO2 concentration. Comparison with other urban observations shows a large range of differences among urban sites in terms of both CO2 fluxes and concentrations. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",,"carbon dioxide; eddy covariance; heat flux; temporal analysis; urban climate; Basel-Stadt; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644788738

Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) projection of future sea-level rise in the high and middle latitudes of 31,66 and 110 centimeters in 100 years for low, middle and high scenarios respectively is wrongly accepted to be applicable to the Gulf of Thailand, which is in the low latitudes, where air and seawater temperatures are already high, and therefore, an insignificant increase of temperatures is found in several large cities. Analyses of 56 years data of tides recorded at Ko Lak, Prachuap Khirikhan province and Sattahip, Chonburi province revealed that sea levels are falling slowly, which is consistent with results of Gregory (1993) who reported sea-level falls in the low latitudes and the Gulf of Thailand of 0-50 milimeters, using U.K. Meteorological Offices Coupled Ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Model.

This was a secondary endpoint in a study primarily evaluating the effect of bicarbonate on survival. Design: Prospective multicenter trial. Setting: Patients treated by urban, suburban, and rural emergency medical services (EMS) services. Patients: Eight hundred and seventy-four prehospital cardiac arrest patients. Interventions: This group underwent conventional ACLS intervention followed by empiric early administration of sodium bicarbonate noting resuscitation times. Survival was measured as the presence of vital signs on emergency department (ED) arrival. Data analysis utilized Student's t-test and logistic regression (p < 0.05). Results: Survival was improved with decreased time to BLS (5.52 min versus 6.81 min, p = 0.047) and ACLS (7.29 min versus 9.49 min, p = 0.002) intervention, as well as difference in time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The upper limit time interval after which no patient survived was 30 min for ACLS time, and 90 min for transport time. There was no overall difference in survival except at longer arrest times when considering the primary study intervention bicarbonate administration. Conclusion: Delay to the initiation of BLS and ACLS intervention influenced outcome from prehospital cardiac arrest negatively. There were no survivors after prolonged delay in initiation of ACLS of 30 min or greater or total resuscitation and transport time of 90 min.

This paper reports the process of identifying appropriate exposure models for estimating PECs (Predicted Environmental Concentrations) for pharmaceuticals and veterinary products, focusing on emissions to Swedish aquatic and terrestrial environments via water and sludge from sewage treatment plants. From a large number of information sources, a set of 181 potentially relevant exposure models was identified. A process of scrutinizing and testing these models resulted in a final selection of two models, namely SimpleTreat 3.1 that is used to estimate distribution and elimination of chemicals in sewage treatment plants (resulting in a PEC), and VetPec, suited for veterinary products, that estimates PEC in soil (including pore water), groundwater, and surface water.

It was shown that the activity and coke resistance of Rh/Al2O3 were enhanced by the addition of CeO2, which greatly depend on the interaction between rhodium and ceria under the reaction atmosphere. In situ electrical conductivity results showed that the reducing agents (CH4, H2) in the reaction system could be activated and dissociated on Rh0, releasing electrons to CeO2 in close contact with Rh0 and generating the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. Meanwhile, it was found from XPS measurements that the electron transfer could also happen from Rh0 to CeO2, creating the Rh0/Rhδ+ couple. Thus, the very coexistence of Ce4+/Ce3+ and Rh0/Rhδ+ redox couples facilitated the activation of CH4 and CO2 and further enhanced the catalytic activity and coke resistance of Rh/Al2O3. For CH4 activation, the electron-deficient state of Rhδ+ had higher ability to accept σ electrons of CH4 to promote CH4 adsorption and C-H bond cleavage, while CO2 activation was mainly facilitated by accepting free electrons of Ce3+ species, which resulted in the enhancement of carbon elimination to yield CO. Finally, a cycle mechanism of redox couples over Rh-CeO2/Al2O3 in CH4/CO2 reforming was proposed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We use Zaozhuang, a city in eastern China heavily dependent on coal, as a case study to quantify the impacts that air pollution in eastern China had on public health in 2000 and the benefits in improved air quality and health that could be obtained by 2020, relative to business-as-usual (BAU), through the implementation of best available emission control technology (BACT) and advanced coal gasification technologies (ACGT). We use an integrated assessment approach, utilizing state-of-the-science air quality and meteorological models, engineering, epidemiology, and economics, to achieve this objective. We find that total health damages due to year 2000 anthropogenic emissions from Zaozhuang, using the ""willingness-to-pay"" metric, was equivalent to 10% of Zaozhuang's GDP. If all health damages resulting from coal use were internalized in the market price of coal, the year 2000 price would have more than tripled. With no new air pollution controls implemented between 2000 and 2020 but with projected increases in energy use, we estimate health damages from air pollution exposure to be equivalent to 16% of Zaozhuang's projected 2020 GDP. BACT and ACGT (with only 24% penetration in Zaozhuang and providing 2% of energy needs in three surrounding municipalities) could reduce the potential health damage of air pollution in 2020 to 13% and 8% of projected GDP, respectively. Benefits to public health, of substantial monetary value, can be achieved through the use of BACT; health benefits from the use of ACGT could be even larger. Despite significant uncertainty associated with each element of the integrated assessment approach, we demonstrate that substantial benefits to public health could be achieved in this region of eastern China through the use of additional pollution controls and particularly from the use of advanced coal gasification technology. Without such controls, the impacts of air pollution on public health, presently considerable, will increase substantially by 2020. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past decades, the area of the cultivated land and its grain production have been increased at the cost of wetlands shrinkage. The large-scale land reclamation severely affected the ecosystems in this region. However, such effects at the regional scale are seldom evaluated quantitatively. We used three datasets of LANDSAT MSS and/or TM imagery to estimate the area changes and the transition of land use types from 1980 to 2000. We also valued changes in ecosystem services delivered by each land category using value coefficients published by Costanza et al. [Nature 387, 1997, 253-260]. Sensitivity analysis suggested that these estimates were relatively robust. Finally, the contribution of various ecosystem functions was ranked to the overall value of the ecosystem services in this study. According to our estimates, the total annual ecosystem service values in Sanjiang Plain have declined by about 40% between 1980 and 2000 ($156284-182572.18 million in total over 20 years). This substantial decline is largely attributed to the 53.4% loss of wetlands. For individual ecosystem functions, waste treatment, water supply and disturbance regulation account for more than 60% to the total ecological values. During those two decades, the contribution of disturbance regulation, cultural and recreation decreased, while the contribution of water regulation, nutrient cycling, food production, raw materials and climate regulation increased during the same period. We also put forward a few proposals concerning the future land use policy formulation and sustainable ecosystems. They are adjusting the 'food first' agricultural policy, establishing more nature reserves for wetlands, creating systems for the rational use of water, harnessing the degraded cultivated land and encouraging eco-tourism. © Springer 2006.","China; Ecosystem services; Land use change; Remote sensing; Sanjiang Plain; Wetland reclamation","Ecosystems; Estimation; Imaging techniques; Land reclamation; Land use; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Wetlands; Ecosystem services; Land use change; Peoples Republic of China; Sanjiang Plain; Wetland reclamation; Environmental impact; fresh water; ecosystem service; land reclamation; land use change; remote sensing; wetland; agriculture; article; China; climate; controlled study; crop production; ecosystem; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental reclamation; environmental sustainability; food industry; land use; nitrogen cycling; quantitative analysis; recreation; sensitivity analysis; tillage; tourism; waste management; water management; water supply; wetland; Agriculture; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Rivers; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Heilongjiang; Sanjiang Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645733875

Whilst retaining a residual presence in many workplaces, Mozambican unions have battled to cope with changes in the external labour market and a greatly altered political climate. In most cases, they have proved equally incapable of challenging the authority of management and of articulating viable alternatives to the neo-liberal orthodoxy. There is a vital need to enhance the quality of unionism and the service provided at existing workplaces, and reconcile the needs of very different groupings of workers, not only within Mozambique, but across the continent; African unions can no longer count on the patronage of governments or on favourable market conditions within specific sectors. © 2006, SAGE Publications Ltd.

A whole-farm modeling approach was used to investigate promising mitigation measures. The effects of potential mitigation measures were modeled to obtain estimates of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from representative dairy model farms in five European regions. The potential to reduce farm GHG emissions was calculated per kg milk to compare organic and conventional production systems and to investigate region and system specific differences. An optimized lifetime efficiency of dairy cows reduced GHG emissions by up to 13% compared to baseline model farms. The evaluation of frequent removal of manure from animal housing into outside covered storage reduced farm GHG emissions by up to 7.1%. Scraping of fouled surfaces per se was not an effective option since the reduction in GHG emissions from animal housing was more than out-weighed by increased emissions from the storage and after field application. Manure application by trail hose and injection, respectively, was found to reduce farm GHG emissions on average by 0.7 and 3.2% compared to broadcasting. The calculated model scenarios for anaerobic digestion demonstrated that biogas production could be a very efficient and cost-effective option to reduce GHG emissions. The efficiency of this mitigation measure depends on the amount and quality of organic matter used for co-digestion, and how much of the thermal energy produced is exploited. A reduction of GHG emissions by up to 96% was observed when all thermal energy produced was used to substitute fossil fuels. Potential measures and strategies were scaled up to the level of European regions to estimate their overall mitigation potential. The mitigation potential of different strategies based on a combination of measures ranged from -25 up to -105% compared to baseline model farms. A full implementation of the most effective strategy could result in a total GHG emission reduction of about 50 Mt of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents per year for conventional dairy farms of EU(15) comparable to the defined model farms. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Sequence and structural conservation indicates that Kvβ resembles an aldo-keto reductase (AKR), an enzyme that catalyzes a redox reaction using an NADPH cofactor. A putative AKR in complex with a Kv channel has led to the hypothesis that intracellular redox potential may dynamically influence the excitability of a cell through Kvβ. Since the AKR function of Kvβ has never been demonstrated, a direct functional coupling between the two has not been established. We report here the identification of Kvβ substrates and the demonstration that Kvβ is a functional AKR. We have also found that channel function is modulated when the Kvβ-bound NADPH is oxidized. Further studies of the enzymatic properties of Kvβ seem to favor the role of Kvβ as a redox sensor. These results suggest that Kvβ may couple the excitability of the cell to its metabolic state and present a new avenue of research that may lead to understanding of the physiological functions of Kvβ. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Cells; Electric potential; Enzyme kinetics; Enzymes; Metabolism; Modulation; Reaction kinetics; Enzymatic properties; Physiological functions; Potassium channels; Structural conservation; Potassium; aldo keto reductase enzyme; oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; unclassified drug; voltage gated potassium channel; animal cell; article; beta chain; controlled study; enzyme analysis; enzyme kinetics; enzyme mechanism; enzyme metabolism; enzyme substrate; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; protein function; rat; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Animals; Female; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Multiprotein Complexes; Oocytes; Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated; Rats; Recombinant Proteins; Substrate Specificity; Xenopus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744970273

Previous palaeo-environmental studies have demonstrated that the pans have experienced several highstands during the Quaternary, forming calcretes around shoreline embayments. The pans are also a significant regional source of dust, and some workers have suggested that surficial carbonate distributions may be controlled, in part. by wind regime. Field studies of carbonate deposits in the region have also highlighted the importance of fluvial and groundwater processes in calcrete formation. However, due to the large area involved and problems of accessibility, the carbonate distribution across the entire Makgadikgadi basin remains poorly understood. The MODIS instrument permits mapping of carbonate distribution over large areas; comparison with estimates from Landsat Thematic Mapper data show reasonable agreement, and there is good agreement with estimates from laboratory analysis of field samples.

These emissions can impact air quality and even climate. We have developed a modeling framework to estimate the emissions from fires in North and parts of Central America (10-71 °N and 55-175 °W) by taking advantage of a combination of complementary satellite and ground-based data to refine estimates of fuel loadings. Various satellite drivers, including the MODIS Thermal Anomalies Product, the Global Land Cover Characteristics 2000 dataset, and the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields Product were used in conjunction with data mined from literature to determine fire location and timing, fuel loadings, and emission factors. Daily emissions of particulate matter and numerous trace gases from fires were estimated using this method for three years (2002-2004). Annual emission estimates differ by as much as a factor of 2 (CO emissions for North America ranged from 22.6 to 39.5 Tg yr-1). Regional variations in emissions correspond to different fire seasons within the region. For example, the highest emissions from Central America and Mexico occur in the late spring whereas the highest emissions from the United States and Canada occur during the summer months. Comparisons of these results with other published estimates of CO emission estimates from fire show reasonable agreement, but substantial uncertainties remain in the estimation techniques. We suggest methods whereby future emissions models can reduce these uncertainties. © 2006.","Agricultural fires; Carbon monoxide; Emissions; Fires; North America; Particulate matter","Air quality; Fuels; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Satellites; Agricultural fires; North America; Particulate matter; Fires; carbon dioxide; fuel; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; fire; satellite; trace gas; air quality; article; biomass; climate; data base; fire; North America; particulate matter; priority journal; Central America; Mexico [North America]; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646783986

Siliciclastic, authigenic and biogenic sediments, varying in age from Cretaceous to Holocene, recovered from a number of vibrocores collected between 200 and 500 m water depth, at the head of the Cape Canyon, provide the basis for an integrated bio-, Sr-isotopic and lithostratigraphic study. The study area is underlain by unconsolidated middle Cretaceous interbedded woody quartzose sand and kaolinitic mud. A large regional erosional hiatus separates the upper Oligocene to lower Miocene carbonate sediments from these Cretaceous sediments. The upper Oligocene to lower Miocene (18.1-27.2 Ma) carbonate succession records third-order sea-level fluctuations superimposed on an overall marine transgression. The interpreted late Oligocene depositional environments imply increased bottom-water activity over time and the peak in phosphogenesis at 23.6-26.1 Ma indicates the onset of warm-water upwelling. Calcareous deposition ended at around 18 Ma when downwarping of the continental shelf associated with uplift of the continental interior resulted in the seaward tilt of the carbonate succession to greater water depths. Increased terrigenous input is recorded as inner shelf prograding quartzose delta-front deposits following uplift of the interior. Uplift combined with a long-term marine regression resulted in the widespread erosion of middle to upper Miocene successions, generally recovered only as reworked glauconite-carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) mixed mineral pellets above the erosional hiatus. Glauconite-rich sediments indicate overall low accumulation rates and multiple reworking events of organic-rich clayey sediments during the middle to late Miocene/early Pliocene. Onset of cold-water upwelling, at least intermittently by ± 15 Ma, established hydrographic conditions similar to the Benguela Upwelling System with a coast-parallel mudbelt present on the middle shelf. A middle Pliocene marine regression reworked 15.8-9.1 Ma inner shelf quartzose delta-front sediments across the outer shelf. Late Pliocene/early Pleistocene uplift of the continental interior resulted in the fault-controlled incision of the head of the Cape Canyon along the seaward flank of the buoyant Agulhas-Columbine basement block. Uplift increased Quaternary terrigenous sedimentation on the shelf, where the facies distribution was clearly controlled by Canyon head bathymetry. High-frequency glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuations resulted in late Quaternary erosion and slumping across the outer shelf and the continued downcutting of the Cape Canyon. Lowstand shelly gravels are common, including the Last Glacial Maximum shell lag, which grades into a faecal pellet rich Holocene mud drape over much of the study area. The late Cenozoic evolution of the western margin recorded in the complex condensed sediment record of the study area is characterised by low sediment accumulation rates and multiple reworking events. The integrated stratigraphic interpretation emphasises the importance of eustasy, tectonic activity, fluvial sediment input, palaeoceanographic and climatic changes. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This has caused major concerns among the policy makers, mainly in the context of the growing need to reduce harmful emissions in the electricity supply industry from the point of view of both local environmental pollution as well as the global warming concerns. This paper presents the outcome of a study involved in identifying and ranking the barriers to the promotion of cleaner and energy efficient technologies and strategies to overcome these barriers in Sri Lanka. Barriers for renewable energy based systems such as wind and wood fuel fired plants (dendro thermal power) and cleaner technologies such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired combined cycle and IGCC (coal) were identified based on a survey. A direct assessment multi-criteria decision making method called Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank the barriers. The most effective strategies are proposed to address the three major barriers for each of these technologies based on extensive discussions with all the stakeholders in the electricity industry. It was found that lack of financing instruments, high initial cost and lack of assurance of resource supply or availability are the main barriers for renewable technologies. As for cleaner fuel and technology options associated with conventional generation systems, the lack of a clear government policy, uncertainty of fuel supplies and their prices and the reliability of the technologies themselves are the major barriers. Strategies are identified to overcome the above barriers. Establishment of a proper feed in tariff, geographical diversification of installations and capacity building in commercial banks are suggested for wind power. Investment incentives, streamlining of wood production and research on site identification are proposed for wood fuel fired plants. Also the study suggests delayed implementation, combined planning with other sectors of the economy, incorporating environmental cost in planning and investment incentives as strategies for IGCC and LNG based technologies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies of the ecology of cities and ecology in cities will therefore assume increasing relevance as urban communities seek to protect and/or enhance their ecological resources. Presently, the most serious threats to wildlife include the degradation and/or loss of habitats, the introduction and spread of problem species, water pollution, unsympathetic management, and the encroachment of inappropriate development. Climate change could add to these problems through competition from exotic species, the spread of disease and pests, increased summer drought stress for wetlands and woodland, and sea-level rise threatening rare coastal habitats. Earlier springs, longer frost-free seasons, and reduced snowfall could further affect the dates of egg-laying, as well as the emergence, first flowering and health of leafing or flowering plants. Small birds and naturalized species could thrive in the warmer winters associated with the combined effect of regional climate change and enhanced urban heat island.

In the ocean, they tend to dominate the phytoplankton assemblage under nutrient-rich conditions; whereas, in freshwater ecosystems, high turbulence and the combination of low temperature/high nutrients favour diatom blooming. Their fascinating biodiversity with approximately 10,000 species has been recently taxonomically revised giving evidence that the diatoms form two clades: the Coscinodiscophytina and the Bacillariophytina, the latter containing two subclades Bacillariophyceae and Mediophyceae; all the more this tremendous species diversity evolved during the last 250 Ma and there is likely no phylogenetic group in which the evolutionary rate has occurred faster (Medlin and Kaszmarska 2004). Therefore, the diatoms can be considered as one of the most successful taxonomic groups with respect to evolution and ecology. However, the genetic and physiological basis why diatoms became so ecologically successful is still a matter of debate. The recently published genome of Thalassiosira pseudonana (Armbrust et al. 2004) and the EST sequence data available from Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Maheswari et al. 2005) have opened new perspectives in diatom research to understand in more detail their physiological peculiarities. The metabolism in oxygenic phototrophs depends on gene expression processes coordinated between the three different compartments: the nucleus, the plastid, and the mitochondrion. Diatoms originate from a secondary endosymbiotic event (see Fig. 1) as opposed to the primary endosymbiotic origin of the ""Chloroplastida"" (Adl et al. 2005), including among others, the charophytes, chlorophytes and prasinophytes. There is convincing evidence that the ancestral diatom derived from a putatively non-photosynthetic eukaryote which domesticated a eukaryotic cell phylogenetically close to a red alga: this ""red line phylogenetics is clearly a work in progress"" (Palmer 2003) because we neither know the nature of the secondary host nor whether all ""chromophytes"" originate from one single endocytobiotic event (Patron et al. 2004). Gene analyses based on whole genome sequencing of T. pseudonana revealed that the diatom genome contains about 800 proteins which align with proteins of animals but do not have homologues in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Armbrust et al. 2004). This suggests that in diatoms the cytosolic metabolic pathways might be closely related to an animal-like rather than to a plant-like cell, which would likely affect the physiological regulation of photosynthesis. Considering the obligatory intracellular gene transfer in chromophytic phototrophs from the vanishing nucleus of the endosymbiont to the nucleus of the secondary host cell, various genes for proteins involved in photosynthesis had to be integrated into the new, more animal-like nucleus. Therefore, we would expect a different pattern in the nucleome-chondriome-plastome interaction with the consequence that metabolic pathways related to these compartments had been lost or that the respective genes had been transferred to the nucleus of the secondary endosymbiont. Therefore, the plastid had to develop a completely new interaction pattern with its genetic partners. To date, this regulatory network in diatoms is not yet understood. The stabilisation of a secondary endosymbiosis did not only require the development of protein targeting from the cytosol into the plastids crossing four membranes (Kilian and Kroth 2004), but also required a signal exchange in the reverse direction from the organelle to the nucleus. In the last few years it has been shown that in green plant cells photosynthesis-related nuclear genes are under chloroplast redox control by a new class of plastid signals (Goldschmidt-Clermont 1998). The sensor for this signal is the redox state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool which depends on the relative activity of photosystems II and I (PS II and PS I). However, the redox state of the chloroplast does not only depend on the membrane-bound reactions, but also on the oxidative state of the stroma which is under the control of the antioxidative system via thioredoxin (TR), gluthathione, ascorbate, and their related metabolising enzymes. Although the biochemical nature of this retrograde signalling from the plastid to the nucleus is still not understood, the importance of this redox-controlled nuclear gene expression has recently been shown by Fey et al. (2005) demonstrating that this signal triggers the whole cellular network of gene expression. This retrograde plastid to nucleus signalling must be basically different in green algae and diatoms because of two reasons: first, the cooperating nuclei are of different phylogenetic origin, and second, the redox control in green algae and diatoms is found to be basically different as outlined below (see sections on ""Regulation of photosynthetic electron flow and the fate of photosynthetic electrons"" and ""Regulation of the enzyme activity in the Calvin cycle in diatoms""). However, we do not know what the consequences of the secondary endocytobiosis on the metabolic regulations were, nor whether the physiological peculiarities of diatoms observed in the past reflect this different host-endosymbiont relationship. In this review, we focus on cell functions which clearly separate the diatoms physiologically from algae of the chloroplastidic lineage. •The thylakoid membranes in diatoms are arranged in groups of three and are not differentiated into grana/stroma lamellae (Berkaloff et al. 1990; Owens 1988) having consequences not only for the PSII/PSI ratio and the regulation of the wavelength-dependent energy distribution between both PSs via so-called state 1-state 2 transitions, but also for the redox signalling (Owens 1986).•The light-harvesting proteins of diatoms are not differentiated into minor and major complexes and the protein domains which trigger membrane stacking in Chloroplastida by modulation of phosphorylation do not exist (Larkum and Vesk 2003; Westermann and Rhiel 2005).•In Chloroplastida, photoprotection is supported by cycling of xanthophylls bound to the minor antenna proteins in the presence of the PsbS protein. In diatoms, xanthophylls contribute even more to the photoprotection; however, in the genome of T. pseudonana, neither a psbS gene nor genes encoding for minor light-harvesting units could be identified.•Diatoms lack the α-carotene pathway with the consequence that photoprotective and light-harvesting pigments are synthesised on the same metabolic branch asking for sophisticated mechanisms of regulation (Lohr and Wilhelm 1999).•In contrast to Chloroplastida, metabolic activity in long dark periods leads to an enhanced reduction state of the PQ pool which is accompanied by the build-up of a proton gradient strong enough to drive the de-epoxidation reaction of xanthophyll cycle (XC) pigments (Jakob et al. 1999). Here again, the impact of unusual redox control of gene expression is obvious.•In chloroplasts of the Chloroplastida, photosynthetic CO2 fixation is regulated by light via the redox state of thiol groups. There is now evidence that in diatoms, the Calvin cycle is controlled by a different mechanism and that the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle (OPP) is not present (Michels et al. 2005).•It has been observed that inhibitory effects of a high concentration of oxygen/low concentration of CO2 on photosynthetic activity are less pronounced in diatoms than in green algae (Beardall 1989; McMinn et al. 2005). This has been discussed in the light of an active transport and accumulation of inorganic carbon within the cell (Beardall 1989) and the C4 fixation metabolism in diatoms (Reinfelder et al. 2004). However, some crucial plastid-localised enzymes being prerequisites in this metabolic pathway could not be identified in the diatom genome.•The metabolic carbon flow in diatom photorespiration is not yet elucidated. However, there is clear evidence that in diatoms, the photorespiratory carbon flux is not coupled to the nitrogen flux as in the typical carbon-oxidation cycle in green algae. Surprisingly, the genome analysis of T. pseudonana revealed that in contrast to green phototrophs, the diatoms possess a complete set of genes for a functional urea cycle (Armbrust et al. 2004). In this context, it might be noteworthy that the genes encoding the enzymes for ß-oxidation and catalase were found in the genome (Armbrust et al. 2004); however, it is not yet clear whether this pathway is located in the peroxisome.•Diatoms synthesise lipids and the ß-1,3 glucan chrysolaminarin as energy storage products. In contrast to starch, this polymer does not form crystals. In green algae, the carbon storage product starch induces cell sinking; whereas in diatoms, the storage product lipid can increase the cell′s buoyancy.•Several in situ iron fertilisation experiments have demonstrated that diatoms can survive even in areas that are severely iron limited (e.g. high nutrient low carbon [HNLC] regions), and have the potential to form large blooms upon relief of the iron limitation (Boyd et al. 2000). This response can in part be explained by the plasticity of the Fe:C ratio in diatoms, possibly achieved by changes in the stoichiometry of photosynthetic proteins and the replacement of ferredoxin by flavodoxin (LaRoche et al. 1996; Strzepek and Harrison 2004).",,"algae; Animalia; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacillariophyceae; Bacillariophyta; Characeae; Chlorophyta; Chromophyta; Cyanidioschyzon merolae; Eukaryota; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Prasinophyceae; Rhodophyta; Thalassiosira pseudonana; Viridiplantae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747415749

It argues that the story can be understood in institutionalist terms, which recognize the different perspectives of planning policy communities and climate change policy communities. The decision to publish advice provided a policy arena in which these different interests sought to influence the agenda, employing competing policy discourses of discretionary enablement and more urgent prescription. These discourses partly reflected different approaches to the role of government, but also revealed the complexities of climate change as a new and uncharted issue facing the planning system. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Climate change; Institutional barriers; National governance; Policy discourse; Spatial planning",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646239406

Major energy savings can be made from modal shifts in the transport sector, and with efficient lighting. The savings make a contribution to economic development, by freeing up resources. The savings from energy efficiency also have important social benefits in energy savings, reducing energy bills for poor households. From an environmental point of view, implementing the city's renewable energy target will have significant costs, but these can be partly off-set by selling carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism, and will result in indirect health benefits. Targeted interventions can reduce local air pollution, and help Cape Town become a leader in addressing greenhouse gas emissions. Apart from examining the social, economic and environmental dimensions of each policy, this paper compares policies to one another. Of particular interest for sustainable energy development are those policies which are viable in terms of costs, social benefits and the environment. Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) in residential, commercial and government sectors and heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in commerce and government sectors stand out as policies that have benefits from every angle. The paper builds on previous work done on the 'state of energy' for Cape Town and develops a tool that can paint a picture of what might happen to energy in the future. Using the Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) modelling tool, a set of energy policies have been simulated.","Cape Town; Energy development; Energy policy; Energy savings; Energy use patterns; Sustainable development","Air conditioning; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Fluorescent lamps; Greenhouse effect; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Cape Town; Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL); Energy development; Energy savings; Energy use patterns; Energy management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744974523

Palaeorecords provide contradictory evidence about marine productivity in this region, but beyond one glacial cycle, data were sparse. Here we present continuous chemical proxy data spanning the last eight glacial cycles (740,000 years) from the Dome C Antarctic ice core. These data constrain winter sea-ice extent in the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean biogenic productivity and Patagonian climatic conditions. We found that maximum sea-ice extent is closely tied to Antarctic temperature on multi-millennial timescales, but less so on shorter timescales. Biological dimethylsulphide emissions south of the polar front seem to have changed little with climate, suggesting that sulphur compounds were not active in climate regulation. We observe large glacial-interglacial contrasts in iron deposition, which we infer reflects strongly changing Patagonian conditions. During glacial terminations, changes in Patagonia apparently preceded sea-ice reduction, indicating that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for different phases of CO2 increase during glacial terminations. We observe no changes in internal climatic feedbacks that could have caused the change in amplitude of Antarctic temperature variations observed 440,000 years ago. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Data acquisition; Dust; Iron; Thermal effects; Data spanning; Dimethylsulphide emissions; Dust flux; Sea ice; carbon dioxide; dimethyl sulfide; iron; sulfur; climate feedback; dust; Last Glacial; sea ice; Antarctica; arctic climate; article; chemical analysis; glacier; priority journal; productivity; sea ice; temperature; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645314908

A continued programme of radio measurements has revealed an exceptional flare in the light curve, with the 15.2-GHz flux density rising by a factor of ∼3 from ∼140 to ∼430 mJy in a rest-frame time-scale of only ∼4 months - much larger than any previous flares observed in this source. In addition to new measurements of the 1.4-43 GHz radio spectrum, we also present the analysis and results of a target-of-opportunity X-ray observation using XMM-Newton, made close to the peak in radio flux. Although the X-ray data do not show a flare in the high-energy light curve, we are able to confirm the X-ray spectral variability hinted at in previous observations. GB B1428+4217 is one of several high-redshift radio-loud quasars that display a low-energy break in the X-ray spectrum, probably due to the presence of excess absorption in the source. X-ray spectral analysis of the latest XMM-Newton data is shown to be consistent with the warm-absorption scenario which we have hypothesized previously. Warm absorption is also consistent with the observed X-ray spectral variability of the source, in which the spectral changes can be successfully accounted-for with a fixed column density of material in which the ionization state is correlated with hardness of the underlying power-law emission. © 2006 RAS.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: individual: Gb b1428+4217; X-rays: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646264282

Observed climatic data from 616 meteorological stations over China's land surface were used. Potential evapotranspiration was calculated by the Penman-Monteith model with a modified net radiation part to accommodate China's unique climatic conditions. According to the aridity/humidity index, a ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation, four moisture regional types were delineated gradually from the southeast to the northwest, i.c. humid, subhumid, semiarid and arid throughout China. Linear regression was performed on the 30-year time series of the four climate factors in order to detect possible trends. The results confirm the obvious spatial and temporal difference of climate trends. Surface air temperature has increasing trends almost all over China especially in winter. Most stations are statistically significant. Annual precipitation shows increasing trends at more than half of the stations, and the increasing trends mainly occur in summer and winter while the decreasing trends occur in spring and autumn. However, most stations are not statistically significant. Potential evapotranspiration has decreasing trends in most stations and nearly half of the stations are statistically significant. Annual aridity/ humidity index shows primarily decreasing trends with a distribution nearly the same as the increasing trends of precipitation. The index has the decreasing trends in spring and summer and the increasing trends in autumn and winter. The results suggest that it is necessary to consider precipitation and potential evapotranspiration simultaneously to describe the moisture conditions exactly.

After establishing conditions favorable for bioremediation (Wu, et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2006, 40, 3988-3995), intermittent additions of ethanol were initiated within the conditioned inner loop of a nested well recirculation system. These additions initially stimulated denitrification of matrix-entrapped nitrate, but after 2 months, aqueous U levels fell from 5 to ∼1 μM and sulfate reduction ensued. Continued additions sustained U(VI) reduction over 13 months. X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy (XANES) confirmed U(VI) reduction to U(IV) within the inner loop wells, with up to 51%, 35%, and 28% solid-phase U(IV) in sediment samples from the injection well, a monitoring well, and the extraction well, respectively. Microbial analyses confirmed the presence of denitrifying, sulfate-reducing, and iron-reducing bacteria in groundwater and sediments. System pH was generally maintained at less than 6.2 with low bicarbonate level (0.75-1.5 mM) and residual sulfate to suppress methanogenesis and minimize uranium mobilization. The bioavailability of sorbed U(VI) was manipulated by addition of low-level carbonate (<5 mM)followed by ethanol (1-1.5 mM). Addition of low levels of carbonate increased the concentration of aqueous U, indicating an increased rate of U desorption due to formation of uranyl carbonate complexes. Upon ethanol addition, aqueous U(VI) levels fell, indicating that the rate of microbial reduction exceeded the rate of desorption. Sulfate levels simultaneously decreased, with a corresponding increase in sulfide. When ethanol addition ended but carbonate addition continued, soluble U levels increased, indicating faster desorption than reduction. When bicarbonate addition stopped, aqueous U levels decreased, indicating adsorption to sediments. Changes in the sequence of carbonate and ethanol addition confirmed that carbonate-controlled desorption increased bioavailability of U(VI) for reduction. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Methanogenesis; Microbial analyses; Nested well recirculation system; X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy (XANES); Bioremediation; Desorption; Ethanol; Groundwater resources; Sediments; Uranium; Water treatment; alcohol; bicarbonate; carbonic acid; ground water; iron; nitrate; sulfate; uranium; Bioremediation; Desorption; Ethanol; Groundwater resources; Sediments; Uranium; Water treatment; aquifer pollution; bioavailability; bioremediation; denitrification; ethanol; groundwater; in situ measurement; iron-reducing bacterium; microbial activity; sediment; sulfate-reducing bacterium; uranium; absorption spectroscopy; aqueous solution; aquifer; article; bioavailability; bioremediation; concentration (parameters); denitrification; desorption; extraction; geochemistry; methanogenesis; monitoring; pH; pollution transport; reduction; sediment; sulfate reducing bacterium; United States; water contamination; x ray near edge absorption spectroscopy; Bacteria; Bicarbonates; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biological Availability; Culture Media; Decontamination; Equipment Design; Ethanol; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Oxidation-Reduction; Pilot Projects; Radioactive Waste; Uranium; Water Pollutants, Radioactive; Water Purification; Eurasia; Europe; Galicia; La Coruna [Galicia]; North America; Oak Ridge Reservation; Southern Europe; Spain; Tennessee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745151074

Therefore the emissions of NH3, CH4 and N2O and costs caused by treating OFMSW by co-fermentation with slurry were calculated in detail from literature data, and strategies for reducing emissions were evaluated. Emission factors were calculated for single gases during storage and after application. The sensitivity of the calculations concerning the organic dry matter content of OFMSW, retention time and CH4-yield was analyzed. The anaerobic co-fermentation of OFMSW increased biogas yields and contributed to the reduction of CO2 emissions with 32 to 152 kg CO2 t -1 organic waste depending on application and storage techniques used for the fermentation residues. Considering a payment of 0.1 €/kWh for the electricity produced, the costs for utilization of OFMSW in slurry based biogas plants were calculated to range between 34 and 38 € t-1. Measures for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by covering the fermentation residue stores proved to be more cost effective with 3-31 € t-1 CO2 compared to immediate harrowing or injecting the residues during field application. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Studies have demonstrated long carrier mean free paths at room temperature in both carbon nanotubes and Ge/Si core/shell nanowires. In the case of carbon nanotube FETs, devices have been fabricated that work close to the ballistic limit. Applications of high-performance carbon nanotube FETs have been hindered, however, by difficulties in producing uniform semiconducting nanotubes, a factor not limiting nanowires, which have been prepared with reproducible electronic properties in high yield as required for large-scale integrated systems. Yet whether nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) can indeed outperform their planar counterparts is still unclear. Here we report studies on Ge/Si core/shell nanowire heterostructures configured as FETs using high-κ dielectrics in a top-gate geometry. The clean one-dimensional hole-gas in the Ge/Si nanowire heterostructures and enhanced gate coupling with high-κ dielectrics give high-performance FETs values of the scaled transconductance (3.3 mS μm -1) and on-current (2.1 mA μm-1) that are three to four times greater than state-of-the-art MOSFETs and are the highest obtained on NWFETs. Furthermore, comparison of the intrinsic switching delay, τ = CV/I, which represents a key metric for device applications, shows that the performance of Ge/Si NWFETs is comparable to similar length carbon nanotube FETs and substantially exceeds the length-dependent scaling of planar silicon MOSFETs. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Carbon nanotubes; Electronic structure; MOSFET devices; Nanostructured materials; Semiconductor materials; Gate coupling; Nanowires; Quantum confinement effects; Heterojunctions; biomaterial; carbon nanotube; germanium; nanotube; silicon; nanomaterial; electronic equipment; geometry; germanium; nanotechnology; scattering; silicon; article; dielectric constant; electron; electronics; geometry; nanotechnology; priority journal; room temperature; semiconductor; chemistry; comparative study; Germanium; Nanostructures; Nanotubes, Carbon; Silicon; Transistors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745327664

The program was written in Fortran 77 and developed by introducing reactive geochemistry into the multiphase fluid and heat flow simulator TOUGH2. A variety of subsurface thermo-physical-chemical processes are considered under a wide range of conditions of pressure, temperature, water saturation, ionic strength, and pH and Eh. Interactions between mineral assemblages and fluids can occur under local equilibrium or kinetic rates. The gas phase can be chemically active. Precipitation and dissolution reactions can change formation porosity and permeability. The program can be applied to many geologic systems and environmental problems, including geothermal systems, diagenetic, and weathering processes, subsurface waste disposal, acid mine drainage remediation, contaminant transport, and groundwater quality. Here we present two examples to illustrate applicability of the program. The first example deals with injectivity effects of mineral scaling in a fractured geothermal reservoir. A major concern in the development of hot dry rock and hot fractured rock reservoirs is achieving and maintaining adequate injectivity, while avoiding the development of preferential short-circuiting flow paths. Rock-fluid interactions and associated mineral dissolution and precipitation effects could have a major impact on the long-term performance of these reservoirs. We used recent European studies as a starting point to explore chemically induced effects of fluid circulation in the geothermal systems. We examine ways in which the chemical composition of reinjected waters can be modified to improve reservoir performance by maintaining or even enhancing injectivity. The second TOUGHREACT application example is related to CO2 geologic sequestration in a saline aquifer. We performed numerical simulations for a commonly encountered Gulf Coast sediment under CO2 injection conditions in order to analyze the impact of CO2 immobilization through carbonate precipitation. Using the data presented in this paper, the CO2 mineral-trapping capability after 10,000 years can reach 60 kg/m3 of sandstone by secondary carbonate mineral precipitation such as siderite, ankerite, and dawsonite. Most of the simulated mineral alteration pattern is consistent with the field observations of natural CO2 reservoirs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

For years, in thermionic emission, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the search for low work function materials with high melting temperature, while reduction of the local change in time of the work function rather than the work function itself has been the main issue of field emission investigations. High brightness and long life are the central targets of emission material investigations for scientific instrument applications, while high current density and low power consumption are the guiding principles for display applications. In most of the present day industries, thermionic emission materials are exclusively used in such fields requiring high current and high reliability as cathode ray tubes, transmission and receiving tubes, x-ray sources and various electron beam machines. Field electron emission sources, however, since applied to high resolution electron microscopes in the 1970s have recently become dominant in research and development in the fields of scientific instruments as well as in the fields of various electron tubes and beam machines. The main issue in this report is to analyse the work function on the atomic scale and thereby to understand the fundamental physics behind the work function, the change in time of the local work function leading to field emission current fluctuation and the relationship between microscopic (on atomic scale) and macroscopic work functions. Our attempt is presented here, where the work function on the atomic scale is measured by utilizing a scanning tunnelling microscopy technique, and it is made clear how far the local work function extends its influence over neighbouring sites. As a result, a simple relationship is established between microscopic and macroscopic work functions. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28444460361

Problems and anesthetic management of the patient are discussed. A 35-year-old man with Sturge-Weber syndrome was to undergo teeth extraction and gingivectomy. Hemangiomas covered his face and the inside of the oral cavity. We used intravenous conscious sedation with propofol and N2O-O2 to reduce the patient's emotional stress. It was previously determined that stress caused marked expansion of this patient's hemangiomas. Periodontal ligament injection was chosen as the local anesthesia technique. Teeth were extracted without excessive bleeding or rupture of hemangiomas, but the planned gingivectomies were cancelled. Deep sedation requiring airway manipulation should be avoided because there are possible difficulties in airway maintenance. Because this was an outpatient procedure, propofol was selected as the sedative agent primarily because of its rapid onset and equally rapid recovery. Periodontal ligament injection with 2% lidocaine containing 1: 80,000 epinephrine was chosen for local anesthesia. Gingivectomy was cancelled because hemostasis was challenging. As part of preoperative preparation, equipment for prompt intubation was available in case of rupture of the hemangiomas. The typically seen elevation of blood pressure was suppressed under propofol sedation so that expansion of the hemangiomas and significant intraoperative bleeding was prevented.

A total of 2896 subjects filled out the self administered questionnaire that included the SF-36 and demographic characteristics. Data were linked from the questionnaires with the data on air pollutants in the cities where the subjects resided. The paper examined the relations between the mean concentration of each air pollutant and the VT or MH score on the SF-36 using analysis of covariance. Results: On crude analysis, the respondents who were exposed to a higher mean two month concentration of photochemical oxidants (Ox) showed a significant linear trend toward lower VT score (p = 0.028). This association remained even after adjustment for subjective demographic characteristics and meteorological variables (p = 0.033). There was a common tendency that subjects who were exposed to higher concentrations of Ox had a lower mean VT or MH score; however, there was a significant association only between Ox concentration and VT score. Conclusion: The score on the VT domain of the SF-36 was associated with the mean concentration of Ox during the previous two month period.

Chan is with the Department of Chemical Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong. This paper presents a technique to study air pollution by combining high spatial resolution data obtained by a mobile platform and those measured by conventional stationary stations. Conventional stations provide time-series point data but cannot yield information that is distant from the sites. This can be complemented or supplemented by mobile measurements in the vicinity of the conventional sites. Together, the combined dataset yields a clearer and more precise picture of the dispersion and the transformation of pollutants in the atmosphere in a fixed time frame. Several experiments were conducted in the years 2002–2003 to track the impact of power plant plumes on ground receptors in the immediate vicinity (within a radius of 30 km) of the plants, using a combined mobile and stationary dataset. The mobile data allowed the identification of emissions from coal-fired and gasfired power plants. Coal-fired power plants were the major source of sulfur dioxide (SO2), whereas nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted from the gas-fired power plant played an important role in the formation of ozone (O3) at ground level. The mobile data showed that two particle size distribution regimes were detected: one had a dominant accumulation mode at 0.40–0.65 μm and the other at 0.65–1 μm. The existence of particles characterized by their mode at 0.65–1 μm and formed by in-cloud processes suggests that vehicular emissions were not the important source. Other local sources, such as power plants (elevated emission), were the likely sources, because Hong Kong does not have much manufacturing industry. © 2006 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Air pollution; Dispersion hardening; Information retrieval; Optical resolving power; Ozone; Particle size analysis; Power plants; Spatial variables control; Sulfur dioxide; Conventional stationary stations; Elevated emission; Mobile measurements; Vehicular emissions; Industrial emissions; coal; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; article; cloud; electric power plant; exhaust gas; Hong Kong; industry; particle size; photochemistry; plume; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644639626

Second, regional climate simulations are conducted by the 5-km-mesh NHM covering East Asia, in order to investigate the small-scale response to large-scale conditions, simulated by the 20-km-mesh AGCM. While the rainfall does not vary in June between the present and future climates, there is more rainfall in July in the future climate. Moreover, the frequency of the precipitation greatly increases with the intensity of the precipitation in July in the future climate simulation. In order to investigate the typical size of the precipitation systems that bring rainfall during the Baiu season, precipitation systems are classified according to the area coverage of the systems. Precipitation systems with an area larger than 90,000 km2 are more frequently seen in July in the future climate, than in the present climate, which corresponds to more rainfall. The increase of the large system in July is most remarkable in the vicinity of Kyushu Island, and the baroclinicity in that area is stronger in the future climate. © 2006, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"atmospheric general circulation model; baroclinic mode; climate change; front; precipitation intensity; rainfall; regional climate; seasonal variation; simulation; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Kyushu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646399466

Photophysics investigation showed that the absorption maximum of BHPE was at 281 nm, red shifted about 40 nm compared to the commercial photoinitiators 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one (HMPP) and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (HCPK), dropping into the UVB region, and the fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence quantum yields of BHPE were found to be 14.2 ns and 0.045, respectively. The photoinitiating activity of BHPE was tested in comparison with HMPP by means of differential photo-calorimetry (DPC or Photo-DSC), and the initiation efficiency of BHPE was found to be comparable to that of HMPP. Bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of BHPE was calculated by quantum chemistry with the B3LYP method of 6-311++G** basis sets and found to be 67.8 kcal/mol, very close to that of HMPP (65.0 kcal/mol) and HCPK (63.5 kcal/mol). The quantum yields of initiation and polymerization were determined to be 58 and 296 for BHPE, 100 (defined as reference) and 389 for HMPP, respectively. A photochemical mechanism was proposed based on the results of steady-state photolysis UV spectra, GC-MS, NMR and GPC. Volatility of BHPE was tested under simulated outdoor conditions, showing very low volatility comparing to the corresponding commercial photoinitiator.

The air quality model tracks the formation of PM2.5 nitrate, sulfate and ammonium ion from primary particles and precursor gases emitted from different sources though a mathematical simulation of emission, chemical reaction, gas-to-particle conversion, transport and deposition. The observed PM2.5 nitrate, sulfate and ammonium ion concentrations, and the mass distribution of nitrate, sulfate and ammonium ion as a function of particle size have been successfully reproduced by the model simulation. Approximately 45-57% of the PM2.5 nitrate and 34-40% of the PM2.5 ammonium ion in the SJV is formed from precursor gaseous species released from sources upwind of the valley. In the SoCAB, approximately 83% of the PM2.5 nitrate and 82% of the PM2.5 ammonium ion is formed from precursor gaseous species released from sources within the air basin. In the SJV, transportation related sources contribute approximately 24-30% of the PM2.5 nitrate (diesel engines ∼13.5-17.0%, catalyst equipped gasoline engines ∼10.2-12.8% and non-catalyst equipped gasoline engines ∼0.3-0.4%). In the SoCAB, transportation related sources directly contribute to approximately 67% of the PM2.5 nitrate (diesel engines 34.6%, non-catalyst equipped gasoline engine 4.7% and catalyst equipped gasoline engine 28.1%). PM2.5 ammonium ion concentrations in the SJV were dominated by area (including animal) NH3 sources (16.7-25.3%), soil (7.2-10.9%), fertilizer NH3 sources (11.4-17.3%) and point NH3 sources (14.3-21.7%). In the SoCAB, ammonium ion is mainly associated with animal sources (28.2%) and catalyst equipped gasoline engines (16.2%). In both regions, the majority of the relatively low PM2.5 sulfate (&lt;5 μg m-3) is associated with upwind sources. Most of the locally generated sulfate is emitted from diesel engines and high-sulfur fuel combustion processes in both modeling domains.

Until recently, engineers developed conceptual process designs by experience and intuition, however, with the establishment of process integration methodologies, this activity can be performed systematically. One of the subjects that have received the most attention from researchers in this area is the steady state design of Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs). Several tools have been developed and are in use; however, the development of a tool for synthesis of HENs that takes into account network controllability is not available. Hence, the purpose of this paper is the development of a new methodology for design of heat-integrated chemical processes, particularly HENs where controllability and energy recovery are both balanced during the design synthesis stage.","Disturbance analysis; Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs); Heat-integration; Multivariable control system analysis","Heat exchangers; Multivariable control systems; Optimization; Process control; Process engineering; Product design; Disturbance analysis; Heat exchanger networks (HEN); Heat integration; Multivariable control system analysis; Chemical engineering; Chemical engineering; Heat exchangers; Multivariable control systems; Optimization; Process control; Process engineering; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745597649

Most of the research examining the epididymis to date has been limited to the study of the secreted proteins involved in the maturation of spermatozoa. However, it is also very important to understand the protein components, regulation and function of the tissue itself since these are the basis for all of its physiological processes. We investigated the differential expression of proteins among the caput, corpus, and cauda regions of rat epididymis and considered the possible links between the localization of these proteins and the different functions of these epididymal regions. High-resolution 2-D gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry (MS) revealed 28 distinct proteins whose expression levels varied from the caput to the cauda epididymis. Sixteen of them were reported for first time to be expressed in the epididymis. Expression patterns of some proteins were validated by Northern blot or Western blot. Immunohistochemistry revealed that inducible carbonyl reductase (iCR), an important enzyme in the anti-oxidative system, exhibits primary and cell-type specific distribution in the distal cauda region. Moreover, analysis of iCR transcription in castrated animals showed that its expression is androgen-dependent. Together with its known functions, iCR may also be involved in androgen metabolism and maintaining a steady microenvironment in the duct of epididymis. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","Androgen; Inducible carbonyl reductase; Rat epididymis; Regional distribution; Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","carbonyl reductase; protein; androgen metabolism; animal tissue; article; castration; cell type; cellular distribution; controlled study; epididymis; epididymis tail; genetic transcription; immunohistochemistry; male; male genital system; mass spectrometry; microenvironment; nonhuman; Northern blotting; oxidation; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; proteomics; rat; spermatozoon maturation; spermatozoon migration; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Western blotting; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Androgens; Animals; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Epididymis; Galectin 3; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Orchiectomy; Proteome; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32344441758

The adopted approach evaluates local potentials of renewable energy sources with the aid of a geographic information system according to actual local conditions, and allows the assessment to consider local potentials and restrictions such as climate conditions, land uses, and ecological environments, thus enabling a more-accurate assessment than is possible with evaluations on an approximate basis.

An appealing approach to estimate hatchling sex ratios is to measure sand temperatures at nest depth and deduce hatchling sex ratios from a beforehand-established relationship of hatchling sex ratio and sand temperature. Such estimates will only be accurate though if metabolic heat produced by the embryos is considered. Judging whether metabolic heating has a potential effect on hatchling sex ratios without actually measuring temperature within clutches would greatly facilitate monitoring protocols. We tested for a relationship between the amount of metabolic heating and the number of developed embryos as well as clutch size in the largest known loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) population of the Mediterranean on Zakynthos (Greece). Temperatures were measured within 20 nests as well as at a reference site in the sand at nest depth. Metabolic heating was detected, but only during the last third of the incubation period did nests heat up considerably (1.6 °C on average) above the temperature of the surrounding sand. During the middle third of incubation, when sex is determined, the amount of metabolic heating was negligible. The amount of metabolic heating during the last third of the incubation duration was significantly correlated to the number of offspring developed to at least about 75% of incubation duration. This factor explained nearly 50% of variation in metabolic heating. Metabolic heating was also significantly correlated to clutch size. Given that clutch size within the Mediterranean is largest in Zakynthos loggerheads, we conclude that metabolic heating can be ignored in the estimate of hatchling sex ratios in Mediterranean loggerhead populations. These results thus provide the basis for a feasible monitoring of hatchling sex ratios in the loggerhead sea turtle in the Mediterranean. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the Mid-Atlantic LLJ and its associated characteristics during the warm seasons of 2001 and 2002 are documented with both the wind profiler data and the daily real-time model forecast products. A case study with three model sensitivity simulations is performed to gain insight into the three-dimensional structures and evolution of an LLJ and the mechanism by which it developed. It is found that the Mid-Atlantic LLJ, ranging from 8 to 23 m s-1, appeared at an average altitude of 670 m and on 15-25 days of each month. About 90% of the 160 observed LLJ events occurred between 0000 and 0600 LST, and about 60% had southerly to westerly directions. Statistically, the real-time forecasts capture most of the LLJ events with nearly the right timing, intensity, and altitude, although individual forecasts may not correspond to those observed. For a selected southwesterly LLJ case, both the observations and the control simulation exhibit a pronounced diurnal cycle of horizontal winds in the lowest 1.5 km. The simulation shows that the Appalachian Mountains tend to produce a sloping mixed layer with northeasterly thermal winds during the daytime and reversed thermal winds after midnight. With additional thermal contrast effects associated with the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, the daytime low-level winds vary significantly from the east coast to the mountainous regions. The LLJ after midnight tends to be peaked preferentially around 77.5°W near the middle portion of the sloping terrain, and it decreases eastward as a result of the opposite thermal gradient across the coastline from the mountain-generated thermal gradient. Although the Mid-Atlantic LLJ is much weaker and less extensive than that over the Great Plains states, it has a width of 300-400 km (to its half-peak value) and a length scale of more than 1500 km, following closely the orientation of the Appalachians. Sensitivity simulations show that eliminating the surface heat fluxes produces the most significant impact on the development of the LLJ, then topography and the land-sea contrast, with its area-averaged intensity reduced from 12 m s-1 to about 6, 9, and 10 m s-1, respectively. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Forecasting; Research; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical methods; Wind effects; Low-level jets; Warm-season climatology; Climatology; climatology; computer simulation; jet; numerical model; season; wind profile; Appalachians; Atlantic Ocean; Chesapeake Bay; Great Plains; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646549598

Based on mineralogical composition and microfabrics, the diagenetic environments are distinguished into marine, near surface meteoric and burial environments. Detailed petrographical observation of abundant thin sections integrated with previous studies on sequence stratigraphy reveals that the carbonate diagenesis in the Carboniferous-Permian boundary section is related to the relative stratigraphic position of the rocks in the high-frequency cycles and controlled by the glacioeustatic sea-level changes. There are distinctive differences in diagenetic patterns between the lower transgressive sequence and the upper regressive sequence in a cyclothem. The diagenesis in the lower transgressive sequence is mainly characterized by pressure dissolution and recrystallization of mudstone and wackstone in a burial environment, and the diagenesis in the upper regressive sequence by cementation and leaching of freshwater in a meteoric environment.","Carbonate; Carboniferous-Permian boundary; Diagenesis; Diagenetic environment; Glacioeustatic sea-level change; High-frequency cycle; Shaanxi; Zhen'an","carbonate sediment; cementation; diagenesis; glacioeustacy; sea level change; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746162327

MMOB from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is devoid of cysteine. Consequently, site-directed mutagenesis was used to incorporate single cysteine residues, allowing specific placement of the probe molecules. Sixteen MMOB Cys mutants were prepared and labeled with the EPR spin probe 4-maleimido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (MSL). Spectral evaluation of probe mobility and accessibility to the hydrophilic spin-relaxing agent NiEDDA showed that both properties decrease dramatically for a subset of the spin labels as the complex with MMOH forms, thereby defining the likely interaction surface on MMOB. This surface contains MMOB residue Till thought to play a role in substrate access into the MMOH active site. The surface also contains several hydrophilic residues and is ringed by charged residues. The surface of MMOB opposite the proposed binding surface is highly charged, consistent with solvent exposure. Probes of both of the disordered N- and C-terminal regions remain highly mobile and exposed to solvent in the MMOH complex. Spin-labeling studies show that residue A62 of MMOB is located in a position where it can be used to monitor MMOH-MMOB complex formation without perturbing the process. Accordingly, steady-state kinetic assays show that it can be changed to Cys (A62C) and labeled with the fluorescent probes 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (BADAN) or 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)-amino) ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (1,5-IAEDANS) without loss of the ability of MMOB to promote turnover. The BADAN fluorescence is partially quenched and red shifted as the complex with MMOH forms, allowing affinity measurements. It is shown that the high affinity of labeled MMOB (KD = 13.5 nM at pH 6.6, 25 °C) for the oxidized MMOH decreases substantially with increasing pH and increasing ionic strength but is nearly unaffected by addition of nonionic detergents. Similarly, the fluorescence anisotropy of the 1,5-IAED ANS-labeled A62C-MMOH complex is perturbed by salts but not nonionic detergents. This suggests that the MMOB-MMOH complex is stabilized by electrostatic interactions consistent with the characteristics of the proposed binding surface. Reduction of MMOH results in a 2-3 order of magnitude decrease in the affinity of the BADAN-labeled A62C-MMOB-MMOH complex, consistent with previous indications of structural change associated with reduction of the active site dinuclear iron cluster. Utilizing BADAN-labeled MMOB, the association and dissociation rate constants for the MMOB-MMOH binding reaction were determined and found to be consistent with a two-step process, possibly involving rapid association followed by a slower conformational change. The latter may be related to the regulation of substrate access into the active site of MMOH. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical reactions; Conformations; Mutagenesis; Organic compounds; Probes; Substrates; Affinity measurements; Binding surface; Cysteine residues; Electrostatic interactions; Fluorescent probes; Methane monooxygenase hydroxylase; MMOB-MMOH binding; Site-bearing hydroxylase component; Spin labels; Solutions; 4 maleimido 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy; 5 [[[(2 iodoacetyl)amino]ethyl]amino]naphthalene 1 sulfonic acid; 6 bromoacetyl 2 dimethylaminonaphthalene; cysteine; fluorescent dye; methane monooxygenase; methane monooxygenase hydroxylase; methane monooxygenase regulatory component; naphthalene derivative; piperidine derivative; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; anisotropy; article; binding affinity; carboxy terminal sequence; catalysis; complex formation; conformational transition; controlled study; electron spin resonance; enzyme substrate; hydrophilicity; ionic strength; kinetics; Methylosinus trichosporium; molecular stability; nonhuman; pH measurement; priority journal; protein conformation; protein metabolism; protein protein interaction; protein structure; reaction analysis; reduction; site directed mutagenesis; spin labeling; structure analysis; technique; thermodynamics; 2-Naphthylamine; Binding Sites; Catalysis; Circular Dichroism; Cysteine; Fluorescence Polarization; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Methylosinus trichosporium; Multienzyme Complexes; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Oxygenases; Protein Isoforms; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Substrate Specificity; Time Factors; Methylosinus trichosporium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644690580

MMOB is known to have many profound effects on the rate and specificity of sMMO. Past studies have revealed specific roles for the well-folded core structure of MMOB as well as the disordered N-terminal region. Here, it is shown that the disordered C-terminal region of MMOB also performs critical roles in the regulation of catalysis. Deletion mutants of MMOB missing 5, 8, and 13 C-terminal residues cause progressive decreases in the maximum steady-state turnover number, as well as lower apparent rate constants for formation of the key reaction cycle intermediate, compound Q. It is shown that this latter effect is actually due to a decrease in the rate constant for formation of an earlier intermediate, probably the hydroperoxo species, compound P. Moreover, the deletions result in substantial uncoupling at or before the P intermediate. It is proposed that this is due to competition between slow H 2O2 release from one of the intermediates and the reaction that carries this intermediate on to the next step in the cycle, which is slowed by the mutation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of the hydroxylase component (MMOH) in the mixed valent state suggest that complexation with the mutant MMOBs alters the electronic properties of the diiron cluster in a manner distinct from that observed when wild-type MMOB is used. Active site structural changes are also suggested by a substantial decrease in the deuterium kinetic isotope effect for the reaction of Q with methane thought to be associated with a decrease in quantum tunneling in the C-H bond breaking reaction. Thus, the surface interactions between MMOH and MMOB that affect substrate oxidation and its regulation appear to require the complete MMOB C-terminal region for proper function. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Enzymes; Hydroxylation; Isotopes; Mutagenesis; Oxygen; Solubility; Diiron cluster; Methane monooxygenase (MMO); Quantum tunneling; Transient kinetics; Methane; carbon; deuterium; hydrogen; hydrogen peroxide; hydroperoxide; iron; methane; methane monooxygenase; methane monooxygenase B; methane monooxygenase hydroxylase; oxygen; unclassified drug; amino terminal sequence; article; carboxy terminal sequence; catalysis; chemical bond; chemical reaction kinetics; complex formation; controlled study; deletion mutant; electron; electron spin resonance; enzyme active site; enzyme specificity; enzyme structure; Methylosinus trichosporium; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; protein folding; quantum chemistry; steady state; surface property; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Catalytic Domain; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Methane; Methylosinus trichosporium; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Nitrobenzenes; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Oxygenases; Peptide Fragments; Sequence Alignment; Surface Properties; Time Factors; Trichosanthin; Methylosinus trichosporium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32244437569

Eddy-covariance technology was applied to investigate the long-term carbon exchange over a 200-year-old Chinese broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest of Forest Ecosystem Open Research Station of Changbai Mountains (128°28′E and 42°24′N, Jilin Province, PR China), Chinese Academy of Sciences, since August 2002. This paper reports the result on (1) phase and amplitude of ecosystem CO2 uptake and release and (2) sink/source status on the data obtained with open-path eddy-covariance system and CO2 profile measurement system from August 2002 to August 2003. Corrections due to storage and friction velocity were applied to the eddy carbon flux. Behavior of pressure flux, neglected in common WPL correction, was analyzed to develop acceptable u* range in dormant periods. The ecosystem was a net sink of atmospheric CO2 and sequestered -308 ± 116 g C m-2 during the study period. The estimates of gross carbon gain and loss at this forest were -1432 ± 216 and -1124 ± 181 g C m-2 separately. The seasonal trend of gross primary productivity (FGPP) and respiration (RE) followed closely the change in vegetation absorption index (VAI) and temperature. The summer is the most significant season as far as ecosystem carbon balance is concerned. The net ecosystem exchange (FNEE) during this period was about -298.0 ± 65.2 g C m-2. The 90 days of summer contributed 67.0% of FGPP, 58.9% of RE of whole year. This study shows that old-growth forest can be strong net carbon sink of atmospheric CO2. There are uncertainties in estimate of annual carbon fluxes with eddy-covariance method. More work on advection and pressure fluxes is warranted. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For the singlet potential energy surface (PES) of CHCl2 + NO2 reaction, the association of CHCl2 with NO2 was found to be a barrierless carbon-to-nitrogen approach forming an energy-rich adduct a (HCl2CNO2) followed by isomerization to b1 (trans-cis-HCl2CONO), which can easily interconvert to b2, b3, and b4. Subsequently, the most feasible pathway is the 1,3-chlorine migration associated with N-O1 bond cleavage of b1 leading to P1 (CHClO + ClNO). The second competitive pathway is the 1,4-chlorine migration along with N-O1 bond rupture of b4 giving rise to P2 (CHClO + ClON). Moreover, some of P1 and P 2 can further dissociate to give P6 (CHClO + Cl + NO). The lesser followed competitive channel is the 1,3-H-shift from C to N atom along with N-O1 bond rupture of b1 to form P3 (CCl2O + HNO). The concerted 1,4-H-shift accompanied by N-O1 bond fission of b 3 to product P4 (CCl2O + HON) is even much less feasible. For the singlet PES of CCl3 + NO2 reaction, the only primary product is found to be P1 (CCl2O + ClNO), which can lead to P2 (CCl2O + Cl + NO) via dissociation of ClNO. The obtained major products CHClO and CCl2O for CHCl 2 + NO2 and CCl3 + NO2 reactions, respectively, are in good agreement with kinetic detection in experiment. Compared with the singlet pathways, the triplet pathways may have less contributions to both reactions. Because the rate-determining transition state involved in the feasible pathways lie above the reactants R, the title reactions may be important in high-temperature processes, The similarities and discrepancies among the CHnCl3-n + NO2 (n == 0-2) reactions are discussed in terms of the substitution effect.

The initial association between CH 2OH and NO2 is found to be the carbon-to-nitrogen approach forming an adduct HOCH2NO2 (1) with no barrier, followed by C - N bond rupture along with a concerted H-shift leading to product PI (CH2O + trans-HONO), which is the most abundant. Much less competitively, 1 can undergo the C-O bond formation along with C-N bond rupture to isomer HOCH2ONO (2), which will take subsequent cis - trans conversion and dissociation to P2 (HOCHO + HNO), P3 (CH2O + HNO2), and P4 (CH2O + cis-HONO) with comparable yields.

We have previously developed two positron emission tomography (PET) ligands, N-(2-[ 11C],5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide ([ 11C]2) and its [18F]fluoroethyl analogue ([ 18F]6), for the current investigation of PBR in the human brain. The aim of this study was to label the potent PBR agonist N-(4-chloro-2- phenoxyphenyl)-N-(isopropoxybenzyl)acetamide (3) and its ethyl (7) and methyl (8) homologues with 11C and to evaluate them as PET ligands for PBR with mice, rats, and monkeys. Ligands [11C]3, [11C]7, and [11C]8 were synthesized by alkylation of phenol precursor 9 with 2-[2-11C]iodopropane ([11C]10), [1-11C] iodoethane ([11C]11), and [11C]iodomethane ([ 11C]11), respectively. The alkylating agent [11C]10 or [11C]11 was prepared by reacting CH3MgBr with [ 11C]CO2, followed by reduction with LiAlH4 and iodination with HI. In vitro quantitative autoradiography determined that 3, 7, and 8 had potent binding affinities (Ki = 0.07-0.19 nM) for PBR in the rat brain. These [11C]ligands could pass across the blood-brain barrier and enter the rat brain (0.17-0.32% of injected dose per gram wet tissue). Ex vivo autoradiography showed that the [11C]ligands preferably distributed in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, two regions with richer PBR density in the rat brain. The co-injection of PBR-selective 2 reduced the [11C]ligand binding in the two regions, suggesting that binding in the rat brain was specific to PBR. PET study determined that the [ 11C]ligands preferably accumulate in the occipital cortex of the monkey brain, a region with a high density of PBR in the primate brain. Moreover, in vivo binding of the methyl homologue [11C]8 in the monkey brain could be inhibited by PBR-selective 2 or 1, indicating that some of the [11C]8 binding was due to PBR. Metabolite analysis demonstrated that these [11C]ligands were metabolized by debenzylation to polar products mainly in the plasma. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"aluminum derivative; benzodiazepine receptor; benzodiazepine receptor stimulating agent; bromide; carbon dioxide; ethane; ethyl iodide; iodopropane; ligand; lithium derivative; magnesium bromide; methyl iodide; n (2,5 dimethoxybenzyl) n (5 fluoro 2 phenoxyphenyl)acetamide c 11; n (4 chloro 2 phenoxyphenyl) n (2 methoxylbenzyl)acetamide; n (4 chloro 2 phenoxyphenyl) n (isopropoxybenzyl)acetamide; peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; phenoxyphenyl acetamide derivative; propane; unclassified drug; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; acetamide; acetamide derivative; carbon; diphenyl ether derivative; ligand; alkylation; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; autoradiography; binding affinity; cerebellum; controlled study; debenzylation; drug brain level; drug potency; drug synthesis; drug uptake; ex vivo study; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; iodination; ligand binding; male; monkey; mouse; nonhuman; olfactory bulb; positron emission tomography; quantitative analysis; rat; animal; brain; chemical structure; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; Haplorhini; metabolism; methylation; positron emission tomography; synthesis; Acetamides; Animals; Brain; Carbon Radioisotopes; Haplorhini; Ligands; Male; Methylation; Mice; Molecular Structure; Phenyl Ethers; Positron-Emission Tomography; Rats; Receptors, GABA-A",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646465269

However, this energy use is a significant contributor to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and, hence, global warming. Capture and disposal of CO2 has received increased R&amp;D attention in the last decade as the technology promises to be the most cost effective for large scale reductions in CO2 emissions. This paper addresses CO2 transport via pipeline from capture site to disposal site, in terms of system optimization, energy efficiency and overall economics. Technically, CO2 can be transported through pipelines in the form of a gas, a supercritical fluid or in the subcooled liquid state. Operationally, most CO2 pipelines used for enhanced oil recovery transport CO2 as a supercritical fluid. In this paper, supercritical fluid and subcooled liquid transport are examined and compared, including their impacts on energy efficiency and cost. Using a commercially available process simulator, ASPEN PLUS 10.1, the results show that subcooled liquid transport maximizes the energy efficiency and minimizes the cost of CO2 transport over long distances under both isothermal and adiabatic conditions. Pipeline transport of subcooled liquid CO2 can be ideally used in areas of cold climate or by burying and insulating the pipeline. In very warm climates, periodic refrigeration to cool the CO2 below its critical point of 31.1 °C, may prove economical. Simulations have been used to determine the maximum safe pipeline distances to subsequent booster stations as a function of inlet pressure, environmental temperature and ground level heat flux conditions.","Carbon dioxide; Compression; Energy efficiency; Pipeline; Sequestration; Transportation","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Optimization; Pipelines; Sequestrations; Subcooled liquid state; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144484115

(1997), Alfaro and Gomes (2001) (hereinafter referred to as MBA) and Shao (2001, 2004) into a regional climate model with a size-distributed active aerosol algorithm, NARCM (Northern Aerosol Regional Climate Model), an assessment of dust emission schemes in the simulation of east Asian dust storms for March 2002 was carried out. Sensitivity of the parameters used for both the MBA and Shao schemes is first analyzed with a box version of the NARCM, where the wind erosion threshold friction velocities for both schemes are in good agreement for soil grain size range in diameter from 40 μm to 400 μm but differ for other size ranges. Although the impacts of clay, silt, loam and sand contents on vertical dust fluxes show a similar trend, their dependences on friction velocity vary substantially as the correction factors in each scheme to the threshold friction velocity, soil moisture and vegetation cover present a different degree of impact on vertical dust fluxes with wind friction velocity. One specific parameter, soil plastic pressure p, required by the Shao scheme varies between 103 Pa for loose surfaces and 105 Pa for hard crusted surfaces, which controls significantly emission flux. On the basis of the comparison of dust emission with the MBA scheme in the box model, the soil plastic pressure p applicable to Asian deserts for the Shao scheme is set to be 1000 Pa for sandy, 5000 Pa for loamy and silty and 10,000 Pa for clay soil in March 2002. In 3-D simulations, both schemes captured the dust mobilization episodes during this period in east Asia and produced the similar spatial distributions of Asian dust column loading. Compared with the MBA scheme, the Shao scheme predicted much lower dust emission and surface concentration in eastern Mongolia and eastern and central north China and slightly higher with some additional dust emission sources in north western China, eastern Kazakhstan and western Mongolia. The key parameters responsible for the differences between the MBA and Shao emission schemes are the surface and soil-related factors including soil moisture and vegetation coverage.

In the presence of Cu(I), catalytic reduction of NO to N2O by CuBMb was observed with turnover number of 2 mol NO·mol CuBMb-1·min-1, close to 3 mol NO·mol enzyme-1·min-1 reported for the ba3 oxidases from T. thermophilus. Formation of a His-heme-NO species was detected by UV-vis and EPR spectroscopy. In comparison to the EPR spectra of ferrous-CuBMb-NO in the absence of metal ions, the EPR spectra of ferrous-CuBMb-NO in the presence of Cu(I) showed less-resolved hyperfine splitting from the proximal histidine, probably due to weakening of the proximal His-heme bond. In the presence of Zn(II), formation of a five-coordinate ferrous-CuBMb-NO species, resulting from cleavage of the proximal heme Fe-His bond, was shown by UV-vis and EPR spectroscopic studies. The reduction of NO to N2O was not observed in the presence of Zn(II). Control experiments using wild-type myoglobin indicated no reduction of NO in the presence of either Cu(I) or Zn(II). These results suggest that both the identity and the oxidation state of the metal ion in the CuB center are important for NO reduction. A redox-active metal ion is required to deliver electrons, and a higher oxidation state is preferred to weaken the heme iron-proximal histidine toward a five-coordinate key intermediate in NO reduction.

In this study, we used thiourea to construct a reactive surface barrier (RSB) at the soil surface for reducing 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) volatilization. The agrochemical thiourea could rapidly transform volatile 1,3-D to nonvolatile products via an SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction. A catalytic mechanism in thiourea-amended soil facilitated the conversion process. A packed soil column system was employed to investigate the emissions and distribution of 1,3-D and optimize the original fumigant emission-reduction strategy. Volatilization of 1,3-D from the soil surface was significantly reduced in columns amended with a thiourea RSB compared with that of bare soil. Volatilization flux and cumulative emissions decreased with increasing thiourea application rate and increasing fumigation depth in packed soil columns. Surface amendment with the RSB did not affect the subsurface distribution of 1,3-D in the soil profile. Combined application of a thiourea RSB and plastic tarps had a synergetic effect in emission control and could eliminate the relatively high fumigant flux that occurs upon tarp disruption. Therefore, this reduced-risk practice was very effective in reducing atmospheric emissions of VOCs from soil treatment with halogenated fumigants. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalysis; Chlorine compounds; Optimization; Soils; Substitution reactions; Vaporization; Volatile organic compounds; 1,3-dichloropropene; Nucleophilic substitution reactions; Soil columns; Thiourea; Air pollution; 1,3 dichloropropene; thiourea derivative; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; Air pollution; Catalysis; Chlorine compounds; Optimization; Soils; Substitution reactions; Vaporization; Volatile organic compounds; fumigant; soil column; soil emission; soil surface; surface layer; volatile organic compound; volatilization; agriculture; air pollutant; article; crop production; halogenation; kinetics; pollution control; soil treatment; United States; Allyl Compounds; Catalysis; Soil; Thiourea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645757570

The novel correlation of Cali-Cali-CX (Cali for aliphatic carbons, CX for any carbon) reduces measurement time by an order of magnitude without sacrificing digital resolution.

We use the concept of intake fraction, defined as the fraction of material or its precursor released from a source that is eventually inhaled or ingested by a population. We select 29 power-plant sites throughout China and estimate annual average intake fractions at each site, using identical source characteristics to isolate the influence of geographic location. In addition, we develop regression models to interpret the intake fraction values and allow for extrapolation to other sites. To model the concentration increase due to emissions from selected power plants, we used a detailed long-range atmospheric dispersion model, CALPUFF. Primary fine particles have the highest average intake fraction (1 × 10- 5), followed by sulfur dioxide (5 × 10- 6), sulfate from sulfur dioxide (4 × 10 - 6), and nitrate from nitrogen oxides (4 × 10- 6). For all pollutants, the intake fractions span approximately an order of magnitude across sites. In the regression analysis, the independent variables are meteorological proxies (such as climate region and precipitation) and population at various distances from the source. We find that population terms can explain a substantial percentage of variability in the intake fraction for all pollutants (R2 between 0.86 and 0.95 across pollutants), with a significant modifying influence of meteorological regime. Near-source population is more important for primary coarse particles while population at medium to long distance is more important for primary fine particles and secondary particles. A significant portion of intake fraction (especially for secondary particles and primary fine particles) occurs beyond 500 km of the source, emphasizing the need for detailed long-range dispersion modeling. These findings demonstrate that intake fractions for power plants in China can be estimated with reasonable precision and summarized using simple regression models.

The EU and most of the CEECs have already committed themselves to reduce by 2008-2012 their emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 8% compared to the 1990 level. This paper reports on an investigation of the potential consequences of the enlargement of the EU and of the emission reduction target set by the Kyoto Protocol on the sectoral production patterns and international trade. A comparative-static general equilibrium model was developed to examine the impacts under different scenarios. For illustrative purposes, two regions (the EU and the CEECs) and three categories of goods and services (agricultural goods, industrial goods, and services) were included. The model was calibrated by the 1998 data. The model was subsequently applied to study the effects of free trade, the mobility of factors and the environmental constraints on production and international trade in light of the enlargement of the EU. We show that in this specific context, free trade is beneficial to economic welfare and does not necessarily increase emissions of greenhouse gases. The mobility of factors also increases economic welfare, but in the case of fixed production technology it may harm the environment through more emissions of GHGs.","Environment; EU enlargement; General equilibrium model; Kyoto Protocol; Trade","emission; European Union; Kyoto Protocol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645406937

To test the hypothesis of deposition enhancement with height, an altitudinal gradient along a N-S transect from the Elbe river lowlands to the Erzgebirge summit was chosen to investigate chemical composition, elevation-related variability, temporal changes, and seasonal patterns of ion concentrations from 1993 to 2002. The following questions were to be answered: (1) Which role does orography play on the composition of precipitation?, (2) Does fog occurrence overrule the orographic influence?, (3) Are there changes in the past 10 years, and if so, why?, (4) Do relevant seasonal changes occur and why? Air streams from westerly and to a lesser degree south-easterly directions prevail. The average precipitation was ion-poor (23 μS cm-1) and acidic (pH 4.5). Sulphate still was the dominant anion (52.3-59.9 μeq L-1), while NH4+ determined the cations (41.9-62.2 μeq L -1). Ion concentrations decreased with altitude to about 735 m a.s.l. and subsequently increased. The seeder-feeder effect largely explains the chemical composition of precipitation; enhanced in winter through snow crystals. Sub-cloud scavenging does not explain the observed patterns. Fog occurrence enhanced the observed effects at higher altitudes. Deposition amounts doubled from the lowlands to the Erzgebirge summit. From 1993 to 2002, acidity decreased by about 50%, mainly due to reduced SO2-emissions. © Springer 2006.","Altitudinal gradient; Fog; Ionic balances; Seeder-feeder; Wet deposition","Ammonia; Composition; Concentration (process); Crystals; Deposition; Fog; Negative ions; pH; Positive ions; Precipitation (chemical); Scavenging; Sulfate minerals; Altitudinal gradient; Ionic balances; Seeder-feeder; Wet deposition; Air pollution; ammonia; snow; sulfate; Air pollution; Ammonia; Composition; Concentration (process); Crystals; Deposition; Fog; Negative ions; pH; Positive ions; Precipitation (chemical); Scavenging; Sulfate minerals; atmospheric pollution; elevation; precipitation (climatology); temporal variation; wet deposition; air pollution; article; chemical composition; cloud; crystal; environmental impact assessment; fog; geographic elevation; Germany; pH; precipitation; seasonal variation; time; wet deposition; winter; Central Europe; Erzgebirge Mountains; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645530388

Both macroscopic magnetization as well as 15V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements reveal that the magnetic nature of dopants has a crucial role in determining the stability of the induced long-range magnetic order. In the case of non-magnetic (Mg 2+ doping at the Ni2+ sites (S = 1), a metamagnetic transition is observed in relatively low magnetic fields. On the other hand, the magnetic order in magnetically (Co2+) doped compounds survives at much higher magnetic fields and temperatures. We attribute this feature to a significant anisotropic impurity-host magnetic interaction. The NMR measurements confirm that the staggered magnetic moments liberated next to the impurity sites, are the reason for the magnetic ordering. In addition, differences in the broadening of NMR spectra and the increase of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation in doped samples indicate an impurity-dependent character for the dominant electron-spin correlations; the latter begin to develop at rather high temperatures with respect to the antiferromagnetic phase-transition temperature. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.",,"Anisotropy; Antiferromagnetism; Correlation methods; Lead compounds; Magnetic moments; Magnetization; Metamagnetism; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Phase transitions; Thermal effects; Haldane chain compound; Macroscopic magnetization; Metamagnetic transition; Non-magnetic doping effects; Doping (additives)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646343230

During this time, the focus has largely been on tightening emissions standards for on-road vehicles and engines, particularly passenger cars and small trucks (light-duty vehicles). Light-duty vehicle emissions control grew out of research that implicated the increasing use of vehicles in the deterioration of air quality conditions in the 1950s in Southern California. Control of motor vehicle emissions began in the early 1960s with the introduction of positive crankcase ventilation, a simple approach consisting of a hose and valve that reduced the venting of uncombusted gases to the atmosphere. From that simple beginning, light-duty-vehicle emissions control evolved to today's complex regulation of fuel properties, exhaust emissions, and evaporative emissions, which require the use of sophisticated engine and emissions-control technologies. These strategies enabled per-mile-exhaust emissions of new, properly operating light-duty vehicles to decrease by 95-99% in 2004 compared with emissions of 1967 model-year vehicles. The focus of mobile-source emissions control expanded to include on-road heavy-duty engines and later nonroad engines. The broadening in regulatory attention arose from the increasing fraction of mobile-source emissions that come from sources other than light-duty vehicles and the relative lack of emissions controls on these sources. On-road heavy-duty-vehicle engines were first regulated for air pollutants in the 1970s, and engines used in off-road applications were first regulated in the mid-1990s. Over the next decade, regulations already approved for new sources will substantially reduce emissions from on-road diesel vehicles, nonroad diesel engines, and gasoline-powered nonroad engines. © 2006 by the National Academy of Sciences.

The association refuted a report by the EIA that warned that the phase-out of the additive could lead to regional imbalances between gasoline supply and demand and associated price spikes. The EIA identified four areas of impact on gasoline supply from the change: a net loss of gasoline production capacity; tight supply of ethanol and transportation capability; limited resources and permitting issues hampering suppliers' ability to get terminal facilities in place to store and blend ethanol; and some loss of supply from foreign manufacturers. To meet anticipated demand, ethanol suppliers are trucking supply to markets close to ethanol plants, which frees up rail capacity for deliveries further away. Use of MTBE as a gasoline additive will decline in the future. This decline is a direct result of Congress' failure to adopt liability reform provisions for MTBE as part of 2005's energy bill. Meanwhile, a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report sent to Congress in March 2006 suggested that corn-based ethanol would have a limited impact on reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.

A number of different systems of potential TE materials are currently under investigation by various research groups around the world, and many of these materials are reviewed in the articles in this Issue. These range from thin-film superlattlce materials to large single-crystal or polycrystalline bulk materials, and from semiconductors and semimetals to ceramic oxides. The phonon-glass/electron-crystal approach to new TE materials is presented, along with the role of solid-state crystal chemistry. Research criteria for developing new materials are highlighted.","Energy; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectricity","Ceramic materials; Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Metalloids; Optoelectronic devices; Thermal conductivity; Waste heat; Ceramic oxides; Electron-crystals; High-efficiency thermoelectric (TE) materials; Thermoelectricity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645458327
