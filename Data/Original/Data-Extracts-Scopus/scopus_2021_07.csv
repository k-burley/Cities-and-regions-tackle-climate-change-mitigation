To address this challenge, we followed the functional land management approach and assessed five soil functions: primary productivity, water regulation and purification, climate regulation, soil biodiversity and nutrient cycling. Soil, management and climate data were collected from 94 sites covering 13 countries, five climatic zones and two land-use types (arable and grassland). This dataset was analysed using the Soil Navigator, a multicriteria decision support system developed to assess the supply of the five soil functions simultaneously. Most sites scored high for two to three soil functions, demonstrating that managing for multifunctionality in soil is possible but that local constraints and trade-offs do exist. Nutrient cycling, biodiversity and climate regulation were less frequently delivered at high capacity than the other two soil functions. Using correlation and co-occurrence analyses, we also found that synergies and trade-offs between soil functions vary among climatic zones and land-use types. This study provides a new framework for monitoring soil quality at the European scale where both the supply of soil functions and their interactions are considered. Highlights: Managing and monitoring soil multifunctionality across Europe is possible. Synergies and trade-offs between soil functions exist, making it difficult to maximize the supply of all five soil functions simultaneously. Synergies and trade-offs between soil functions vary by climatic zone and land-use type. Climate regulation, biodiversity and nutrient cycling are less frequently delivered at high capacity. © 2020 The Authors.

Adopting the GIS and RS methods, we modeled how these two stressors combine to influence the future growth of the atolls and table reefs of three archipelagoes in the South China Sea (SCS), based on geomorphic and ecological zones. A large-scale survey of the coral communities in Xisha Islands in 2014, Dongsha Islands in 2014–2016 and Nansha Islands in 2007 provided zone-specific process datasets on the range of reef accretion rates. Sea surface temperature and extreme (minimum and maximum) SLR data above 1985–2005 levels by 2100 in the SCS were derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) models forced with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Our model projected that: (1) the Xisha Islands and Dongsha Islands may have a better growth status, because the reef flat biotic sparse zone may be recolonized with hard coral and become a biotic dense zone; (2) the southern Nansha Islands reefs have a risk of stopping growing due to their earlier annual bleaching years. The increasing of water depths of these reefs is stronger in the RCP with more emissions. Our approach offers insights into the best-case and worst-case impacts of two global environmental pressures on potential future reef growth under a changing climate. © 2021 by the author.

In this context, EU member states are required to develop a national strategy to achieve the required emissions reductions under the Paris Agreement and EU climate goals. Western Macedonia is a region in North-western Greece with its economy largely dominated by lignite mining, lignite-fired power plants and district heating systems. In 2019, the Greek Government set the goal of withdrawing all lignite plants by 2028, with most units being withdrawn already by 2023. This decision has had an immense socio-economic impact on the region ofWestern Macedonia. This research work reflects the current situation at the socio-economic and socio-political level in Western Macedonia and discusses the policies implemented in the context of the lignite phase-out process to ensure a just transition for households and businesses of the region. Although there is not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ blueprint for successful low-carbon transitions of high-carbon intensive regional economies, the main target of our paper is understanding the impacts, challenges and opportunities of decarbonizing Western Macedonia. © 2021 by the authors.","Challenges of decarbonisation; Delignification; Lignite phase-out; Western macedonia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111925467

It is commonly assumed that the climate–carbon cycle response to a negative CO2 emission is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the response to an equivalent positive CO2 emission. Here we test the hypothesis that this response is symmetric by forcing an Earth system model with positive and negative CO2 emission pulses of varying magnitude and applied from different climate states. Results indicate that a CO2 emission into the atmosphere is more effective at raising atmospheric CO2 than an equivalent CO2 removal is at lowering it, with the asymmetry increasing with the magnitude of the emission/removal. The findings of this study imply that offsetting positive CO2 emissions with negative emissions of the same magnitude could result in a different climate outcome than avoiding the CO2 emissions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"asymmetry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate modeling; temperature effect; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108427027

This study calculates future emissions and global temperature rises attributable to U.S. LDVs. We examine how 2021-2050 U.S. LDV cumulative emissions can be limited to 23.1 Gt CO2equiv, helping to limit global warming to less than 2 °C. We vary four vehicle life cycle parameters (transport demand, sales share of alternative fuel vehicles, vehicle material recycling rates, and vehicle lifespans) in a dynamic fleet analysis to determine annual LDV sales, scrappage, and fleet compositions. We combine these data with vehicle technology and electricity emission scenarios to calculate annual production, use, and disposal emissions attributable to U.S. LDVs. Only 3% of the 1512 modeled pathways stay within the emission limit. Cumulative emissions are most sensitive to transport demand, and the speed of fleet electrification and electricity decarbonization. Increasing production of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to 100% of sales by 2040 (at the latest) is necessary, and early retirement of internal combustion engine vehicles is beneficial. Rapid electricity decarbonization minimizes emissions from BEV use and increasingly energy-intensive vehicle production. Deploying high fuel economy vehicles can increase emissions from the production of BEV batteries and lightweight materials. Increased recycling has a small effect on these emissions because over the time period there are few postconsumer batteries and lightweight materials available for recycling. Without aggressive actions, U.S. LDVs will likely exceed the cumulative emissions budget by 2039 and contribute a further 0.02 °C to global warming by 2050, 2.7% of the remaining global 2 °C budget. © 2021 American Chemical Society","climate change; electric vehicles; electricity decarbonization; fossil fuels; transportation","Automobile materials; Battery electric vehicles; Budget control; Decarbonization; Electronic Waste; Fleet operations; Fuel economy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Light weight vehicles; Recycling; Sales; Secondary batteries; Alternative fuel vehicles; Cumulative emissions; Global temperatures; Increasing production; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Light duty vehicles; Lightweight materials; Vehicle technology; Gas emissions; alternative fuel; climate change; climate effect; electrification; emission control; greenhouse gas; reduction; traffic emission; Article; atmospheric transport; carbon footprint; carbonization; climate change; combustion; electricity; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; life cycle; motor vehicle; recycling; United States; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; technology; United States; Electricity; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Motor Vehicles; Technology; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108528139

This industry contributes 23.96% of global CO2 emissions. In this research, an ecological network input–output interval fuzzy linear programming (EIFP) method is developed to clarify CO2 reduction responsibilities and depict transfer relationships of transportation. This method integrates input– output analysis (IOA), inexact rough interval fuzzy linear programming (IRFLP) and ecological network analysis (ENA) into a general framework. The proposed method is employed for calculating inter-provincial CO2 transfer under different situations in 30 provinces of China and further supporting the formulation of regional reduction policies. Results demonstrate that transportation energy demand of Beijing is dependent on imports, which indirectly increases CO2 reduction pressure in energy supply areas. Therefore, CO2 reduction responsibility should be traced to source and included in emission reduction plan of energy demand areas. In inter-provincial CO2 transfer relationships of natural gas, positive relationships account for a higher proportion; therefore, it is feasible to consider raising the proportion of natural gas in the future development direction of transportation.

As known, autoignition behavior of DF mixtures plays a significant role in controlling the ignition timing and combustion performance in engines. In the present study, ignition delay time (IDT) measurements of methane/diesel mixtures with three varying diesel substitution ratios (denoted as DSR30, DSR50, and DSR70) were conducted on both a heated rapid compression machine and a heated shock tube under wide-range conditions (T = 640–1450 K, p = 6–20 bar, ϕ = 0.7, 1.0, and 2.0 in ‘air’ mixtures). Experimental results show that DF blends exhibit typical two-stage autoignition characteristics along with the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) response at the temperature region currently investigated, owing to the addition of high-reactivity diesel fuel. Moreover, both the total and first-stage IDTs decrease with the rise of pressure and equivalence ratio as well as diesel substitution ratio. Additionally, a crossover of IDTs occurs at a high temperature (~1400 K) for varying equivalence ratios, and there exists a non-linear promoting effect of diesel contents on IDTs. The simulation results performed using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism (POLIMI_1412) in conjunction with a well-validated tri-component diesel surrogate show generally good agreement with the experimental results at the current test conditions. Furthermore, species evolution assisted with brute-force sensitivity analysis was carried out to further understand the autoignition chemistry of the DF mixture, particularly the chemical interplay between methane and diesel during the low-temperature ignition processes. It is found that methane hardly generates OH radicals, which are mainly produced via the low-temperature oxidation pathways of diesel fuel. The competition between methane and diesel for OH radicals inhibits the consumption of diesel while promotes the depletion of methane, resulting in an inhibiting impact on the overall reactivity of the reaction system. What's more, the experimental data reported herein provide a foundation for the development of DF kinetic models with high accuracy and robustness. © 2021 The Combustion Institute","Chemical kinetics; Diesel fuel; Dual-fuel mixture; Ignition delay time; Methane","Chemical analysis; Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Emission control; Free radicals; Fuels; Ignition; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Methane; Mixtures; Sensitivity analysis; Shock tubes; Temperature; Auto-ignition; Dual-fuel mixture; Dual-fuels; Elevated pressure; Equivalence ratios; Fuel mixtures; Ignition delay time; Kinetic models; Measurement model; OH radical; Reaction kinetics; diesel fuel; hydroxyl radical; lignite; methane; polycarbonate; Article; boundary layer; chemical composition; chemical reaction kinetics; chemoluminescence; controlled study; low temperature; oxidation; priority journal; rate constant; temperature; vapor pressure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102335337

While climate warming is known to greatly impact alpine ecosystems, the gas exchange responses at the leaf and community levels to climate warming in alpine meadow ecosystems remain unclear. In this study, the alpine grass, Elymus nutans, and forb, Potentilla anserina, were grown in open-top chambers (OTCs) for 3 consecutive years to evaluate their response to warming. Gas exchange measurements were used to assess the effects of in-situ warming on leaf- and community-level photosynthetic carbon assimilation based on leaf photosynthetic physiological parameters. We introduced a means of up-scaling photosynthetic measurements from the leaf level to the community level based on six easily measurable parameters, including leaf net photosynthetic rate, fresh leaf mass per unit leaf area, fresh weight of all plant leaves in the community, the percentage of healthy leaves, the percentage of received effective light by leaves in the community, and community coverage. The community-level photosynthetic carbon assimilation and productivity all increased with warming, and the net photosynthetic rate at the leaf level was significantly higher than at the community level. Under elevated temperature, the net photosynthetic rate of E. nutans decreased, while that of P. anserina increased. These results indicated that climate warming may significantly influence plant carbon assimilation, which could alter alpine meadow community composition in the future. © Copyright © 2021 Zhou, Su, Wu, Shi and Ding.","alpine meadow; climate warming; photosynthesis; plant communities; up-scaling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111075523

However, the high risk of deficiency or depletion of EVs battery energy during driving rather constrains the EVs development. It is hence necessary to investigate the reasonable path planning of EVs, which can not only be beneficial to reduce the users' mileage anxiety caused by inadequate energy amount, but also improve the road resource utilization and alienate traffic congestion, thus enhancing energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, the current EVs path planning technologies are investigated thoroughly. The current EV path planning problem is usually based on the traffic state when the user puts forward the planning request. The traffic environment varies dynamically, however, which could be much different after driving a while and the driving path should be changed in real-time along with the varied EVs SOC. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the dynamic path planning of EVs considering real-time traffic environment variation and EV battery consumption comprehensively. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Dynamic Path Planning; Electric Vehicles; Energy Consumption Modelling; Traffic Information","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Motion planning; Secondary batteries; Traffic congestion; Battery energy; Dynamic path planning; Electric vehicle batteries; Energy; Energy conservation and environmental protections; Energy consumption model; Traffic environment; Traffic information; Vehicle development; Vehicle path planning; Electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117342671

The existing forest mortality models for Larch (Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii) forest, which plays key roles in maintaining forest ecosystem functions and reducing atmospheric carbon concentration through the sequestration, are based on the traditional modeling methods, and these models do not account for the effects of climate on the forest mortality. Developing climate sensitive mortality models are useful for formulating effective forest management strategies in the context of climate change. We developed the diameter class mortality models using the data of 102 temporary sample plots distributed across the Guandi Mountain National Forest Park and Wutai Mountain Boqiang State-owned Forest Farm in the Shanxi Province of northern China. Four commonly used mortality functions were used to fit the data. Among many climatic and dendrometric variables evaluated, number of trees per diameter class (NC), mean annual precipitation (MAP); median diameter class (MDC), and mean temperature difference (DT) contributed significantly highly to the mortality variations. Then, these variables were selected as predictors to develop the two-level nonlinear mixed-effects mortality models applicable to the diameter class levels. The random effects at the levels of both the sample plots and stands with different site quality (blocks) were taken into account to build the models. Compared to other three models derived from the Poisson; Zero-inflated Poisson; Hurdle Poisson functions, the two-level Logistic mixed-effects mortality model better explained the effects of climate variables on the forest mortality of Larch. Tree mortality increased with increasing NC and MAP, however, MDC and DT had the opposite effects with diameter class increasing. Modeling the random effects at the block-level alone led to significantly high correlations among the residuals, and correlations were significantly reduced when the random effects were modeled at both the block- and sample plot-levels. Excessive rain during the growing season decreased the rate of tree mortality, especially for diameter classes with high number of trees. Findings from this study can be combined with the knowledge of the adaptive management to reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with forest management decision. © 2021","Basic model; Climate change; Forest management; Mixed-effects modeling; Stand mortality","Climate change; Climate models; Decision making; Ecosystems; Random processes; Value engineering; Basic model; Diameter class; Mean annual precipitation; Mixed effects; Mixed effects models; Mortality model; Northern China; Number of trees; Random effects; Stand mortality; Forestry; air temperature; atmospheric gas; carbon sequestration; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; decision making; diameter; ecosystem function; forest ecosystem; forest management; growth rate; mortality; national park; precipitation (climatology); Decision Making; Diameter; Ecosystems; Forest Management; Forestry; Models; Mortality; Random Processes; China; Shanxi; Wutai Mountain; Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110457203

The present 12-month field trial aimed to: (1) investigate the responses of the seasonal variations in soil N2O emissions and environmental factors, including soil temperature and moisture content, concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3−-N, water-soluble organic N (WSON), microbial biomass N (MBN), water-soluble organic C (WSOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC), and urease and protease activities, to application of BF, chemical fertilizer (CF) and a mixture of BF and CF (BCF) within a Moso bamboo plantation, and (2) reveal contributions of variation in soil properties to change in soil N2O emissions. The fertilized treatments matched doses of N, P and K among BF, CF and BCF, with an unfertilized treatment as a control. Compared to the control, BF treatment decreased soil N2O emissions (P &lt; 0.05), whereas treatments of CF and BCF enhanced soil N2O emissions (P &lt; 0.05). Soil N2O emissions were predominantly related to the soil temperature (P &lt; 0.01), and correlated with soil WSON concentration and soil urease and protease activities in all fertilized treatments (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, BF treatment markedly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced soil WSON concentration, as well as soil urease and protease activities, whereas the CF and BCF treatments enhanced them (P &lt; 0.05). Results of structural equation modelling indicated that the mechanisms by which BF decreased soil N2O emissions within the subtropical Moso bamboo plantation was via lowering WSON concentration and N-cycling enzyme activity in soils.

It is of great importance to assess the frequency of urban air pollution occurrence and its influencing factors. The objective of our study is to develop consistent methodologies for constructing an index system and for assessing the influencing factors of the urban air pollution occurrence based on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework by incorporating spatial analysis, geographical detector, and geographically weighted regression models. The 27 influencing factors were selected for assessing their influences on the urban air pollution occurrence in 337 Chinese cities. The results indicate that the spatial pattern of the urban air pollution in China was mostly consistent with the Chinese population-based Hu Line. Urban air pollution frequently occurred in North China, Central China, Northeast China, and East China, and displayed strong seasonality. The influencing factors of urban air pollution were complex and diverse, varying from season to season. Influencing factor analysis also shows that the explanatory power between any two influencing factors was greater than that of a single influencing factor of the urban air pollution. Furthermore, most influencing factors had both positive and negative effects and local effects on urban air pollution. Finally, we put forward five suggestions on reducing urban air pollution occurrence, which can provide the basis and reference for the government to make policies on urban air pollution control in China.

This is especially important considering that the global building stock is expected to rapidly expand in the years to come. In this study, a global-scale modeling framework is developed to analyze the evolution of building energy intensity per floor area during 1971–2014, its relationship with economic development, and its future role in energy savings across 21 world regions by 2060. Results show that, for residential buildings, while most high-income and upper-middle-income regions see decreasing energy intensities and strong decoupling from economic development, the potential for further efficiency improvement is limited in the absence of significant socioeconomic and technological shifts. Lower-middle-income regions, often overlooked in analyses, will see large potential future residential energy savings from energy intensity reductions. Harnessing this potential will include, among other policies, stricter building efficiency standards in new construction. For the commercial sector, during 1971–2014, the energy intensity was reduced by 50% in high-income regions but increased by 193% and 44% in upper-middle and lower-middle-income regions, respectively. Given the large energy intensity reduction potential and rapid floor area growth, commercial buildings are increasingly important for energy saving in the future. © 2021 The Author(s)","Decoupling; Energy intensity; Global building sector; Integrated assessment model; LMDI; Scenario analysis","Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Historic preservation; Housing; Office buildings; Decouplings; Energy savings; Energy intensity; Energy-savings; Global building sector; Integrated assessment modelling; LMDI; Middle incomes; Scenarios analysis; Floors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104910819

The empirical results verify that the pressure to reach economic growth targets in these regions reduces the level of residents' health. Moreover, the effect in developing regions is significantly stronger than that in developed regions, and the effect in the northern region is significantly stronger than that in the southern region. The mediation effects test found that the pressure to reach economic growth targets has led to an upsurge in PM2.5 concentration and an increase in the output of industrial solid waste, thereby threatening residents' health. The regulatory effects model highlights that enhancing public awareness could weaken the negative impact of the pressure to reach economic growth targets on residents' health, while the expansion of industrial production will aggravate the negative impact. In the process of economic growth, the government should set reasonable economic growth targets, pay attention to the construction of the environmental protection legal system, implement energy- conservation and emission reduction measures and increase public awareness of environmental protection to ensure residents' health. © Copyright © 2021 Zhong, Wang, Ji, Zeng and Wei.","economic goal pressure; environmental pollution; heterogeneity; mechanism; residents' health","China; economic development; environmental protection; epidemiology; government; human; motivation; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Goals; Government; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112595565

These threats are strongly linked through the short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs); ozone (O3), aerosols, and methane (CH4). Understanding the impacts of ambitious SLCF mitigation in different source emission sectors on planetary health indicators can help prioritize international air pollution control strategies. A global Earth system model is applied to quantify the impacts of idealized 50% sustained reductions in year 2005 emissions in the eight largest global anthropogenic source sectors on the SLCFs and three indicators of planetary health: global mean surface air temperature change (∆GSAT), avoided PM2.5-related premature mortalities and gross primary productivity (GPP). The model represents fully coupled atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, land ecosystems and climate, and includes dynamic CH4. Avoided global warming is modest, with largest impacts from 50% cuts in domestic (−0.085 K), agriculture (−0.034 K), and waste/landfill (−0.033 K). The 50% cuts in energy, domestic, and agriculture sector emissions offer the largest opportunities to mitigate global PM2.5-related health risk at around 5%–7% each. Such small global impacts underline the challenges ahead in achieving the World Health Organization aspirational goal of a 2/3 reduction in the number of deaths from air pollution by 2030. Uncertainty due to natural climate variability in PM2.5 is an important underplayed dimension in global health risk assessment that can vastly exceed uncertainty due to the concentration-response functions at the large regional scale. Globally, cuts to agriculture and domestic sector emissions are the most attractive targets to achieve climate and health co-benefits through SLCF mitigation. © 2021. The Authors.

The unit N surplus exhibited a downward trend and the unit P surplus showed an increasing trend. Significant correlations existed between planting areas and nutrient surplus. The N and P surplus layout was mainly concentrated in the West Liaohe River lower reaches basin. The planting area of wheat must be reduced and the areas of maize and soybean must be controlled to adjust the N and P balance and reduce the environmental pollution risk. Chemical fertilizer and seed inputs are the main sources of N input. Furthermore, combining farming and pastoral farming is conducive to improving N and P use efficiency.

To improve the environmental quality and sustainable development of transportation infrastructure, it is important to implement sustainable strategies in pavement construction and rehabilitation. The use of recycled materials is a key element in generating sustainable pavement designs to save natural resources, reduce energy, greenhouse gas emissions, and costs. The objective of this study was to propose a methodology for assessing the environmental and economic life-cycle benefits when using recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) materials in highway projects. Previous studies on life cycle analysis (LCA) using RAP focused on the economics and/or environmental impacts during the material production process. Thus, there is a need to consider sustainability analysis at all stages of construction and rehabilitation during the performance period of pavement structures. This study addresses this need with the proposed methodology. The suggested approach could be potentially implemented in a pavement management system (PMS) so as to introduce sustainability principles in optimizing alternative rehabilitation strategies. The methodology includes various steps for the analysis, starting with condition assessment of the existing highway, identifying alternative structural pavement designs, predicting service life, setting up alternative rehabilitation strategies, and conducting life cycle environmental and economic analysis. To demonstrate the value of the methodology, a comparative parametric study was conducted on two real case study projects representing actual field conditions for primary roads in Maryland. These case studies were used in order to quantify the economic savings and environmental benefits of using different levels of RAP in highway rehabilitation. The results of the analysis indicate that incorporating RAP in pavement rehabilitation can contribute substantially to cost savings and environmental impact reduction (e.g., greenhouse gas emission, energy, water, and hazardous waste). The benefits illustrated in this study are expected to encourage wide adoption of the proposed methodology and the use of recycled materials in highway construction and rehabilitation. The methodology is transferable where similar materials and highway construction techniques are used. © 2021 by the authors.

Though the refined maximum likelihood (RML) algorithm can be directly applied to low angle estimation in MIMO radar, its computational burden is huge due to the large virtual aperture. Moreover, the conventional MIMO radar employs full waveform diversity, which actually sacrifices the emission gain. To reduce the computational burden and improve the transmit gain, a reduced-dimension RML method for transmit beamspace-based (TB-based) MIMO radar is developed. Firstly, the transmit beamspace (TB) matrix is designed to focus the transmit energy within the desired spatial sector. Then, to reduce the computational complexity and retain the estimation precision of the direct RML (D-RML) method for TB-based MIMO radar, a transmit-receive separate RML (TRS-RML) method is developed by applying the RML algorithm to the transmit and receive side respectively. Moreover, we propose to fuse the estimation results of the transmit and receive side together to improve the estimation precision. Theoretical analysis shows the TRS-RML method requires much lower computational burden than D-RML method. Numerical experiments show the proposed method has higher estimation accuracy compared with the D-RML method for the conventional MIMO radar in most angle region. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Low angle estimation; Multipath effect; Multiple-input multiple-output radar; Refined maximum likelihood algorithm; Transmit beamspace","Maximum likelihood estimation; MIMO systems; Numerical methods; Radar signal processing; Angle estimation; Computational burden; Estimation precision; Estimation results; Full-waveforms; Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radars; Numerical experiments; Virtual apertures; MIMO radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104629517

However, producing biomass-based SAFs may induce changes in global land use and the associated carbon stock. The induced land use change (ILUC) emissions, as a part of the full life-cycle emissions for SAF pathways, will affect whether and to what extent SAFs reduce emissions compared with petroleum-based jet fuels. Here, we estimate the ILUC emission intensity for seventeen SAF pathways considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), covering five ASTM-certified technologies, nine biomass-based feedstocks, and four geographical regions. We introduce the SAF pathways into a well-established computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, GTAP-BIO, and its coupled emission accounting model, AEZ-EF, to study economy-wide implications of SAF production and estimate ILUC emissions intensity for each pathway. The estimated SAF ILUC emission intensities, using a 25-year amortization period, range from −58.5 g CO2e MJ−1 for the USA miscanthus alcohol (isobutanol)-to-jet (ATJ) pathway to 34.6 g CO2e MJ−1 for the Malaysia &amp; Indonesia palm oil Hydrotreated Esters of Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. Notably, the vegetable oil pathways tend to have higher ILUC emission intensities due to their linkage to palm expansion and peatland oxidation in Southeast Asia. The cellulosic pathways studied provide negative ILUC emissions, mainly driven by the high carbon sequestrations in crop biomass and soil. Using the core life-cycle emissions established by ICAO, we show that fifteen of the assessed pathways have a lower full life-cycle emission intensity than petroleum-based jet fuels (89 g CO2e MJ−1), offering promising options to reduce aviation emissions. © 2021 The Authors","Aviation biofuel; CORSIA; Emission; GTAP; Land use change; LCA","Aviation; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Fatty acids; Gasoline; Geographical regions; Jet fuel; Life cycle; Palm oil; Aviation biofuel; Aviation fuel; Aviation industry; CORSIA; Emission; Emissions intensity; GTAP; International Civil Aviation Organization; Landuse change; Life cycle emissions; Land use; alcohol; biofuel; carbon; carbon dioxide; cellulose; ester; fatty acid; isobutanol; palm oil; petroleum; sustainable aviation biofuel; unclassified drug; vegetable oil; biofuel; petroleum; air transportation; biofuel; biomass burning; carbon sequestration; cellulose; emission control; emission inventory; land use change; peatland; Article; aviation; biogeographic region; biomass; carbon sequestration; controlled study; crop; Indonesia; induced land use change emission; land use; life cycle; Malaysia; nonhuman; oxidation; peatland; soil; Southeast Asia; United States; Indonesia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia; Miscanthus; Aviation; Biofuels; Indonesia; Malaysia; Petroleum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102635494

Hence, the evaluation of soil health (SH) should comprehensively take soil productivity and ecological environmental effects into account. In this study, five functions from the perspective of functional soil management were summarized, including primary productivity, provision and cycling of nutrients, the provision of functional and intrinsic biodiversity, water purification and regulation, and carbon sequestration and regulation. For each soil function, in view of the natural and ameliorable conditions affecting SH, basic indicators were selected from the two aspects of inherent and dynamic properties, and restrictive indicators were chosen considering the external properties or environmental elements, with the minimum limiting factor method coupled with weighted linear model. The new evaluation system was tested and verified in Yixing City, China. The healthy and optimally functional soils were concentrated in the northeast and mid-west of Yixing City, whereas unhealthy soils were predominant in the south and around Taihu Lake. The main limitations to SH improvement included cation exchange capacity, nutrient elements, and soluble carbon. The SH evaluation method was verified using the crop performance validation method, and a positive correlation was noted between food production stability index and soil health index, indicating that the evaluation system is reasonable. © 2021 by the authors.

This study analyzed the factors that improved the air quality in cities in the Guanzhong region of China–in terms of meteorology and controlling emissions–following the implementation of the “Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control” in 2013. The average air quality index (AQI) values, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, and NO2 in these cities in 2020 decreased by 45.1%, 43.8%, 82.9%, 57.3%, and 31.6%, respectively, compared to the values in 2014, while the O3 concentration increased by 16.7%. During the COVID-19 pandemic of February to May 2020, lockdown measures in cities in Guanzhong resulted in reductions of approximately 18.4%, 24.2%, and 17.9% in the AQI, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations compared to the same period in 2019. Principal component analysis showed that the yearly reduction in AQI in cities in Guanzhong was attributed mainly to reductions in industrial emissions, followed by reductions in emissions from homes and motor vehicle exhausts. We propose the strengthening of measures to control particulate matter, O3 and greenhouse gas to see the improvement of air quality among this region in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality improvement; Cities in Guanzhong; COVID-19 pandemic; Emission reductions; Meteorological factors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107872662

Using the provincial panel data in China from 2000 to 2017, this work investigated the aggregate effects of low-emission electricity. The results showed that 1) when the ratio of low-emission electricity to total electricity increases by 1%, the GDP per capita will increase by 0.16% and CO2 emissions will decrease by 0.848%. In other words, low-emission electricity can achieve the goal of low-carbon economic development; 2) the self-supply of low-emission electricity, rather than trade and efficiency, is the main reason for China’s boosted economic growth; and 3) low-emission electricity increases the regional economic gap in China. The effects of pollution inhibition and economic promotion on low-emission electricity in developed areas are significantly greater than those in less developed areas. Thus, the low-emission electricity policy in China should benefit the economy and avoid the excessive economic gap among regions. Policymakers should vigorously promote the low-emission electricity revolution and pay attention to the inclination of energy policy to the central and western regions. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Chen and Wang.","balance of development; CO2 emissions; economic growth; low-emission energy; regional heterogeneity","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Regional planning; CO2 emission reduction; Economic growths; Electricity policy; Low carbon energies; Low-carbon economic; Policy makers; Regional economic; Western region; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111943913

To achieve emission targets in the YREB region, it is essential to identify the driving forces of its CO2 emissions. However, existing studies are not very refined and only examine the overall effects of drivers on CO2 emission changes, while neglecting the sub-regional and sectoral level effects across China. More refined research, therefore, will provide better-targeted policies for emission reduction relevant to regional levels such as the YREB region. Towards this end, this paper integrates the methods of structural decomposition analysis and attribution analysis to demonstrate the driving forces, at both sub-regional and sectoral levels, for YREB's emission changes from 2002 to 2012. Our results reveal the following: (1) Jiangsu Province has always been the main regional source of increasing CO2 emissions in the YREB, accounting for more than 20% of total CO2 emission growth. (2) The Electricity and Heat Production and Supply sector is responsible for most of the increases in CO2 emissions, both in 2002–2007 (609.8 Mt, 54.8%) and 2007–2012 (287.6 Mt, 34%). (3) During the period of 2007–2012, changes in per capita final demand were the primary driving force for the increases in CO2 emissions, while changes in CO2 emission intensity were the largest driving force for decreasing CO2 emissions, respectively accounting for 179.9% and −119.4% of total emission changes in the YREB region. (4) Moreover, the effect of emission intensity mainly exists in the Electricity and Heat Production and Supply sector in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, accounting for respectively, 10% and 10.4% of the total effects across all economic sectors. Considering the diverse impacts of driving forces in different sub-regions and economic sectors, policymakers should apply more refined measures to utilize varying driving forces in different sub-regions and economic sectors towards sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attribution analysis; China; CO2 emissions; Socio-economic drivers; Structural decomposition analysis; Yangtze river economic belt","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; Article; carbon footprint; China; economic development; electricity; energy consumption; environmental policy; shipping; statistical analysis; sustainable development; thermogenesis; Yangtze river economic belt; China; river; socioeconomics; China; Jiangsu; Yangtze River; Zhejiang; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Rivers; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105273008

In this work, we report changes in the chemical components of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at four NCP sampling sites from 2012/2013 to 2017 to investigate the impacts and drivers of the Clean Air Action on aerosol chemistry, especially for secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA). During the observation period, the concentrations of PM2.5 and its chemical components (especially SIA, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC)) and the frequency of polluted days (daily PM2.5 concentration ≥ 75 μg m−3) in the NCP, declined significantly at all four sites. Asynchronized reduction in SIA components (large decreases in SO42− with stable or even increased NO3− and NH4+) was observed in urban Beijing, revealing a shift of the primary form of SIA, which suggested the fractions of NO3− increased more rapidly than SO42− during PM2.5 pollution episodes, especially in 2016 and 2017. In addition, unexpected increases in the sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) and the nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) were observed among sites and across years in the substantially decreased PM2.5 levels. They were largely determined by secondary aerosol precursors (i.e. decreased SO2 and NO2), photochemical oxidants (e.g. increased O3), temperature, and relative humidity via gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions. Our results not only highlight the effectiveness of the Action Plan for improving air quality in the NCP, but also suggest an increasing importance of SIA in determining PM2.5 concentration and composition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution mitigation; Ammonium; Chemical components; Nitrate; Sulfate","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric humidity; Organic carbon; Sulfur compounds; Air pollution mitigation; Ammonium; Chemical component; Chinese Government; Clean air; North China Plain; PM$-2.5$; Secondary inorganic aerosol; SO$-4$/$+2-$; Sulphates; Nitrates; ammonia; carbon; elemental carbon; nitrate; organic carbon; ozone; sulfate; unclassified drug; aerosol; air quality; ammonium; chemical composition; concentration (composition); nitrate; oxidation; particulate matter; sulfate; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmosphere; chemical composition; chemical reaction; China; humidity; nitrogen oxidation ratio; oxidation; particulate matter 2.5; pollution monitoring; secondary inorganic aerosol; sulfur oxidation ratio; temperature; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; China; North China Plain; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103952394

However, the effect of soil texture on aggregate development and especially the associated retention of carbon (C) derived from plant residues remains unclear for Ultisols in which abundant oxides functioning as inorganic adhesive agents are important for aggregation. Further, little is known about whether different microbial populations are responsible for the aggregation process in different-textured soils. In this study, two soils with distinctive textures (sandy loam and clay) were incubated with and without the addition of 13C-labeled Chinese fir leaves for 29 days to examine the dynamics of soil aggregates and the fate of leaf-derived C. This was done by determining the mass, total C and δ13C signatures of four aggregate size classes after 1, 7, and 29 day (d) of incubation. To analyze the role of microorganisms in aggregate formation, regular CO2 efflux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), inorganic nitrogen, hot-water-extractable polysaccharides, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) were measured to represent microbial activity, communities, and growing conditions. The results showed that sandy loam produced larger new macroaggregates (&gt;250 μm) than the clay in the first 7 d. However, differences in mean weight diameter (MWD) and the proportion of macroaggregates were not maintained by the end of the incubation. Fresh leaf-derived C incorporated into different-sized aggregates was not significantly different between the sandy loam and clay at all sampling times. The majority of retained residue-C (56% and 45% in the sandy loam and clay, respectively) was eventually stored in macroaggregate fractions (&gt;250 μm) that were extensively formed by the clustering of microaggregates and silt-and-clay between 1 and 7 d after incubation, which indicated that soil aggregation had a functional control over the occlusion of leaf residue-derived C. The MWD of the aggregates was strongly related to cumulative CO2-C, MBC, DOC, and NO3−−N in both soils (P &lt; 0.001). The biomass of bacteria and gram-positive (G + ) bacteria significantly explained the variation in MWD in the clay (P &lt; 0.001) whereas the fungi and fungal: bacterial (F:B) ratio were significantly correlated with MWD in the sandy loam (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that soil texture had a negligible effect on macroaggregate formation and leaf-derived C incorporation into aggregates in this short-term incubation experiment.

The numerical experiments were performed from 3 to 16 February in 2019 and in 2020, during which a severe fog–haze event (3–16 February 2020) occurred in the BTH region, with a simulated maximum daily PM2.5 of 245 μg m−3 in Tangshan and 175 μg m−3 in Beijing. The results indicate that the daily PM2.5 decreased by 5–150 μg m−3 due to the emissions reduction and increased by 10–175 μg m−3 due to the meteorological condition in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Handan, Hengshui, Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Tangshan from 7 to 14 February. For the horizontal distribution, PM2.5 and different aerosol species concentrations from 7 to 14 February 2020 increased compared with those during the same period in 2019, indicating that the accumulation of pollutants caused by the unfavorable meteorological condition offset the decreases caused by the emissions reduction, leading to the high aerosol concentration during the COVID-19 lockdown. 摘要 本研究从气象条件和减排两方面探讨了COVID-19封锁期间严重雾霾发生的原因[研究目的], 并定量的分析了气象条件和减排对PM2.5浓度的相对影响[创新点].使用WRF-Chem在2019年2月3日–16日和2020年2月3日–16日进行了三个数值模拟试验, 分别为2019年气象场与MEIC-2019 (2019年中国多分辨率月度排放清单), 2020年气象场与MEIC-2019,2020年气象场与MEIC-2020[研究方法].结果表明COVID-19封锁期间严重雾霾的原因是不利气象条件增加的PM2.5浓度大于减排减少的PM2.5浓度[重要结论]. © 2020","Emissions reduction; Meteorological condition; PM2.5; PM2.5 ; WRF-Chem; WRF-Chem ; 关键词:; 减排; 气象条件","aerosol; concentration (composition); COVID-19; emission control; fog; haze; meteorology; particulate matter; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101689013

They established the VSPbin emission rate database and emission factor list of typical urban Taxis in the built-up area based on the actual driving characteristics of Tangshan city. To analyze the driving conditions of taxis in Tangshan City, this study selected four operating conditions: acceleration, constant speed, deceleration, and idle. The research results showed that as the emission standards became increasingly strict, the emission of single-vehicle pollutants decreased, and in particular NOx emissions were reduced by more than 90%. Compared with gasoline fuel, CNG fuel taxis' CO2 and NOx emissions showed a downward trend. When natural gas was used as fuel, the CO emissions of taxis could be reduced by 27.2% ∼ 92.0%, and the CO2 emissions by 19. 5% ∼ 32.1%. The CO and CO2 emission factors of taxis both decrease with the increase of speed. For particulate matter, the quantity and quality emission factors both decrease first and then increase with the increase of speed, and the rising speed is obviously accelerated during the high-speed phase. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Compressed natural gas; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Planning; Speed; Taxicabs; Driving characteristics; Driving conditions; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Emission standard; Operating condition; Particulate Matter; Research results; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112754568

Herein, a simple and green method is proposed to synthesize bamboo shavings derived porous carbon materials (BSCS) with large specific surface area and spongy-like structure. The unique porous and loose structure ensures that the electrolyte ions can be quickly transported in the electrode material during the process of charge and discharge, thus making full use of the active surface. As a result, the assembled zinc-ion hybrid capacitor (ZIHC) based on BSC4 displays a high specific capacity of 104 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and an excellent capacity retention of 106.1 % after 10000 cycles. Importantly, the solid-state ZIHC delivers high capacity of 124 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, high power density of 15221.2 W kg−1, and remarkable energy density of 197.7 Wh kg−1.

By now, little has been known about whether such alteration in plant community would generate updated soil organic carbon (SOC) conservation strategies, and thus alter SOC dynamics. Methods: To assess the temporal dynamics of SOC stock and fractions after shrub encroachment into temperate herbaceous wetlands, we measured floor litter mass, fine root biomass, and SOC stock and fractions (i.e. labile C pool I, labile C pool II, and recalcitrant C pool) across the 0–50 cm soil profile in the open wetlands and shrub islands (Betula fruticose and Salix floderusii) with different basal diameter sizes (small, 10 ~ 15 cm; medium, 15 ~ 20 cm; and large, 20 ~ 30 cm) in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. Results: Regardless of shrub species, SOC stock initially decreased after shrub expansion, but gradually recovered to the initial level of herbaceous wetlands. Moreover, SOC stock correlated positively with fine root biomass, but showed no significant relationship with floor litter mass. The responses of SOC fractions to shrub expansion mainly occurred in the surface soils (0–15 cm), despite a slight change in recalcitrant C pool in 15–50 cm layer. In the surface soils, labile C pool decreased substantially, whereas recalcitrant C pool and recalcitrant index of SOC elevated with increasing shrub sizes. Conclusions: Shrub encroachment can recover SOC pool and enhance SOC recalcitrance in temperate herbaceous wetlands, and altered fine root biomass would account for shrub encroachment-induced SOC dynamics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Altered plant composition; Betula expansion; Fine root biomass; Salix expansion; Soil carbon fraction; Soil carbon stability","conservation planning; herb; litter; plant community; shrub; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil profile; Betula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105239830

However, the role of green credit in carbon emissions reduction in China is still lacking testing. Using a set of panel data including 30 provinces and cities, this study focused on the impact of green credit on carbon dioxide emissions in China from 2006 to 2016. The empirical results indicated that green credit has a significantly negative effect on carbon dioxide emissions intensity. Furthermore, after the mechanism examination, we found that the promotion impacts of green credit on industrial structure upgrading and technological innovation are two effective channels to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Heterogeneity analysis found that there are regional differences in the effect of green credit. In the western and northeastern regions, the effect of green credit is invalid. Quantile regression results implied that the greater the carbon emissions intensity, the better the effect of green credit. Finally, a further discussion revealed there exists a nonlinear correlation between green credit and carbon dioxide emissions intensity. These findings suggest that the core measures to promote carbon emission reduction in China are to continue to expand the scale of green credit, increase the technology R&D investment of enterprises, and to vigorously develop the tertiary industry. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a transport energy model containing an elaborate transport demand model and a technology bottom-up model for detailed behavioral and technological representations was developed to investigate how electric vehicles (EVs) will penetrate the markets in the long-term and what impacts on energy consumption and emissions would emerge following EV adoption in China at the provincial level. A set of scenarios was created based on different policy interventions for the promotion of electric mobility. The results showed that subsidies for EV adoption would significantly boost the market share and foster a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, while the business-as-usual scenario would only generate a moderate influence on EV penetration. The regional differences in the emission reduction potential due to EV subsidies across the 31 provinces indicated that policy instruments for EV promotion would have significant positive effects in the developed provinces in both the capital metropolitan area and southeastern China. An economic cost analysis revealed a relatively low economic feasibility in northeastern and northwestern regions where the emission reduction potential is also lower than the national average, implying that the developing provinces in northeastern and northwestern China require greater financial assistance and the establishment of supportive policies for EV promotion. © 2021","Electric vehicle policy; Energy system; Regional disparity; Technology bottom-up model; Transport demand model","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Carbon neutrals; CO$-2$/ emission; Electric vehicle policy; Emission reduction potentials; Energy systems; Neutral targets; Regional disparities; Technology bottom-up model; Transport demand modeling; Transport sectors; Emission control; fossil fuel; bottom-up approach; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; cost analysis; economic analysis; electric vehicle; emission control; energy policy; metropolitan area; Article; carbon footprint; China; cost effectiveness analysis; economic aspect; electric vehicle; electricity; energy; energy consumption; environmental management; geographic distribution; motor vehicle; policy; traffic and transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104427095

The impact on methane production of various BW to KW mixing ratios, with and without the addition of granular activated carbon (GAC), were studied under thermophilic (55 °C) temperatures. GAC is reported to enhance methane production in such digestions through direct interspecies electron transfer. The results showed that the co-digestion of BW and KW under the 1:2 VS ratio significantly improved the biomethane potential (BMP). In the absence of GAC, an optimal BW:KW ratio was found to be 1:2, achieving a BMP of 0.76 g CH4-COD/g feed-COD. With GAC addition, the BMP increased to 0.81 g CH4-COD/g feed-COD, the lag phase in the digestion was significantly reduced, and the methane production rate increased.

In this study we provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art on GHG emission characterizations of China's urban water infrastructure with the aim of shedding light on global implications for sustainable development. We started by synthesizing a framework on GHG emissions associated with water and wastewater infrastructure. Then we analyzed the different sources of GHG emissions in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. In drinking water services, electricity consumption is the largest source of GHG emissions. A particular concern in China is the common use of secondary pumping for high-rise buildings. Optimized pressure management with an efficient pumping system should be prioritized. In wastewater services, non-CO2 emissions such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are substantial, but vary greatly depending on regional and technological differences.

The impacts of land use on greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions have been extensively studied. However, the underlying mechanisms on how soil aggregate structure, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N (TN) distributions in different soil aggregate sizes influencing carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from alpine grassland ecosystems remain largely unexplored. Methods. A microcosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of land use change on CO2 and N2O emissions from different soil aggregate fractions. Soil samples were collected from three land use types, i.e., non-grazing natural grassland (CK), grazing grassland (GG), and artificial grassland (GC) in the Bayinbuluk alpine pastureland. Soil aggregate fractionation was performed using a wet-sieving method. The variations of soil aggregate structure, SOC, and TN in different soil aggregates were measured. The fluxes of CO2 and N2O were measured by a gas chromatograph. Results. Compared to CK and GG, GC treatment significantly decreased SOC (by 24.9-45.2%) and TN (by 20.6-41.6%) across all soil aggregate sizes, and altered their distributions among soil aggregate fractions. The cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O in soil aggregate fractions in the treatments of CK and GG were 39.5-76.1% and 92.7-96.7% higher than in the GC treatment, respectively. Moreover, cumulative CO2 emissions from different soil aggregate sizes in the treatments of CK and GG followed the order of small macroaggregates (2-0.25 mm) > large macroaggregates (> 2 mm) > micro aggregates (0.25-0.053 mm) > clay +silt (< 0.053 mm), whereas it decreased with aggregate sizes decreasing in the GC treatment. Additionally, soil CO2 emissions were positively correlated with SOC andTNcontents. The highest cumulative N2O emission occurred in micro aggregates under the treatments of CK and GG, and N2O emissions among different aggregate sizes almost no significant difference under the GC treatment. Conclusions. Conversion of natural grassland to artificial grassland changed the pattern of CO2 emissions from different soil aggregate fractions by deteriorating soil aggregate structure and altering soil SOC and TN distributions. Our findings will be helpful to develop a pragmatic management strategy for mitigating GHGs emissions from alpine grassland. © 2021 Zhang et al.","Alpine grassland; CO2 and N2O emissions; Soil aggregate structure; Soil organic carbon; Total nitrogen","carbon dioxide; chlorophyll; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; alpine tundra; Article; carbon footprint; fractionation; grassland; greenhouse gas; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial diversity; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; pastureland; soil; soil microflora; soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109972526

Sowing dates serve as an effective adaptation strategy to these climate perturbations. By controlling the weather experienced by crops and influencing the number of successive crops that can be grown in a year, sowing dates can impact both individual crop yields and cropping intensities. Unfortunately, the spatiotemporally resolved crop phenology data necessary to understand sowing dates and their relationship to crop yield are only available over limited years and regions. To fill this data gap, we produce a 500 m rainfed soy (Glycine max) sowing and harvest date dataset for Mato Grosso from 2004 to 2014 using a novel time series analysis method for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery, adapted for implementation in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Our estimates reveal that soy sowing and harvest dates varied widely (about 2 months) from field to field, confirming the need for spatially resolved crop timing information. An interannual trend toward earlier sowing dates occurred independently of variations in wet season onset, and may be attributed to an improvement in logistic or economic constraints that previously hampered early sowing. As anticipated, double cropped fields in which two crops are grown in succession are planted earlier than single cropped fields. This difference shrank, however, as sowing of single cropped fields occurred closer to the wet season onset in more recent years. The analysis offers insights about sowing behavior in response to historical climate variations which could be extended to understand sowing response under climate change in Mato Grosso. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Mato Grosso; Remote sensing; Sowing date; Soy cultivation; Time series analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110161581

We herein report the first example of using copper(I)-alkynyl chemistry within an ultra-microporous MOF (CuI@UiO-66-(COOH)2) to achieve ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. The anchored CuI ions on the pore surfaces can specifically and strongly interact with C2H2 molecule through copper(I)-alkynyl π-complexation and thus rapidly adsorb large amount of C2H2 at low-pressure region, while effectively reduce CO2 uptake due to the small pore sizes. This material thus exhibits the record high C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 185 at ambient conditions, significantly higher than the previous benchmark ZJU-74a (36.5) and ATC-Cu (53.6). Theoretical calculations reveal that the unique π-complexation between CuI and C2H2 mainly contributes to the ultra-strong C2H2 binding affinity and record selectivity. The exceptional separation performance was evidenced by breakthrough experiments for C2H2/CO2 gas mixtures. This work suggests a new perspective to functionalizing MOFs with copper(I)-alkynyl chemistry for highly selective separation of C2H2 over CO2. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","acetylene capture; copper(I)-alkynyl chemistry; gas separation; porous material; π-complexation","Binding energy; Carbon dioxide; Complexation; Microporosity; Pore size; Separation; Ambient conditions; Binding affinities; Breakthrough experiment; Molecular size; Selective separation; Separation performance; Separation selectivity; Theoretical calculations; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107768727

We employed a regional chemistry model WRF-Chem to simulate air pollutants in Nanjing and compared the results to surface observations and satellite retrievals. During the JDS, air pollutant emissions from industry and transportation sectors largely decreased by 50–67% due to the short-term emission control measures such as reducing coal combustions, shutting down factories, and partially limiting traffic. Benefiting from the emission control, the simulated concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO and VOCs in Nanjing decreased by 17%, 20%, 20%, 19%, and 15% respectively, consistent with the surface and satellite observations. However, both the observed and simulated O3 increased by 3–48% during the JDS, which was mainly due to the remarkable NOx emission reduction (26%) in the downtown of Nanjing where the O3 production regime was mainly VOC-controlled. In addition, the atmospheric oxidation capacity and further the sulfur oxidation ratio, were facilitated by the elevated O3, which led to variable mitigation efficiencies of different secondary PM2.5 compositions. Our study offers an opportunity for understanding the coordinated control of PM2.5 and O3 in typical city clusters, and can provide implications for future mitigation actions. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Tang, Feng, Yan, Liao and Li.","emission control; O3; PM2.5; satellite remote sensing; WRF-Chem",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112477549

Various datasets have been applied from local to global scale to study vegetation dynamics and there is a lack of solid comparison among multiple datasets. Note that vegetation growth might shift over time and the greening and browning components over a long-time span might be masked by a linear trend. Here, we aim to monitor the long-term and nonlinear dynamics in vegetation greenness for Inner Mongolia (an important part of dryland Asia). As a useful tool that indicates vegetation greenness, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and LAI (Leaf Area Index) integrals derived from the GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI3g and the GIMMS LAI3g products are applied. During the period of 1982–2016, NDVI/LAI integrals have an overall acceptable consistency in characterizing the trends of vegetation greenness, with NDVI large/small integrals and LAI large/small integrals increase at a rate of 0.96, 1.72, 2.23, and 3.13 per decade, respectively. Inner Mongolia experienced a noticeable greening process (71% and 82% greening area in NDVI large/small integrals, 67% and 73% greening area in LAI large/small integrals), despite the fragmentally distributed browning trends in eastern and partial northern Inner Mongolia. As inferred from nonlinear trend analysis, we found the greening process is still prevalent. The browning of eastern Inner Mongolia under the linear analysis was actually transferring from browning to greening, while the greening trend in northern Inner Mongolia was changing to browning. Increased occurrences in the frequency of breakpoints after 1999 suggest that previously stable vegetation ecology is more sensitive to external disturbances such as altered climatic impact and anthropogenic intervention. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the effects of changes in N fertilization and precipitation patterns (i.e., precipitation intensity and frequency) on N2O emissions in agricultural fields are still unclear. In this study, we simulated soil N2O emission under different precipitation patterns (6 precipitation intensities, and 12 precipitation frequencies by either merging or splitting precipitation events) and N fertilization rates (low, typical, and high N fertilization) in a cornfield using the DeNitrification-DeComposition model. The model was parameterized and validated using meteorological data and N experimental measurements in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. Results showed that soil water filled pore space (WFPS) and simulated soil N2O emission increased as precipitation intensity increased. Less frequent but high intensity precipitation treatments reduced the soil WFPS by 25.2% and stimulated soil N2O emission by 45.3%, while more frequent but low intensity precipitation treatments increased soil WFPS by 9.0% and reduced soil N2O emission by 23.9%. Compared to typical N fertilization, the sensitivity of soil N2O emission to precipitation was higher under high N than low N fertilization treatments, and the response ratios were 50.0% and 40.1%, respectively.

The objectives were to compare fertilizer P and K rate recommendations, to look for opportunities to rationalize similar recommendations across state lines, and to examine challenges to the development of a cooperative regional approach to P and K recommendations. Mehlich-3 (eight states), Mehlich-1 (five states), or Lancaster (one state) extractions were the basis of plant available soil P (STP) and K (STK) assessment. Fertilizer recommendation philosophies (sufficiency, build and maintain, and/or hybrid) variation among the states might be the main reason behind such discrepancies. Although a few similarities in P and K rate recommendations were found, the different philosophies, numerical presentations, and extraction procedures drove important recommendation differences. Widespread adoption of the Mehlich-3 extraction procedure has not reduced variation in fertilizer P and K rate recommendations among the states. Instead, for states using Mehlich 3, soil test critical concentrations ranged from 30 to 75 mg P kg–1 and 60 to 175 mg K kg–1 for corn (Zea mays L.) grain and warm-season grass hay production. The adoption of uniform soil testing terminology, sample collection guidelines, extraction methods, and interpretations across common physiographic regions, soils, and state lines remains a challenge. Differences arise because of the different soil orders and properties, climate conditions, and resulting crop responses to added P and K fertilizers. Such differences in soil-test-based fertilizer P and K recommendations are state specific and highlight needs to examine the soil testing and recommendation process, make soil test results end-user friendly, and, when appropriate, standardize fundamental information used in the soil testing guidelines. © 2021 The Authors.

However, few experimental studies have be made on the anisotropic heat transfer properties of fiber reinforced composites. In this study, the anisotropic thermal conductivities of two-dimensional (2D) plain woven and twill woven carbon-fiber/epoxy composites are measured at different temperature with the one-dimensional (1D) steady-state method, transient plane source (TPS) method and transient hot wire method, respectively. The out-of-plane thermal conductivity and in-plane thermal conductivity at the temperature ranging from −45 °C to 160 °C are obtained and comparisons are made among the three methods. The results show that all the three methods can be used to measure the anisotropic thermal conductivity of fiber/epoxy woven composites. Both the out-of-plane thermal conductivity and in-plane thermal conductivity of carbon-fiber/epoxy woven composites increase with temperature, and the in-plane thermal conductivity is approximately four times as high as the out-of-plane thermal conductivity for the plain woven composites. Compared with the results of 1D steady-state method, the max deviations of TPS method and hot wire method are 18.1% and 17.1%, respectively. The sources of error that leading to the deviations are also discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anisotropic thermal conductivity; Carbon-fiber/epoxy composites; Experimental study; In-plane thermal conductivity","Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Heat transfer; Reinforcement; Thermal conductivity; Weaving; Wire; Anisotropic thermal conductivity; Carbon fiber-epoxy; Carbon fiber-epoxy composites; Experimental study; Fibre-reinforced composite; In-plane thermal conductivity; Out-of-plane; Properties of fiber; Thermal; Woven composite; Anisotropy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103644036

This study was a composting experiment involving the combination of poultry manure with plant residues (corn stalks, mushroom residues, and vegetable straw), as well as with either wheat stalk biochar (WB) or rice husk biochar (RB). The integrated effects of plant residues and biochar on NH3 loss, heavy metal (Cu, Zn, As, and Cd) stabilization, and 17β-estradiol (E2) dissipation were investigated during composting. The poultry manure co-composted with corn straw and mushroom residue showed the highest potential for E2 degradation. Biochar enhanced E2 dissipation and decreased estrogenic activity in all treatments, with RB showing a stronger effect than WB. Both biochars decreased microbial diversity and increased bacterial groups related to E2 and organic matter degradation·NH3 emission was reduced by 50–82% with 15% WB and 86–97% with 15% RB. The extractable fraction of As was reduced by 0–53% with WB and 50–84% with RB, while that of Cd was reduced by 5–28% for WB and 25–41% for RB in poultry manure compost. However, biochar showed little effect on Cu and Zn. Biochar appears to have a promotional effect and enhances the microbial degradation of E2. Specifically, the integration of corn stalks, mushroom residues, and RB in poultry manure compost had a positive effect by preventing nitrogen loss while reducing the bioavailability of heavy metals and hormones. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","17β-estradiol; Ammonia; Estrogenic activity; Heavy metal","Biochemistry; Biodegradation; Composting; Endocrinology; Fertilizers; Heavy metals; Manures; Zinc compounds; 17β-estradiol; Bio chars; Corn stalk; Estrogenic activities; NH$-3$; Oestrogens; Plant residues; Poultry manure; Rice husk biochar; Wheat stalks; Ammonia; ammonia; arsenic; biochar; cadmium; carbon; copper; estradiol; heavy metal; nitrogen; unclassified drug; zinc; ammonia; biochar; charcoal; estrogen; heavy metal; ammonia; biochar; composting; concentration (composition); estrogenic compound; heavy metal; immobilization; manure; poultry; waste management; Article; bioavailability; composting; controlled study; degradation; estrogen activity; extraction; maize; microbial community; mushroom; plant residue; plant stem; poultry manure; rice husk; vegetable; wheat; animal; manure; poultry; soil; Bacteria (microorganisms); Basidiomycota; Ammonia; Animals; Charcoal; Composting; Estrogens; Manure; Metals, Heavy; Poultry; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107693139

Thus, a material-efficient prefabricated concrete element (PCE) system was developed to incorporate construction and demolition waste as feedstock for residential building energy renovation by over-cladding the walls of old buildings. By conducting life cycle assessment and life cycle costing using the payback approach, this study aims to explore the life cycle performance of energy conservation, carbon mitigation, and cost reduction of the PCE system in three European member states: Spain, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The results show that the energy payback periods for Spain, the Netherlands, and Sweden were 20.45 years, 17.60 years, 19.95 years, respectively, and the carbon payback periods were 23.33 years, 16.78 years, and 8.58 years, respectively. However, the financial payback periods were less likely to be achieved within the building lifetime, revealing that only the Swedish case achieved a payback period within 100 years (83.59 years). Thus, circularity solutions were considered to shorten the PCE payback periods. Using secondary materials in PCE fabrication only slightly reduced the payback period. However, reusing the PCE considerably reduced the energy and carbon payback periods to less than 6 years and 11 years, respectively in all three cases. Regarding cost, reusing the PCE shortened the Swedish payback period to 29.30 years, while the Dutch and Spanish cases achieved investment payback at 42.97 years and 85.68 years, respectively. The results can be extrapolated to support the design of sustainable building elements for energy renovation in Europe. © 2021 The Authors","Building energy renovation; Construction and demolition waste; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Payback; Prefabricated concrete element","Carbon; Concretes; Construction; Cost reduction; Demolition; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Investments; Building energy renovation; Concrete elements; Construction and demolition waste; Energy; Life cycle costing; Netherlands; Payback; Payback periods; Prefabricated concrete element; Swedishs; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104760152

Here we use Greenland ice-core records of chlorine, sodium, and acidity, and global model simulations to show how tropospheric Cly has been impacted by anthropogenic emissions since the 1940s. We show that anthropogenic contribution of nonsea-salt chlorine significantly influenced total chlorine and its trends after the 1940s. The modeled regional 170% Cly increase from preindustrial to the 1970s was driven by acid displacement from sea-salt-aerosol, direct emission of hydrochloric acid (HCl) from combustion, and chemical reactions driven by anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Since the 1970s, the modeled 6% Cly decrease was caused mainly by reduced anthropogenic HCl emissions from air pollution mitigation policies. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic emissions of acidic gases and their emission control strategies have substantial impacts on Cly with implications for tropospheric oxidants, methane, and mercury. © 2021.

The CALFEWS simulation framework links the operation of state-wide, interbasin transfer projects (i.e., State Water Project, Central Valley Project) with coordinated water management strategies abstracted to the scale of irrigation/water districts. This study contributes a historic baseline (October 1996–September 2016) evaluation of the model's performance against observations, including reservoir storage, inter-basin transfers, environmental endpoints, and groundwater banking accounts.

These antecedents have forced governments to focus on saving energy and reducing emissions in this sector. To help government decision-making and facilitate energy planning for utilities, this work analyzes the energy consumption that occurs in city buildings. The information used to carry it out is publicly accessible. The study is carried out from the point of view of the population density of the cities, and these are analyzed individually. Furthermore, the area actually occupied by the city has been considered. The results are studied by inhabitant and household. The proposed method has been applied to the case of Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants. The results show that the higher the population density, the higher the energy consumption. This occurs both per inhabitant and per household. Furthermore, the consumption of electrical energy is inelastic, which is not the case with the consumption of thermal origin. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the intermittency of these variable renewable sources and the high energy requirement of carbon capture restrict their widespread deployment. These challenges are traditionally addressed independently at the grid-level, leading to conservative costs and limited operational flexibility for both systems. Here, we examine the synergistic integration of renewables and flexible carbon capture with individual fossil power plants. Renewables provide clean energy for carbon capture, while flexible carbon capture acts as a form of energy storage to counter renewable intermittency. To assess whether the benefits obtained from integration outweigh the capital cost under spatiotemporal variability of electricity markets and renewable energy, we develop a mathematical programming-based optimization framework. We decouple the design and operational decisions in a two-stage optimization strategy to efficiently solve the large-scale problem. When applied to a nationwide case study on coal plants across the US, we observe that, for futuristic carbon tax and renewable cost scenarios, it is profitable to invest in solar-assisted carbon capture for nearly one-third of the coal plants. It reduces carbon capture cost by 8.9%, and accommodates solar intermittency while avoiding the capital cost of an equivalent battery, which is 4.4 times the solar farm cost. Furthermore, the levelized cost of electricity will be less than that of new natural gas plants with overall emission reduction between 87.5 and 91%. The integrated system thereby provides a cost-effective and sustainable measure to reduce CO2 emissions and improve the operational flexibility of existing fossil-based systems for accelerating the clean energy transition of the global energy sector. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas plants; Mathematical programming; Microgrids; Natural gasoline plants; High energy requirements; Levelized cost of electricities; Operational decisions; Operational flexibility; Optimization framework; Spatiotemporal variability; Synergistic integration; Two stage optimizations; Cost reduction; alternative energy; carbon sequestration; cleaner production; emission control; future prospect; pollution tax; power plant; profitability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110832182

Two commercial diesel oils were considered as reference fuels, the first with the conventional content of biodiesel (7%), the second with an amount of 15%. Then, increasing levels of UCOME were added, on a volumetric basis (20%, 40%, 55 or 60%), to analyse the influence of biodiesel content on engine behaviour. Three part load engine operating conditions were selected for tests, measuring average engine parameters and indicated pressure diagrams. Their processing allowed to calculate the most important operating, energy and environmental engine quantities, rate of heat release and related combustion parameters. A proper management of the exhaust gas recirculation circuit, variable nozzle turbine and injection system was applied thanks to the availability of an open electronic control unit. An optimal UCOME content (40%) was identified, leading to highest values of brake thermal efficiency (with maximum increase around 5% referring to baseline fuels) and lowest levels of NOX emissions. For this blend, the analysis of combustion parameters outlined that the use of the renewable fuel corresponded to an enhanced premixed combustion phase, while reducing combustion duration. Lower local temperature levels, related to the decrease of Lower Heating Value, other local effects and biodiesel degree of unsaturation justify NOX reduction. Furthermore, soot emissions were always reduced when increasing biodiesel content, while combustion stability was not affected.

People of Jepara have been extracting the starch from its stem as the main raw material for traditional cuisine, horog-horog. Sugar palm stands can conserve soil and water. Their large stems store relatively much carbon rather than other agricultural monocot plants. Thus, sugar palm cultivation plays an important role in climate change mitigation. However, the areal of sugar palm cultivation was limited. Thus, land evaluation was needed to predict land performance over time to support sugar palm cultivation. The purposes of the present study were to identify land characteristics and their suitability for sugar palm cultivation. This research was conducted in Bangsri, Kembang, and Pakis Aji Districts. The purposive sampling method was used for the field survey. In total, there were 20 land units (9,232.17 ha) across those three districts. Furthermore, to determine land suitability for sugar palm cultivation, the matching method was applied. Thus, the data from field surveys and laboratory tests were used. The obtained results in the present study indicated that 13 land units were classified as S3 (marginal) and 7 land units were classified as N (not suitable). However, there were some limiting factors in the field that must be addressed to support sugar palm cultivation in S3, such as water availability (wa), rooting condition (rc), and nutrient retention (nr). Furthermore, in the land unit that was classified as N the main limiting factor was slope (>30%). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Soil conservation; Surveys; Climate change mitigation; Land suitability; Matching methods; Nutrient retention; Palm cultivation; Rooting conditions; Sampling method; Water availability; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112411738

Existing transmission capacity is, however, a limiting factor in expanding hydropower imports to the region. To examine the value of expanding transmission capacity from Quebec to the Northeast, we employ an integrated top-down bottom-up modeling framework (USREP-EleMod). This research was part of an Energy Modeling Forum effort, EMF34, with a goal of better characterizing linkages in energy markets across North America. The scenarios we examine exogenously expand transmission capacity by 10, 30, and 50% above existing capacity into the US Northeast (New York/New England), finding the value to the economy of these expansions ranging from $.38-$.49 per kWh imported into New York, and $.30-$.33 per kWh imported into New England by 2050. The scenarios include economy-wide emissions goals these states have set for themselves. The carbon limits we imposed raise fuel prices more than electricity prices and as a result we found greater electrification in the US Northeast region from 2030 onward, a result that one would not see using just an electricity sector model, demonstrating a main hypothesis of EMF34, that models that looked at more integration across energy markets would give deeper insight than more narrowly focused models. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-border electricity trade; Economic benefits; Low-carbon economy; Top-down bottom-up model; Transmission capacity expansion","Carbon; Costs; Hydroelectric power; Power markets; Cross-border electricity trade; Economic benefits; Energy markets; Low carbon economy; New England; New York; Northeast regions; Top-down bottom-up model; Transmission capacities; Transmission capacity expansion; Expansion; alternative energy; bottom-up approach; cost-benefit analysis; cross-border relations; electricity supply; electrification; energy market; energy planning; hydroelectric power; targeting; top-down approach; trade performance; Canada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104070449

Objectives: We aimed to transcend the existing research logic (from case studies to obtain the patterns of the cooling effect of UGI, then propose implications for UHI mitigation) and established a hypothetical idealized urban thermal security pattern model (TSPurban). Methods: Based on two basic concepts deduced from the physical property of UGI—(threshold) size and cooling distance, as well as the simplifying assumptions we defined. Then, three proposed conceptual UGI types (ecological, efficient, and elementary—3E) and subtypes were used to frame the model. Results: We deduced that the idealized TSPurban model conforms to a hierarchical hexagonal structure in theory and it can be calculated and applied, although it generally cannot be seen in the real world. Conclusions: The idealized TSPurban model can help us better-understanding UGI cooling effects when considering climate adaption planning and decision-making; it also serves as a novel pathway to study the cooling effects of UGI and mitigate the UHI effect. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate adaption planning; Hierarchical hexagonal structure; Urban green infrastructure; Urban heat island; Urban thermal security pattern","decision making; greenspace; heat island; landscape ecology; physical property; spatiotemporal analysis; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079535064

Different carbon input modes have different effects on soil carbon storage and the microbial community, but the effects of carbon input control on soil microbial diversity and community structure in temperate forests remain unclear. We used high-throughput 16SrRNA gene sequencing and ecological network analysis methods to analyze the soil bacterial community, symbiotic network, and key species of three different carbon input treatments (litter removal, root removal, litter and root removal) in temperate natural secondary forests during the freeze-thaw season and growing season. The results showed that the change in the carbon source input led to a change in the way in which soil bacteria used carbon, which was mainly manifested as follows: (1) The relative abundance of Acidobacteria, which was oligotrophic bacteria, significantly decreased in the sample plots where the root system was removed. (2) In the litter removal treatment, the abundance of bacteria with functions related to the absorption of CH4 decreased. (3) The correlation between the module characteristic genes in the bacterial network analysis and the physical and chemical properties of soil, CK modules were grouped separately, and the change in the correlation may also indicate the change in the way soil bacteria use carbon. Second, the influence of belowground roots on the soil bacterial community structure was more significant than that of aboveground litter. The root system had a greater influence on the soil bacterial community. Third, the decrease of organic carbon input reduced the stability of the soil bacterial network, and the proportion of positive connections in the bacterial network for litter removal and root treatment increased significantly, indicating that these bacterial communities had the same change trend as the fluctuation of the environment. Finally, the freeze-thaw season had a greater impact than the growing season on bacterial diversity, community structure, and function. The freeze-thaw process allowed the bacterial community to respond to root removal more significantly, and the structural changes were mainly due to changes in temperature, water content, dissolved organic carbon, and nitrate nitrogen. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Detritus input and removal treatment (DIRT); Function prediction; Keystone taxa; Litter removal; Root removal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108859860

However, the impact of such pathway on the availability of land for bioenergy crops production has not been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, previous assessments of the role bioenergy in Colombia have mostly focused on residues, in isolation of land use policies. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid statistical land balancing and suitability allocation approach to estimate long term projections of the cost–supply potential of bioenergy crops and residues. Regionalized to the 32 Colombian departments (administrative divisions), this approach could provide higher resolution than global assessments, while avoiding the complexity of spatially explicit methods. We investigated three scenarios covering the uncertainty of socioeconomic drivers and agricultural and livestock productivity factors. Our results suggest that pursuing progressive land use policies (SSP1 scenario) could release up to 14 Mha of land by 2050, which could be available to produce perennial bioenergy crops. The cumulative potential of crops in SSP1 could reach up to 2200 PJ, where about half of this potential could be attained at 7 $ GJ−1 or less. Potential supply centers could be identified in Orinoquía, Andean, and Caribbean regions for energy crops and the Pacific region for residues. Our findings indicate that there could be an opportunity to create synergy between the low carbon development strategies of the land use and energy sectors in Colombia. © 2021 The Authors","Colombia; Hybrid statistical land use analysis; National resource assessment; Regionalized biomass potential; Spatial cost supply maps","Biofuels; Biomass; Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Productivity; Bioenergy crops; Colombia; Colombians; Cost supply; Hybrid statistical land use analyse; Land use policy; National resource assessment; Regionalized biomass potential; Spatial cost supply map; Supply potential; Land use; agricultural labor; agricultural land; agroindustry; alternative agriculture; bioenergy; cost analysis; crop residue; energy conservation; energy crop; socioeconomic conditions; statistical analysis; Colombia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105700411

Long-term measurements of trace gas concentrations in urban areas can be used to quantify the impact of emission reductions on GHG mole fractions. Open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy is a non-intrusive technique that can be used to simultaneously measure multiple atmospheric trace gases in the boundary layer. This study investigates the reduction of mole fractions and mole fraction enhancements above background for surface CO, CO2, and CH4 in downtown Toronto, Canada (the fourth largest city in North America) during the 2020 and 2021 COVID-19 stay-at-home periods. Mean values obtained from these periods were compared with mean values from a reference period prior to the 2020 restrictions. Mean CO mole fraction enhancement declined by 51 ± 23% and 42 ± 24% during the 2020 and 2021 stay-at-home periods, respectively. The mean afternoon CO2 mole fraction enhancement declined by 3.9 ± 2.6 ppm (36 ± 24%) and 3.5 ± 2.8 ppm (33 ± 26%) during the stay-at-home periods in 2020 and 2021. In contrast, CH4 mole fraction enhancement did not show any significant decrease. Diurnal variation in CO during the stay-at-home period in 2020 was also significantly reduced relative to the reference period in 2020. These reductions in trace gas mole fraction enhancements coincide with the decline of local traffic during the stay-at-home periods, with an estimated reduction in CO and CO2 enhancements of 0.74 ± 0.15 ppb and 0.18 ± 0.05 ppm per percentage decrease in traffic, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the temporal and spatial characteristic of SO2, NOx, and PM emission concentrations, quantified the standard-reaching rate and air pollutant emissions factors, as well as discussed the spatial distribution and potential reduction measures of emission amounts based on the hourly online monitoring data and basic information collected from sintering head process in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) in 2017. We found that there was a downward trend of monthly emission concentrations during September to December 2017, in response to the emission control policies. By comparing with the emission standard implemented in 2017, the standard-reaching rate of PM, NOx, and SO2 were 74.7%, 23.5%, and 62.5% respectively, higher relative to the ultra-low emission standard. The emission factors of PM, NOx, and SO2 were calculated at different sintering machine scales, and were found to be lower than previous estimates. The emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM from sintering machine heads in the BTH region amounted to 14.2 kt, 143.2 kt and 46.3 kt respectively, Tangshan and Handan accounted for over 60% of the total emission amounts. The most popular technologies applied for PM and SO2 removals are electrostatic precipitators and limestone-gypsum flue gas desulfurization with an average removal efficiency of 71.8% and 90.3%.

In this period, the pace of new urbanization in China is gradually accelerating, and it is becoming a powerful engine of China's economic growth and social development. The new urbanization strategy will leverage a new round of development of the construction industry and become a new growth point of the construction industry. The traditional construction industry is at the cost of consuming a lot of natural resources and causing heavy environmental burden. As a technological innovation with innovative significance in changing the mode of production, prefabricated building is an important way of energy conservation and emission reduction, and its development prospect is very broad. However, due to the relatively deep practice of prefabricated building based on the market environment has just started, the targeted research on energy conservation and emission reduction is not sufficient or even blank. Taking a project in Shenyang City of Liaoning Province as an example, this paper establishes the calculation formula of carbon emission of concrete prefabricated and cast-in-place residential buildings by using the emission factor method, calculates and compares the differences of carbon emission of the two kinds of buildings in the production stage, transportation stage and construction stage, and puts forward the corresponding carbon reduction measures of prefabricated buildings in each stage, so as to provide a powerful reference for the healthy and rapid development of other low-carbon buildings in China theoretical basis and practical guidance of the project. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buildings; Cast in place concrete; Concrete industry; Construction industry; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Prefabricated construction; Development prospects; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Environmental burdens; Low-Carbon Buildings; Measurement and analysis; Residential building; Technological innovation; Traditional constructions; Historic preservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112447542

However, real-world emission measurements are rarely conducted for PHEV under different initial battery state-of-charge (SoC). In this study, a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) was employed to investigate the real-world emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) from a Euro V PHEV under fully and uncharged initial battery SoC. Compared to the emissions under the uncharged state, the average emission factors (EFs) of CO, NOx, and CO2 under the fully charged state are reduced by 72.2%, 27.8%, and 29.0%, respectively. And the reduction effect on the urban road is much more significantly prominent compared to that on the rural road and highway. In addition, obvious reduction effectiveness can be found for CO EFs in different average speed bins, especially those with speeds above 100 km/h. For NOx and CO2, however, the average speed-bin EFs are reduced only when the speed is below 70 km/h, while no obvious differences can be found when the speed is above 70 km/h. Furthermore, for the average vehicle specific power (VSP)-bin emission rates, obvious reduction effectiveness is observed for CO in different speed ranges, and for NOx and CO2 in the low- and medium-speed ranges except the high-speed range. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air pollution control equipment; Automotive batteries; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Charging (batteries); Conversion efficiency; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Planning; Roads and streets; Speed; Sustainable development; Vehicle performance; Battery state of charge; Emission characteristics; Emission measurement systems; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Real-world emission; Reduction effects; Road and highways; Vehicle specific power; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112750555

However, the quantitative evaluation of its impact on multiple sectors of the socioeconomic system is incomplete. Based on compiled regional input–output table of the year 2012, this study developed a method to analyze the relationships between economic activities and related meltwater withdrawal, as well as sectoral transfer. The results show that the direct meltwater withdrawal intensity (DMWI) of agriculture was much higher than other sectors, reaching 2348.02 m3 /10,000 CNY. Except for A01 (agriculture) and A02 (mining and washing of coal), the embodied meltwater withdrawal (EMW) driven by the final demand of other sectors was greater than direct meltwater withdrawal, and all sectors required inflows of virtual water (72.45 × 108 m3, accounting for 29% of total supply from cryospheric water resources) for their production processes in 2012. For sectors with high DMWI, improving water-use efficiency is an effective way to reduce water withdrawal. To some extent, the unbalanced supply of cryospheric water resources due to geographical segregation can be regulated by virtual water flows from water-saving to water-intensive sectors.

Here, we performed a first-order estimate of the CO2 consumption induced by silicate chemical weathering and organic carbon burial in subtropical China related to this climatic reorganization. Our results show that an increase in long-term CO2 consumption by silicate weathering varies from 0.06×1012 to 0.87×1012 mol yr−1 depending on erosion flux reconstructions, with an ~50% contribution of Mg-silicate weathering since the late Oligocene. The organic carbon burial flux is approximately 25% of the contemporary CO2 consumption by silicate weathering. The results highlight the significant role of weathering of the Mg-rich upper continental crust in East China, which would contribute to the rapid decline in atmospheric CO2 during the late Oligocene and the Neogene rise in the seawater Mg content. If this climatic reorganization was mainly induced by the Tibetan Plateau uplift, our study suggests that the growth of the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau can lead to indirect modification of the global carbon and magnesium cycles by changing the regional hydrological cycle in areas of East Asia that are tectonically less active. © 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon cycle; Late Oligocene; Oceanic Mg cycle; Silicate weathering; Tibetan Plateau","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon dioxide; Erosion; Magnesium compounds; Organic carbon; Silicates; Tropics; Chemical weathering; East Asian monsoon; Flux reconstruction; Hydrological cycles; Organic carbon burial; Silicate weathering; Subtropical China; Upper continental crust; Weathering; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; chemical weathering; magnesium; monsoon; Oligocene; silicate; upper crust; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107486078

China has become the world's second largest energy consumer and the largest CO2 emitter. China's total energy consumption from building operation reached 22% of the total national energy consumption, of which residential buildings accounted for about 45.7%. The proportion may further increase with the progress of urbanization and growth of population. Therefore, It is believed that the development of low-carbon housing market is important for energy conservation and emission reduction. Due to different positions and interests, low-carbon housing has not been effectively promoted by various stakeholders involved in the development of low-carbon housing in China. This paper discussd how to encourage stakeholders to accept, participate and promote the development of low-carbon housing on the base of analyzing the behavior and interest demands of all stakeholders. The paper take Guangzhou city as the case, the reaserch shows the Guangzhou goverment has issued relevant policies to encourage that real estate projects implement green building two-star or above standards, both commercial housing and affordable housing have provided low-carbon housing products nowadays, but there are only a few projects and few real estate enterprises involved. Most consumers hold a supportive attitude towards the supply of low-carbon housing products, but it is hoped that low-carbon housing can improve the living comfort without too high a price. The paper suggested that the government should improve policy design and incentive mechanism, build a quality assurance system for the whole life cycle of low-carbon housing. cooperate with real estate developers and strengthen publicity to improve the recognition of low-carbon housing in the whole society. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy conservation; Environmental protection; Housing; Planning; Population statistics; Quality assurance; Sustainable development; Building operations; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Quality assurance systems; Real estate enterprise; Real-estate projects; Residential building; Stakeholder behavior; Total energy consumption; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112759418

In order to apply evaporative cooling technology to hot and semiarid climate regions, an integrated system, which combined indirect evaporative cooling and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) technologies, was proposed. In the proposed system, cold water produced by indirect evaporative chiller (IECh) is firstly used to cool the fresh air and then used as cooling water for a water-cooled VRF system. To investigate the feasibility and its energy saving potential of the proposed system in hot and semiarid climate regions, a mathematical model was developed and a simulation program was developed. The energy performance of the system during the cooling season is evaluated in a typical office building in Turpan of China. Results show that the proposed system has a seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) of 7.48. Compared with conventional air-cooled VRF system, the proposed system can help to reduce energy consumption by approximately 35%. Therefore, it is feasible to apply the proposed system for indoor climate control in hot and semiarid climate regions with remarkable energy savings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Energy saving; Evaporative cooling; SEER; Simulation; VRF","Air conditioning; Climate models; Cooling water; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Evaporative cooling systems; Integrated control; Office buildings; Climate regions; Energy savings; Energy-savings; Evaporative cooling; Hot climate; Refrigerant flow; Seasonal energy efficiency ratios; Semi-arid climate; Simulation; Variable refrigerant flow; Evaporation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107647062

We assessed the benefits of carbon and pollution control policies on air quality and human health, with an integrated framework combining an energy-economic model, an air quality model and a concentration–response model. With a base year 2015, seven combined scenarios were developed for 2030 based on three energy scenarios and three end-of-pipe control ones. Policy-specific benefits were then evaluated, indicated by the reduced emissions, surface concentrations of major pollutants, and premature deaths between scenarios. Compared to the 2030 baseline scenario, the nationwide PM2.5- and O3-related mortality was expected to decline 23% or 289 (95% confidence interval: 220–360) thousand in the most stringent scenario, and three quarters of the avoided deaths were attributed to the end-of-pipe control measures. Provinces in heavily polluted and densely populated regions would benefit more from carbon and pollution control strategies. The population fractions with PM2.5 exposure under the national air quality standard (35 μg/m3) and WHO guideline (10 μg/m3) would be doubled from 2015 to 2030 (the most stringent scenario), while still very few people would live in areas with the WHO guideline achieved for O3 (100 μg/m3).

The industrial carbon emission efficiency (ICEE) of China is directly related to the achievement of carbon emission reduction targets. This paper reports on the use of the minimum distance (min-SBM) method to determine the ICEE of 30 provinces in China during 1998–2015, as well as the use of a spatial econometric method to investigate the convergence and influencing factors of the regional ICEE. The results indicate significant regional differences in the ICEE. The provinces with higher average values of ICEE are located in the eastern coastal areas, whereas the provinces with lower average values of ICEE are located in the central and western inland regions. The results of the spatial autocorrelation index reveal that China’s inter-provincial ICEE exhibits significant spatial autocorrelation characteristics, and its spatial distribution demonstrates a certain regularity. The local indicators of spatial association diagram further illustrate that most provinces in China have high and low agglomeration values. With the introduction of the spatial effect, the absolute and conditional convergence rates increase. In addition to the non-significant industrial structure effect, the level of economic development, foreign direct investment, technological progress, and government intervention demonstrate a positive impact on the ICEE convergence, whereas the energy consumption structure has a negative impact. This work investigates the cause for the regional gap in China’s current ICEE. Suggestions for improving the efficiency of China’s industrial carbon emissions and narrowing the regional gap are provided, which serve as a reference value for China to achieve the peak of carbon dioxide emissions before 2030. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convergence; Industrial carbon emission efficiency (ICEE); Minimum distance method to the efficient frontier; Spatial effect","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; foreign direct investment; industrial emission; industrial structure; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; industry; technology; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Industry; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102357340

This study built up a life-cycle data envelopment analysis model to inclusively measure CO2 and PM2.5 management performance of China's 30 provinces’ transport sectors during 2013–2017 using the atmospheric environmental efficiency (AEE). We showed that the PM2.5 efficiency improvement was the main driver of China's AEE increase from 0.544 in 2013 to 0.649 in 2017. The west of China exhibited the fastest growth and led the AEE since 2014; the central region also increased its AEE by 14.6% in the study period, while the east showed a negligible AEE improvement. Furthermore, the results showed that strict environmental regulation in the transport sector may cost China's economic growth. Hence, we suggest that CO2 management demands more regulatory attention, and that market-oriented regulatory mechanisms, such as integrating the transport sector into carbon and PM2.5 emission trading systems, is needed to lower cost and enhance AEE. © 2021 The Authors","Atmospheric environmental efficiency; Cost-effectiveness; Data envelopment analysis; Environmental regulation; Life-cycle assessment","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Efficiency; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Life cycle; % reductions; Air pollutants; Atmospheric environmental efficiency; CO$-2$/ emission; Cycle data; Data envelopment; Efficiency improvement; PM$-2.5$; Transport sectors; Data envelopment analysis; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; cost analysis; data envelopment analysis; economic growth; emissions trading; environmental economics; life cycle analysis; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104454421

It is unknown whether these changes are associated with changes in health conditions, especially given changes in other factors due to rapid economic growth. Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in two periods spanning more than twenty years (1993–1996 vs. 2017–2018) in four Chinese cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Lanzhou, and Guangzhou. Data were collected regarding adults’ respiratory disease, smoking status, education, occupation, and household characteristics. Ambient air pollution data were obtained for each study. We first used logistic regression models to construct the district-specific adjusted disease prevalences. In the second stage, first-difference regression models were employed to examine whether the change in respiratory diseases prevalences was associated with the change in outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution surrogates. Results: A total of 7,557 and 9,974 households were participating in Period 1 (1993–1996) and Period 2 (2017–2018), respectively. Compared to Period 1, we found substantial reductions in the ambient air pollution concentrations, and a suggestive improvement in cooking-related indoor air pollution in Period 2. We observed decreases in the district-specific covariate-adjusted prevalences of both asthma and chronic bronchitis among participants, with an average reduction of 3.6% (range: 0.0% to 24.3%). From Period 1 to Period 2, one percent decrease in the proportion of cooking with coal was associated with a 19.0% (95% CI, 0.96–37.04%) decrease in the prevalence of males’ chronic bronchitis and a 1.86% (0.69–3.04%) increase in the prevalence of females’ asthma. Little evidence was observed regarding the potential health benefits associated with the decreases in ambient air pollution levels. Conclusions: The substantial reduction in household use of coal for cooking might be an important contributor to the decrease in adults’ respiratory disease prevalence from 1993–1996 to 2017–2019 in four Chinese cities. Changes in this indoor air pollution source, along with other risk factors for respiratory diseases, may have masked respiratory health benefits associated with reductions in outdoor air pollution levels. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Here, we report a joint treatment of C60 by heating and plasma to induce a dramatic performance promotion during ECR. The electrochemical measurements indicate the Faraday efficiency for ECR toward CO production kept at high level over 80% in a wide potential region from − 0.4 to − 0.7 V versus RHE, with the highest value reaching 96.8%. The physical characterization reveals that fragmentation of C60 occurs together with N/O doping, both of which could induce change in electron structure, causing the formation of *COOH intermediate and ultimately leading to the optimized activity and selectivity for CO production. This treatment route was further revealed to be applicative for other carbon materials, e.g., single-walled carbon nanotube, to promote its ECR activity and selectivity.

Lockdown has resulted in significant air quality improvement, especially in urban regions. The lockdown has acted as a natural experiment empowering researchers, policymakers, and governing bodies. The present study focuses on quantifying and analysing the effect of lockdown on India’s metropolitan cities, namely New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bangalore. The study analyses the phase-wise and diurnal variations in the air quality from 24 March 2020 to 31 May 2020 while focussing on-peak and off-peak duration concentrations. To investigate the reason behind pollutant reduction, correlation of drop percentages in pollutant concentrations with vehicle population, extent of construction activity, and meteorological parameters are analysed. The 24-h drop in PM10 and PM2.5 showed a high correlation (R2 = 0.97 and 0.72, respectively) with the city’s vehicle population. During peak hours, the inland cities (Delhi and Bangalore), with a more extensive vehicle fleet, recorded a higher drop in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations than coastal cities (Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata). With respect to 2019 concentration, the maximum decrease in pollutant concentrations averaged across the five study locations was recorded in NO2 (46%), followed by PM2.5 (40%), PM10 (37%), and CO (19%). SO2 and O3 contrarily recorded an overall increase of 40% and 41%. These results wherein vehicular pollutants recorded the maximum drop indicate that reduced vehicular traffic primarily influenced air quality improvement during the lockdown. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Air quality; COVID-19; Metro cities; Traffic peaks hours","air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; metropolitan area; particulate matter; policy making; pollution control; traffic emission; urban pollution; Bengaluru; Chennai; Delhi; India; Karnataka; Kolkata; Maharashtra; Mumbai; New Delhi; Tamil Nadu; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110653767

As a dominant tree species in arid area, Populus euphratica plays an important ecological role in slowing desertification. Here, continuous observations of carbon, water, and energy fluxes were carried out in Populus euphratica forest with eddy covariance (EC) technique in 2018. We systematically explained the variation characteristics of energy fluxes and WUE at different time scales, and explored the main controlling factors of WUE in drought-stressed environment based on the synchronous meteorological data. Results showed that the carbon exchange of the Populus euphratica forest ecosystem occurred mainly during the growing seasons (April–October). During this period, the entire ecosystem appeared as a carbon sink with the potential to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. The average daily WUE was 2.2 g C/kg H2O, which was lower than other temperate forests (2.57–6.07 g C/kg H2O) but higher than grassland, wetland, and cropland. We also concluded that an increase in carbon dioxide concentration (CCO2) and air relative humidity (RH) could promote the increase of WUE. Nevertheless, WUE was negatively correlated with air temperature (Ta), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Additionally, WUE increased under moderate soil water content (SWC), but decreased due to the continuously rising SWC. WUE was more strongly affected by factors affecting water consumption than carbon uptake. Under the conditions of high temperature, strong radiation and low humidity in the summer, the growth rate of ET was much larger than that of GPP. This study not only contributes to our understanding of the carbon, water, and energy dynamics of the Populus euphratica forest ecosystem but also provides an important reference for ecological conservation and ecological restoration in arid regions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); evapotranspiration; forest ecosystem; primary production; water use efficiency; Populus euphratica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106432759

This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effects of monensin sodium salt (MSS) and disodium fumarate (DF) on CH4 production, rumen fermentation, and microbial community, with different substrates. The addition of MSS and DF, alone and in combination, significantly reduced the concentration and production of CH4 (p &lt; 0.05), and while with vinasse as substrate, the CH4 production was higher for forage. The highest propionate production and lowest acetate and propionic ratio (A:P) values were all observed in cultures added to the combination of 14 mmol/L DF and 80 mg/kg MSS in both substrates, suggesting that these additives improved the rumen fermentation efficiency. The diversity indexes of prokaryotic microbiota with forage as the substrate were significantly higher than vinasse, and there were different effects on diversity indexes with the addition of MSS and DF depending on the incubated substrate. Supplementation with MSS and DF increased the number of starch degradation and fumarate reducing bacteria, decreased the number of methanogens, but had no significant effect on the number of fibrolytic bacteria. pH, NH3-N, and rumen volatile fatty acids (VFA) were the main factors influencing prokaryotic community structure. In conclusion, basal substrates (forage and vinasse) and CH4 mitigation additives (MSS and DF) have interactions on the in vitro rumen fermentation and microbial composition. © 2021 by the authors.

High-throughput sequencing was integrated with functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) to decipher the bacterial structure and functions. Results show that adding cornstalks constructed a more complex and mutualistic bacterial network to enhance organic biodegradation. This scenario, however, aggravated the emission of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide with the enrichment of the genus Bacillus and Desulfitibacter at the thermophilic stage of composting to facilitate ammonification and sulphur-related respiration, respectively. By contrast, spent mushroom substrates facilitated the proliferation of the genus Pseudomonas to promote nitrate reduction at the cooling stage, leading to considerable emission of nitrous oxide. Compared to these two agents, garden waste contained less easily biodegradable substances to limit bacterial mutualism, thereby reducing gaseous emissions in composting.

Studies on global sea surface temperature (GSST) are primarily carried out under linear assumption, which is not capable of fully revealing the evolution characteristics of sea surface temperature (SST) due to the non-linear and non-stationary nature of the SST. Here, the evolution of the GSST trend in the past century is investigated by using an adaptive and local spatial–temporally multidimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition method. The results show that the global ocean has been warming except for the subpolar North Atlantic, the equatorial central Pacific, and the Southern Ocean in the Pacific sector. The equatorial central Pacific turned from cooling to warming around the middle of the last century made it one of the fastest-warming regions in recent decades with other regions located in the Arctic Ocean and the western-boundary current regions and their mid-latitude extensions in both hemispheres. The strongest warming during recent decades is found in the Arctic Ocean, east of the continents in the northern hemisphere, the entire Indian Ocean, and especially in the tropical Pacific Ocean. From a zonal average perspective, warming (>0.1 K since 1900) first took place in the subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere and 50°S of the Southern Hemisphere almost simultaneously around 1910, then followed by the subpolar warming in the Northern Hemisphere.

As birds are sensitive to environmental change, they are considered as excellent models in studies on the effects of habitat conversion interacting with climate change. A nuanced understanding of the original drivers of the community structure involves the study of beta diversity metrics of different scales related to environmental factors. In this study, we attempted to unveil the drivers of bird community structure by studying beta diversity and its partitioning components with climate warming, thereby gaining insight into avian community structure trends. A systematic survey was conducted in eight regions of the Wuyi Mountains (WMs) from 2015 to 2019. Our results showed that the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation of the WMs have been increasing in a synchronous manner for the last 30 years, while the bird community structure changed in an uneven manner. Species adopted different strategies when facing climate change and the dominant bird species alternated in the mountains with the bird community structure changing sequentially. A comprehensive analysis of bird distribution data and environmental factors showed that the bird community structure was mainly preserved by the environmental filtering process, while some regions with habitats largely different from those of the neighboring regions experienced climate-induced competitive exclusion. In an overall stable bird community in the WMs, the species were slightly affected by climate change; however, a few bird communities were sensitive to climate warming in local areas with environmental heterogeneity.

Energy retrofits of existing buildings provide an effective means to reduce building consumption and carbon footprints. A key step in retrofit planning is to predict the effect of various potential retrofits on energy consumption. Decision-makers currently look to simulation-based tools for detailed assessments of a large range of retrofit options. However, simulations often require detailed building characteristic inputs, high expertise, and extensive computational power, presenting challenges for considering portfolios of buildings or evaluating large-scale policy proposals. Data-driven methods offer an alternative approach to retrofit analysis that could be more easily applied to portfolio-wide retrofit plans. However, current applications focus heavily on evaluating past retrofits, providing little decision support for future retrofits. This paper uses data from a portfolio of 550 federal buildings and demonstrates a data-driven approach to generalizing the heterogeneous treatment effect of past retrofits to predict future savings potential for assisting retrofit planning. The main findings include the following: (1) There is high variation in the predicted savings across retrofitted buildings, (2) GSALink, a dashboard tool and fault detection system, commissioning, and HVAC investments had the highest average savings among the six actions analyzed; and (3) by targeting high savers, there is a 110–300 billion Btu improvement potential for the portfolio in site energy savings (the equivalent of 12–32% of the portfolio-total site energy consumption). © 2021 by the authors.

To reduce carbon emissions, China has established eight regional ETS since 2013 to reduce carbon emissions. However, significant heterogeneities exist across the eight pilots, resulting in distinctively different carbon price movements. Traded as a financial asset, carbon allowance is vulnerable to internal and external shocks. Though carbon prices have been fluctuating fiercely since the inception of the carbon market, little is known about potential carbon price bubbles in any of these pilots. To this end, this paper resorts to the generalized sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test, which allows the detection of multiple bubbles, as well as the date stamping of bubbles in carbon prices. For the first time, price bubbles are found in the Chinese carbon markets. The empirical results find three bubbles in Guangdong pilot, two bubbles in Tianjin pilot, and one bubble in Hubei pilot. These explosive episodes are closely related to immature market mechanisms and policy implementations.

To enhance understanding of the nitric acid (HNO3) dry deposition process that largely contributes to the total nitrogen deposition, we associate this process with the equilibrium shift of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) to HNO3 and ammonia (NH3) near the surface. We obtained the flux of HNO3 and PM2.5 components above a forest in suburban Tokyo using a relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system incorporating the denuder/filter-pack sampling technique. We conducted continuous samplings on a weekly basis over a long-term period, from October 14, 2016 to October 3, 2018, including leafy and leafless conditions. The measured deposition velocities of fine NO3− particles were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) larger than those of fine SO42− particles and similar to those of HNO3, regardless of the leafy and leafless periods. The larger deposition velocities of fine NO3− particles caused by the equilibrium shift of NH4NO3 were found to be similar to previous measurements at the same site. The measured deposition velocities of HNO3 were low and included many emission cases compared to those of fine NO3− particles. The lower HNO3 deposition velocities were associated with the equilibrium shift of NH4NO3 to the gas phase, causing the suppressed deposition and apparent emission of HNO3, particularly during the leafless period. The emission of HNO3 is possibly due to high HNO3 concentration near the surface, which is attributed to a small removal of the leafless canopy. The turbulence enhanced both the upward and downward fluxes of HNO3. These results will contribute to the better understanding for the dynamics of the nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere and the accurate assessment for the nitrogen deposition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Asia; Deciduous forest; Deposition velocity; HNO3; REA; Semi-volatile aerosols","Ammonia; Forestry; Nitrates; Nitric acid; Nitrogen removal; Ammonium nitrate; Asia; Deciduous forest; Deposition velocities; Dry deposition; Dry deposition process; Equilibrium-shift; HNO$-3$; Relaxed Eddy accumulation; Semi-volatile aerosols; Velocity; ammonia; ammonium nitrate; nitric acid; nitrogen derivative; ammonium nitrate; concentration (composition); detection method; dry deposition; forest ecosystem; measurement method; nitric acid; nitrogen compound; suburban area; Article; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; controlled study; dry deposition; forest; gas; Japan; nitrogen deposition; priority journal; surface property; velocity; Tokyo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105566349

Therefore, it is critical to identify the determinants of housing carbon footprint (CF) and prepare appropriate carbon mitigation measures. By employing the IPCC accounting method, input-output analysis and the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model, this study aims to study the spatio-temporal patterns and identify the driving factors of housing CF. The results show that regional disparities and urban-rural differences existed during the period 2012–2017. The results of the extended STIRPAT model show that population scale and energy consumption per unit building area are the two dominant contributors to the housing CF increments in all areas. While, family size only shows significant negative impact in eastern and western regions, the per capita disposable income only induces higher housing CF in rural areas, and energy structure had a remarkable positive impact in urban area of western region and all rural areas. Policy recommendations are proposed to mitigate the overall housing CF, including; controlling population growth and promoting urbanization benefits; encouraging green consumption; optimizing household energy consumption structure, and; en-hancing residential building energy management. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the impact of green innovation (i.e., innovation relating to the environmentally sound technologies (ESTs)) on carbon emission performance in a large developing country, such as China, has been paid little attention. This paper investigates the impact of green innovation on carbon emission performance based on a panel data set covering 218 prefecture-level cities in China from 2007 to 2013. First, we examine whether heterogeneous green innovations have a synergistic effect on carbon emission performance using the two-way fixed effect model, instrumental variable method, and spatial econometric model. Moreover, using a causal mediation effect model, we identify four kinds of potential transmission channels of green innovation affecting carbon emission performance: energy consumption structure effect, industrial structure effect, urbanization effect, and foreign direct investment (FDI) effect. The results indicate a positive effect of green innovation and its sub-categories on carbon emission performance in China. However, a noteworthy phenomenon is that direct carbon emission-reduction innovation and green administrative innovation have a weaker effect on carbon emission performance than other kinds of green innovations. In addition, the positive effect has an evident heterogeneity in different kinds of cities. To be specific, green innovation has an evident positive impact on carbon emission performance in key cities for environmental protection, resource-based cities, non-resource-based cities, and central cities. Meanwhile, a “snowball” effect and a symbiotic effect of carbon emission performance exist in local cities and between cities, respectively. Finally, we find that green innovation significantly decreases and increases carbon emission performance through industrial structure effect and FDI effect, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission performance; China; Green innovation; Green patent; Heterogeneity; Mediation effect","Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Investments; Patents and inventions; Carbon emission performance; Carbon emissions; China; Emissions performance; Green innovations; Green patent; Heterogeneity; Industrial structures; Mediation effect; Structure effect; Carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; heterogeneity; innovation; panel data; statistical analysis; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105494007

Nine plant species from the central part of Shanxi Province, China, were investigated to characterize differences in their PM retention capacity and the grain sizes of the collected PM. Styphnolobium japonicum, Syringa oblata, and Cerasus serrulata demonstrated strong retention capacity for PM particles of diverse size fractions. Philadelphus incanus, Viburnum opulus, and Yulania biondii had relatively weak retention capacity for overall and fine PM. Generally, species with smaller leaves and roughness surfaces, waxy leaves, or leaves with hair had strong PM retention capacity. Leaves with suitable groove widths better retained fine PM. Foliar dust observed on leaves presented multimodal distribution curves, including bimodal, trimodal, and four-peak distributions, which differed from the trimodal distribution of natural dustfall. The different PM retention capacities of the nine investigated species and the differing grain sizes between foliar dust and atmospheric dustfall indicated that plant leaves could selectively retain PM.

We review the major laboratory and field findings with regard to effects of anthropogenic pollutants (NOx, anthropogenic aerosols, SO2, NH3) on biogenic SOA formation. NOx participate in BVOC oxidation through changing the radical chemistry and oxidation capacity, leading to a complex SOA composition and yield sensitivity towards NOx level for different or even specific hydrocarbon precursors. Anthropogenic aerosols act as an important intermedium for gas—particle partitioning and particle-phase reactions, processes of which are influenced by the particle phase state, acidity, water content and thus associated with biogenic SOA mass accumulation. SO2 modifies biogenic SOA formation mainly through sulfuric acid formation and accompanies new particle formation and acid-catalyzed heterogeneous reactions. Some new SO2-involved mechanisms for organosulfate formation have also been proposed. NH3/amines, as the most prevalent base species in the atmosphere, influence biogenic SOA composition and modify the optical properties of SOA. The response of SOA formation behavior to these anthropogenic pollutants varies among different BVOCs precursors. Investigations on anthropogenic—biogenic interactions in some areas of China that are simultaneously influenced by anthropogenic and biogenic emissions are summarized. Based on this review, some recommendations are made for a more accurate assessment of controllable biogenic SOA formation and its contribution to the total SOA budget. This study also highlights the importance of controlling anthropogenic pollutant emissions with effective pollutant mitigation policies to reduce regional and global biogenic SOA formation. © 2021, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","anthropogenic pollutants; anthropogenic—biogenic interactions; biogenic volatile organic compounds; China; secondary organic aerosol",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101455082

Urban planning is the most important means of shaping urban morphology. Therefore, this study takes Wuhan as an example and uses the method of WRF/CMAQ coupled UCM model to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 in the Wuhan metropolitan area in winter 2015. The six most important urban morphological indicators in urban planning: the floor area ratio and building height, building density and building width, vegetation coverage ratio, and urban fraction, are selected and classified into three groups. Studying their impact on the spatial and temporal distribution of PM2.5 concentration provides support for urban planners to improve air quality. The results show that the maximum value of PM2.5 concentration in Wuhan urban area occurs in the morning rush hour, and PM2.5 is distributed concentrically in the downtown of the city (within the second ring highway) according to the highways around the city. The PM2.5 concentration in the downtown area with the most extensive urban morphological index is the highest, and it decreases with increasing distance from the downtown. Among the six indicators, building density and urban fraction have the most significant impact on PM2.5 concentration because they have the greatest impact on the wind speed at 10 m. The height of the planetary boundary layer is the key factors affect the vertical and horizontal diffusion of air pollutants.

Little is known about inhibitory effects and the mechanism of phosphate on ZVI dissolution within a bioreactor during long-term operation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of achieving energy recovery from phosphate-containing domestic sewage using an efficient anaerobic reactor with micro-sized or nano-sized ZVI addition. The results indicate that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and methane production are enhanced by ZVI addition. A maximum COD removal efficiency of 89% and methane content of 60% was achieved. However, the strengthening effect of ZVI on methane production is weakened by the presence of phosphate in domestic sewage. Analyzing the variations of Fe2+ ions and phosphate concentrations and characterizing the micro-morphology of corroded ZVI proved that the generated Fe2+ ions reacts with phosphate and forms a passivation layer on the ZVI surface, inhibiting further dissolution of ZVI. As an improved alternative, we chose the double layered core-shell structured ZVI@carbon composite as an excellent candidate to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on ZVI dissolution. In this way, the direct formation of precipitates on the ZVI surface can be avoided due to the protective carbon layer which adjusts the ion transfer. Adding ZVI@carbon composites accelerate the methane content by 16%. To our knowledge, this is the first report on adding ZVI@carbon composites to promote the anaerobic metabolism in studies, which are focusing on reducing the inhibition of ZVI by phosphate. © 2021","domestic sewage; methane production; phosphate; ZVI dissolution; ZVI@carbon composites","Chemical oxygen demand; Ions; Methane; Passivation; Phosphates; Shells (structures); Carbon composites; Core shell; Domestic sewage; Inhibitory effect; Iron carbon; Iron dissolution; Methane production; Zero-valent iron; Zero-valent iron dissolution; Zero-valent iron@carbon composite; Dissolution; carbon nanoparticle; ferrous ion; iron nanoparticle; methane; nanocomposite; phosphate; carbon; iron; methane; phosphate; anaerobic digestion; bioreactor; composite; dissolution; industrial production; inhibition; iron nanoparticle; methane; phosphate; sewage treatment; acetoclastic methanogen; acetoclastic methanogenesis; anaerobic metabolism; Article; chemical oxygen demand; concentration (parameter); controlled study; corrosion; crystal structure; dissolution; energy recovery; evaluation study; feasibility study; high throughput sequencing; hydrogenotrophic methanogen; hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; ion transport; methanogenesis; methanogenic archaeon; microbial community; micromorphology; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; reaction analysis; reactor operation; scanning electron microscopy; sewage treatment; sludge treatment; surface property; thermogravimetry; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; anaerobic growth; sewage; solubility; Anaerobiosis; Carbon; Iron; Methane; Phosphates; Sewage; Solubility; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105477244

The control of NOx emissions is the key to reducing the impact of sludge combustion on environmental pollution. In this study, Fenton/CaO was used to condition municipal sludge, which was subsequently mixed with rice husk to fabricate briquette fuel for combustion experiments. The effects of the conditioner dosages, mass ratios of the rice hull to sludge, and the combustion temperatures on NOx emissions from briquette combustion were studied. The results showed that the NOx emissions decreased with increasing doses of conditioned sludge. In addition, with an increase in the rice husk ratio in the briquette, the NOx emissions decreased and the conversion rate increased. Additionally, with an increasing combustion temperature, the combustion of molded fuel became more complete. The NOx emission of conditioned sludge combustion was reduced by approximately 1.3 times compared with that of the sludge alone. Using the response surface methodology, the optimized conditions were obtained as follows: the rice husk mixing ratio is 43.8%, the Fenton/CaO conditioner dosage is 220 mg/g, and the temperature is 829 °C. The minimum NOx emission concentration was predicted to be 0.845 mg/g.

In this study, 500 PCDD/F samples were determined by thermal desorption gas chromatography coupled to tunable-laser ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TD-GC-TLI-TOFMS) for 168 h. PCDD/F emissions range from 0.01 ng I-TEQ/Nm3 to 2.37 ng I-TEQ/Nm3, with 44% of values below 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3 (the national standard). In addition, the temperature of the furnace outlet, bed pressure, and oxygen content are considered as key operating parameters among the 13 operating parameters comprising four temperature parameters, four pressure parameters, four flow parameters, and oxygen content. More specifically, maintaining the furnace outlet temperature to be higher than 800◦C, or bed pressure higher than 13 kPa, or the oxygen content stably and above 10% are effective methods for reducing PCDD/F emissions. According to the analysis of the Pearson coefficients and maximal in-formation coefficients, there is no significant correlation between operating parameters and PCDD/F I-TEQ. Only when there is a significant change in one of these factors will the PCDD/F emissions also change accordingly. The feedback control of PCDD/F emissions is realized by adjusting the furnace outlet temperature, bed temperature, and bed pressure to control the PCDD/F to be less than 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3. © 2021 by the authors.

China has been working in the CO2 emission reduction and carbon sinks with the purpose of becoming the carbon-neutral country by 2060. The CO2 capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies and the reforestation technology represented by the Conversion of Cropland to Forestland Program (CCFP) have great potential for sinking CO2 emission. However, the trade-off among CCFP, CCS/CCUS and Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus are not well evaluated. In this paper, the remote-sensing data are collected and used to evaluate the sustainability of CCFP by analyzing the variation of land use and land cover (LULC), crop production, etc. The results show that 13.29% of the cropland in 2001 vanished and converted to grassland (8.3%), mosaic cropland (3%) and urban land (0.98%) in 2019, demonstrating that the CCFP is successful in both WEF nexus and carbon sink. The total crop production has increased around 50% between 2001 and 2019, implying that the CCFP will not lead to the food risk during the conversion of croplands into other types of land in China. A sustainable implementation of CCFP and other environmental Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) policies in 2019–2060 could reach an estimated total growth of 7.462 billion m3 in comparison of that in 2018 and the total plantation forest stock of about 10.852 billion m3 in 2060, with a corresponding minimum CO2 sink of 2.90 billion tons in 2060. The estimated peak of net equivalent CO2 emissions before 2030 is about 11.0 billion tons and could not be reduced to zero by 2060 without the large-scale application of the CCS/CCUS technologies as geological sequestration of CO2. Besides, the application of CCS/CCUS can be beneficial for WEF, e.g., through replacing the water by CO2 during energy production, especially in the shale gas production in the regions with high water risks in China. In one word, CCS/CCUS and CCFP are two decided pathways of carbon sequestration and should be systematically applied to achieve China’s carbon neutrality by 2060. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon neutrality; Carbon sequestration; CCFP; CCUS; WEF nexus","Carbon dioxide; Chemical contamination; Crops; Cultivation; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Emission control; Food storage; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power plants; Land use; Metal drawing; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Carbon sequestration; CO2 emission reduction; Environmental issues; Geological sequestration; Land use and land cover; Large-scale applications; Payments for ecosystem services (PES); Sustainability assessment; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; crop production; global warming; grassland; land cover; satellite data; shale gas; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109748148

Economic crop types (apple [Malus domestica], greenhouse, intercropping), traditional crop types (corn [Zea mays], potato [Solanum tuberosum]), and terraced fields abandoned for five years in two small catchment areas in Ansai, Shaanxi, were selected, and the composition of the bacterial communities and other physicochemical properties of the soil were analyzed.The numbers of operational taxonomic units and bacteria α-diversity in economic and traditional crop types were 1.05 to 1.23 times higher than those in abandoned land; the change in crop types had significant effects on the soil bacterial community, and soil available phosphorus (P) content and bulk density were the main factors affecting the soil bacterial community.The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria,Acidobacteria,Actinobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes, and the Proteobacteria accounted for 35% of the community in greenhouses but 30% in abandoned land. The co-occurrence networks indicated that economic crop types increased the links between soil bacterial taxa and the intensity of stability for terraced agroecosystems, especially for copiotrophic groups (Proteobacteria).

Based on a quasi-experimental design, we provide firm-level evidence of TFP improvement from China's pilot ETSs. Using panel data of Chinese listed firms during 2009–2018, the difference-in-differences method is adopted to evaluate the impact of ETS on the firm-level TFP. The results show that the ETS significantly improves the firm-level TFP, increasing it in pilot regions by approximately 14% when compared with non-pilot regions. Further analysis shows that this improvement is not affected by the heterogeneity of firms’ ownership, but by industrial heterogeneity. Moreover, this improvement is realized by promoting firms’ operating and profitability capacity. We also find that the impact of ETS on firm-level TFP is stable and exhibits no time lag. Our findings not only improve the effectiveness evaluation framework of the Chinese ETS, but also have some implications for how to promote the construction of a national carbon emissions trading market in the context of high-quality development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions trading scheme; Difference-in-differences; High-quality development; Total factor productivity","Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; Productivity; Quality control; Carbon emission trading; Carbon emission trading scheme; Chinese firms; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Emissions Trading Scheme; High quality; High-quality development; Productivity improvements; Total factor productivity; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104910636

Coastal cities, which have become the backbone of national economies, are highly dependent on the ecosystem services supported by the ocean. As a global coastal megacity, Shanghai has benefited enormously from its relationship with the ocean but its burgeoning population and rampant economic development in recent decades have applied great pressures on the associated coastal ecosystems and have reduced the ocean's capacity to provide ecosystem services and, meanwhile, have led to the demand for greater investment in ocean ecosystem restoration. To support the goal of long-term sustainability and facilitate appropriate management decisions, it is essential to assess the current health status of the coastal ecosystems of Shanghai and evaluate potential future risks. Here we apply the Ocean Health Index (OHI) framework, with indicators and reference points adjusted based on the unique coastal environment in Shanghai. The results reveal that the city obtained an overall OHI of 59 (out of 100) for the period 2012 to 2016. Individual indicators for Clean Waters (22) and Fisheries (39) exhibit particularly low values, indicating that the coastal waters around Shanghai are heavily polluted and that marine fishing is unsustainable. The city's highest OHI scores are in the sectors of Coastal Livelihoods and Economies (93), and Tourism and Recreation (93), indicating that Shanghai's coastal ecosystems contribute significantly to people's livelihoods and regional economies, while marine recreational areas and related leisure activities add considerably to the quality of life in the region.

The occurrence of influenza has been proved to be related to a variety of meteorological factors. However, less attention has been paid to the effect of relative humidity (RH) on different types of influenza, especially in subtropical regions. Daily data on laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, weather variables, and air pollutants in Hefei covering the 2014–2019 period were collected. The seasonality and trend of daily influenza cases were explored by the time series seasonal decomposition method. Generalized linear model was fitted in conjunction with distributed lag nonlinear model to quantify the associations of RH with influenza A and influenza B. Subgroup analyses were conducted by sex, age (0–4, 5–17, and ≥18 years), and season (cold and warm seasons). A total of 5238 influenza cases including 2847 influenza A cases and 2391 influenza B cases were recorded. The epidemic of influenza presented a distinct seasonal pattern, and the number of daily influenza cases increased steadily since 2016. High RH was related to an increased risk of influenza A (maximum RR = 1.683, 95%CI: 1.365–2.076), especially among males, females, and school-age children. Low RH was associated with an increased risk of influenza B (maximum RR = 1.252, 95%CI: 1.169–1.340). The contrasting relationships of RH with influenza A and B remained significant in cold seasons. High RH and low RH were significantly associated with the increased risk of influenza A and B, respectively. The findings of our study may provide clues for proposing new effective interventions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Influenza; Relative humidity; Seasonality; Time series","decomposition analysis; influenza; relative humidity; respiratory disease; seasonal variation; seasonality; subtropical region; Anhui; China; Hefei; Subgroup A; adolescent; air pollutant; child; female; human; humidity; influenza; male; season; weather; Adolescent; Air Pollutants; Child; Female; Humans; Humidity; Influenza, Human; Male; Seasons; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102500443

In this paper, the carbon emissions in China and its subordinate provinces during 2005–2017 are firstly divided into four stages, named S1, S2, S3, and S4. The results show that China has just entered the S3, and it is impossible to reach the peak of energy-related CO2 emissions with steady economic growth before 2030. Then, three-layer LMDI is utilized to explore the drivers of CO2 emissions, and the impact of urbanization which is separated from the population is considered innovatively. The economic development increases CO2 emissions, while the other drivers have diverse effects, which may be positive or negative, on carbon emissions in different regions. Therefore, four emission reduction paths with provincial characteristics should be followed in the future: (i) three provinces, namely, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang, should optimize multiple basic objectives in parallel; (ii) four provinces, such as Inner Mongolia and Hainan, should optimize the energy structure; (iii) six provinces, such as Jiangxi and Hunan, should optimize the industry structure; and (iv) the other provinces should develop new clean energy according to regional conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Drivers; EKC; Emission reduction paths; Energy-related CO2 emission; Stages; Three-layer LMDI","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; economic growth; emission control; industrial structure; urbanization; China; Hainan; Hunan; Jiangxi; Nei Monggol; Ningxia Huizu; Shaanxi; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; urbanization; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102495705

In order to investigate street-scale flow and air quality, this study developed the atmospheric photolysis calculation framework (APFoam 1.0), an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code based on OpenFOAM, which can be used to examine microscale reactive pollutant formation and dispersion in an urban area. The chemistry module of APFoam has been modified by adding five new types of reactions, which can implement the atmospheric photochemical mechanism (full O3-NOx-volatile organic compound chemistry) coupled with a CFD model. Additionally, the model, including the photochemical mechanism (CS07A), air flow, and pollutant dispersion, has been validated and shows good agreement with SAPRC modeling and wind tunnel experimental data, indicating that APFoam has sufficient ability to study urban turbulence and pollutant dispersion characteristics. By applying APFoam, O3-NOx-volatile organic compound (VOC) formation processes and dispersion of the reactive pollutants were analyzed in an example of a typical street canyon (aspect ratio H/WCombining double low line1). The comparison of chemistry mechanisms shows that O3 and NO2 are underestimated, while NO is overestimated if the VOC reactions are not considered in the simulation. Moreover, model sensitivity cases reveal that 82%-98% and 75%-90% of NO and NO2, respectively, are related to the local vehicle emissions, which is verified as the dominant contributor to local reactive pollutant concentration in contrast to background conditions. In addition, a large amount of NOx emissions, especially NO, is beneficial to the reduction of O3 concentrations since NO consumes O3. Background precursors (NOx/VOCs) from boundary conditions only contribute 2%-16% and 12%-24% of NO and NO2 concentrations and raise O3 concentrations by 5%-9%. Weaker ventilation conditions could lead to the accumulation of NOx and consequently a higher NOx concentration but lower O3 concentration due to the stronger NO titration effect, which would consume O3. Furthermore, in order to reduce the reactive pollutant concentrations under the odd-even license plate policy (reduce 50% of the total vehicle emissions), vehicle VOC emissions should be reduced by at least another 30% to effectively lower O3, NO, and NO2 concentrations at the same time. These results indicate that the examination of the precursors (NOx and VOCs) from both traffic emissions and background boundaries is the key point for understanding O3-NOx-VOCs chemistry mechanisms better in street canyons and providing effective guidelines for the control of local street air pollution. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

To provide the point feedbacks for cascaded random Raman lasing at different wavelengths, wavelength-insensitive broadband reflectors are commonly used in cascaded RRFLs, resulting in the rather broad high-order random Raman lasing with several nanometers of typical spectral width. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a tunable narrowband cascaded RRFL with an air-spaced etalon assisted point reflector. To realize narrowband, single- or dual-wavelength emission for each order of random lasing, the etalon is specially designed to have broad operation wavelength range, narrowband transmission lines and large free spectral range (FSR) associated with the Raman frequency shift. As a result, 1st- to 3rd-order random Raman lasing with single-wavelength emission in 1.1–1.27 µm region are generated in a 15 km single mode fiber (SMF) with -3 dB bandwidths below 0.4 nm, which are approximately four times less than those of cascaded RRFL without etalon. The maximum output power of the 3rd-order random Raman lasing is 615 mW, with 10% of optical conversion efficiency. Moreover, a tunable cascaded RRFL is performed by tuning the wavelength of pump laser or tilting the etalon. Dual-wavelength emission for each order of random lasing can also be realized at specific pump wavelengths. We also verified, by employing shorter fiber (10 km), more than 1.5 W output power of high-order RRFL can be achieved with -3 dB bandwidths less than 0.6 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of tunable sub-1 nm narrowband cascaded RRFL with single- or dual-wavelength emission for each order of random lasing. © 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement",,"Bandwidth; Etalons; Fiber lasers; Fibers; Reflection; Single mode fibers; Broadband reflector; Free spectral range; Maximum output power; Operation wavelength; Optical conversion efficiency; Raman fiber lasers; Raman frequency shifts; Wavelength-agile lasers; Pumping (laser)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108531453

By analyzing the carbon cycle of a cropland use system, we develop an inventory for measuring the net carbon sequestration, covering four carbon sources, i.e., agricultural materials, rice fields, soils, straw burn-ing, with the crop carbon sequestration considered. Different from conventional studies that have focused on quantity, in this study, we define net carbon sequestration performance of cropland use (NCSPC) as the ratio of actual net carbon sequestration to an optimal value per unit of cropland. We estimate the net carbon sequestration of cropland use, from 2000 to 2019, for the study area consist-ing of the 13 principal grain-producing provinces in China. Then, global-SBM is applied to measure the provincial NCSPC; furthermore, the Theil index and convergence test are employed to portray the spatiotemporal characteristics and regional divergence. The results show the following: (1) The net carbon sequestration was 3.837 t per hectare of cropland in the principal grain-producing area, of which the sequestration and the emission were 6.343 t and 2.506 t, respectively. The share of emissions, from largest to smallest, was methane from rice paddies, agricultural materials, straw burning, and soil nitrous oxide. Specifically, cropland use in Henan exhibited the strongest net carbon sequestration, whereas in Hunan it was the lowest. (2) The average NCSPC was 0.774 in the principal grain-producing area, indicating that 22.6% of the net carbon sequestration per unit of cropland remained to be explored under the corresponding production technology and input com-binations. Temporally, the NCSPC had an annual change rate of −0.30%, displaying a slowly declining trend. Spatially, the NCSPC evolved from a scattered distribution to blocky agglomeration, eventually presenting a decreasing pattern from north to south. (3) First, the total Theil index in-creased, and then decreased, indicating that the regional disparity of the NCSPC expanded early but shrank later. From 2011 to 2019, inter-regional disparity took up more in the total. Over time, both the whole region and the subregions obeyed the σ convergence. Unlike the benign trends observed in Zones I and II, the NCSPC values of Zone III converged to a low level. This study aims to provide a theoretical base for emission mitigation and sequestration promotion for cropland use. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent pilot-scale experiments in Iceland and Washington state, USA, provide promising results that indicate rapid carbon mineralization occurs within basalt reservoirs. Nevertheless, transitioning these pilot-scale results to large-scale industrial CCS operations is fraught with uncertainty because fluid flow in basalt formations is governed by fracture-controlled hydraulic properties that are highly heterogeneous and difficult to map in situ. This uncertainty is exacerbated by feedbacks between multi-phase fluid dynamics (CO2 and water) and fluid-rock reactions, which may result in a reinforcing feedback comprising CO2 mineralization, permeability alteration, and fluid mobility. To begin to understand the feedbacks between multi-phase fluid flow and mineralization in fractured basalt, this study uses reactive transport simulation methods to model CO2 infiltrating a meter-scale, synthetic basalt fracture overlying a storage reservoir while accounting for porosity change due to mineralization and its corresponding effect on permeability and fluid mobility. Results show that (i) carbonate and clay mineralization tends to occur downgradient of a fracture intersection, (ii) mineralization reduces porosity, which leads to permeability reduction and slows free-phase CO2 migration, (iii) stronger porosity-permeability coupling increases the proportion of mineralized carbon while reducing CO2 mass that can enter fracture, which may lead to self-sealing behavior as fluid mobility approaches nil, and (iv) errors caused by unknown porosity-permeability relationships are small in comparison to errors that arise by omitting mineralization-induced permeability reduction when simulating CO2 sequestration scenarios in basalt reservoirs. © 2021","Basalt fracture network; Carbon mineralization; Fracture permeability alteration; Porosity-permeability coupling; Reactive transport","Basalt; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Flow of fluids; Fracture; Mineralogy; Minerals; Porosity; Salinity measurement; Transport properties; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Carbon mineralization; Fracture intersections; Geologic carbon sequestrations; Hydraulic properties; Multi-phase fluid flow; Permeability reduction; Pilot-scale experiments; Petroleum reservoir engineering; basalt; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; computer simulation; mafic rock; mineralization; permeability; porosity; reactive transport; reservoir",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108618317

The APEC economies are divided into annual energy and overall energy efficiency ratings, and improvement directions are proposed for the different variables. With the proposal of magnitude, this study discusses the changes in intertemporal conversion variables and proposes suggestions for improvement. Finally, this study analyzes the implications of energy investment and the efficiency policies of APEC economies. The results show that economies with the lowest overall energy efficiency ratings have great potential for improvement. Reducing capital stock, labor, fossil fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions while increasing GDP can increase energy efficiency ratings. However, economies do not want to reduce the state’s capital stock, and labor and population birth adjustments are difficult. Energy efficiency can only start by adjusting the consumption of fossil fuels, CO2 emissions, and GDP.

Despite attracting considerable recent attention, most such fluids have not been applied at a large-scale due to their high costs and/or complex synthesis processes. Here, we report the development of CO2-switchable viscoelastic fluids using commercially available sodium polyacrylate (NaPAA) and N,N-dimethyl ethanol amine (DMEA)-based switchable water. Upon bubbling CO2, into the solutions under study, DMEA molecules are protonated to generate quaternary ammonium salts, resulting in pronounced decreases in solutions viscosity and elasticity due to the influence of increased ionic strength on NaPAA molecular conformations. Upon removal of CO2 via introduction of N2, quaternary salts are deprotonated to tertiary amines, allowing recovery of fluid viscosity and elasticity to near the initial state. This work provides a simple approach to fabricating CO2-switchable viscoelastic fluids, widening the potential use of CO2 in stimuli-responsive applications. © 2021 by the authors.

This represents an important knowledge gap because changes in microbial networks could have implications for their functionality and vulnerability to future disturbances. Here, we compare the spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of bacterioplankton molecular ecological networks using high-throughput sequencing of Illumina HiSeq and multivariate statistical analyses from a subtropical river during wet and dry seasons. Results demonstrated that the lower reaches (high human activity intensity) network had less of an average degree (10.568/18.363), especially during the dry season, when compared with the upper reaches (low human activity intensity) network (10.685/37.552) during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The latter formed more complexity networks with more modularity (0.622/0.556) than the lower reaches (high human activity intensity) network (0.505/0.41) during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Bacterioplankton molecular ecological network under high human activity intensity became significantly less robust, which is mainly caused by altering of the environmental conditions and keystone species. Human activity altered the composition of modules but preserved their ecological roles in the network and environmental factors (dissolved organic carbon, temperature, arsenic, oxidation–reduction potential and Chao1 index) were the best parameters for explaining the variations in bacterioplankton molecular ecological network structure and modules. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the keystone phylum in shaping the structure and niche differentiations in the network. In addition, the lower reaches (high human activity intensity) reduce the bacterioplankton diversity and ecological niche differentiation, which deterministic processes become more important with increased farmland and constructed land area (especially farmland) with only 35% and 40% of the community variation explained by the neutral community model during the wet season and dry season, respectively. Keystone species in high human activity intensity stress habitats yield intense functional potentials and Bacterioplankton communities harbor keystone taxa in different human activity intensity stress habitats, which may exert their influence on microbiome network composition regardless of abundance. Therefore, human activity plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and function of bacterioplankton molecular ecological networks in subtropical rivers and understanding the mechanisms of this process can provide important information about human–water interaction processes, sustainable uses of freshwater as well as watershed management and conservation. © 2021 by the authors.

Through a qualitative analysis of media coverage and industry public relations during the period 2008–2019, we show how the fossil fuel hegemony has been maintained and extended in the face of growing social and political critique. We identify the key discourses that the Australian fossil fuel sector has employed in reproducing hegemony and delaying action on climate change. This extends previous theorisations of moral and intellectual leadership by detailing how the fossil fuel sector embeds particular technical claims into the climate change debate.

While large federal reclamation projects once dominated western water management and provided ample water for large scale agricultural development as well as the urbanization of the West, water engineering alone is no longer sufficient or, in some cases, a politically acceptable policy option. As demand for water in the West increases with an ever-growing population, climate change is presenting a more challenging and potentially untenable, reality of even longer periods of drought and insufficient water quantity. The complexity of managing water resources under climate change conditions will require multifaceted and publicly acceptable strategies. This paper therefore examines water policy preferences of residents in four western states: Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho. Using a public survey conducted in these states in 2019, we examine preferences pertaining to infrastructural, education, incentives and regulation specifically examining levels of support for varying policies based on climate change and environmental efficacy beliefs as well as geography, demographic variables, and political ideology. Results show support for all water policies surveyed, with the exception of charging higher rates for water during the hottest part of summer. The most preferred water policies pertained to tax incentives. Some variation of support exists based on gender, education, environmental values, efficacy, state residency and belief in anthropogenic climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

The goals of this study were to: a) calculate potential renewable energy production in the north of the Yucatan Peninsula; b) understand the perception of the local inhabitants towards the installation and operation of ocean energy devices and c) estimate the potential environmental impacts in the Río Lagartos Biosphere Reserve, considering keystone or unique/endemic species. Our results indicate that energy harvesting through salinity gradient would be the most feasible among renewable energy production alternatives that would reduce emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere thus helping mitigate global warming. The maximum recorded salinity was 90 psu, in February and April, which would provide 1.39 kWh/m3. This would not be sufficient to fully meet the local demands for electricity. Our findings show that the local people are not well informed regarding renewable energies. They appreciate their natural environment and would be very reluctant to see drastic changes in their surroundings. Finally, if saline gradient energy production were to be implemented here, the changes in the gradient and hydrosedimentary flows would probably induce undesirable alterations to the natural ecosystems: (mangroves), food webs (plankton), and threatened species (flamingos and horseshoe crabs). In conclusion, our findings indicate that salinity gradient energy production is unlikely to be viable in the Ria Lagartos Biosphere Reserve mostly because of the reluctance of local inhabitants to changes in their environment and the potential environmental impacts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Coastal lagoon; Flamingoes; Horsehoe crab; Mangroves; Salinity gradient energy; Social perception","Biospherics; Conservation; Energy harvesting; Environmental protection; Forestry; Global warming; Renewable energy resources; Biosphere reserve; Multi-disciplinary approach; Natural ecosystem; Natural environments; Renewable energies; Salinity gradients; Social perception; Threatened species; Environmental impact; carbon dioxide; alternative energy; demand-side management; electricity generation; mangrove; perception; salinity; Article; biosphere; bird; carbon footprint; electricity; endangered species; endemic species; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; flamingo; greenhouse effect; horseshoe crab; hydrosedimentary flow; mangrove; Mexico; plankton; priority journal; renewable energy; salinity; salinity gradient energy production; sea; sediment transport; Yucatan; Mexico [North America]; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101673232

Palaeoecological research can provide essential context for the impacts of anthropogenic climate change in the 21st Century and beyond, but existing studies have notable limitations in the insights they can provide: vegetation proxy data are spatially and temporally skewed with inconsistent taxonomic resolution; existing modelling studies typically overlook individualistic species-level responses, are limited in temporal coverage, and lack close integration with empirical palaeoecological data. Here, we investigate the impact of major climate changes upon the species-level floristic composition of southern Brazil's Atlantic Forest, from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the late 21st century, by modelling the distributions of 30 key species at seven time slices since the LGM and comparing the assemblages they form with an unprecedented dataset of palaeoecological proxy data. We find notable compositional changes through time across our study area, especially during the early Holocene, which was characterised by extensive no-analogue plant communities. Aspects of these modelled floristic changes are captured in proxy records but many occur in data-sparse regions, highlighting geographic foci for future palaeoecological investigation to test these model predictions. Our findings highlight the individualistic responses of Atlantic Forest plant species to climate change and help resolve long-standing palaeoecological questions – explaining the dominance of highland grasslands at the Last Glacial Maximum (likely due to low atmospheric CO2 concentrations), clarifying the LGM extent of coastal tropical forest (probably in a grassland matrix on exposed continental shelf), and explaining the origins of Araucaria angustifolia's western populations (from climatic (micro-)refugia rather than human-mediated dispersal). Our results also set the 21st Century's impending climate and vegetation changes in a 21,000-year temporal context, revealing that, under a high emissions scenario, more than 100,000 km2 of the southern Atlantic Forest will experience more climate-driven floristic change in the coming decades than it has in the last 21 millennia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropocene; Atlantic forest; Biodiversity hotspot; Climate change; Conservation; Late quaternary; Palaeoecology; Present; South America; Vegetation dynamics","Biodiversity; Climate models; Conservation; Forestry; Glacial geology; Vegetation; Anthropocene; Atlantic forest; Biodiversity hotspot; Hot spot; Last Glacial Maximum; Late quaternary; Palaeoecology; Present; South America; Vegetation dynamics; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; biome; climate change; forest ecosystem; grassland; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; paleoecology; plant community; tropical forest; twenty first century; vegetation dynamics; Araucaria; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]; Araucaria angustifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107887091

As both vehicle technology and emissions legislation in Europe continue to evolve, Concawe has conducted a study to examine the effects that fuels can have on emissions, in this case from commercial road vehicles. A bus certified to Euro VI emissions level and a delivery truck certified to Euro V emissions level have been tested on a chassis-dyno over the World Harmonized Vehicle Cycle (WHVC) and Transport for London Urban Inter-Peak (TfL UIP) test cycles with six fuels: an EN590-compliant B5 (petroleum diesel containing 5% biodiesel by volume), a bioderived paraffinic diesel, a 50:50 blend of the aforementioned fuels, a low-density petroleum-derived B5, a B30 and the same B30 additized with a high dose of cetane number improver (CNI). Results show reduced NOx reductant (AdBlue) consumption with paraffinic diesel in the Euro VI bus due to lower engine-out NOx emissions. More surprisingly, higher hydrocarbon emissions were observed with some low-density hydrocarbon fuels in the Euro V truck. Compared to B5, B30 with and without CNI did not affect tank-to-wheel (TTW) CO2, volumetric fuel consumption or NOx by statistically significant margins. When considered with the findings of a complementary light-duty study, it is apparent that low-density diesel fuels could offer overall benefits to both emissions affecting local air quality and to greenhouse gas emissions on a TTW basis. The addition of higher fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) levels to fuels can be used to increase renewable fuel contribution resulting in no penalty in NOx emissions from modern technology vehicles. Compatibility of these fuels with the existing vehicle fleet would require further specific consideration. Outside of fuel properties considerations, Euro VI aftertreatment systems can increase N2 O emissions at the tailpipe through chemical reactions in the catalyst. This can translate into about 10% contribution of N2 O emissions to the overall GHG emissions of the vehicle. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we assessed the feasibility of adaptation options for the African context. Using the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative, a stocktake of adaptation-related responses to climate change from the peer-reviewed literature in 2013-2020, we found 827 records of adaptation actions in Africa. We categorised and evaluated 24 adaptation options and for each option, six dimensions of feasibility were considered: economic, environmental, social, institutional, technological, and evidence of effectiveness. Over half (51%) of all adaptation actions were reported in the food sector where sustainable water management (SWM) was the most reported option. The fewest actions were reported for cities (5%). The majority of actions (53%) were recorded in just six countries: Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria and South Africa. Encouragingly, effectiveness was assessed as medium or high for 95% of adaptation options. However, no options had high feasibility on any other dimension. Technological and institutional factors present major barriers to implementation. Crop management, SWM, sustainable agricultural practices, agroforestry, livelihood diversification, ecosystem governance and planning, health governance and planning, infrastructure and built environment, all had moderate feasibility across three or more dimensions. Human migration has low feasibility but high potential for risk reduction. Major knowledge gaps exist for environmental feasibility, for assessing adaptation limits at increasing levels of climate hazard, for economic trade-offs and synergies, and for Central and Northern Africa. Our results highlight sectors where enablers for adaptation can be increased.

Changes in rainfall patterns, increased frequency of extreme climate events, along rising air temperatures and sea levels are some of the serious issues faced by the global community. Mountain communities have their local wisdom for dealing with climate change. The huge impact of climate change requires an active effort to anticipate the widespread effects using mitigation and adaptation strategies. This research investigates the legacy of ideas of the Javanese mountain community in anticipating climate change. The research method is qualitative and uses an explorative approach to examine how the legacy of ideas of the Javanese community, combined with local potential, is used as a strategy for anticipating climate change. The research results show that the cultivation of medicinal plants based on ancestral heritage is used as an anticipation strategy for dealing with uncertainties in climate and weather. Since ancient times, mountain communities have believed that the cultivation of medicinal plants in mountain regions offers an alternative source of subsistence if other food and vegetable crops fail to thrive. Medicinal plants are not only consumed by the local community but can also be sold since they are believed to have a relatively stable price and a clear consumer market. They can be consumed by all segments of the community, for stamina, to treat diseases, and also for beauty, and to promote domestic harmony. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Extreme weather; Global warming; Plants (botany); Sea level; Adaptation strategies; Alternative source; Global community; Local potentials; Medicinal plants; Rainfall patterns; research methods; Research results; Landforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112475778

First, it highlights parts of the judgement that represent best practice in adjudicating climate change, such as the operationalization of an integrated approach to international law. Second, it identifies human rights questions resulting from the Supreme Court’s narrow focus on the rights of residents of the Netherlands in determining a specific mitigation target.

We propose a machine-learning model to consider alkalinity, Ca, Mg, Na, Ba, Fe, Mn, Cl, sulfate, TDS, specific conductance, pH, temperature, and turbidity holistically together. The model, an ensemble of sub-models targeting one parameter pair per sub-model, was trained with groundwater chemistry from Pennsylvania (n=19,086) and a set of 16 analyses from putatively contaminated groundwater. For cases where [CH4] ≥ 10 mg/L, salinity- and redox-related parameters sometimes show that CH4 may have moved into the aquifer recently and separately from natural brine migration, i.e., anomalous CH4. We applied the model to validation and hold-out data for Pennsylvania (n=4,786) and groundwater data from three other gas-producing states: New York (n=203), Texas (n=688), and Colorado (n=10,258). The applications show that 1.4%, 1.3%, 0%, and 0.9% of tested samples in these four states, respectively, have high [CH4] and are ≥50% likely to have been impacted by gas migrated from exploited reservoirs. If our approach is indeed successful in flagging anomalous CH4, we conclude that: i) the frequency of anomalous CH4 (# flagged water samples / total samples tested) in the Appalachian Basin is similar in areas where gas wells target unconventional as compared to conventional reservoirs, and ii) the frequency of anomalous CH4 in Pennsylvania is higher than in Texas + Colorado. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that differences among regions might be affected by differences in data volumes.

Of all countries, those of the Arabian Peninsula are synonymous with energy and the supply and use of fossil fuels. However driven by commitments to international climate change agreements the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have been developing alternative energy strategies with targets for renewables. This paper presents the outputs of biomass resource modelling analyses that identify bioenergy opportunities across the region. Municipal wastes are found to represent a leading opportunity for bioenergy with a combined 19.35 Mtpa of resource across the GCC currently being sent to landfill that could otherwise be used for energy. The research finds that up to 22.5% of GCC country electricity could be generated from bioenergy technologies fuelled by indigenous biomass resources. Interviews were undertaken with Director-level GCC individuals from industry and government and a survey was facilitated to gain an understanding of perceptions of bioenergy and the potential barriers to its greater deployment. There was majority support for renewable technologies and for bioenergy, however a majority of respondents were found to be ‘not willing’ or ‘unsure’ when asked if they would be willing to take any individual actions such as recycling to support bioenergy schemes. High availability of cheap fossil fuels, stimulated by fossil fuel subsidies is identified as the greatest barrier to renewables.

This paper studied PM2.5 distribution patterns in both symmetric and asymmetric street canyons by using the computational fluid dynamics technique. Simulation experiments were conducted in a series of isolated street canyons in Beijing with five SCERs and three types of traffic flow states. The results of the simulation experiments were verified with on-site data. The results are threefold: (1) PM2.5 emitted by the vehicles gathers around the corners of leeward buildings of street canyons, and this phenomenon tends to be aggravated by heavy traffic flow states in most scenarios; (2) of five SCERs, it was the most difficult for PM2.5 to spread out of the canyons with SCER = 2:1:2, whereas it was the easiest for PM2.5 to spread out of the canyons with SCER = 2:2:1; and (3) pedestrians and residents on the leeward side of asymmetric street canyons are exposed to the highest PM2.5 concentration.

Natural lands carbon sequestration and storage are critical for successful pathways to global decarbonization (i.e., as a negative emissions technology). Coastal vegetated habitats maintain carbon sequestration rates exceeding forest sequestration rates on a per unit area basis by nearly two orders of magnitude. These blue carbon habitats and their associated carbon sequestration benefits are vulnerable to losses from land-use change and sea-level rise. Incorporation of blue carbon habitats in climate change policy is one strategy for both maintaining these habitats and conserving significant carbon sequestration capabilities. Previous policy assessments have found the potential for incorporation of coastal carbon sequestration in national-level policies, yet there has – to date – been little inclusion of blue carbon in the national-scale implementation of Paris commitments. Recently, sub-national jurisdictions have gained attention as models for pathways to decarbonization. However, few previous studies have examined sub-national level policy opportunities for operationalizing blue carbon into climate decision-making. California is uniquely poised to integrate benefits from blue carbon into its coastal planning and management and its suite of climate mitigation policies. Here, we evaluated legal authorities and policy contexts addressing sequestration specifically from blue carbon habitats. We synthesized the progressive action in California's approaches to mitigate carbon emissions including statutory, regulatory, and non-regulatory opportunities to incorporate blue carbon ecosystem service information into state- and local-level management decisions. To illustrate how actionable blue carbon information can be produced for use in decision-making, we conducted a spatial analysis of blue carbon sequestration in several locations in California across multiple agencies and management contexts. We found that the average market values of carbon sequestration services in 2100 ranged from $7,730 to $44,000 per hectare and that the social cost of carbon sequestration value was 1.3 to 2.7 times the market value. We also demonstrated that restoration of small areas with high sequestration rates can be comparable to the sequestration of existing marshes. Our results illustrate how accessible information about carbon sequestration in coastal habitats can be directly incorporated into existing policy frameworks at the sub-national scale. The incorporation of blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national climate policies can serve as a model for the development of future policy approaches for negative emissions technologies, with consequences for the success of the Paris Agreement and science-based decarbonization by mid-century. © 2020","Blue carbon; Carbon budget; Carbon sequestration; Climate mitigation; Climate policy; Ecosystem services; Nature-based solutions","carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem service; greenhouse gas; spatial analysis; California; France; Ile de France; Paris; United States; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102102686

Tree planting on degraded urban lands—or afforestation—is one form of nature-based solution that has been increasingly implemented in cities around the world. The benefits of afforestation are, however, contingent on the capacity of soils to support the growth of planted trees, which poses a challenge in some urban settings where unfavorable soil conditions limit tree performance. Soil-focused site treatments could help urban areas overcome impediments to afforestation, yet few studies have examined the long-term (>5 yr) effects of site treatments on soils and other management objectives. We analyzed the impacts of compost amendments, interplanting with shrubs, and tree species composition (six species vs. two species) on soil conditions and associated tree growth in 54 experimental afforestation plots in New York City, USA. We compared baseline soil conditions to conditions after 6 yr and examined changes in the treatment effects from 1 to 6 yr. Site treatments and tree planting increased soil microbial biomass, water holding capacity, and total carbon and nitrogen, and reduced soil pH and bulk density relative to baseline conditions. These changes were most pronounced in compost-amended plots, and the effects of the shrub and species composition treatments were minimal. In fact, compost was key to sustaining long-term changes in soil carbon stocks, which increased by 17% in compost-amended plots but declined in unamended plots. Plots amended with compost also had 59% more nitrogen than unamended plots, which was associated with a 20% increase in the basal area of planted trees. Improvements in soil conditions after 6 yr departed from the initial trends observed after 1 yr, highlighting the importance of longer-term studies to quantify restoration success. Altogether, our results show that site treatments and tree planting can have long-lasting impacts on soil conditions and that these changes can support multiple urban land management objectives. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America","afforestation; carbon; compost; nature-based solutions; nitrogen; plant–soil interactions; soil carbon stocks; soil health; urban forestry","afforestation; basal area; climate change; global climate; restoration ecology; suburbanization; tree planting; urban forestry; urbanization; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; Matthiola; carbon; carbon sequestration; forest; soil; tree; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Forests; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105434836

Accurate evaluation of the environmental effect of the policy is of great significance to its promotion. A difference-in-differences (DID) model is used to explore the role of the “ESER” demonstration city policy in urban environmental governance. The results of empirical tests show that the policy has significantly reduced fine particulate matter (PM2.5), industrial dust, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and wastewater emissions by 39.1%, 61%, 18.3%, and 7.4%, respectively. The results of the multi-stage DID model show that the emission reduction effect of this policy increases significantly in the short term but decreases gradually in the long term. The results of the mediation effect model show that the emission reduction effect is driven mainly by increasing innovation capacity and reducing energy intensity; the effect is also more significant in cities on a larger scale, with higher levels of fiscal expenditure and financial development, more abundant human capital and higher levels of economic development.

This study used 21-year (2000–2020) high-resolution (1 km) Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm-based AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. MAIAC AOD was evaluated against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data across three sites (Xuzhou-CUMT, NUIST, and Taihu) located in Jiangsu Province. The study also investigated the spatiotemporal distributions and variations in AOD, with associated trends, and measured the impact of meteorology on AOD in the 13 cities of Jiangsu Province. The evaluation results demonstrated a high correlation (r = 0.867~0.929) between MAIAC AOD and AERONET data, with lower root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.130~0.287) and mean absolute error (MAE = 0.091~0.198). In addition, the spatial distribution of AOD was higher (&gt;0.60) in most cities except the southeast of Nantong City (AOD &lt; 0.4). Seasonally, higher AOD was seen in summer (&gt;0.70) than in spring, autumn, and winter, whereas monthly AOD peaked in June (&gt;0.9) and had a minimum in December (&lt;0.4) for all the cities. Frequencies of 0.3 ≤ AOD &lt; 0.4 and 0.4 ≤ AOD &lt; 0.5 were relatively common, indicating a turbid atmosphere, which may be associated with anthropogenic activities, increased emissions, and changes in meteorological circumstances. Trend analysis showed significant increases in AOD during 2000–2009 for all the cities, perhaps reflecting a booming economy and industrial development, with significant emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), and primary aerosols. China’s strict air pollution control policies and control of vehicular emissions helped to decrease AOD from 2010 to 2019, enhancing air quality throughout the study area. A notably similar pattern was observed for AOD and meteorological parameters (LST: land surface temperature, WV: water vapor, and P: precipitation), signifying that meteorology plays a role in terms of increasing and decreasing AOD. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we estimated premature mortality attributed to BC in China in 2013 using a health impact model combined with annual average BC concentrations predicted using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model. Source contributions to BC from six different source sectors were estimated using the source-oriented method, including residential, industrial, transportation, open burning, power, and other sources. The sensitivity of BC-related premature mortality to emission reductions in different sources was quantified in different regions of China. The results showed that the total all-cause premature mortality related to BC was approximately 1,436,957 (95% CI: 998,746–2,029,210) in China in 2013. Residential, industrial, and transportations sources were the three main sources of BC-induced premature mortality. Central China, Yangtze River Delta, and Sichuan Basin had the highest BC-induced mortality due to a high level of emissions and a dense population. A sensitivity test by assuming the same exposure-response coefficient of BC as the total PM2.5 showed the number of deaths was 265,122 thousand (95% CI: 541,90, 445,943) which can be treated as the lower limit of the BC-related mortality in China. Despite the uncertainties in estimates, it is suggested that reducing BC emissions in China would lead to significant health benefits. Controlling BC from industrial and transportation sources would bring more relative mortality reductions, from a percentage point of view, in most provinces of China. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","black carbon; China; Disaggregation by province; premature mortality; source contribution; source contributions","Air quality; Carbon; Emission control; Health risks; Housing; Uncertainty analysis; Black carbon; China; Disaggregation by province; Epidemiological studies; Fine particulate matter; PM$-2.5$; Premature mortality; Residential-industrial; Source contributions; Health; black carbon; outdoor black carbon; unclassified drug; air quality; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; child mortality; health impact; sensitivity analysis; source identification; Article; cause of death; China; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; human; limit of quantitation; long term exposure; mortality risk; particulate matter 2.5; population research; premature mortality; United States; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105247949

In the entire chain transportation process of containerized cargo multimodal transportation, the generalized external cost is considered to establish the total utility model of multimodal transportation. Based on the optimal carbon tax rate, we studied the impact of single tax rate and progressive tax rate on carbon emissions of multimodal transportation schemes. Also, the Tianjin-Weihai section of the Bohai Rim Economic Circle is used for example analysis. The results of the study found that under different carbon tax starting points, the cost of electronic goods can be reduced by 80-200 yuan per ton, and the carbon emissions can be reduced by 350-600 tons. The effect of reducing emissions is also different for different cargo values. By adjusting the structure of cargo transportation, an optimal multimodal transportation plan considering carbon tax is proposed to provide a basis for carbon tax policy formulation and implementation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Economic analysis; Emission control; Freight transportation; Internet of things; Smart city; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Cargo transportation; Collection methods; Containerized cargo; Emission reduction; Progressive tax rates; Reducing emissions; Transportation process; Multimodal transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112530232

This raises a critical question from a climate mitigation perspective: Would there still be a chance to stabilize the Greenland ice sheet if the carbon reduction goals of the Paris Agreement could be met? Here, we show that there is indeed a possibility for stabilizing the Greenland ice sheet with the low-emission scenario of RCP2.6. In particular, RCP2.6 would potentially limit the warming in Greenland below 1°C within next 30 years and constrain its loss of ice sheet coverage below 10%. After 2050, the annual mean temperature in Greenland is likely to be stabilized and no further loss is expected to its ice sheet. However, the effective window for this chance will be closing after 2020. If no effective carbon reduction policies are being taken now, we are very likely to enter a continuous warming pathway and lose the chance of stabilizing the Greenland ice sheet. © 2021.

The results showed that the dominant factor behind the area burned was wind speed in three climatic regions, particularly in Ganzi and A’ba with plateau cli-mates. In Ganzi and A’ba, precipitation was mainly responsible for controlling the number of forest fires while it was mainly affected by temperature in Panzhihua and Liangshan with semi-humid subtropical mountain climates. Moreover, the synergistic effect of temperature, precipitation and wind speed was responsible in basin mid-subtropical humid climates with Chengdu as the center and the influence of temperature was slightly higher. The differential forest fire response to meteorological factors was observed in different climatic regions but there was some regularity. The influence of monthly precipitation in the autumn on the area burned in each climatic region was more significant than in other seasons, which verified the hypothesis of a precipitation lag effect. Climate warming and the combined impact of warming effects may lead to more frequent and severe fires. © 2021 by the authors.

Herein, the locations in the ocean and permafrost that meet the requirements for hydrate-based CO2 storage are summarized. Furthermore, research progress and shortcomings of hydrate-based CO2 storage are analyzed. The two main methods for hydrate-based CO2 storage are direct CO2 hydrate storage and CO2–CH4 hydrate replacement. Direct CO2 hydrate storage on the seabed and in the subsea (or permafrost) is proposed, and CO2 formation experiments on different scales are conducted. Various porous media are used to simulate the natural sediment and investigate the hydrate formation equilibrium and kinetics. CO2–CH4 replacement is preferred because it combines the benefits of CO2 storage and CH4 production. The hydrate equilibrium of different CO2–CH4 mixture hydrates is measured using different methods. Nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopy are commonly used to study the hydrate structure characteristics and mass transfer properties. Macrokinetics are usually conducted in a high-pressure vessel to analyze the effects of the experimental conditions on the replacement results. Nevertheless, the replacement rate and hydrate properties should be investigated further. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","CO2 storage; CO2–CH4 hydrate replacement; experimental research; hydrate","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; High pressure effects; Hydration; Mass transfer; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Permafrost; Porous materials; Pressure vessels; Equilibrium and kinetics; Experimental conditions; Future research directions; High-pressure vessel; Hydrate equilibria; Hydrate structures; Natural sediments; Transfer properties; Gas hydrates",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105303260

The composition characteristics and carbon number distributions were investigated, and the contribution of individual VOC to ozone formation potentials (OFPs) was weighted. Results showed that alkanes were the major VOC species, accounting for approximately 65.5%. VOC emissions decreased significantly as the standards became stricter, especially for alkanes and aromatics; and the VOC emissions on highway were much lower than those on urban roads. Carbon number distribution of VOCs was mainly concentrated in C3 C4 and C10 C12. Aromatics were the major contributors to ozone formation, taking up 49.3 57.6% of the total OFPs, and naphthalene, 1-butene, dodecane, 1,2,3-Trimethylbenzene and 2-propenal were the top five species.

Because of both natural and social factors, China has significant CO2 emission inequalities, however, there is few literature on residential carbon inequality and its driving factors. Using the provincial panel data of Chinese residential sector from 2005 to 2017, this article examines residential CO2 emission inequality (carbon inequality) and its driving factors from a static and dynamic perspective to provide empirical support for the formulation of emission reduction policies and the allocation of regional emission reduction quotas. The results indicate that residential carbon inequality grew from 2005 to 2017. The energy intensity disparity was the main contributor in promoting carbon inequality increases, and its effects demonstrated an increasing trend. Per capita income disparity was the second largest factor in the growth of residential carbon inequality, with a contribution of approximately 20%. Additionally, the urban and rural structure also positively widened carbon inequality, but its contribution decreased. Conversely, the energy structure disparity actively facilitated a reduction of carbon inequality, although such active effects were minor. Based on these results, policies relevant narrowing the regional gaps of energy intensity, per capita income, and urbanization were proposed for decreasing carbon inequality of China's residential sector. © 2021","Carbon inequality; Center of gravity; Driving factor; Residential co2 emissions; Urbanization","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Housing; Emission reduction; Emission reduction policies; Energy intensity; Energy structures; Living conditions; Per capita income; Residential energy consumption; Residential sectors; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106895506

In this study, five forest ages, young forest (YF), middle-aged forest (MAF), near-mature forest (NMF), mature forest (MF), and over-mature forest (OMF) in a Pinus tabuliformis plantation were chosen to illustrate interactions among the C: N: P stoichiometry in soils and carbon distribution in plants, in the mountainous area of eastern Liaoning, China. Carbon content was highest in the leaves of MAF (505.90 g·kg−1) and NMF (509.00 g·kg−1) and the trunks of YF (503.72 g·kg−1), MF (509.73 g·kg−1), and OMF (504.90 g·kg−1), and was lowest in the branches over the entire life cycle of the aboveground components (335.00 g·kg−1). The carbon content of the fine roots decreased with soil layer depth. In YF, MAF, and NMF carbon content of fine roots at 0.5 m was always higher than that of fine roots at 1 m; however, it was the opposite in MF and OMF. The carbon content of the leaves changed with forest age; however, carbon content of branches, trunks and fine roots did not change significantly. Soil total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and available phosphorus (AP) content was highest in the OMF. Soil TC, TN and AP content, and TC: TN, TC: TP and TN: TP ratio decreased with increasing soil depth. Soil TC, TN, and TP content had a significant effect on the carbon content of fine roots (p &lt; 0.05). The leaf carbon content and soil element content changed obviously with forest age, and the soil TN, TP and AP increased, which might reduce the carbon content allocation of fine roots. © 2021 Wang et al.

The upgrading of pipelines is bound to occupy certain road resources, compress the driving space of motor vehicles for a long time, aggravate the traffic congestion in the construction section, and then affect the traffic operation of the whole region. A reasonable layout of traffic signs for inducement to guide the traffic flow in the area where the construction section is located is conducive to promoting a balanced distribution of traffic flow in the regional road network, so as to achieve the reduction of automobile exhaust emissions and the sustainable development of traffic. In this paper, the layout optimization method of regional traffic signs for inducement is proposed. Taking the maximum amount of guidance information that the regional traffic signs can provide as the objective function, and taking the traffic volume, the characteristics of intersection nodes and the standard deviation of road saturation as the independent variables, the layout optimization model of guidance facilities is constructed, which can optimize the layout of traffic guidance signs in the area affected by the construction section, and achieve the goal that the minimum number of facilities can provide the maximum amount of guidance information. The results of the case study show that among the 64 alternative locations where traffic guidance signs can be set in the study area, eight optimal locations are finally determined as the setting points of guidance facilities through this model, and the effective increment of guidance information is the largest at this time.

However, the energy use of ships is affected by a series of navigational environmental parameters, which have certain spatial and temporal differences and variability. Therefore, the dynamic collaborative optimization method of sailing route and speed, which fully considers the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of those factors, is of great importance. In this paper, the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the environmental factors and their related ship energy consumption profiles are first analyzed. Subsequently, a ship energy consumption model considering various environmental factors is established to realize the prediction of energy use of ships within the navigation region. Then, a novel dynamic collaborative optimization algorithm, which adopts the Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy and swarm intelligence algorithm, is proposed, to further improve the ship's energy consumption optimization. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the newly developed dynamic collaborative optimization method, which fully considers the continuously time-varying characteristics of environmental and operational parameters, could effectively reduce the energy consumption in comparison to the original operational mode. In addition, the adoption of the MPC strategy produces better performance results compared to the optimization method without the MPC strategy. © 2021","energy consumption prediction; intelligent ship; low carbon shipping; Speed optimization; weather routing","algorithm; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; environmental factor; optimization; prediction; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; vessel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107141973

Plant phenology is a key factor controlling the productivity of terrestrial vegetation under climate change. Over the past several decades, the vegetation in the three-river headwaters region (TRHR) has been reported to have changed greatly owing to the warming climate and human activities. However, uncertainties related to the potential mechanism and influence of climatic and soil factors on the plant phenology of the TRHR are poorly understood. In this study, we used harmonic analysis of time series and the relative and absolute change rate on Google Earth Engine to calculate the start (SOS), end (EOS), and length (LOS) of the growing season based on MOD09A1 datasets; the results were verified by the observational data from phenological stations. Then, the spatiotemporal patterns of plant phenology for different types of terrain and basins were explored. Finally, the potential mechanism involved in the influence of climatic and soil factors on the phenology of plants in the TRHR were explored based on the structural equation model and Pearson’s correlation coefficients. The results show the remotely sensed monitoring data of SOS (R2 = 0.84, p &lt; 0.01), EOS (R2 = 0.72, p &lt; 0.01), and LOS (R2 = 0.86, p &lt; 0.01) were very similar to the observational data from phenological stations. The SOS and LOS of plants possessed significant trends toward becoming advanced (Slope &lt; 0) and extended (Slope &gt; 0), respectively, from 2001 to 2018. The SOS was the earliest and the LOS was the longest in the Lancang River Basin, while the EOS was the latest in the Yangtze River Basin owing to the impact of climate change and soil factors. Meanwhile, the spatial patterns of SOS, EOS, and LOS have strong spatial heterogeneity at different elevations, slopes, and aspects. In addition, the results show that the drivers of plant phenology have basin-wide and stage differences. Specifically, the influence of soil factors on plant phenology in the Yangtze River Basin was greater than that of climatic factors, but climatic factors were key functional indicators of LOS in the Yellow and Lancang river basins, which directly or indirectly affect plant LOS through soil factors. This study will be helpful for understanding the relationship between the plant phenology of the alpine wetland ecosystem and climate change and improving the level of environmental management. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on the particular perspective of gender-specific differences in energy use, we conducted a large-scale questionnaire survey among residents in Jiangsu, China, and investigated household daily energy use (DEU) and energy-efficient product purchases (EEPPs). We also measured the distribution of family decision-making power between husbands and wives using four dimensions: daily expenditure decisions (DEDs), large-scale commodity purchase decisions (LCPDs), children's education decisions, and elder support decisions, and we furthermore explored the influence of the conjugal power core on household energy conservation. The results showed that male-dominated families use more energy and were less likely to buy energy-efficient products than gender neutral families (0.814 times the DEU; 1.202 times the EEPPs) and female-dominated families (0.705 times the DEU; 1.325 times the EEPPs). Specifically, when women constituted the power core in respect to decision-making about daily household expenditure, the household's daily energy consumption was significantly lower, and this did not affect LCPDs; when women represented the power core of decision-making about the purchase large-scale commodities for the household, EEPPs and DEU both tended to go green. The endogeneity and robustness tests also confirmed that the results were reliable and stable. Our findings provide new ideas for the government, which can contribute to the formulation of more effective energy-saving and emission-reduction strategies. © 2021","Conjugal power; Daily energy use; Endogeneity; Energy-efficient product purchase; Gender inequality; Household energy conservation","Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Sales; Surveys; Effective energy; Energy-efficient products; Gender-specific differences; Household expenditure; Industrial sector; Purchase decision; Questionnaire surveys; Robustness tests; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107857256

However, the low carbon-methane conversion rate limits its wide application due to the low degradation rate of RS during fermentation. This study investigated the effect of acclimatized paddy soil microorganisms using swine wastewater on degradation of RS before anaerobic digestion. The total organic carbon, reducing sugar and NH4+-N content of paddy soil + RS + swine wastewater (PRS) (653.50 mg/L) was higher than that of other groups after 19 days. The carboxymethyl cellulose activity (4.01 IU), cellulose/lignin ratio (5.25) and the degradation rate of lignin (51.96%) in PRS were higher than those of other groups. The Firmicutes (21.02%), Chloroflexi (12.48%), Proteobacteria (20.92%), and Bacteroidetes (25.78%) were the main fermentation phyla in PRS during acclimatization.

Under steady state, 99.9% of ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), 76.8% of orthophosphate, and 80.2% of total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency was achieved. The N2O emission factor during nitrification was 0.8–1.9% of the oxidized NH4-N. The emission factor increased to 7.4–45.9% with the coexistence of heterotrophic activities. Extending the anoxic time from 30 to 90 min reduced the N2O emission factor from 1.6 to 1.0%. N2O emission was stimulated with nitrite (NO2-N) as the electron acceptor, with the N2O emission factor of 5.2–5.6%. Denitrification with internal organic carbon contributed 6.8% of reduced NO2-N to N2O. NO2-N might exert a crucial role in N2O emission independent of carbon source. For the acclimated microbial communities, Nitrospira and Nitrosospira were the dominant nitrifiers and responsible for the N2O emission during nitrification. Azospira, Dechloromonas, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and unclassified genus of family Comamonadaceae might be responsible for N2O emission during denitrification.

The built environment has become a major focus for research into ways to reduce the climate effects of urban areas. Researchers who seek to model the performance of a large group of buildings, however, have available only complex simulation methods that require a massive amount of calculation if applied within an ordinary computer environment. Finding a simpler, more efficient modeling process would be a valuable contribution. This study selects a typical residential community as the simulation object, assigning boundary conditions derived from field measurements. A method of numerical simulation that treats buildings as porous media is applied to the area to simulate wind conditions. Results of the porous media method are compared with results from standard computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. Modeling results of the porous media method also are validated against physically measured data. Both validation methods indicate that the porous media method produces reliable results at a higher simulation efficiency. Compared with standard CFD method, in this study, the porous media method reduces the number of meshing grids by 27.8%, reduces the total iteration steps by 52.2% and reduces the total computational time by 66.7%. The porous media method is applicable to large-scale construction and intensive modeling, where it can effectively predict the wind environment at the initial planning stage. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CFD simulation; Porous media; Urban planning; Wind environment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105524817

Local communities, which have been facing extreme climates for a long time in their production and daily life, have developed some locally applicable traditional knowledge that has played an important role in their adaptation to extreme climate and disaster risk management. Therefore, this research aims to link Local knowledge (LK) to community extreme climate disaster risk management in order to construct a conceptual model. It then takes the extreme climate adaptation strategy of traditional nomads in a temperate grassland of China as an example to analyze the role of LK in extreme climate adaptation using the proposed theoretical framework. The main research objectives of this study are: (1) To construct a conceptual model to illustrate the relations among extreme climate events, risk management, LK, and farmers' adaptation strategies; (2) To apply the theoretical framework to a field case to reveal context-specific extreme climate adaptation mechanisms with LK as a critical component; (3) To test the framework and provide suggestions for the extreme climates adaptation, and the conservation of LK related to climate change adaptation. The results show that from the perspective of disaster risk management, local communities could manage extreme climates as a disaster risk through adaptation strategies formed from LK, because as a knowledge system, LK contains relevant knowledge covering the whole process of disaster risk management. © 2021, Science Press.

Focusing on the relationship between peak-shaving capacity of CHP units and the consumption of renewable energy generation, the problem about operational flexibility of CHP plants is analyzed in this paper. From the perspective of entire CHP plants rather than the renovation of one CHP unit, the problem regarding the operation scheduling without cost or risk is addressed. A plant-level operation domain model is established, which can improve the operational flexibility of CHP plants. The heat and power adjustable ranges of CHP plants were obtained by particle swarm optimization. Also the CHP plant located in northern China was taken as an example. The power load downward adjustment range of four periods in the heating season are 9.21%, 20.44%, 14.09% and 5.31% respectively, compared with the entire plant actual power under the same heat load. Moreover, the operational flexibility of CHP plants can be enlarged by decreasing the pressure of heating extraction. Compared with the entire plant actual operating conditions, the consumption of renewable energy generation could be increased by 268.56 million kWh approximately and about 0.22 million tons CO2 emissions can be reduced per heating season if the reference plant operates with minimum power load constantly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CHP; Flexibility; Operation domain; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Renewable energy generation","Cogeneration plants; Renewable energy resources; Thermoelectric power plants; Combined heat and power units; Combined-Heat and Power; Flexibility; Heat and power plants; Operation domain; Operational flexibility; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Power load; Renewable energy generation; Thermal-power plants; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105525633

A transparent and reproducible alternative method (ALT) of calculating PM2.5 from the particle numbers in three size categories was used in place of the estimates provided by Plantower, the manufacturer of the sensors used in PurpleAir monitors. The ALT method was superior in several ways (better precision, lower limit of detection, improved size distribution) compared to Plantower's CF1 or ATM data series. PurpleAir monitors were strongly correlated with the nearby US EPA Air Quality System AQS stations. A calibration factor (CF) ranging between 2.9 and 3.1 was empirically derived for the PurpleAir estimates using the ALT method. This value was based on comparing the average value of 177,329 PurpleAir measurements to the value calculated from the FEM stations. The monitoring period included about 13 weeks showing very high outdoor values due to several major fires covering several hundred thousand acres. The CF during these 13 weeks averaged 2.39, whereas the CF for the remaining 64 weeks averaged about 3.21, suggesting a different response to the smoke from wildfires compared with normal ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5).

We collected 6-day measures of indoor PM2.5 during the winter and evaluated household and stove-use characteristics in homes at three rural and diverse study sites. The median indoor PM2.5 concentration across all homes was 19 µg/m3, with higher concentrations in Alaska (median = 30, minimum = 4, maximum = 200, n = 10) and Navajo Nation homes (median = 29, minimum = 3, maximum = 105, n = 23) compared with Montana homes (median = 16, minimum = 2, maximum = 139, n = 59). Households that had not cleaned the chimney within the past year had 65% higher geometric mean PM2.5 compared to those with chimney cleaned within 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: −1, 170). Based on a novel wood stove grading method, homes with low-quality and medium-quality stoves had substantially higher PM2.5 compared to homes with higher-quality stoves (186% higher [95% CI: 32, 519] and 161% higher; [95% CI:27, 434], respectively). Our findings highlight the need for, and complex nature of, regionally appropriate interventions to reduce indoor air pollution in rural wood-burning regions.

Methods: The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO systematic review registry. Medline, CINAHL and Global Health databases were systematically searched. Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis was conducted using a non-informative prior to assess whether the regression coefficients differed across observations due to the heterogeneity among studies. Results: We identified 3248 records for title and abstract review, of which 309 underwent full text screening. Thirty-six studies were included, based on the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were from China (n = 14), India (n = 6) and the USA (n = 3). PM2.5 was the most frequently reported pollutant. PM was estimated using modelling techniques (22 studies), satellite-based measures (four studies) and direct measurements (ten studies). Mortality data were sourced from country-specific mortality statistics for 17 studies, Global Burden of Disease data for 16 studies, WHO data for two studies and life tables for one study. Sixteen studies were included in the Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that the annual estimate of premature mortality attributed to PM2.5 was 253 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI: 90, 643) and 587 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI: 1, 39,746) for PM10. Conclusion: 253 premature deaths per million population are associated with exposure to ambient PM2.5. We observed an unstable estimate for PM10, most likely due to heterogeneity among the studies. Future research efforts should focus on the effects of ambient PM10 and premature mortality, as well as include populations outside Asia. Key messages: Ambient PM2.5 is associated with premature mortality. Given that rapid urbanization may increase this burden in the coming decades, our study highlights the urgency of implementing air pollution mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to population and planetary health. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis; Particulate matter; PM10; PM2.5; Premature mortality","atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; meta-analysis; mortality; particulate matter; China; India; United States; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; Asia; Bayes theorem; China; environmental exposure; epidemiology; India; meta analysis; particulate matter; premature mortality; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Bayes Theorem; China; Environmental Exposure; India; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110300870

Through traded food, associated environmental impacts are also displaced as the consumer benefits from the product without incurring the externalities of production. Taking U.S. rice as an example, we discuss the sustainability implications of rewiring U.S. rice production and trade for reducing the impacts of irrigation (water and energy) and transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We model a series of robust optimization scenarios that re-arrange the origin of trade and therefore the production to target virtual water use and GHG emission reductions. For the baseline case, virtual water trade amounts to 35 billion m3, and embodied irrigation and transportation GHG emissions amount to 6 billion kg CO2-equivalent and 0.7 billion kg CO2-equivalent, respectively. Rewiring consistently achieves better results compared to the baseline even in the presence of uncertainty. However, our findings reveal strikingly sobering national-level savings in optimizing the water use (2%) and GHG emissions (14%) with tradeoffs in other impacts. To achieve these results, all rice-producing states undergo changes, with the state of Mississippi completely stopping production. California's unique ability to produce medium-grain rice at a large scale makes it indispensable for current rice production and hence a major constraint for rewiring rice production. The findings of this work reveal the inflexibility of our food system in balancing the food-energy-water nexus tradeoffs through restructuring trade. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","crop re-distribution; food trade; food-energy-water nexus; optimization","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Optimization; Sustainable development; Consumer benefits; Food production; Medium grains; National level; Rice production; Robust optimization; Virtual water trade; Water and energies; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111241102

It has also been proposed that prescribed fire can be used to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although prescribed fire creates emissions, if the treatment also decreases the incidence of subsequent wildfires, it is possible for the net outcome to be an emissions decline. Previous studies have suggested prescribed fire, at the frequencies required to materially impact wildfire occurrence, generally leads to net emissions increases. A focus on emissions means any change in carbon storage within the ecosystem remains unaccounted for; because living, dead, and soil carbon pools are characterized by different residence times, a re-distribution of carbon amongst these pools may either reduce or increase long-term ecosystem carbon stores. A full ecosystem carbon model has been developed to investigate the implications of prescribed fire management on total Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance (NECB), inclusive of both emissions and carbon storage. Consistent with previous work, the results suggested limited potential for reducing net GHG emissions through applying prescribed fire, with higher emissions from prescribed fire approximately offset by lower emissions and avoided carbon losses from the subsequent reduction in wildfire frequency. For example, shortening the prescribed fire interval from 25 to 10 years resulted in a NECB sequestration that was typically less than ±0.4 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, or less than approximately 0.1% of the total ecosystem carbon storage. Hence, whilst there was limited opportunity for achieving emission abatement outcomes from changing prescribed fire management, there were no significant emission penalties for doing so. These results suggest land managers should be free to adopt prescribed fire regimes to target specific management outcomes, without significantly impacting net emissions or total ecosystem carbon storage over the long term. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Fire severity; Net ecosystem carbon balance; Pyrogenic carbon; South-eastern Australia; Temperate forests","carbon; carbon; carbon sequestration; ecological modeling; emission control; fire management; greenhouse gas; prescribed burning; soil carbon; wildfire; Article; calibration; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; ecosystem; prescribed burning; retention time; soil; steady state; wildfire; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; fire; forest; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Fires; Forests; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105830893

The aim of the experiments is to reduce the warming that results from a high-tier emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP5-8.5) to that resulting from a medium-tier emission scenario (SSP2-4.5). These simulations aim to analyze the response of climate models to a reduction in incoming surface radiation as a means to reduce global surface temperatures, and they do so either by simulating a stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer or, in a more idealized way, through a uniform reduction in the solar constant in the model. We find that over the final two decades of this century there are considerable inter-model spreads in the needed injection amounts of sulfate (29±9Tg-SO2/yr between 2081 and 2100), in the latitudinal distribution of the aerosol cloud and in the stratospheric temperature changes resulting from the added aerosol layer. Even in the simpler G6solar experiment, there is a spread in the needed solar dimming to achieve the same global temperature target (1.91±0.44%). The analyzed models already show significant differences in the response to the increasing CO2 concentrations for global mean temperatures and global mean precipitation (2.05K±0.42K and 2.28±0.80%, respectively, for SSP5-8.5 minus SSP2-4.5 averaged over 2081-2100). With aerosol injection, the differences in how the aerosols spread further change some of the underlying uncertainties, such as the global mean precipitation response (-3.79±0.76% for G6sulfur compared to -2.07±0.40% for G6solar against SSP2-4.5 between 2081 and 2100). These differences in the behavior of the aerosols also result in a larger uncertainty in the regional surface temperature response among models in the case of the G6sulfur simulations, suggesting the need to devise various, more specific experiments to single out and resolve particular sources of uncertainty. The spread in the modeled response suggests that a degree of caution is necessary when using these results for assessing specific impacts of geoengineering in various aspects of the Earth system. However, all models agree that compared to a scenario with unmitigated warming, stratospheric aerosol geoengineering has the potential to both globally and locally reduce the increase in surface temperatures. © 2021 Daniele Visioni et al.",,"aerosol; climate modeling; CMIP; computer simulation; solar radiation; stratosphere; sulfate; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109200705

Since the region is characterized by summer water shortages and recurrent drought conditions, a summer irrigation water demand forecast system has been developed, operating both at regional and Land Reclamation and Irrigation Board levels. Remote sensing crop detection is used in combination with a soil water balance model as a monitoring tool in support to water management and to optimize the use of available water resources. These instruments are also integrated with operational calibrated probabilistic seasonal forecast products currently based on Copernicus Climate Services, in order to evaluate summer irrigation water needs in advance in support to decision-making by water managers. Results obtained using this prediction system are characterized by a significant forecast skill. The sources of the predictability of this system are specifically evaluated, showing that the correct representation of crop geographical distribution is crucial for the ability of the system to capture spatial variability in irrigation demand. Furthermore, the system forecast skill is mostly due to the use of an empirical model to assess the hypodermic water table depth initialized by means of the observed meteorological data of the months before the beginning of the summer season. Finally, calibrated probabilistic seasonal predictions also contribute to a minor extent to the good performance of the system as a whole. © 2021 The Authors.

Four different engineering control measures were studied in real-life office conditions by means of online NP measurements and indoor aerosol modeling. The studied engineering control measures were general ventilation, local exhaust ventilation (LEV), retrofitted enclosure, and retrofitted enclosure with LEV. Efficiency between different control measures was compared based on particle number and surface area (SA) concentrations from which SA concentration was found to be more reliable. The study found out that for regular or long-time use of ME desktop 3D printers, the general ventilation is not sufficient control measure for NP emissions. Also, the LEV with canopy hood attached above the 3D printer did not control the emission remarkably and successful position of the hood in relation to the nozzle was found challenging. Retrofitted enclosure attached to the LEV reduced the NP emissions 96% based on SA concentration. Retrofitted enclosure is nearly as efficient as enclosure attached to the LEV (reduction of 89% based on SA concentration) but may be considered more practical solution than enclosure with LEV. © 2021 The Authors.

In order to make buildings more comfortable, functional, efficient and safe, building services are used. Therefore, building services are the key to decrease their contribution to climate change. Due to the lack of organized literature on this topic, this paper presents the first comprehensive assessment of trends in the literature on building services related to climate change, which was completed by conducting a bibliometric analysis of the existing literature on the topic. The ultimate goal is to provide a source where researchers and other interested parties can find this information in an organized manner. Results show that the most abundant and recent studies related to building services are based on improving energy efficiency by optimizing systems such as ventilation or lighting, the latter with the installation of LED lights. In addition, recent studies have focused on social factors such as housing and urban growth. © 2021 by the authors.

This study targets a deep saline reservoir system (Soyatal and El Abra formations of Cretaceous age) by performing the first detailed analysis of the geological structure and petrophysical properties of the subsurface rocks in the study area. A comprehensive study of the stratigraphy and mineralogy was conducted with rocks from México's geologic repository (Litoteca Nacional). which included petrography, permeability, and CT scanning. The results were correlated with wireline logs and drilling reports of a dry well (Jasso-1) previously drilled for petroleum prospecting in the area. The integrated data identified a potential set of carbonaceous reservoir and caprock formations, with a preliminary storage capacity of 1.1 GTCO2. The industrial corridor in Tula de Allende includes a 300 KBPD refinery, an 1800 MW high-sulfur fuel oil- power plant, and cement factories, which contribute to air pollution that exceeds international limits of air quality of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), and particulates. A CCS project would not only improve the environmental quality for local inhabitants, reducing the atmospheric pollution in the immediate area but additionally have the same effects in Mexico City.

We used the Random Forests machine learning algorithm to model variability among plantations of Eucalyptus nitens in key wood properties affecting the value of solid-wood products. Using breast-height disk samples from 46 even-aged stands of different ages across the island of Tasmania, Australia, we modelled site variation in SilviScan-3TM derived estimates of wood density, microfibril angle and modulus of elasticity. Regional-scale models were developed with respect to plantation age, environmental and climatic variables. Wood density and MOE increased, and MFA decreased with age. Wood density and MOE decreased and MFA increased with elevation. Increasing elevation is associated with increasing annual precipitation and decreasing temperature, but the variation in wood properties was mainly associated with precipitation. Wood density decreased and MFA increased with annual precipitation. MOE was positively related to wood density and negatively related to MFA, thus as expected, increased with annual precipitation. Using the Random Forests climate models we demonstrate the potential for predicting and mapping wood properties relevant for solid wood products at a scale that is relevant to strategic planning by the forest industry. Such models allow quantification of the impact of different growing conditions on the wood properties of harvested logs and therefore on wood products. When coupled with genetic, growth and economic models, these wood property models have the potential to assist in characterisation of standing forest resources and future estate planning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Forest resource characterization; Microfibril angle; Modulus of elasticity; Non-parametric models; Plasticity; Wood density","Climate models; Decision trees; Economics; Forestry; Hardwoods; Machine learning; Natural resources; Plasticity; Timber; Wood products; Annual precipitation; Eucalyptus nitens; Forest resource characterization; Forest resources; Microfibril angles; Non-parametric modelling; Random forests; Solid wood products; Wood density; Wood properties; Elastic moduli; algorithm; climate modeling; ecological modeling; economic activity; evergreen forest; forest resource; machine learning; plantation forestry; wood; Economics; Forestry; Hardwoods; Natural Resources; Plasticity; Wood Products; Australia; Tasmania; Eucalyptus nitens; Tasmania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103778993

Drawing upon two strains of climate governance and collaborative governance literature, respectively, this article adopts a polycentric approach to the analysis of Oslo's urban climate governance. It unpacks the relationships between urban leadership, climate goal-setting and institutional design, and reveals how these variables condition the employment of a combination of integrative and interactive governing instruments that foster both self-governance and co-creation in climate responses. The article argues that broad and long-term political support facilitates the adoption of ambitious climate goals, utilization of regulatory powers, and the design and operations of innovative hybrid mixes of integrative and interactive governing instruments. The hybrid combination of instruments is what provides the basis for synergistic, predictable and dynamic forms of self-governance and co-created linkages among public and private ‘units’ within the wider urban climate governance ecosystem. Trans-local and transnational networks play an important role in building such capacities for urban climate governance. Local processes of co-creation and networked experimentations are ‘scaling up’ to change policies at city, national and international levels. The empirical observations from Oslo have implication for theories of polycentric urban climate governance and for the promise and limitations of co-creation in the climate arena.

Despite the benefits of this transition, including reduced environmental impacts to water and soil, previous studies demonstrated that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may increase if adequate levels of technological sophistication are not implemented. Considering that 58% of municipal solid waste (MSW) is organic, it seems plausible that a relevant portion of emissions can be linked directly to food loss and waste (FLW) management. This study aims to determine the GHG emissions mitigation potential in FLW compared to the current baseline scenario in 24 Peruvian cities, by modelling alternative technologies to treat organic MSW. Life cycle modelling was performed using the waste-LCA software EASETECH. Five treatment scenarios were modelled: i) open dumping; ii) landfilling with no gas treatment; iii) landfilling with landfill gas treatment; iv) landfilling with energy recovery; and, v) anaerobic digestion. GHG emissions of FLW generation proved to be substantially higher than those for FLW treatment. However, if sophisticated technologies are implemented in FLW treatment, an annual reduction of up to 1.56 Mt CO2eq could be attained. Moreover, despite the health and environmental benefits of a transition to optimized diets, in which, for example, meat consumption is reduced and vegetables are boosted, an important increase in FLW and, therefore, an increase in GHG emissions in the treatment phase is shown. However, if certain technologies, such as energy recovery or anaerobic digestion, were implemented, most carbon losses would be avoided. © 2021","Carbon footprint; Dietary patterns; Landfilling; Life cycle assessment; Peru; Waste treatment","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon footprint; Environmental technology; Food supply; Food waste; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Municipal solid waste; Waste disposal; Anaerobics; Dietary patterns; Energy recovery; Food loss; Food security; Food waste; Gas treatment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-fillings; Peru; Life cycle; carbon footprint; climate variation; dietary intake; food security; greenhouse gas; landfill; life cycle analysis; waste management; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; crop production; dumping; energy recovery; environmental policy; food handling; food processing; food security; food storage; food waste; human; landfill; life cycle assessment; meat consumption; nonhuman; Peru; vegetable consumption; waste disposal; waste gas management; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102991846

The carbon isotope composition of peat varies from –28.05 to –30.05‰ (average –29.15‰). The total PAH content varies from 11 to 360 ppb, with an average of 63 ppb and a median value of 34 ppb. Heavy compounds, such as benzo(a)anthracene and benzofluoranthenes, are prevalent among PAHs. The presence of PAHs in the peat is determined by three main factors: technogenic impact, wildfires, and biogeochemical soil processes. The prevalence of benzo(a)anthracene in the upper part of the palsa down to the bottom of the active layer suggests an anthropogenic impact (the influence of transport and domestic fuel combustion). The share of benzo(a)anthracene decreases with depth, while the share of benzofluoranthenes increases. Two sharp peaks of PAH content (260 and 360 ppb) are observed; they coincide with a local increase of carbon isotope values, most likely resulting from wildfires. The minimums in PAH content are presumably determined by the biogeochemical factor and the input of polyarenes generated by decomposition of plant residues. Carbon isotope composition of peat mainly reflects the isotope composition of vegetation, the degree of peat moistening, and the influence of pyrogenic factor. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Dystric Histosols; paleoenvironment; polyarenes; stable carbon isotopes; wildfires","active layer; biogeochemical cycle; carbon isotope; Histosol; isotopic composition; PAH; paleoenvironment; palsa; stable isotope; tundra; wildfire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111476426

However, the wider rumen metabolic response to methanogenic inhibition by 3-NOP and the (Formula presented.) intermediary metabolite requires further exploration. Furthermore, (Formula presented.) supplementation potently decreases CH4 emissions from cattle. The reduction of (Formula presented.) utilizes H2 and yields (Formula presented.), the latter of which may also inhibit rumen methanogens, although a different mode of action than for 3-NOP and its (Formula presented.) derivative was hypothesized. Our objective was to explore potential responses of the fermentative and methanogenic metabolism in the rumen to 3-NOP, (Formula presented.) and their metabolic derivatives using a dynamic mechanistic modeling approach. An extant mechanistic rumen fermentation model with state variables for carbohydrate substrates, bacteria and protozoa, gaseous and dissolved fermentation end products and methanogens was extended with a state variable of either 3-NOP or (Formula presented.). Both new models were further extended with a (Formula presented.) state variable, with (Formula presented.) exerting methanogenic inhibition, although the modes of action of 3-NOP-derived and (Formula presented.) -derived (Formula presented.) are different. Feed composition and intake rate (twice daily feeding regime), and supplement inclusion were used as model inputs. Model parameters were estimated to experimental data collected from the literature. The extended 3-NOP and (Formula presented.) models both predicted a marked peak in H2 emission shortly after feeding, the magnitude of which increased with higher doses of supplement inclusion. The H2 emission rate appeared positively related to decreased acetate proportions and increased propionate and butyrate proportions. A decreased CH4 emission rate was associated with 3-NOP and (Formula presented.) supplementation.

It particularly focuses on the factors that contribute to the success (or lack thereof) of urban climate governance experimentation. It finds that the city’s government has been successful in developing and trialing some but not all experiments and that the overall results of these are promising in certain areas of city development and use.

We have implemented (regional) superparametrization of the ECMWF weather model OpenIFS [2] by cloud-resolving, three-dimensional large-eddy simulations. This setup, described in [3], contains a two-way coupling between a global meteorological model that resolves large-scale dynamics, with many local instances of the Dutch Atmospheric Large Eddy Simulation (DALES) [4], resolving cloud and boundary layer physics. The model is currently prohibitively expensive to run over climate or even seasonal time scales, and a global SP requires the allocation of millions of cores. In this paper, we study the performance and scaling behavior of the LES models and the coupling code and present our implemented optimizations. We mimic the observed load imbalance with a simple performance model and present strategies to improve hardware utilization in order to assess the feasibility of a world-covering superparametrization.

The usage of the co-produced digestate can lead to high acidification and eutrophication impacts, but this aspect is often not considered, neither is the way different substitution methods for the digestate affect the results. In this work we address these issues performing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of CBG production through anaerobic digestion of animal manure and municipal organic waste (MOW). GHG savings of 93%–131% compared to the fossil diesel benchmark in the Renewable Energy Directive were found, thus complying with the 60% reduction target. The ammonia emissions during the digestate application make acidification and terrestrial eutrophication the main environmental burdens of CBG from MOW, leading to a 142% and a 715% increase for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication respectively, compared to fossil diesel. When CBG is produced from manure and the avoidance of manure storage emission is considered, a 257% and a 700% lower acidification and terrestrial eutrophication impact was found. Our results suggest that better manure-storage techniques are required and that field emissions due to digestate application, which is sensitive to pH and nitrogen content, should be reduced. It was further demonstrated that including the digestate fertilizing emissions in the system boundaries of the LCA of CBG production and substitution of both mineral fertilizer production and usage have a great impact on the outcome, but also introduce uncertainty of the results. The outcome of this work was used to suggest recommendations on the methodology for future LCA studies on CBG production and EU biofuel regulations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Digestate; Life cycle assessment; Manure; Municipal organic waste; Renewable energy directive","Acidification; Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Diesel engines; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Anaerobics; Biogas production; Digestate; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life-cycle environmental impact; Manure; Manure storages; Municipal organic waste; Organic wastes; Renewable energy directive; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105086990

Results of theoretical calculations of the formation of these products are presented here where the transition state energy for various mechanisms is evaluated as a function of applied voltage. The calculations are based on electron density functional theory combined with searches of saddle points on the energy surface describing the system at a given voltage, and the simulated system includes a few water molecules explicitly while the rest of the dielectric is represented as a continuum. The mechanism for HCOO-formation is found to involve concerted electron and hydrogen atom transfer to CO2while CO is formed in two concerted electron and proton transfer steps with adsorbed COOH as an intermediate. Conversion of COOH to HCOOH is not a viable process as it involves a transition state of high energy so the formation of HCOOH and CO products does not have a common intermediate but rather represents competing reaction paths. The energies of the transition states of the rate-limiting steps for these two paths are almost equal, consistent with the onset potential being similar. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Copper; Density functional theory; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Formic acid; Molecules; Reaction intermediates; Copper electrodes; Electrochemical reductions; Hydrogen-atom transfer; On-electron density; Rate-limiting steps; Theoretical calculations; Transition state; Transition state energies; Activation energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110409359

The study explains how the municipal organizational robustness and external institutional dynamics moderate the relation between capacities, leadership, and local government investment decisions. We examine hypotheses on moderating effects with regression methods, using data from 345 Chilean municipalities over a nine-year period, and analyzing the evidence with support of qualitative data. Our results reveal that municipal organizational robustness-operational rules, planning, managerial flexibility and integration, and accountability-is the most quantitatively outstanding moderating factor. The evidence leads us to deduce that efforts to support local governments in the emerging policy domain of resilient critical infrastructure require special attention to the robustness of municipal institutional arrangements. The results are valid for countries where the local governments have responsibilities to fulfill and their decisions have consequences for the adaptation. Since one of the objectives of the Special Issue “Bringing Governance Back Home-Lessons for Local Government Regarding Rapid Climate Action” is to explore how action is enabled or constrained by institutional relations in which the actors are embedded, this study contributes to achieving the goal. © 2021 by the authors.","Capacities; Chile; Critical infrastructure investment; Governance; Local governments; Municipal organizational robustness; Political leadership attributes","adaptive management; decision analysis; extreme event; infrastructural development; investment; local government; organizational framework; risk assessment; weather; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111381259

This paper explores the new application for the urban rail system as a sustainable solution for urban freight distribution. A significant problem in using rail for urban freight is determining the most efficient tram route, in terms of related costs and accessibility for the distribution centers and end-users. The study takes a systematic approach, based on identifying scenarios, existing tramlines, traveled distances, and time durations, and appraises the scheme through an energy consumption analysis to assess a hypothetical freight tram scheme. In a German case study in Berlin, a freight tram system delivered the goods of five delivery companies from their logistics hubs in the Pankow district to a micro depot instead of to the trucks. Three different path scenarios from logistics hubs to the micro depot were developed, to make comparisons based on energy consumption. Freight tram implementation in Berlin (compared to the current situation) resulted in a reduction of more than 7 tons of CO2 emissions per year, and 60 road-vehicle-kilometers per day, in exchange for 275 MJ of daily electric consumption. © 2021 by the authors.

Still, research has emphasized a small subset of potentially useful precursor materials. With the goal of expanding the precursor pool, this work presents results of parallel literature mining and rate modeling activities. As a result of literature mining, materials with appropriate SiO2, Al2O3, and CaO concentrations were assembled into a comprehensive, representative ternary diagram. 23 000+ materials were extracted from 7000 journal articles, and 7500 materials from 6000 articles with 80 ≤ SiO2 + Al2O3 + CaO ≤105 wt% automatically classified. Both supervised and semi-supervised models were used for dissolution rate prediction of glassy materials with all models pulling from a single data set (n = 802 reported dissolution rates from 105 different glasses). Supervised modeling utilized linear and decision tree regressions to determine features most predictive of dissolution rate, resulting in log-linear relationships between rate and pH, inverse temperature (1/K), and non-bridging oxygen per tetrahedron (NBO/T). Semi-supervised modeling was observed to be more robust to broader feature inclusion, providing similar predictive ability with a relatively larger set of descriptive features. Most importantly, results indicated that models trained on data from disparate scientific communities were adequately predictive (RMSE ≈ 1), particularly under pH ≥7 conditions relevant to the cement and alkali activation communities. © 2020 The American Ceramic Society","akali activation; aluminosilicates; amorphous; modeling/model; solubility","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Calcium oxide; Carbon footprint; Cement industry; Cements; Concrete industry; Concrete products; Decision trees; Dissolution; Glass; Silica; Silicon; Thermal logging; Cement and concretes; Decision tree regression; Inverse temperatures; Linear relationships; Non-bridging oxygen; Precursor materials; Predictive abilities; Scientific community; Inverse problems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100836354

Future changes in precipitation patterns related to climate change are likely to have the greatest impacts on society. The new generation of geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites provide high-resolution observations and opportunities to improve our understanding of precipitation processes. This study contributes to improved precipitation characterization and retrievals from space by identifying precipitation types (e.g., convective and stratiform) with multispectral observations from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sensor onboard the GOES-16 satellite. A machine-learning-based classification model is developed by deriving a comprehensive set of features using five ABI channels and numerical weather prediction observations, and trained with the Ground Validation Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor (GV-MRMS) system as a benchmark. The developed prognostic model shows skillful performance in identifying the occurrence/nonoccurrence of precipitation (accuracy of 97%; Kappa coefficient of 0.9) and precipitation processes, with overall classification accuracy of 76% and Kappa coefficient of 0.56.

Albeit inexpensive copper electro-catalyzes CO2to hydrocarbons at reasonable rates, it suffers from low selectivity due to high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. Although an increase in bulk pH suppresses HER activity, this leads to a CO2reaction with hydroxide and the formation of bicarbonate and carbonate ions. In contrast, we demonstrate selective HER suppression by functionalizing Cu electrocatalysts with pyridine molecules without a commensurate reduction in CO2RR activity. Density functional theory (DFT) based computational results suggest that the decrement in the H binding energy and blockage of step edge atoms (which are the most active sites for the HER) by pyridine molecules are the reasons for selective suppression of the HER activity on the copper surface after pyridine functionalization. Further, an insignificant decrease in CO binding is the reason behind the lack of suppression of the CO2RR activity. This study provides pointers towards better electrocatalyst design for the CO2RR. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Binding energy; Binding sites; Carbon dioxide; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Electrocatalysts; Global warming; Hydrogen; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Molecules; Pollution control; Pyridine; Reaction rates; Reduction; Carbon dioxide reduction; Computational results; Copper surface; Functionalizations; Hydrogen evolution; Proton concentrations; Pyridine molecules; Renewable electricity; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110784529

Correlation, principal component analysis (PCA) and neutralization indicators as source apportionment methods were used to determine atmospheric acid precursors. Results show that the collected samples were severely acidified with pH value of 5.5 in oil producing communities and weak acid: pH 6.5 in non oil producing areas and varied with seasons. Fractional acidity (FA) constituted 98–99% of neutralizing ability, neutralization factor (NF) recorded Cl−, Ca2+ and NH4+ in values of 0.41, 0.43 and 0.003 with Ca2+ from sea salt, being the most neutralizing substance than NH4+from agricultural practice. The neutralizing and acidifying potentials (NP/AP) recorded a mean of 0.4, showing weak alkaline effect on atmospheric acid rain in oil producing communities. The positive correlation among ionic species implicates pH, SO42+and NO3 as causes of severe atmospheric acidity.

After years of implementation, the policy has brought positive impacts and mobilized remarkable financial resources for forest management, protection and development and also improve living standard of people whose lives depend on the forest. However, until now PFES has focused on target sectors of clean water and tourism; other potential sectors such as industrial companies, have not been applied. This research aims to identify opportunities and challenges of Carbon PFES from industrial companies that have been causing large GHGs emission. Quang Ninh and Thanh Hoa-the two largest provinces in Vietnam are selected to collect data and estimate GHG emissions from coal-fired thermal power plants and cement plants; and also to identify sequestration capacity of forest-based C services that are providing boundary in the two provinces. As the result, average emission factors for pulverized coal, circulating fluidized bed and rotary kiln technology were 1.05 tCO2/MWh, 1.11 tCO2/MWh and 0.85 tCO2/ton of clinker, respectively. In 2018, total CO2 emissions from thermal power and cement industry in Thanh Hoa and Quang Ninh were 11,395,545 tCO2, and 31,938,232 tCO2, respectively. Meanwhile, CO2 absorption capacity of all forest types in these two provinces were 4,302,474 tCO2 and 3,191,060 tCO2, respectively. It means about 38% of CO2 emitted in the year from these industries can be absorbed by the forests in Thanh Hoa and about only 10% of that can be absorbed by the forests in Quang Ninh. It is also found that more than 17% of CO2 yearly emitted from both industries can be absorbed by the forests in both provinces.

Conversely, global wind power installed capacity is continuously growing during the last years. The economic viability and sustainability of centralized wind projects relies heavily on wind resources, efficient technologies, and an attractive and dynamic Feed-in-Tariff (FIT). Therefore, this study assesses the potential effect of global warming on the life-cycle techno-economic viability of future wind power projects in Central Asia, specifically in Kazakhstan. Hence, the Ereymentau Wind Power Plant (WPP) in the Northern region of Kazakhstan was selected as case study. Historic data showed that monthly averaged wind speed and ambient pressure can be treated as statistically stationary, and only the air density drop due to temperature increase of 0.2°C per decade is assumed in the present study. Our results predict a reduction in Net Present Value, Benefit–Cost Ratio, and Internal Rate of Return of 29 million KZT, of 0.0015, and 0.03%, respectively, in the lifetime of Ereymentau WPP. Moreover, an Equity payback increase of 0.4 years and a drop of 987 tCO2e in GHG emission reductions are projected. Consequently, our results indicate that global warming, despite of being a global problem of significance, would have a negligible impact in ongoing plans to develop the wind potential in Northern regions of Eurasian countries sharing similar conditions to those present in Ereymentau-Kazakhstan. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Central Asia; climate change; global warming; life-cycle cost analysis; RETScreen expert; wind power","Earnings; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Wind; Ambient pressures; Economic viability; Efficient technology; Internal rate of return; Potential effects; Temperature increase; Wind power production; Wind power projects; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100839925

The growth of key world economies has led to an increase in the use of construction materials and therefore in the demand for cement, particularly in the Asian region. With increasing interest on sustainability issues, environmental concerns posed by the cement industry in Myanmar were investigated in order to explore options to mitigate emissions and subsequent environmental impacts. Comparative life cycle assessments were conducted including a base scenario (existing cement production scheme) and five alternative scenarios developed mostly with a focus on energy efficiency and the use of alternative fuels and materials. A cradle-to-gate system boundary was considered, limiting the scope of the study to raw material extraction, transportation and manufacturing. The impact assessment was performed based on the ReCiPe (2016) method. The results showed that the mitigation options employed in specific scenarios led to a significant reduction in major emissions and consequent environmental impacts in comparison with the base scenario. Above all, the ideal scenario (combination of all possible mitigation options) showed the best results enabling a decrease in emissions of CO2 by 10–50%, NOx by 5–23%, SO2 by 4–20% and PM2.5 by 6–22% compared to a base scenario. This resulted in a reduction of major environmental impacts by 10–50% for climate change, 6–27% for photochemical oxidant formation: ecosystem quality, 7–22% for particulate matter formation, 6–22% for terrestrial acidification and 8–64% for fossil resource scarcity. © 2021","Cement; Emissions; Environmental performance; Life cycle assessment; Myanmar","Alternative fuels; Cement manufacture; Cements; Climate change; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Life cycle; Manufacture; Materials handling; Raw materials; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Cement manufacturing; Comparative life cycle assessment; Energy intensive industries; Environmental concerns; Particulate matter formations; Photochemical oxidants; Raw material extraction; Sustainability issues; Cement industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099523177

Management policies that fail to account for non-stationary dynamics may fail to achieve management objectives. We establish a framework for understanding optimal strategies for managing a theoretical harvested population under non-stationarity. Building from harvest theory, we develop scenarios representing changes in population growth rate ((Formula presented.)) or carrying capacity ((Formula presented.)) and derive time-dependent optimal harvest policies using stochastic dynamic programming. We then evaluate the cost of falsely assuming stationarity by comparing the outcomes of forward projections in which either the optimal policy or a stationary policy is applied. When (Formula presented.) declines over time, the stationary policy leads to an underharvest of the population, resulting in less harvest over the short term but leaving the population in a higher-value state. When (Formula presented.) declines over time, the stationary policy leads to overharvest, resulting in greater harvest returns in the short term but leaving the population in a lower and potentially more vulnerable state. This work demonstrates the basic properties of time-dependent harvest management and provides a framework for evaluating the many outstanding questions about optimal management strategies under climate change.

The development strategy of the world community is determined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals. According to this document, one of the priorities is to eliminate the harmful effects of carbon fuel emissions. In the world, about 80% of the energy produced is produced by burning carbon, which leads to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Annual CO2 emissions reach 33.1 billion tons, causing irreparable damage to the environment. Our nature will continue to develop and evolve under these conditions, but the drastic climate change, global warming, and the mutation of flora and fauna are tasks that require immediate solutions. As a solution to these problems, we can offer the use of alternative energy sources. They represent promising ways to obtain, transfer and use energy from renewable sources, reducing the risk of harm to the environment. Also, to reduce harmful CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are proposed, including carbon dioxide sequestration technologies, which are implemented in the form of CC (U) S (carbon capture, utilization and storage) projects. Another solution to the tasks set can be the creation of carbon landfills and farms that will allow us to develop technologies for monitoring carbon emissions and runoff. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Sustainable development; Transmissions; Alternative energy source; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Carbon emissions; Carbon fuels; CO2 emissions; Development strategies; Energy from renewable sources; Harmful effects; Environmental protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110081900

Those with intersecting disadvantages, such as women, the poor, and ethnic minority groups, may be particularly affected. Understanding and assessing di-verse vulnerabilities, especially those related to ethnicity, are therefore potentially important to the development of policies and programs aimed at enabling adaptation in such groups. This study uses a livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) method, along with qualitative data analysis, to compare the vulnerability of different smallholder farmers in Son La province, one of the poorest provinces in Vietnam. Data were collected from 240 households, representing four minority ethnic groups. The results indicated that household vulnerability is influenced by factors such as income diversity, debt, organizational membership, support from and awareness by local authorities, access to health services, water resources, and location. Results revealed that two of the ethnic groups’ households were, on average, more vulnerable, particularly regarding livelihood strategies, health, water, housing and productive land, and social network items when compared to the other two ethnic groups. The study shows the need for targeted interventions to reduce the vulnerability of these and simi-larly placed small ethnic communities. © 2021 by the authors.

We carry out a systematic review of the academic literature to understand the key barriers and corresponding strategies for financing urban NBS. First, we report on specific financing challenges and strategies found for NBS uptake in four urban ecological domains: buildings, facades and roofs; urban green space (parks, trees); allotment gardens (including urban agriculture); and green-blue infrastructure. Across domains, we identify two overarching barriers of NBS finance: (1) coordination between private and public financiers and (2) integration of NBS benefits into valuation and accounting methods. We discuss strategies found in the literature that address these barriers; here, two things stand out. One, there is a large variety of valuation strategies that does not yet allow for an integrated accounting and valuation framework for NBS. Two, strategies aimed at coordinating public/private finance generally look for ways to encourage specific actors (real estate developers, residents) that benefit privately from an NBS to provide co-financing. We visualize our findings into a framework for enabling (public and/or private) finance for upscaling urban NBS. © 2021 The Author(s)","Green urban infrastructure; Nature-based solutions; Public-private finance; Sustainable finance; Sustainable innovation","integrated approach; nature-society relations; public-private partnership; strategic approach; sustainability; adult; agriculture; female; finance; financial management; human; land use; male; real estate; resident; review; systematic review; city; sustainable growth; tree; Cities; Sustainable Growth; Trees",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104103545

To mitigate deforestation, it is necessary to know the relevant stakeholders’ roles and interactions and deepen our knowledge of the local livelihoods, objectives, potentials, limitations, and “rights of being” among farms, as well as the best management practices (BMPs). In this study, our aim was to identify and assess livestock BMPs along an elevational gradient to foster sustainable production and reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). This approach could be environmentally and economically beneficial. Data were collected from 167 households along three elevational gradients, as well as from 15 interviews held among a multidisciplinary panel of key stakeholders and researchers in the EAR. The results showed that most of the Kichwa population lives in the medium zone, which features a larger agricultural and forest surface. Conversely, in the lower and upper areas, livestock predominates, where the upper area is specialized in milk production and the lower area in dual-purpose cattle (meat and dairy). The stakeholder assessment provided several key results: (a) social, structural, and technical factors have complementary effects on BMP adoption; (b) the sixteen assessed BMPs facilitated the implementation of existing financial incentive programs and enabled public–private partnerships to develop REDD+ projects. The policy implications of implementing these approaches are also discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

Dust emission can cause respiratory diseases among workers and adjacent residents of the factory and environmental pollution in the region. This study aims to reduce dust emissions of an iron ore concentrate plant in Iran. Applying dust control methods can affect the production process. Therefore, in this study, the value engineering (VE) method has been used, which focuses on improving the processes without affecting the main functions. This method is implemented in three stages. In the pre-study stage of VE, the prerequisites of study, such as determining the management requirements, study scope, evaluation criteria, forming the VE team, and planning, were met. In the study stage, the required information was collected; the studied process functions were identified and ranked; 62 ideas were created based on the functions and then evaluated; the final scenarios for the selected device, hopper, were developed and ranked using the VIKOR method; and finally, confirmation of the results by the management was obtained. In the post-study stage, the results will be implemented. The approach of this study was based on maintaining the functions of the production process and production rate and finding the most effective solution to reduce dust and environmental hazards, the most efficient solution in terms of performance, and the most cost-effective solution in terms of fixed and variable costs. According to the results, dry and wet dust suppression systems are the best options among the scenarios to meet the objectives of this study. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Dust emission; Iron ore concentrate; Production process; Value engineering; VIKOR","atmospheric pollution; ecological engineering; emission control; industrial emission; iron ore; mining industry; occupational exposure; particulate matter; respiratory disease; Iran; iron; iron derivative; dust; human; Iran; pollution; Dust; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Iran; Iron; Iron Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102848004

These induce a change in the cellular homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are known to react with cellular components, including DNA, lipids, and pro-teins, and to interfere with hormone signaling via several post-translational modifications (PTMs). Protein carbonylation (PC) is a non-enzymatic and irreversible PTM induced by ROS. The non-enzymatic feature of the carbonylation reaction has slowed the efforts to identify functions regulated by PC in plants. Yet, in prokaryotic and animal cells, studies have shown the relevance of protein carbonylation as a signal transduction mechanism in physiological processes including hydrogen peroxide sensing, cell proliferation and survival, ferroptosis, and antioxidant response. In this review, we provide a detailed update on the most recent findings pertaining to the role of PC and its implications in various physiological processes in plants. By leveraging the progress made in bacteria and animals, we highlight the main challenges in studying the impacts of car-bonylation on protein functions in vivo and the knowledge gap in plants. Inspired by the success stories in animal sciences, we then suggest a few approaches that could be undertaken to overcome these challenges in plant research. Overall, this review describes the state of protein carbonylation research in plants and proposes new research avenues on the link between protein carbonylation and plant redox biology. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous work in the area has argued that organic carbon isotope (δ13Corg) excursions can be used for chemostratigraphic correlation within these continental depositional environments, most importantly for the identification of the KPB where impact evidence is unavailable. However, it is unclear how modern surficial weathering affects δ13Corg values, particularly in terrestrial depositional settings, and whether standard sampling methods are sufficient to obtain unaltered rock material. We tested the fidelity of the terrestrial δ13Corg record with respect to surficial alteration and contamination through investigation of different field sampling techniques, including hand trenches, a backhoe-excavated trench, and sediment coring. We find that δ13Corg values in hand and backhoe trenched sections are more positive than δ13Corg values in cored sections, implying that modern surficial alteration affects δ13Corg values but not overall trends. A negative δ13Corg excursion associated with the KPB is present in most sections we analyzed, but it does not appear to be unique within our sections. The KPB excursion occurs within a coal layer, and we observe similar excursions within other carbon-rich lithologies. Given that we cannot disentangle local lithological effects from global atmospheric changes, we conclude that a negative δ13Corg excursion is not an unequivocal indicator of the KPB in the Hell Creek area. © 2021","Chemostratigraphy; Cretaceous; Extinction; Hell Creek; Paleogene; δ13C","carbon isotope; Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; iridium; lithology; sampling; sediment core; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis; weathering; Montana; United States; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105952232

The hydrogen/hydrogen peroxide blends are supplemented with steam for NOx emissions reduction purposes. The objective of the current work is to explore fundamental aspects of the proposed technology, with an emphasis on identifying the key chemical pathways that control the ignition delay time and NOx emissions, using mathematical tools from the computational singular perturbation (CSP) approach. The proposed technology demonstrates a noteworthy potential for use in CI engines, since a 10% (per fuel volume) addition of hydrogen peroxide decreases the ignition delay time to 1 ms, while the mass fraction of NO in equilibrium drops by 100%. Reactions H + O2 → OH + O and H + O2 (+M) → HO2 (+M) play key roles in the acceleration of the ignition delay time, while the thermal and the NNH mechanisms are identified as the dominant pathways for the production of NO. A further 12% addition of steam (per mixture's volume) induces a two orders of magnitude drop to NO emissions and slightly increases the ignition delay time by 8%. Finally, at sufficiently high steam addition conditions (in the region of 30% and above by mixture's volume), the system exhibits two stage ignition (mainly owed to reaction HO2 + OH → H2O + O2), a phenomenon that is unique, considering that the initial mixture includes solely hydrogen-based chemical species. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Additive; CSP; Diesel engines; Explosive dynamics; Hydrogen; NOx","Additives; Diesel engines; Drops; Emission control; Hydrogen; Hydrogen peroxide; Ignition; Mixtures; Oxidation; Steam; 'current; Chemical dynamics; Compression ignition; Computational singular perturbation; Condition; Explosive dynamics; Hydrogen-air mixture; Ignition delay time; NOx emissions; OH$+-$; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103418915

We showed that the carbon emissions directly caused by land use change (direct ELUC) during 1992–2015 was 26.54 Pg C (1.15 Pg C yr-1), with a decreased trend and a net reduction rate of −0.15 Pg C yr-1. The areas that exhibited reductions were concentrated in South America, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia, and those with increments were scattered in Northwestern North America, Eastern South America, Central Africa, East Asia, and parts of Southeast Asia. For the indirect carbon emissions from the utilization of built-up land (indirect ELUC), it manifested an upward trend with a total emission of 27.51 Pg C (1.2 Pg C yr-1). The total value resulted by global ELUC was $136.3 × 109 US, and the value of annual was equivalent to 3.7 times the GDP of the Central African Republic in 2015 ($5.93 × 109 US yr-1). Among the 79 countries and regions considered in this study, 54 represented the upward GDP with increased emissions, and only 25 experienced GDP growth with emission reductions. These findings highlight the pivotal role of land use change in the carbon cycle and the significance of coordinated development between GDP and carbon emissions. © 2021","Carbon emissions; Land use; Soil organic carbon; Temporal-spatial change; Vegetation biomass carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111213008

However, our understanding of the effects and determining factors is still limited, especially in the deep soil layer. Here, we investigated the diversity and composition of soil bacterial communities in different soil layers along a 1,500-m elevational gradient in the Taibai Mountain. The variables associated with climate conditions, plant communities, and soil properties were analyzed to assess their contributions to the variations in bacterial communities. Soil bacterial richness and α-diversity showed a hump-shaped trend with elevation in both surface and deep layers. In the surface layer, pH was the main factor driving the elevational pattern in bacterial diversity, while in the deep layer, pH and soil carbon (C) availability were the two main predictors. Bacterial community composition differed significantly along the elevational gradient in all soil layers. In the surface layer, Acidobacteria, Delta-proteobacteria, and Planctomycetes were significantly more abundant in the lower elevation sites than in the higher elevation sites; and Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, and Beta-proteobacteria were more abundant in the higher elevation sites. In the deep layer, AD3 was most abundant in the highest elevation site. The elevational pattern of community composition co-varied with mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, diversity and basal area of trees, pH, soil C availability, and soil C fractions.

As China seeks to reduce CO2 emissions intensity further, understanding how intensity differs provincially and regionally, as well as why, will be important for developing equitable management strategies. The Kaya-Theil model has been extensively applied to analyze the emission inequality; however, there have been no studies focusing on the inequality in carbon intensity in the different sectors and from different resource types in China. Here, we develop a comprehensive analysis on the inequality in China’s carbon intensity from both sectoral and energy perspectives from 1997 to 2016. The Theil index is decomposed into the within-region inequality and between-region inequality based on four economic development strategies. We used the LMDI decomposition analysis to identify the driving factors of the inequality (GDP share, emission coefficients, energy structure, energy intensity and economic structure). We find that after a decline in the inequality from 2003 to 2009, the inequality in the total carbon intensity increased by 28.4% from 2009 to 2016, mainly from an increase in the inequality from the industry sector (+ 53.1%), construction sector (+ 47.6%) and coal (+ 40.6%). The within-region inequality was the main source of the inequality in the carbon intensity, accounting for more than 60% of the inequality of the total carbon intensity from 2009 to 2016. Further decomposition identified the energy intensity disparity as the key driving factor of the carbon intensity inequality, inducing a 26.5% increase of the inequality from 2009 to 2016. Moreover, our results demonstrate how the structural transformation of energy and economic structure impact the inequality in carbon intensity.

Determining the contribution of wind erosion of soil to the concentration of atmospheric PM is essential for the formulation of management strategies. In this study, we determined the contribution values (CVs) which denote the contribution of dust emissions to PM2.5 or PM10 levels, and the sharing rates (SRs) which denote the proportion of PM2.5 and PM10 emissions from soil to atmosphere in Ningxia, located in the upper arms of the Yellow River in western China. The results showed that, at a spatial scale, except in the summer, the CVs and SRs followed the order Guyuan &gt; Yinchuan &gt; Shizuishan &gt; Zhongwei &gt; Wuzhong, and the impact of wind erosion of soil on ambient air quality in Guyuan was higher than that in other cities; at a temporal scale, the CVs and SRs of dust emissions followed the order spring &gt; winter &gt; autumn &gt; summer. The impact of wind erosion of soil on ambient air quality was highest in spring; the total PM2.5 and PM10 emissions were highest from cultivated land, followed by sandy land, grassland, forest land, and bare land. Our results are consistent with those obtained using chemical mass balance (CMB), which is the model for source apportionment of atmospheric PM (fitting verification R2 &gt; 0.9), indicating that this approach can be used to estimate dust emissions due to wind erosion of soil on a large scale. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","A box model; Contribution values (CVs); Sharing rates (SRs); Wind erosion of soil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108582542

The existing dams in the river basin have been incorporated in the model setups, calibration and validation. The COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment datasets for South-Asia (CORDEX-SA) at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution for four-time horizons, viz., 1970–05 (historical), 2006–40 (near-term), 2041–70 (mid-term) and 2071–99 (end-term) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 has been used to investigate the changes in the future climate and simulation of future streamflow. The proposed dams have also been incorporated for modeling the future developmental scenarios. The scenario analysis based on the projected climate variables has led to the inference that the change in the precipitation pattern coupled with the warming trends, maybe contributing towards higher variability in water availability. A future scenario of lower water availability and higher water demands thus calls for optimal utilization of available water resources in the future, so that the higher water demands can be satisfied with lower anticipated future flows. Various alternatives were explored for devising adaptation strategies using the engineering/technical solutions in which the optimal water resources management approaches were explored using the simulation-only and the genetic algorithm based simulation–optimization approaches. The simulation–optimization framework based integrated reservoir operation of four reservoirs has led to better reservoir performance and the number of irrigation failures has decreased substantially from 92 to 12 during 2006–40, 86 to 22 during 2041–70 and 89 to 10 during 2071–99.

Projections of shoreline retreat are highly uncertain, however, namely due to deeply uncertain mean sea level projections and the absence of consensus on a coastal impact model. An improved understanding and a better quantification of these sources of deep uncertainty are hence required to improve coastal risk management and inform adaptation decisions. In this work we present and apply a new extra-probabilistic framework to develop shoreline change projections of sandy coasts that allows consideration of intrinsic (or aleatory) and knowledge-based (or epistemic) uncertainties exhaustively and transparently. This framework builds upon an empirical shoreline change model to which we ascribe possibility functions to represent deeply uncertain variables. The model is applied to two local sites in Aquitaine (France) and Castellón (Spain). First, we validate the framework against historical shoreline observations and then develop shoreline change projections that account for possible (although unlikely) low-end and high-end mean sea level scenarios. Our high-end projections show for instance that shoreline retreats of up to 200ĝ€¯m in Aquitaine and 130ĝ€¯m in Castellón are plausible by 2100, while low-end projections revealed that 58 and 37ĝ€¯m modest shoreline retreats, respectively, are also plausible. Such extended intervals of possible future shoreline changes reflect an ambiguity in the probabilistic description of shoreline change projections, which could be substantially reduced by better constraining sea level rise (SLR) projections and improving coastal impact models. We found for instance that if mean sea level by 2100 does not exceed 1ĝ€¯m, the ambiguity can be reduced by more than 50ĝ€¯%. This could be achieved through an ambitious climate mitigation policy and improved knowledge on ice sheets. © Copyright:",,"beach morphology; coastal erosion; geomorphological response; ice sheet; probability; quantitative analysis; sand; sea level change; shoreline change; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis; Aquitaine; Castellon; Comunidad Valencia; France; Nouvelle-Aquitaine; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112610395

Increased pressure for reducing CO2 emissions poses new challenges to policy-makers who try to promote economic growth and environmental protection in tandem. Since 2010, 19 scenic areas in China have been declared as low-carbon tourism demonstration zones. It follows that investigating whether CO2 emissions originating in the tourism industry could, in fact, compromise sustainable development in China becomes an essential area of study. Whilst this is a key concern to society, there are only a limited number of studies that analyse the environmental impact of tourism and the validity of the tourism-led-growth hypothesis. This study considers both domestic and international tourism and explicitly tests the relationship among tourism development, economic growth and CO2 emissions in China, employing a panel vector autoregressive model and utilising regional data between 2006 and 2017.

Yet, evaluating the atmospheric outcomes of teleworking enhancing policies remains difficult, especially when official databases on telework, household equipment and car emissions are incomplete or nonexistent. Here we propose several techniques to efficiently assess the impact of an increase in teleworking rates, and to explore the resulting bias, in a typical medium-sized European metropolitan area where few data are available: Besançon, France. Population and cartographical data are introduced in an individual-based daily mobility simulation model. We then calculate the resulting emissions for twenty atmospheric pollutants, using three different methodologies that aim to compensate, with different precision levels, for the lack of accurate information regarding vehicle fleets. Our results confirms the efficiency of telework for reducing emissions, with an average reduction of −0.42% in emission for an increase of 1% in teleworking rate. The precision level of data used strongly impacts the estimated quantity of air pollutant emissions (up to a factor ten). Failing to correctly account for inequalities in teleworking rate and equipment between socio-occupational categories introduces strong bias in the results which may degrade the correct evaluation of environmental benefits of teleworking enhancing planning policies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Daily mobility; Greenhouse gases; Planning policies; Teleworking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106869185

Here we test these hypotheses by analyzing an ∼11-m-long core archiving Holocene dust trapped in Montezuma Well, a natural sinkhole in Arizona (southwestern United States), alongside current dust sources and transport pathways. Major elements indicate that Montezuma Well sediments originate from two end members: local carbonate bedrock and external siliceous dust. Core sediments are similar to the adjacent siliceous soils accumulated atop the bedrock, pointing to their eolian origin. Particle-size distributions reveal fine dust transported during winter from the northwestern Sonoran Desert and the Mojave Desert and coarse dust transported during summer from the southwestern Sonoran Desert, similar to current climate systems and dust pathways. A survey of potential dust sources indicates that current summer and winter dust sources in the Sonoran Desert are under a supply-limited state. Dust fluxes were higher during wetter phases of the Holocene when winter sources dominated. During the middle Holocene drought, dust fluxes were minimal and dominated by summer sources until dust input ceased as drought conditions did not produce enough floods to refill sources with sediments. We propose that in the Sonoran Desert, dust emission is strongly connected with climate, increasing during humid intervals and enhanced by fluvial sediment replenishment at dust sources. © 2021 Geological Society of America.",,"Climate change; Drought; Landforms; Particle size; Sediments; Soil testing; Carbonate bedrock; Drought conditions; Fluvial sediment; Increasing aridities; Long-term relationships; Strongly connected; Transport pathways; Vegetation change; Dust; aridity; drought; dust; emission; Holocene; paleoclimate; Arizona; Sonoran Desert; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109457598

Though previous studies indicated that bike-sharing is associated with various social, environmental, and economic benefits, unintended adverse outcomes of DBS that constitute public nuisance also have been reported. Thus, it is necessary to assess the DBS effects on urban transport sustainability for strategic decisions on its further developments. This study is focused on the evaluation of environment-, public- and individual user-interest related effects of DBS, in terms of efficient resource utilization by sharing, Green House Gas (GHG) emission reduction, urban transport efficiency enhancement, public space occupation and individual cost-savings. The assessment models of DBS's resource demand and GHG emission, user transport time and cost, road and roadside parking space demand allocated in the functional unit of transporting one passenger for one kilometre are developed. Economic value models of the reduced resources demand, GHG emissions, transport time, and the occupied public space are then proposed for scaling DBS's overall benefits. A scenario model is developed to describe the DBS scheme and the benefits analysis's social-economic backgrounds. The case study of Shanghai, the largest DBS market nationwide, is presented to enrich the knowledge about DBS schemes in China, their potential contribution to urban transport sustainability, and implications for public administration, operation management and user behaviour guidance. The proposed assessment models can be applied to studies on DBS schemes in other China contexts to provide some comparisons and a more comprehensive understanding of its effects. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Dockless bike-sharing service (DBS); Economic value; Efficiency; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainable urban transport","Behavioral research; Bicycles; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Public administration; Sustainable development; Assessment models; Benefits analysis; Economic benefits; Further development; Operation management; Resource utilizations; Scenario Modeling; Strategic decisions; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101143516

Forest function is not static, but rather a risky asset that fluctuates and can decrease as a result of forest disturbance. Therefore, concepts such as resilience and insurance value as well effective policy formulation, management, and restoration are key to maintaining these benefits. This study estimates the insurance value that the public places on a policy that promotes restoration for increased resilience and ecosystem services using binary choice (BC) and best-worst scaling (BWS) models to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) and to vote for the restoration of longleaf pine (LLP) forests in the southeastern United States. Our BWS findings indicate that respondents seemed to only prefer programs with low risk of forest damage and lower monthly costs, while BC models show that low and moderate risk programs increased the likelihood of voting for them and that excellent wildlife habitat was also highly valued by our respondents. Positive attitudes towards the environment also positively influence voting for forest restoration programs. Findings contribute to an emerging body of literature on social-ecological systems and how the voting public conceptualizes trade-offs among ecosystem services, insurance value, and resilience. Results may help assess the use and incorporation of concepts such as resilience, ecosystem services, and insurance value in restoration, environmental, fire management, and climate change-related policy instruments and programs. © 2021","Best-worst scaling; Choice experiments; Ecosystem service trade-offs; Longleaf pine; Risk; Social-ecological systems","ecosystem service; environmental policy; environmental restoration; fire management; resilience; trade-off; wildfire; willingness to pay; adult; article; attitude; climate change; forest; habitat; human; insurance; United States; wildlife; animal; ecosystem; forest; policy; United States; Pinus palustris; Animals; Ecosystem; Forests; Insurance; Policy; Southeastern United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103641862

Observational data provided by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On satellite missions offer global TWS variation (ΔTWS) in terms of an integrated water column. However, GRACE spatial resolution is relatively coarse (i.e., 3°), and the vertically integrated value cannot be separated into ΔTWS components directly. This study demonstrates the feasibility to estimate ΔTWS components at any desired spatial-vertical resolution by effectively maintaining the native resolution of the employed hydrological knowledge. It utilizes a least-squares with constraints (LSC) approach to rigorously incorporate GRACE and GRACE-FO data and a priori hydrological knowledge, with the aim to improve global ΔTWS components’ accuracy and spatial resolution. The 3°×3° GRACE mascon derived ΔTWS data is disaggregated into the 0.5°×0.5° anomalous soil moisture storage (ΔSMS), groundwater storage (ΔGWS), snow water equivalent (ΔSWE), and surface water storage (ΔSWS) based on the covariance information obtained from the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) and the PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) models. Evaluation with different ground measurements and satellite products between 2002 and 2019 exhibits significantly improved accuracy in all individual ΔTWS components. This improvement is of particular note in ΔGWS and ΔSWS, where the LSC approach increases the globally averaged correlation values by approximately 0.13 and 0.05, respectively. Reliable prior knowledge leads to a more accurate ΔTWS component estimate, and the use of ensemble-mean knowledge yields the best result. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","A priori hydrological knowledge; GRACE; GRACE-FO; Least-squares with constraints; Spatial resolution; TWS component","Digital storage; Groundwater; Knowledge management; Snow; Soil moisture; Surface waters; A priori hydrological knowledge; Gravity recovery and climate experiment-FO; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Least Square; Least-square with constraint; Spatial resolution; Storage component; Terrestrial water storage; Terrestrial water storage component; Water storage; Image resolution; covariance analysis; data set; estimation method; GRACE; hydrological modeling; knowledge; satellite data; snow water equivalent; soil moisture; spatial resolution; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107775671

Though related studies have revealed substantial reductions in primary emissions, obvious differences do exist in the responses of secondary pollutants, like ozone (O3) pollution. However, the regional disparities of O3 responses and their causes have still not been fully investigated. To better elucidate the interrelationship between anthropogenic emissions, chemical production, and meteorological conditions, O3 responses caused by lockdowns over different regions were comprehensively explored at a global scale. Observational signals of air-quality change were derived from multi-year surface measurements and satellite retrievals. With similar substantial drops in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone shows rising signals in most areas of both East Asia and Europe, even up to ∼14 ppb, while a non-negligible declining signal exists in North America, by about 2–4 ppb. Furthermore, the drivers behind the different O3 responses are discussed based on meteorological analysis and O3 sensitivity diagnosis. On the one hand, O3 responses to NO2 declines can be affected by the primary dependence on its precursors. On the other hand, it is also highly dependent on meteorological factors, especially temperature. Our study further highlights the great importance of taking into consideration both the regional disparities and synergistic effects of precursor reductions and meteorological influence for scientific mitigation of O3 pollution. 摘要 疫情期间全球各地一次排放大幅削减, 而臭氧等二次污染的响应则存在着区域间差异.结合地面和卫星观测发现, 同在氮氧化物大幅下降的情况下,臭氧在东亚和欧洲呈现出可达14ppb的上升信号, 而北美则下降为主 (约2–4ppb) .我们结合气象分析和臭氧敏感性进一步讨论了臭氧响应差异性的原因, 一方面受臭氧与前体物间关系的影响;另一方面来自于气象, 尤其是温度.研究明晰了人为排放,化学和气象三者的内在关联, 强调了在臭氧控制过程中考虑前体物削减和气象条件协同的重要性. © 2020 The Authors","Air quality; COVID-19; COVID-19 lockdown; Meteorology; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; 二氧化氮; 关键词:; 气象条件; 空气质量; 臭氧","air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; meteorology; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; Europe; Far East; North America; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101887361

However, existing literature mainly explains the assessment mechanism in an isolated manner, which may fail to explain local officials' strong incentive to reduce pollutant emission when economic performance still held a prior position. Using the data of 810 observations of municipal party secretaries from 281 cities during 2005–2015, this paper examines the threshold effect of environmental pollution on the municipal party secretaries' economic promotion tournament. The results demonstrate that only when environmental pollution is below a certain level, can economic performance significantly increase local officials' promotion probability. Moreover, the significant threshold effect only exists for cities with stricter environmental governance and lower economic growth target. This research provides a deeper understanding of the special role of environmental performance in local officials' promotion assessment in China, which also has practical implications for countries struggling economy-environment trade-off to learn how to overcome this dilemma. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Economic performance; Environmental pollution; One-vote veto; Promotion tournament; Threshold effect","economic development; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental fate; environmental impact assessment; governance approach; pollution policy; threshold; trade-off; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104057444

In particular, aerospace industry, with the more electric aircraft (MEA) revolution, is shifting toward the usage of electrical in place of mechanical energy on board to save fossil fuel and reduce polluting emissions. For this reason, phase-locked loops (PLLs) systems have been well developed for synchronizing different power sources and loads within the aircraft electrical grid. Since one of the proposed solutions for MEA power grids is to operate at variable frequency from 360 to 800 Hz, a third-order model-based steady-state linear Kalman filter PLL (SSLKF-PLL) has been proposed in the literature to achieve fast tracking performance during such grid frequency variations. To suppress the potential disturbances due to harmonics in the grid, sensor scaling errors/unbalances, and dc offsets while maintaining low computational burden, this article aims to enhance the disturbance rejection ability of SSLKF-PLL by adding a repetitive observer (RO). Simulation and experimental tests show that RO allows stable and effective suppression of disturbances from all the abovementioned sources during variable frequency operation. The execution time of the proposed PLL is only 4.23 μs using a Xilinx Zynq-7000-based platform, where the added RO takes 2.664 μs to execute, and the SSLKF-PLL alone takes 1.566 μs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Fault tolerant control; more electric aircraft; phase-locked loops; power system harmonics; repetitive control","Aerospace industry; Disturbance rejection; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Industrial research; Phase locked loops; Computational burden; Effective suppression; Experimental test; Linear Kalman filters; Mechanical energies; Polluting emission; Transportation electrifications; Variable frequencies; More electric aircraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105107700

Hence, heating in this area is in urgent need of a shift to cleaner approaches. However, current progress is mainly attributed to the generous and unsustainable subsidies of the government, which have become a considerable financial burden. This paper develops a linear recursive dynamic model to identify economical, clean heating pathways in northern China. Different heating demands and clean technology promoting advances are considered. The results show that rapid promotion of clean heating technologies would save 1161–3026 Mtce (million tons of standard coal equivalent) of energy and avoid 7692–8843 Mt CO2, 12–13 Mt CH4, 8–9 Mt SO2 and 7–8 Mt BC emissions cumulatively from 2020 to 2050. For rural residential buildings, biomass pellet furnaces, air source heat pumps and air conditioning should each contribute to about 30% of the heating demands in 2050 to achieve clean heating. However, coal-fired cogeneration should be the major method of coal heating, and mainly serve urban residential buildings and commercial buildings. The consequent energy cost savings of a faster clean heating transition would exceed the increase in investment costs and operational costs. Therefore, promoting clean heating as early as possible is the economical and environmentally friendly choice for northern China in the long run. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","C3IAM/NET-Building model; Clean heating; Cost minimization; Emission reduction; Energy savings; Northern China","Air conditioning; Coal; Costs; Emission control; Energy utilization; Heating; Housing; Investments; Office buildings; Buildings sector; C3IAM/NET-building model; Clean heating; Cost minimization; Emission reduction; Energy savings; Energy-savings; Floor areas; Heating demand; Northern China; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105500892

Frequency analysis of the number of rivers with the annual maximum flow over the flow capacity in the same year (defined as simultaneous flooding here) indicated that simultaneous flood risk will increase in the future climate under 4-degree rise scenarios in Japan, whose increment is larger than the variation of sea surface temperature projections. As the result, the return period of simultaneous flooding in eight river basins (the same number as in a severe storm in western Japan, 2018, causing the second worst economic damage since 1962) is estimated at 400 years in the historical experiment, 25 years in the 4-degree rise experiment. The association rule and graph theory analyses for the big data of annual maximum flows in the future climate scenarios indicated that simultaneous flood occurrence is dominated by spatial distance at a national scale as well as by the spatial relation between mountainous ridges and typhoon courses at a regional scale.

The growing cities comprising these areas thus faced various kinds of natural changes. One of the major significant changes included the change in climaticconditions. Climateis the weather experienced by any region for a long period, particularly extending to 30-35 years. Therefore, the climate is a long-term study of any region where any slight change shows a significant impact on the lives and balance of the region's habitats. This paper tries to deal with the analysis of climate change in the KMA region. Metropolitan cities in India are currently considered prime concerns due to various climatic distortion and global warming effects. Thus, the paper tries to show the factors and effects of climate change. The study period has been taken for 35 years in the paper. The analysis is carried out using various GIS techniques using the ArcMap 10.1.1 software and statistical techniques to generate graphs. From 1989 to 2006 ranged high as the population showed a rising trend in Kolkata, Howrah, and Kalyani.However, this trend changed for some time during 2014 and 2015 as various plantation activities, programs, and projects were taken up by the government to safeguard climate change's harmful effect. It shows a rise in the temperature and fall in the rainfall quantities from 2015 to 2019. It also shows the disturbed rainfall pattern as a characteristic feature in the KMA cities as sudden droughts or urban flooding rise as a common phenomenon. The area is highly exposed to constant modifications. The paper concludes in a nutshell how the changes have affected the region and are still having asignificant impact on influencing lives and living. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Air Quality parameter; Climate change; Isohyet Map; LST; Meteorological parameters; NDBI; NDVI","Global warming; Geo-spatial analysis; Harmful effects; Metropolitan area; Metropolitan cities; Rainfall patterns; Regional management; Statistical techniques; Urban agglomerations; Rain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111925723

Natural gas is replacing other fossil fuels in our energy mix. One way to reduce the green-house gas (GHG) impact of fossil natural gas is to replace it with renewable natural gas (RNG). The benefits of utilizing RNG are that it has no climate change impact when combusted and utilized in the same applications as fossil natural gas. RNG can be injected into the gas grid, used as a transportation fuel, or used for heating and electricity generation. Less common applications include utilizing RNG to produce chemicals, such as methanol, dimethyl ether, and ammonia. The GHG impact should be quantified before committing to RNG. This study quantifies the potential production of biogas (i.e., the precursor to RNG) and RNG from agricultural and waste sources in New York State (NYS). It is unique because it is the first study to provide this analysis. The results showed that only about 10% of the state’s resources are used to generate biogas, of which a small fraction is processed to RNG on the only two operational RNG facilities in the state. The impact of incorporat-ing a second renewable substitute for fossil natural gas, “green” hydrogen, is also analyzed. It re-vealed that injecting RNG and “green” hydrogen gas into the pipeline system can reduce up to 20% of the state’s carbon emissions resulting from fossil natural gas usage, which is a significant GHG reduction. Policy analysis for NYS shows that several state and federal policies support RNG pro-duction. However, the value of RNG can be increased 10‐fold by applying a similar incentive policy to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, we explore how a gain and loss framing influence social preferences for the distributional outcomes of climate policy. Respondents are asked to consider climate policy alternatives with two main outcomes affecting three regions of the world: Income effects for future generations caused by climate change, which the respondents may not be affected by, and a present generation co-benefit from mitigation efforts, which could benefit the respondents directly. Using a sample of the Danish population, we find a significant difference in the estimated preference structure for climate policies when future income effects are framed as losses in income for future generations relative to when framed as regained income. However, the welfare measures reveal that the framing did not generate significantly higher value estimates for the framed income effect attribute. Instead, the framing resulted in increased willingness to pay for additional climate policy initiatives per se, and higher value estimates for the unframed, present generation co-benefit. We interpret these results drawing on the behavioural science and economic literature on framing and reference point dependent preferences. © 2021","Attribute level framing; Choice experiment; Climate policy; Social preferences; Valence-based framing","climate change; cost-benefit analysis; environmental policy; experimental study; income; mitigation; preference behavior; trade-off; welfare reform; willingness to pay; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105249419

However, ammonia emissions are generally less regulated worldwide. This study analyzed ammonium pollution character, quantified the dominant ammonia emission sources, and assessed ammonia reduction potential in urban Harbin (China). The results showed that ammonium recorded low concentration in the non-heating season (1.34 ± 1.57 μg/m3), and recorded sharply increased concentration (6.50 ± 7.02 μg/m3) and relative abundance in the heating season. It was closely correlated with vehicle-related pollutants (CO) in non-heating season, while with biomass burning-related pollutants (K+, Cl−) in the heating season. Bayesian Mixing Model emphasized the increasing contribution of biomass burning and decreasing contribution of fertilizer as the pollution levels escalate. The results from the thermodynamic equilibrium model showed that a 50%–60% ammonium decrease could bring marketable decrements of the aerosol pH, aerosol water content, ammonium nitrate concentration, and inorganic ion mass.

The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between China’s manufacturing industry benefits and air quality, taking into account the role of government policies in the era of big data, and to study the change points in the time series relationship between industry benefits and air quality. First, we apply and analyze big data and estimate values based on the maximum deviation method. Then, gray relational analysis is used to identify change points, which occur in 2005 and 2010 for both industry benefits and air quality. The total study period is divided into three subperiods: 1998–2005, 2006–2010, and 2011–2017. We find that air pollution control policy was relatively extensive from 1998 to 2005, and that there was a negative relationship between air quality and manufacturing industry benefits. From 2006 to 2010, a positive relationship gradually appeared and, since 2011, with the popularization of big data technology in policy making and environmental governance, intergovernmental cooperation has deepened and manufacturing enterprises have been more actively involved in governance.

The effects of urbanization on annual precipitation in temperate climate zone were complicated and have not been fully investigated. In this study, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of North China was selected as research area and field observations of inter-annual precipitation from 1980 to 2015 were utilized to conduct the spatiotemporal analysis and to extract the urbanization effects. Combined statistical methods were applied and the urbanization effects indicator (UE) was created to quantify the roles of urban development on annual precipitation by combining the land cover change of cities and urban–rural precipitation differences. The paper found following main results: (1) In 2000 s, annual precipitation increased faster in urban areas (slope = 7.165 mm/yr) than in rural areas (slope = 4.954 mm/yr). The urbanization effects on the increasing of precipitation have been implied by comparisons of urban–rural difference between 2000 s (slope = 2.211 mm/yr) and 1980 s (slope = 0.165 mm/yr). (2) Rapid urbanization led to increasing of annual precipitation. Built-up areas correlated higher with urban precipitation than with rural precipitation in 9 of 13 cities, and were used as weights to improve the urbanization effects indicator (UE). (3) As the largest and the most developed city, Beijing presented the highest urbanization effects (UE = 44.5) on the increasing inter-annual precipitation, which was 51% higher than the secondary city of Chengde (UE = 21.71). The coastal cities such as Tianjin, Qinhuangdao and Tangshan presented negative UE values probably due to the strong sea-land energy interactions. This study contributes new findings to the effects of urbanization on annual precipitation in temperate climate zone and could help understand the feedback of land surface changes to variations of atmospheric circulation. © 2021","Field observation; Precipitation; Temperate zone; Urbanization","Climatology; Rural areas; Urban growth; Annual precipitation; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Field observations; Interannual; North China; Rapid urbanizations; Regional climate; Temperate climate; Temperate zone; Urbanization; Precipitation (chemical); atmospheric circulation; land cover; land use change; regional climate; spatial analysis; urban area; urbanization; China; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103112993

A considerable amount of legal cannabis is cultivated indoors primarily for quality control and security. In this study we analysed the energy and materials required to grow cannabis indoors and quantified the corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using life cycle assessment methodology for a cradle-to-gate system boundary. The analysis was performed across the United States, accounting for geographic variations in meteorological and electrical grid emissions data. The resulting life cycle GHG emissions range, based on location, from 2,283 to 5,184 kg CO2-equivalent per kg of dried flower. The life cycle GHG emissions are largely attributed to electricity production and natural gas consumption from indoor environmental controls, high-intensity grow lights and the supply of carbon dioxide for accelerated plant growth. The discussion focuses on the technological solutions and policy adaptation that can improve the environmental impact of commercial indoor cannabis production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.",,"Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Plant life extension; Quality control; Commercial productions; Electricity production; Environmental control; Geographic variation; Life-cycle GHG emissions; Natural gas consumption; Policy adaptation; Technological solution; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102301923

As an urban area where the need for farm products is getting higher, Sleman, on the contrary, is suffering from the availability of agricultural land. Utilization of homestead land optimally is one way to maintain foodstuffs' availability in downsizing groundwater resources due to climate change and green land conversion. This study explains urban farmer community empowerment through the Climate Village Education in Pendowoharjo Village, Sleman. The empowerment was done under the triple helix model framework, consisting of Janabadra University, village government, the village-owned company called Bumdes Amarta, and an urban farmer community, namely the Tanjung Lestari Women Farmers Group. Activities in the climate village program are the design of rainwater harvesting equipment called IPAH (Rainwater Harvesting Installation), infiltration wells and dead-end channels called rorak, training, and mentoring to use IPAH as well as training in viticulture and hydroponic systems, and optimization of households waste management system, the core business of Bumdes. Indicators of the success and sustainability of the climate village program are the increased number of IPAH facilities, infiltration wells, and rorak; the increased number of residents harvesting and utilizing rainwater, the increased number of female farmer group members who actively use their yards for vegetable cultivation with viticulture and hydroponic system, as well as the increased income of Bumdes from household waste management business. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Harvesting; Rain; Rural areas; Waste management; Well equipment; Agricultural land; Community empowerments; District government; Hydroponic systems; Rain water harvesting; Triple helix models; Vegetable cultivation; Waste management systems; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112410344

Despite significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region still experienced high air pollution concentrations. Employing two emissions reduction scenarios, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to investigate the PM2.5 concentrations change in this region. The model using the scenario (C3) with greater traffic reductions performed better compared to the observed PM2.5. Compared with the no reductions base-case (scenario C1), PM2.5 reductions with scenario C3 were 2.70, 2.53, 2.90, 2.98, 3.30, 2.81, 2.82, 2.98, 2.68, and 2.83 μg/m3 in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Cangzhou, Chengde, Handan, Hengshui, Tangshan, and Xingtai, respectively.

The potential exploitation of N2O-reducing bacteria, which are resident members of anammox microbial communities, for N2O mitigation would require more knowledge of their ecophysiology. This study investigated the phylogeny of resident N2O-reducing bacteria in an anammox microbial community and quantified individually the processes of N2O production and N2O consumption. An up-flow column-bed anammox reactor, fed with NH4+and NO2-and devoid of oxygen, emitted N2O at an average conversion ratio (produced N2O: influent nitrogen) of 0.284%. Transcriptionally active and highly abundantnosZgenes in the reactor biomass belonged to theBurkholderiaceae(clade I type) andChloroflexusgenera (clade II type). Meanwhile, less abundant but actively transcribingnosZstrains were detected in the generaRhodoferax,Azospirillum,Lautropia, andBdellovibrioand likely act as an N2O sink. A novel15N tracer method was adapted to individually quantify N2O production and N2O consumption rates. The estimated true N2O production rate and true N2O consumption rate were 3.98 ± 0.15 and 3.03 ± 0.18 mgN·gVSS-1·day-1, respectively. The N2O consumption rate could be increased by 51% (4.57 ± 0.51 mgN·gVSS-1·day-1) with elevated N2O concentrations but kept comparable irrespective of the presence or absence of NO2-. Collectively, the approach allowed the quantification of N2O-reducing activity and the identification of transcriptionally active N2O reducers that may constitute as an N2O sink in anammox-based processes. © 2021 American Chemical Society","biokinetics; microrespirometry; N2O-reducing bacteria; nitrogen isotope; nosZ; transcription","Bacteria; Cost effectiveness; Nitrogen oxides; Tracers; Wastewater treatment; Consumption rates; Microbial analysis; Microbial communities; Nitrification and denitrification; Partial nitritation; Production rates; Reducing activity; Transcriptionally active; Nitrogen removal; nitrogen 15; nitrous oxide; oxygen; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; bioreactor; exploitation; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrogen isotope; nitrous oxide; sewage treatment; source-sink dynamics; anammox bacterium; Article; Azospirillum; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; Bdellovibrio; Burkholderiaceae; chemical sink; Chloroflexus; cladistics; controlled study; Lautropia; microbial biomass; microbial community; microbial respiration; nonhuman; nosZ gene; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; population abundance; quantitative analysis; reactor operation; Rhodoferax; bioreactor; denitrification; nitrification; oxidation reduction reaction; Azospirillum; Lautropia; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110232299

Fusarium wilt disease is one of the endemic diseases in extreme climatic areas in the high and lowlands. To deal with this climate change adaptation, a study was carried out that aims to determine the effect of the biofungicide Trichoderma spp. in controlling Fusarium wilt disease in several shallot varieties. This study used an experimental method carried out in the Highlands of Sembalun Bumbung Village, East Lombok using a Randomized Block Design with factorial experiments. The main factor is the formulation of biofungicides, namely: without biofungicides (control), liquid biofungicides, tablets and powders. The simple factor is shallot varieties, namely: Bali Karet, Ampenan, Keta Monca, Super Philip, and Super Cross. The results showed that liquid, tablet and powder of biofungicide could suppress Fusarium wilt disease up to 0%, while in control the percentage of disease reached 60%.

The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system can effectively reduce NOx emissions from diesel vehicles and is widely used in China IV and V heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs). In this study, two China IV HDDVs, one with SCR system failure and the other with a normal SCR system, were tested by using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS). Results showed that the NOx emission factors of the test vehicle with SCR system failure were 8.42 g/kW·h, 6.15 g/kW·h, and 6.26 g/kW·h at loads of 0%, 50%, and 75%, respectively, which were 2.14, 2.10, and 2.47 times higher than those of normal SCR vehicles. Emission factors, in terms of g/km and g/kW·h, from two tested vehicles were higher on urban roads than those on suburban and motorways. The NOx emission factor of the vehicle with failed SCR system did not meet the China IV emission standard. The time-weighted results for normal SCR vehicle over the three road types show that, except for NOx emission factor 12.17% higher than the China IV limit at 0% load, the emission values are 16.21% and 27.54% below the China IV standard limit at 50% load and 75% load, respectively. In general, with higher load, NOx emissions (in terms of g/kW·h) from the tested vehicle decreased. Furthermore, NO/NOx concentrations of both vehicles with normal and failed SCR systems showed a decreasing trend with the increase in load. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition to uncertainties in climate depicted in various representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, futuristic population growth mimicking historical conditions is subject to uncertainties related to changing development patterns. The combi-nation of climate change and population characteristics exacerbates concerns regarding the future water quality performance of river systems. Previous studies have established linkages among future climate, population impacts and watershed water quality performance. However, these linkages have not been specifically incorporated into water quality trading programs. Rather than temporally-variant adjustment factors, WQT programs use constant margins of safety for pollutant reduction credits resulting in trade ratios that do not explicitly account for futuristic climate and population uncertainties. Hence, this study proposes a conceptual framework for water quality trading establish-ing adjustment factors as margins of safety on trade ratios for pollutant reduction credits examining climate and population characteristics separately followed by evaluating them combined. This new framework is demonstrated using a programming script that calculates the margins of safety based on simulation results conducted through a water quality model of the Jordan River in Salt Lake City, UT, USA over a 3-year timeframe. With margins of safety over magnitudes of ±2 over the Jordan River simulations, this research introduces the framework as a foundation for developing adjustment factors for addressing climatic and population characteristics upon river systems. © 2021 by the authors.

However, many scenarios so far rely on bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage as the only CDR technology. Various other options have been proposed, but have scarcely been taken up in an integrated assessment of mitigation pathways. In this study we analyze a comprehensive portfolio of CDR options in terms of their regional and temporal deployment patterns in climate change mitigation pathways and the resulting challenges. We show that any CDR option with sufficient potential can reduce the economic costs of achieving the 1.5 °C target substantially without increasing the temperature overshoot. CDR helps to reduce net CO2 emissions faster and achieve carbon neutrality earlier. The regional distribution of CDR deployment in cost-effective mitigation pathways depends on which options are available. If only enhanced weathering of rocks on croplands or re- and afforestation are available, Latin America and Asia cover nearly all of global CDR deployment. Besides fairness and sustainability concerns, such a regional concentration would require large international transfers and thus strong international institutions. In our study, the full portfolio scenario is the most balanced from a regional perspective. This indicates that different CDR options should be developed such that all regions can contribute according to their regional potentials. © 2021 The Author(s).

Some regions were affected by water scarcity in recent years. Due to climate change, an increase in peak water demand is expected in the future. Therefore, water demand prediction models that include climate indices are of interest. In this paper, we present a general multiple linear regression (GMLR) model that can be applied to selected study sites. We compared the performance of the GMLR model with different modeling approaches, i.e., stepwise multiple linear regression, support vector regression, random forest regression and a neural network approach. All models were trained with water demand and weather data reaching back several years and tested with the last available observation year. The applied modeling approaches achieved a similar performance. As a second step, the GMLR model was used to estimate the peak water demands for the time period 2025–2050. For the future water demand estimate, 16 different climate projections were used. These climate projections represent the worst-case climate change scenario (RCP 8.5). The expected increase in peak water demand could be confirmed with the modeling approach. An increase in peak water demand by 3.5% compared to the reference period was estimated. © 2021 by the authors.","ANN; Climate change; Long-term daily water demand forecasting; MLR; Peak water demand; RF; SVR","Climate models; Decision trees; Linear regression; Predictive analytics; Support vector regression; Water supply; Climate change scenarios; Climate index; Climate projection; Model approach; Multiple linear regressions; Regression model; Stepwise multiple linear regression; Water scarcity; Climate change; climate change; estimation method; future prospect; numerical model; regression analysis; water demand; water supply; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111102301

Accordingly, the redirection of finance flows is a key objective of the Paris Agreement, and countries have started to enact policies to influence financial actors to this end. However, transparency on such policies is low, and it is hardly possible to compare policy activity internationally. To fill this gap, here we present a comparative analysis of green financial policy output in OECD countries from 2001 to 2019, based on a newly compiled inventory of 136 policies from 29 countries and the European Union. We show that policy output accelerated rapidly since the Paris Agreement, with countries implementing 3.3 policies on average using various governing resources. Key instruments include carbon disclosure requirements, low-carbon investment policies for public funds, and green state investment banks. However, there are huge differences in policy output between countries, and some countries that host important financial centers have implemented few policies to date. On the basis of our results, we develop a research agenda to deepen the understanding of this important but little-studied area of climate policies. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, limited works have been carried out for the estimation of emission and dispersion of PM10 from coal crushers and its ancillary operations. In this study, field-based measurements and regulatory dispersion model coupled with Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) were applied to investigate the assimilative capacity (AC) of a region with operational coal crushers. The model run was found ‘acceptable’ when compared with measured values according to set performance criteria. Furthermore, the validated model parameterization was used to forecast the dispersion effects by various emission control alternatives recommended by regulators viz. covering of conveyor belts, paving of the unpaved road, reducing feed rate, etc. Results suggested that the major contribution of PM10 was from transportation and loading of coal after crushing, while PM10 levels from crushing dissipated in a smaller area. Paving of transport roads and bunker/silo-based loading were effective control measures as emissions reduced by 30.67%–52.51%. The relationship between distance and emission load revealed that PM10 concentrations below 100 μg/m3 were achieved at approximately 750 m away from emission sources in the present study. Crusher's operations with existing emissions of 23.43 g/day/m2 were detrimental for the region's AC and needed to be stepped down to 11.71 g/day/m2. In particular, using modeled meteorological data provided reasonable forecasts for allowable emissions and planning to site crusher operations. Correction to the low-wind conditions resulted in a better simulation of mean annual estimates than daily estimates of PM10. Such visualization of spatially explicit frameworks will guide policymakers in strengthening regulations. © 2021 The Authors","Assimilative capacity; Coal crusher; Control scenarios; Emission rate; Unpaved road; WRF",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115987664

This fact challenges the current technologies to achieve carbon-lean steel production and to align with the requirement of a drastic reduction of 80% in all CO2 emissions by around 2050. Thus, alternative reduction technologies have to be implemented for extracting iron from its ores. The hydrogen-based direct reduction has been explored as a sustainable route to mitigate CO2 emissions, where the reduction kinetics of the intermediate oxide product FexO (wüstite) into iron is the rate-limiting step of the process. The total reaction has an endothermic net energy balance. Reduction based on a hydrogen plasma may offer an attractive alternative. Here, we present a study about the reduction of hematite using hydrogen plasma. The evolution of both, chemical composition and phase transformations was investigated in several intermediate states. We found that hematite reduction kinetics depends on the balance between the initial input mass and the arc power. For an optimized input mass-arc power ratio, complete reduction was obtained within 15 min of exposure to the hydrogen plasma. In such a process, the wüstite reduction is also the rate-limiting step towards complete reduction. Nonetheless, the reduction reaction is exothermic, and its rates are comparable with those found in hydrogen-based direct reduction. Micro- and nanoscale chemical and microstructure analysis revealed that the gangue elements partition to the remaining oxide regions, probed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and atom probe tomography (APT). Si-enrichment was observed in the interdendritic fayalite domains, at the wüstite/iron hetero-interfaces and in the oxide particles inside iron. With proceeding reduction, however, such elements are gradually removed from the samples so that the final iron product is nearly free of gangue-related impurities. Our findings provide microstructural and atomic-scale insights into the composition and phase transformations occurring during iron ore reduction by hydrogen plasma, propelling better understanding of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetic barriers of this essential process. © 2021","Atom probe tomography; Hydrogen plasma; Iron ore reduction; Microstructure; Steel","Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Electric arcs; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Hematite; Hydrogen; Industrial emissions; Iron ores; Kinetics; Microstructure; Phase transitions; Reaction rates; Steelmaking; Thermodynamics; Atom-probe tomography; Chemical compositions; Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS); Microstructure analysis; Rate-limiting steps; Reduction by hydrogens; Reduction technologies; Thermodynamics and kinetics; Iron ore reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111963262

In order to investigate the stability and chemiluminescence characteristics of the inverse diffusion lift-off flame, the OH∗ and CH∗ radiation characteristics, lift-off height, and transition (attachment, lift-off and blow-out) of flames under different burner structure were discussed. The results showed that burner rim thickness and incidence angles would affect the stability of the inverse diffusion flame. When the thickness of the burner rim exceeded 0.5 mm, the flame would directly change from the attachment state to blow-out state as oxygen velocity increased. Additionally, the values of the blowout limit of the nozzle were inversely proportional to the rim thickness of the burner. Different incident angles would result in various shear angles, which would affect the flame structure. As the incidence angle decreased, the tangential velocity of flame increased and the flame tended to be more stable. When the lift-off flame generated, OH∗ intensity and distribution showed a sudden change, and the OH∗/CH∗ peak intensity ratio of the flame appeared abrupt changes. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Burner structure; Chemiluminescence; Flame transition; Inverse diffusion flame; Stability","Blowouts; Catalytic oxidation; Chemiluminescence; Diffusion; Flame research; Blow-out; Burner structure; Flame transition; Incidence angles; Inverse diffusion; Inverse diffusion flame; Lift offs; Lift-off flame; OH$+-$; Rim thickness; Stability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106656396

Acidification rates were tested ranging from 0 to 2 g sulfuric acid (H2SO4) L−1 slurry in six meso-scale outdoor storage tanks, each filled with 10.6 m3 slurry and stored for 114 d. Results showed that the rate of acidification for maximum inhibition of CH4 and NH3 emissions varied markedly, whereas N2O reductions were modest. Reductions of CH4 increased with acid rate from 0 to 1.2 g L−1, with no additional response beyond &gt;1.2 g L−1. In contrast to CH4, inhibitions of NH3 showed a linear response across all rates, although reductions were ≤ 30%. Thus, higher acidification rates would be required to achieve greater NH3 emission reductions. Our findings indicate that achieving &gt;85% NH3 emissions reductions would require 4 × more acid than achieving &gt;85% CH4 reductions. Decisions on optimum H2SO4 rates will depend on the need to mitigate CH4 emissions (the primary greenhouse gas emitted from stored liquid manure) or reduce NH3 emissions (which is regulated in some regions). These results will help develop guidelines related to the potential costs and benefits of reducing emissions through acidification. © Copyright © 2021 Sokolov, Habtewold, VanderZaag, Dunfield, Gregorich, Wagner-Riddle, Venkiteswaran and Gordon.","ammonia; greenhouse gases; manure acidification; manure management; methane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111033224

Paleolimnology is a study of the physical, chemical, and biological features of the lakes in the past. Find the future from the past, prediction of the future condition can be developed from the reconstruction of past condition, based on the fossil preserved in the sediment. Ecosystem services of the lakes are hydroelectricity power, source of drinking water, irrigation, fisheries, tourism, socio-economic religious activities. Those functions have been deteriorated due to sedimentation, pollution, and eutrophication. Water security becomes a problem. Lake sediments as archives that record the climatic and environmental changes in the catchment area. VosViewer had been applied to construct and visualize bibliometric publications indexing by Scopus with the keywords paleolimnology, water resource, renewable energy, climate change, and food security. The result shows that there is a strong relationship between paleolimnology, climate change, and food security.

Much analytic work has been dedicated to evaluating the cost and performance of various CO2 capture technologies, but less attention has been paid to evaluating the cost of CO2 transport and storage. Many integrated assessment modeling studies assume a combined cost for CO2 transport and storage that is uniform in all regions, commonly estimated at $10/tCO2. Realistically, the cost of CO2 transport and storage is not fixed at $10/tCO2 and varies across geographic, geologic, and institutional settings. We surveyed the literature to identify key sources of variability in transport and storage costs and developed a method to quantify and incorporate these elements into a cost range. We find that onshore pipeline transport and storage costs vary from $4 to 45/tCO2 depending on key sources of variability including transport distance, scale (i.e. quantity of CO2 transported and stored), monitoring assumptions, reservoir geology, and transport cost variability such as pipeline capital costs. Using the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, we examined the impact of variability in transport and storage costs by applying a range of uniform costs in all regions in a future where global temperature rise is limited to 2°C. We then developed three modeling cases where transport and storage costs vary regionally. In these latter cases, global cumulative CO2 captured and stored through 2100 ranges from 290 to 377 Gt CO2, compared to 425 Gt CO2 when costs are assumed to be uniformly $10/t CO2 in all regions. We conclude that the widely used assumption of $10/tCO2 for the transport and storage of CO2 is reasonable in some regions, but not in others. Moreover, CCS deployment is more sensitive to transport and storage costs in some regions than others, particularly China. More analysis is needed to further quantify CO2 transport and storage costs at a regional level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CCS; CO2 storage cost; CO2 transport cost; integrated assessment model","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Pipelines; Global integrated assessments; Global temperatures; Institutional setting; Integrated assessment models; Onshore pipelines; Reservoir geology; Sources of variability; Transport distances; Cost benefit analysis; assessment method; carbon storage; cost analysis; integrated approach; pipeline; transport process; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109568497

In this region, four lignite-burning power plants are located. The data assimilation technique, based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter method, is employed to combine space-borne atmospheric observations from the high spatial resolution Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and simulations using the LOTOS-EUROS Chemical Transport model. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service-Regional European emissions (CAMS-REG, version 4.2) inventory based on the year 2015 is used as the a priori emissions in the simulations. Surface measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) from air quality stations operating in the region are compared with the model surface NO2 output using either the a priori (base run) or the a posteriori (assimilated run) NOx emissions. Relative to the a priori emissions, the assimilation suggests a strong decrease in concentrations for the station located near the largest power plant, by 80% in 2019 and by 67% in 2018. Concerning the estimated annual a posteriori NOx emissions, it was found that, for the pixels hosting the two largest power plants, the assimilated run results in emissions decreased by ~40–50% for 2018 compared to 2015, whereas a larger decrease, of ~70% for both power plants, was found for 2019, after assimilating the space-born observations. For the same power plants, the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) reports decreased emissions in 2018 and 2019 compared to 2015 (−35% and −38% in 2018, −62% and −72% in 2019), in good agreement with the estimated emissions. We further compare the a posteriori emissions to the reported energy production of the power plants during the summer of 2018 and 2019. Mean decreases of about −35% and−63% in NOx emissions are estimated for the two larger power plants in summer of 2018 and 2019, respectively, which are supported by similar decreases in the reported energy production of the power plants (~−30% and −70%, respectively). © 2021 by the authors.

We divide the scenarios into three broad classes: outlooks which extrapolate current trends and anticipate policy developments; exploratory scenarios which may consider disruptions; and normative scenarios which derive energy system pathways consistent with a long-term goal. Many organisations are starting to blend outlooks, exploratory and normative approaches. The paper covers trends in primary energy demand to 2040, snapshots of the energy mix in 2040, drivers of demand, and the evolution of scenarios projections developed in recent years. We find sharp divergences between outlooks and normative scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement on climate change. All published outlooks imply that the world is not on an energy pathway compatible with the Paris Agreement. We conclude with an assessment of emerging themes including: scenario benchmarking and group think; adaptation of scenarios to real world developments; and the plausibility of different types of scenarios. We propose that more dialogue between scenario developers from the scientific community and those working in governments and commercial organisations could be beneficial.

We develop and apply a method that combines SDG interaction analysis, which helps determine prerequisites for SDG attainment, with the transition management framework, which helps align policy goals with institutional designs. Using Aruba as a case study, we show that prioritizing increased economic benefits from sustainable marine development, including those of tourism, provides the greatest amount of direct co-benefits to other SDGs. When considering indirect co-benefits, reducing marine pollution emerged as a key supporting target to achieve SDGs. The results also show that, as in many other small island states, sustainable ocean development in Aruba depends on international partnerships to address global issues—including climate change mitigation—over which it has little control. Using SDG relationships as a guide for institutional cooperation, we find that the institutions with the most potential to coordinate action for sustainable ocean development are those that address economic, social and international policy, rather than institutions specifically focused on environmental policy.

Urbanization and industrial development along with increased populations have brought clear socio-economic benefits to Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) but can also bring disadvantages such as decreasing air quality. A lack of reliable air quality data in East African cities makes it difficult to understand air pollution exposure and to predict future air quality trends. This work documents urban air quality and air pollution exposure in the capital cities of Kampala (Uganda), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Nairobi (Kenya). We build a situational awareness of air pollution through repeated static and dynamic mobile monitoring in a range of urban locations, including urban background, roadside (pavement and building), rural background, and bus station sites, alongside vehicle-based measurements including buses and motorcycle taxis. Data suggest that the measured particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5, PM10) in all studied cities was at high concentrations, and often hazardous to human health, as defined by WHO air quality guidelines. Overall, the poorest air quality was observed in Kampala, where mean daily PM2.5 and PM10 0.84). This link between roadside emissions and indoor air pollution within buildings located close to the road should be explored more fully. This study, through a series of case studies, provides clear evidence that roads and traffic need to be a focus for mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution exposure in East African cities. = concentrations were significantly above the WHO limits at urban background locations by 122% and 69% and at roadside locations by 193% and 215%, respectively. Trafficis clearly a major contributor to East African urban air pollution; monitoring in Kampala and Addis Ababa, on motorcycle taxis, in buses and at bus stations indicated that drivers and commuters were exposed to poor air quality throughout their commute. Road-related air pollution can also impact indoor locations near roads. Using one exemplar building located within Nairobi’s Central Business District, it is shown that measured outdoor PM concentrations significantly correlate with the indoor air quality (r = 0.84). This link between roadside emissions and indoor air pollution within buildings located close to the road should be explored more fully. This study, through a series of case studies, provides clear evidence that roads and traffic need to be a focus for mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution exposure in East African cities. © 2021 The Author(s).

Drawing on the literature documenting this in theory and practice, we present a comprehensive overview of climate change risks and considerations across the whole life cycle of a restoration initiative. The resulting framework identified seven areas of restoration design and implementation in which climate change is important to address: setting restoration objectives, selecting sites and managing connectivity, choosing target species and ecosystems, managing key ecosystem interactions and micro-climates, identifying and mitigating site-level climate change risks, aligning the project with long-term policies, and designing a monitoring framework that enables adaptive management. A scan of restoration projects focussing on two regions – Brazil and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN – revealed limited inclusion of these considerations in practice, with less than 5% of the projects evidently addressing at least one of the seven areas. We discuss two projects showing good practice in climate resilient restoration: restoration of Atlantic forest in Brazil that plans for climate change in connectivity and hydrological management, species selection, and policy alignment, and crayweed underwater forest restoration in Sydney, Australia, whose careful attention to species provenance, genotype measurement and monitoring provided a “future-proofing” approach to restoration success in the long term. Building on such examples, our framework can be used as a tool to support global restoration targets and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021–2030 through more climate resilient restoration. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","Adaptation; Climate change; Ecological restoration; Resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107814228

A significant part of Europe's population lives in areas, especially cities, where exceedances of air quality standards occur: ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) pollution pose serious health problems. Several countries have exceeded one or more of their 2010 emission limits for four important air pollutants. Reducing air pollution therefore remains important. This paper presents a low-cost air quality monitoring device that due to the communication technology (LoRaWAN) can be used on large geographical areas.

It is driven by global population growth on the one hand and constrained by greenhouse gas reduction targets on the other. Accordingly, the implementation of new energy-efficient, low-carbon, and biodiversity-preserving technologies has become an absolute priority. In this work, the basic processes and requirements for the successful implementation of low-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasmas generated in air are considered in the various steps of the agricultural food production chain. This paper briefly reviews the history of plasma science in agriculture as well as discusses the pros and cons of low-pressure plasma versus atmospheric-pressure plasma. Particular attention is focused on plasmas generated using low-cost gases, such as synthetic or ambient air. The influence of various plasma components is discussed. These include electromagnetic fields (specifically ultraviolet–visible near-infrared radiation) and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the typical pre-harvest and post-harvest processing in the agri-food value chain. Finally, state-of-the-art cold air plasma generation and its potential deployment at the laboratory scale and under real farming conditions for industrial-scale production are examined.

However, fossil energy based power plant is one of the primary contributors of greenhouse gas which is the main cause of global warming. Besides that, the supply of fossil energy keeps on depleting along the year. Because of that, the availability of New and Renewable Energy (NRE) sources to overcome these problems are vital. Up until this moment, several types of NRE such as water energy, geothermal, and bioenergy have been utilized. However, the utilization capacity is pretty low and needs to be enhanced, either by optimizing the existing NRE or by exploring other type of non-fossil energy source as alternative NREs. One of the non fossil energy sources that have the potential is the wind energy. Indonesia has many areas that have the potential for developing PLTB because they have an average annual wind speed of 3.4-4.5 seconds or have an energy between 200 kWh/m to 1000 kWh/m. In operation, the exhaust emissions produced by wind power plants in the form of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and atmospheric pollutants are less when compared to power plants using fossil fuels. In addition, carbon dioxide emissions from wind power plants are only one hundredth of that of fossil fuels. Thus, it can be said that the development of electricity with wind power has good prospects to be applied in several regions in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power plants; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum prospecting; Sulfur dioxide; Wind; Wind power; Atmospheric pollutants; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy source; Exhaust emission; Fossil energy; Non-fossil energies; Renewable energies; Water energy; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112662132

Protein supplementation is widely used to increase intake and digestion of low-quality forages, yet little is known about its impact on CH4 emissions. British-cross steers (n = 23; initial body weight [BW] = 344 ± 33.9 kg) were used in a three-period crossover design to evaluate the effect of protein supplementation to beef cattle consuming low-quality forage on ruminal CH4, metabolic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, forage intake, and ruminal fermentation. Steers individually had ad libitum access to low-quality bluestem hay (4.6% crude protein [CP]) and were provided supplemental protein based on (dry matter basis): cottonseed meal (CSM; 0.29% of BW daily; 391 g/d CP), dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS; 0.41% of BW daily 563 g/d CP), or none (CON). Urea was added to DDGS to match rumen degradable protein provided by CSM. Ruminal CH4 and metabolic CO2 fluxes were obtained 2.4 ± 0.4 times per steer daily using an automated open-circuit gas quantification system (GreenFeed emission monitoring system; C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD). Forage intake increased (P < 0.01) with protein supplementation; however, no difference in forage intake (P = 0.14) was observed between CSM and DDGS treatments. Flux of CO2 (g/d) was greater (P < 0.01) for steers fed CSM and DDGS than for steers fed CON. Steers supplemented with CSM had greater (P < 0.01) CH4 emissions (211 g/d) than DDGS (197 g/d) both of which were greater (P < 0.01) than CON (175 g/d). Methane emissions as a proportion of gross energy intake (GEI) were lowest (P < 0.01) for DDGS (7.66%), intermediate for CSM (8.46%) steers, and greatest for CON (10.53%). Steers fed DDGS also had the lowest (P < 0.01) ruminal acetate:propionate ratio (3.60), whereas CSM (4.89) was intermediate, and CON (5.64) steers were greatest. This study suggests that the common practice of supplementing protein to cattle consuming low-quality forage decreases greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GEI.

This possibility is due to the effect of temperature on plant phenology and the difference between vertical and horizontal gradients in temperature sensitivities. We calculated the dates of the start (SGS) and end of the growing season (EGS) in a steep river basin located in a mountainous region of central Japan over a century timescale by using a degree-day phenological model based on long-term, continuous, in situ observations. We assessed the generality and representativeness of the modelled SGS and EGS dates by using phenological events, live camera images taken at multiple points in the basin, and satellite observations made at a fine spatial resolution. The sensitivity of the modelled SGS and EGS dates to elevation changed from 3.29 days (100 m)−1 (−5.48 days °C−1) and −2.89 days (100 m)−1 (4.81 days °C−1), respectively, in 1900 to 2.85 days (100 m)−1 (−4.75 days °C−1) and −2.84 day (100 m)−1 (4.73 day °C−1) in 2019. The long-term trend of the sensitivity of the modelled SGS date to elevation was −0.0037 day year−1 per 100 m, but the analogous trend in the case of the modelled EGS date was not significant. Despite the need for further studies to improve the generality and representativeness of the model, the development of degree-day phenology models in multiple, steep river basins will deepen our ecological understanding of the sensitivity of plant phenology to climate change.

Despite their ecological and biotechnological importance, their translational regulation of carbon and energy metabolisms remains unclear. Here, we report how carbon and energy metabolisms in the model acetogen Acetobacterium woodii are translationally controlled under different growth conditions. Data integration of genome-scale transcriptomic and translatomic analyses revealed that the acetogenesis genes, including those of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and energy metabolism, showed changes in translational efficiency under autotrophic growth conditions. In particular, genes encoding the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway are translated at similar levels to achieve efficient acetogenesis activity under autotrophic growth conditions, whereas genes encoding the carbonyl branch present increased translation levels in comparison to those for the methyl branch under heterotrophic growth conditions.

The results indicated that the estimated present-day PM2.5 concentrations were comparable to satellite-derived data. Overall, the PM2.5 concentrations of the analyzed regions exceeded the WHO air-quality guidelines, particularly in East Asia and South Asia. In future SSP scenarios that consider the implementation of significant air-quality controls (SSP1-2.6, SSP5-8.5) and medium air-quality controls (SSP2-4.5), the annual PM2.5 levels were predicted to substantially reduce (by 46% to around 66% of the present-day levels) in East Asia, resulting in a significant improvement in the AQI values in the mid-future. Conversely, weak air pollution controls considered in the SSP3-7.0 scenario resulted in poor AQI values in China and India. Moreover, a predicted increase in the percentage of aged populations (&gt;65 years) in these regions, coupled with high AQI values, may increase the risk of premature deaths in the future. This study also examined the regional impact of PM2.5 mitigations on downward shortwave energy and surface air temperature. Our results revealed that, although significant air pollution controls can reduce long-term exposure to PM2.5, it may also contribute to the warming of near-and mid-future climates. © 2021 by the authors.

The Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) approach has been used to fund the protection of other ‘Blue Carbon’ Ecosystems (BCE), yet seagrass has been incorporated in just one PES project worldwide. Some of the ecosystem services delivered by seagrass have the potential for inclusion under a PES framework but multiple challenges currently make this difficult, particularly under community-based management. PES programmes typically focus on carbon as the tradable service, but scientific uncertainties regarding seagrass carbon are likely to remain significant barriers to using carbon as the sole commodity under current carbon trading standards and market conditions. It is recommended here that project developers demonstrate the multiple ecosystem services delivered by seagrass meadows, along with their importance to coastal communities, in the planning and marketing of seagrass PES projects. Moreover, they should consider approaches that incorporate seagrass meadows into other blue carbon certified projects. The capacities of the communities that rely most heavily on seagrass are generally very limited. Consequently, demanding high levels of scientific certainty over carbon stocks and flows will exclude most of these communities. Standards, buyers and policy makers should consider building community capacity in the technical and marketing requirements of voluntary carbon standards. The voluntary carbon market has the flexibility to pioneer certified seagrass carbon, potentially leading to the inclusion of seagrass carbon in formal policy instruments, such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). © 2021","Community-based management; Seagrass; Voluntary carbon market","carbon emission; community resource management; ecosystem service; emissions trading; seagrass meadow; standard (regulation); voluntary approach; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104923355

Based on the chemical compositions and stable isotopes of NO3− in precipitation (δ15N-NO3− and δ18O-NO3−), the NO3− sources and their formation pathways were determined to aid in reducing NOx emissions in Ningbo, an important port city. The acid rain frequency in Ningbo was 67%, and the mean SO42−/NO3− ratio was 1.07. The δ18O-NO3− (49.5‰–82.8‰) and δ15N-NO3− values (−4.3‰–2.7‰) both varied seasonally, with high values during the cold season and low values during the warm season. The seasonal variations in the δ18O-NO3− values were mainly controlled by the NO3− formation pathways, following the OH· pathway during the warm season and N2O5 pathway during the cold season. The Monte Carlo simulation results indicated that the contributions of the OH· pathway ranged from 28.3% to 75.4%, with the remainder contributed by the N2O5 pathway. The improved Bayesian model incorporating nitrogen (N) isotopic fractionation (Ԑ = 4‰) indicated that mobile sources, including ship emissions (35.0%) &gt; coal combustion (26.0%) &gt; biomass burning (20.0%) &gt; soil emissions (19.0%), were the major sources of NOx emissions in Ningbo.

This paper utilized the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification and land surface temperature (LST) data to analyze the seasonal dynamics of SUHI in Wuhan based on the Google Earth Engine platform. In addition, the SUHI intensity derived from the traditional urban–rural dichotomy was also calculated for comparison. Seasonal SUHI analysis showed that (1) both LCZ classification and the urban–rural dichotomy confirmed that Wuhan’s SHUI effect was the strongest in summer, followed by spring, autumn and winter; (2) the maximum SUHI intensity derived from LCZ classification reached 6.53◦C, which indicated that the SUHI effect was very significant in Wuhan; (3) LCZ 8 (i.e., large low-rise) had the maximum LST value and LCZ G (i.e., water) had the minimum LST value in all seasons; (4) the LST values of compact high-rise/midrise/low-rise (i.e., LCZ 1–3) were higher than those of open high-rise/midrise/low-rise (i.e., LCZ 4–6) in all seasons, which indicated that building density had a positive correlation with LST; (5) the LST values of dense trees (i.e., LCZ A) were less than those of scattered trees (i.e., LCZ B) in all seasons, which indicated that vegetation density had a negative correlation with LST.

How to strengthen indigenous microbial metabolic activity to enhance biodegradation and mineralization efficiency of refractory composite pollutants is critical but poorly understood in environmental biotechnology. Here, a synergetic biostimulation coupling electrode with zero-valent iron (ZVI) was investigated for the bioremediation of river sediments contaminated by 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP, reducible pollutant) and hydrocarbons (oxidizable pollutants). The bioremediation efficiency of ZVI based biostimulation coupling electrode against TBP debromination and hydrocarbons degradation were 1.1–3 times higher than the electrode used solely, which was attributed to the shape of distinctive microbial communities and the enrichment of potential dehalogenators (like Desulfovibrio, Desulfomicrobium etc.). The sediment microbial communities were significantly positively correlated with the enhanced degradation efficiencies of TBP and hydrocarbons (P < 0.05). Moreover, the coupled system predominately increased positive microbial interactions in the ecological networks. The possible mutual relationship between microbes i.e., Thiobacillus (iron-oxidizing bacteria) and Desulfovibrio (dehalogenator) as well as Pseudomonas (electroactive bacteria) and Clostridium (hydrocarbons degraders) were revealed.

The results show that although temperature affects CH4 emissions from paddy fields, it is not the only influencing factor. Compared with submerged irrigation+no basal fertilizer method, the CH4 emission flux of intermittent irrigation+basal fertilizer method is significantly larger; under the same submerged irrigation method, applying basal fertilizer is beneficial to CH4 emission. In the submerged irrigation+basal fertilizer mode, tillering fertilizer is more conducive to methane emission than panicle fertilizer. The use of intermittent irrigation method to apply appropriate amount of base fertilizer and tiller fertilizer can effectively control the increase of rice yield and the reduction of CH4 emissions in the rice field.

The results show that: there are apparent spatial spillover and high emission regional clusters in Chinese provinces. Government supervision and market regulation can substantially reduce pollution emissions, while how to mitigate environmental problems through green total factor productivity require government and market regulation guidance. Through the threshold regression, it is proved that the government control-and-command mode performs the optimal action range, for the emission reduction effect gradually converges as the enhancement of regulatory intensifies, yet the promotion effect of the two kinds of regulatory measures will be strengthened with the improvement of green total factor productivity.

The carbon sequestration function of herbaceous marsh plays a key role in slowing climate warming and maintaining regional environmental stability. Vegetation biomass is an important index reflecting the carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands. Investigating the biomass of marsh vegetation can provide a scientific basis for estimating the carbon storage and carbon sequestration capacity of marshes. Based on field survey data of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation and the distribution data set of marsh in China, we analyzed the aboveground biomass and its spatial distribution pattern of herbaceous marsh on a national scale for the first time. The results showed that in China the total area of herbaceous marsh was 9.7×104 km2, the average density of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation was 227.5±23.0 g C m−2 (95% confidence interval, the same below), and the total aboveground biomass was 22.2±2.2 Tg C (1 Tg=1012 g). The aboveground biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation is generally low in Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, and high in central North China and coastal regions in China. In different marsh distribution regions of China, the average biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation from small to large was as follows: temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (182.3±49.3 g C m−2)&lt;Tibetan Plateau marsh region (243.9±26.6 g C m−2)&lt;temperate arid and semi-arid marsh region (300.5±73.2 g C m−2)&lt;subtropical humid marsh region (348.4 ±59.0 g C m−2)&lt;coastal marsh region (675.4±73.8 g C m−2). Due to the different area of herbaceous marsh, the total aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in different marsh distribution regions was the largest in the temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (9.6±2.6 Tg C), and was the smallest in the coastal marsh region (1.1±0.1 Tg C). The spatial distribution of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in China has obvious non-zonality characteristics, but also presents certain zonality in some regions. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in the Tibetan Plateau decreased with the increase of altitude. With the aggravation of drought, the aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions and temperate arid and semi-arid regions decreased first and then did not obviously change. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions was relatively larger in the regions with higher average annual temperature. The results can provide scientific basis for accurately evaluating the adjustment action of wetland ecosystems on climate, and provide decision support for adaptive management of wetland ecosystems. © 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aboveground biomass; China; Herbaceous marsh; Spatial distribution; Vegetation; Wetland","Biomass; Carbon capture; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forestry; Spatial distribution; Vegetation; Water conservation; Above ground biomass; Adaptive Management; Annual temperatures; Arid and semi-arid regions; Carbon sequestration; Ecological functions; Environmental stability; Spatial distribution patterns; Wetlands; aboveground biomass; carbon sequestration; data set; herb; marsh; spatial distribution; vegetation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107541129

We reviewed these extreme weather events, together with the year’s newly published climate and health science reports, and identified three important themes for building health resilience in the decade ahead: (1) preparing for greater magnitude and intensity of climate hazards, extreme events, and population health impacts; (2) better anticipating cascading and compound impacts on population well-being, particularly for the most vulnerable; and (3) identifying appropriate, effective preparedness tools and strategies. While decarbonizing the economy is the urgent goal to protect both human and planetary health from a changing climate, 2020 demonstrates that recognizing the likely magnitude and complexity of future extreme weather events, and preparing local public health agencies and communities with the knowledge and tools to respond to them, will be essential in this critical decade. © The Author(s) 2021.","adaptation; climate change; extreme weather; public health","climate change; extreme event; flooding; health science; hurricane; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; Australia; California; Central America; China; climate change; Coronavirinae; economic aspect; extreme weather; flooding; human; hurricane; nonhuman; population health; public health; review; wellbeing; wildfire; disaster planning; health status; organization and management; Australia; California; Central America; China; United States; Coronavirus; Climate Change; Disaster Planning; Health Status; Humans; Public Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105754014

In this study, various modes of N input were tried and the best mode (MRPU-2S, i.e., mid-rib placement upper to corms in two splits) that restricted SOC depletion and kept SOC above a threshold level of 1%, was suggested as suitable for saffron (Crocus sativus) cultivation in temperate soils. Under this treatment a significantly higher yield (1.92 kg ha−1) as well as more apocarotenoids (crocin and safranal) content, was noticed. Threshold values of surface SOC stock (26.64 Mg ha−1) above which C sequestration values moved to a positive coordinate plane were noted. Through this investigation, we identified a great C sequestration potential for MRPU-2S treatment for improving declining SOC stocks in saffron growing soils of temperate regions.

Future rainfall depths and temperature variations are projected using several general circulation models (GCMs) for two representative concentration pathway (RCP) (i.e., RCP45 and RCP85) scenarios using LARS-WG software. A simulator model is developed using the genetic programming (GP) model to predict future water demand based on projected climate variables of rainfall depth and maximum temperature. The period of 1996–2016 is selected as the base period. Three future periods, namely the near-future (2021–2040), middle future (2041–2060), and far future (2061–2080), are also employed to assess climate change impact on water demand. Results indicate significant increases in annual projected rainfall depth (14~53%), maximum temperature (0.04~4.21 °C), and minimum temperature (1.01~4.71 °C). The projected monthly patterns of rainfall depth and temperature are predicted to cause a 1-month shift in the water demand peak (i.e., it will occur in April instead of May) for all future periods. Furthermore, the annual water demand per capita is projected to increase by 0.5~1.2%, 1.5~3.2%, and (2.2~7.1%), during the near-, middle-, and far-future periods, respectively. The uncertainty associated with water demand is also projected to increase over time for RCP45. The mathematical expression of urban water demand based on climatic variables is vital to managing the water resources of Neyshabur. The methodology proposed in the present study represents a robust approach to assessing how climate change might affect urban water demand in cities other than Neyshabur and provides crucial information for decision-makers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"annual variation; assessment method; climate change; uncertainty analysis; urban area; water demand; water management; Iran; Nishapur; Razavi Khorasan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105577000

Specifically, introducing ultramicropores (pores width &lt;0.7 nm) into carbon materials may be effective in improving the anode performance of SIBs. However, due to the difficulty of their synthesis and homogeneity regulation, ultramicroporous carbon as advanced SIB anodes as well as their sodium storage mechanisms have seldom been investigated. Herein, carbon spheres with centralized ultramicropores and abundant C═O is facilely obtained by combining the in situ ion activation and the novel quantitative air-assisted carbonization process for the first time. The quantitative air acts not only as a mild agent to activate the materials, but also as an oxygen dopant for forming oxygen-containing functional groups. As the optimized anode, quantitative air-assisted carbonized spheres with a precursor weight of 0.3 g (QACS-0.3) delivers a high rate capability (265 and 121 mAh g-1at 0.05 and 5.0 A g-1, respectively) and good cycling stability (126 mAh g-1after 5000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1). Kinetic analysis, theoretical calculation, and ex situ testing technologies reveal that the ultramicropores can facilitate the diffusion of Na+below 0.2 V; the synergistic effect of defects, C═O, and ultramicropores can extend the discharge curves and effectively improve the adsorption capacity of carbon materials.

Existing WWTPs, however, are an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and may not be able to treat increasingly complicated wastewater or meet stringent environmental standards. These WWTPs can be updated to address these challenges, and different technologies are available but with potentially different environmental implications. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a widely used approach to identify alternatives with lower environmental footprint. In this study, LCA was applied to an actual urban WWTP, considering four scenarios involving upgrading and energy-resource recovery. The environmental performance with respect to life cycle GHG emissions and eutrophication impact was analyzed. The environmental benefits of reduced water pollution and energy and material displacement associated with energy-resource recovery process were also considered. The results showed tradeoffs among the four scenarios. Although upgrading the studied WWTP would meet discharge standard for total phosphorus and reduce total eutrophication impact by about 19%, it would increase GHG emissions by at least 16%. Besides, the energy-resource recovery mode for existing WWTP (S2) performs the best in terms of GHG emissions. For different biogas utilization methods, combined heat and power (CHP) system is superior to the existing method of delivering biogas to gas grid, in terms of energy recovery or reduction of GHG emissions and eutrophication impact. Our research results may provide a reference for plant managers to select the most environmentally friendly upgrade scheme and energy-resource recovery technique for future upgrade projects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Energy-resource recovery; Environmental tradeoffs; Eutrophication impact; GHG emissions; Life cycle assessment; Wastewater treatment upgrade","biogas; combined heat and power; eutrophication; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; wastewater; wastewater treatment plant; water pollution; water quality; animal; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle stage; wastewater; water management; Animals; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Life Cycle Stages; Waste Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102190001

Energy prediction models provide critical information to decision-makers who develop sustainability policies to reduce energy use and emissions. We present a transportation energy model (TEM) that uses Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to predict household transportation energy consumption in this study. The TEM model uses data-driven approaches for household transportation energy prediction. Machine learning techniques in artificial intelligence (AI) predictive modeling have become popular due to their ability to capture nonlinear and complex relationships. On the other hand, developing comprehensive understanding the inference mechanisms in AI models and ensuring trust in their predictions is challenging. This is because AI models are mostly of high complexity and low interpretability; in other words, they are black-box models. This study presents a case study of how model transparency and explanation can be generated using the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) to support advanced machine learning techniques in the transportation energy field. The methodology has been implemented based on the Household Travel Survey (HTS) data, which is used to train the artificial neural network with a relatively high degree of accuracy. The importance and effect (local explanation) of HTS inputs (such as household travel, demographics, and neighborhood data) on transportation energy consumption for specific traffic analysis zones (TAZs) are analyzed. The results are valuable to promote intelligent and user-friendly transportation energy planning models in urban regions across the world. © 2021","Artificial neural network; Explainable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; LIME; Transportation energy use; Urban metabolism","Complex networks; Decision making; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Lime; Machine learning; Neural networks; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Complex relationships; Data-driven approach; High degree of accuracy; Household travel surveys; Machine learning techniques; Sustainability policy; Traffic analysis zones; Transportation energy consumption; Predictive analytics; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; energy planning; energy use; household energy; machine learning; transportation; transportation planning; urban region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104303690

To accommodate the scale of implementation required, there is a need to increase the efficiency of current design and production processes. Computational methodologies have proven to increase design efficiency by generating and parsing through myriad design options based on multivariate (e.g., spatial, environmental, and economic) factors. Modular Construction (MC) is another approach used to increase efficiency of both design and production. This paper combines these approaches in a novel methodology for generating modular design options for extensions of existing buildings (an efficacious form of building adaptation). The methodology focuses on key architectural design metrics such as energy use, daylighting, life cycle impact, life cycle costing and structural complexity, whereby a set of Pareto-optimal exploratory design options are generated for evaluation and further design development. A functional demonstration is then carried out for the extension of Ken Soble Tower in Hamilton, Ontario. The contribution of this research is the efficient development and evaluation of design options for improving existing residential infrastructure in order to meet required energy improvements using modular extensions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Building adaptation; Circular economy; Computational design; Design optimization; Design option assessment; Modular construction","Architectural design; Costs; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Pareto principle; Urban growth; Building adaptation; Building stocks; Circular economy; Computational design; Computational methodology; Design optimization; Design option; Design option assessment; Modular designs; Modulars; Modular construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105324996

However, a reduced share of fossil fuel in transportation and industry requires a significant shift in power generation energy sources. Power generation from renewable sources is still limited and will be for the foreseeable future. Developing countries and oil-producing nations in the middle east may shift to electric vehicles, but electricity energy sources will not be easily moved to renewables., A detailed and comprehensive emission inventory was developed in a bottom-up method for a typical populated city in Iran, middle-east. The objective was to study the effects of power generation emissions on local criteria air contaminants and greenhouse gas emissions. All primary sources of emissions, including mobile sources, industries, house heating, power generation, cement and brick production facilities, fuel stations, and transportation hubs, were considered in the study. In the mobile sources section, exhaust and non-exhaust, cold and hot exhaust, and resuspended dust particles were included in the model. The methodology of developing the emission inventory is described in this study. It was found that the emission profile of a largely populated city, which is also a religious tourist attraction in the region, is highly driven by the power generation sources, despite the large population of vehicles on the road. The emission inventory study showed a contribution of 56% NOx and 97% SOx emissions by power plants to the total emissions as high sulphur heavy oil is used partially in electricity generation. Powerplants also generated more than one-third of particulate emissions. At the current state, given the significant impact of power generation on air pollution, increasing electric vehicle share will worsen the urban living conditions for a populated city unless a substantial shift in power generation energy source toward renewables happens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gas; High-resolution emission inventory; Vehicle electrification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109086159

Two research sites viz., saltmarsh restoration site (SMRS) and impacted site (IP) were selected for this study. Amount of carbon assimilation by saltmarsh plant Porteresia coarctata at SMRS was increased from 165.17 ± 68.35 to 198.18 ± 41.32 g/m2 during the study. The highest carbon assimilation (198.18 ± 41.32 g/m2) was noticed during winter, while the highest biomass (10.47 ± 0.25 kg/m2) was measured from SMRS. Soil compactness, organic matter, organic carbon, field water capacity, plant height, plant biomass and shoot density were found to be significantly (p &lt; 0.05 to 0.01) higher in the SMRS than that of the IS. Seasonal variations of air temperature, water temperature, water pH, water salinity, water transparency, tidal height, inundation period, wave velocity, soil temperature, soil pH, pore water salinity, sedimentation, soil texture particle density, plant height, biomass and shoot density at different significance levels (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.01) were noticed throughout the study. Correlation matrix showed that the plant height, biomass and shoot density were positively correlated with sedimentation, and negatively correlated with wave velocity at different significant levels (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.01). From the present study, it is evident that SMRS, which was controlled and managed with some artificial inputs not only showed the elevated levels of plant height, biomass, shoot density, sedimentation and carbon assimilation but also exhibited remarkable changes in some of the factors studied rather than impacted site (IS), the findings of which could be helpful for the protection of coastal environment as well as mitigation of climate change impact that will ultimately save the local community from natural calamities in the long run. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change impact; Mitigation; Saltmarsh restoration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109076842

The plant is mainly used to obtain a dark greyish green dye from its leaves and it has an economic value due to ornamental characteristics. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the appropriate Polyethylene Glycol 8000 (PEG) doses for early detection of drought resistance using MK, SL-64, Garnem, Pixy and Gis-6 rootstocks. Methods: The microshoots of each rootstock were planted at the end of the fourth subculture in Magenta GA7 vessels containing NRM medium. The medium contained 1.0 mg L-1 BA + 0.01 mg L-1 IBA supplemented with 30 g L-1 sucrose, gelled with 5.5 g L-1 agar and 0, 2, 3 and 4% PEG doses (four treatments). The cultures were kept at 23±2 °C temperature under 16 h light (80 μmol m-2 s-1) and 8 h dark photoperiod. Result: The highest number of shoots was recorded in control treatment for MK rootstock (2.81 shoots plant-1) and in 4% PEG treatment for Gis-6 rootstock (2.81 shoots plant-1).

Goenka University, Haryana, Gurugram, India","As the world's population is expected to be over 2/3rd urban by 2050, climate action in cities is a growing area of interest in the inter-disciplines of development policy, disaster mitigation and environmental governance. The climate impacts are expected to be quite severe in the developing world, given its urban societies are densely packed, vastly exposed to natural elements while possessing limited capabilities. There is a notable ambiguity and complexity that inhibits a methodical approach in identifying urban resilience measures. The complexity is due to intersection of large number of distinct variables in climate geoscience (precipitation and temperature anomalies at different locations, RCPs, timeline), adaptation alternatives (approach, priority, intervention level) and urban governance (functional mandate, institutional capacity, and plans &amp; policies). This research examines how disparate and complex knowledge and information in these inter-disciplines can be processed for systematic 'negotiation' to situate, ground and operationalize resilience in cities. With India as a case, we test this by simulating mid-term and long-run climate scenarios (2050 &amp; 2080) to map regional climate impacts that shows escalation in the intensity of climate events like heat waves, urban flooding, landslides and sea level rise. We draw on suitable adaptation measures for five key urban sectors- water, infrastructure (including energy), building, urban planning, health and conclude a sleuth of climate resilience building measures for policy application through national/ state policies, local urban plans and preparation of city resilience strategy, as well as advance the research on 'negotiated resilience' in urban areas.

The objective is to noninvasively probe the local hydrocarbon dynamics at asphaltene/maltene interfaces to reveal the global characteristics of bitumen at increasing temperatures and under various mechanical constraints. Experiments. We propose multidimensional (1D and 2D) nuclear magnetic relaxation (NMR) experiments to characterize the dynamic properties of hydrocarbons for a set of bitumen from 40 to 180 °C. The convergence towards universal theoretical modelling of NMR relaxation experiments gives a comprehensive understanding of hydrocarbon transport in these very weakly permeable samples. Moreover, a multivariate statistical analysis allows for correlating these NMR relaxation data for all bitumen samples to the main empirical parameters by qualifying the bitumen grading, such as the penetrability, softening and fragility points over a large range of temperatures. Findings. These new experimental and theoretical multiscale approaches link hydrocarbon interfacial dynamics to the global characteristics of various bitumen types.

Climate change presents acute challenges for steppe biome: there is a prolonged increase in average daily temperatures, accompanied by a deficit of precipitation, mainly in the spring-summer period, and droughts become more frequent. Also, in addition to climatic factors, the consequences of human economic activity have a negative impact on forest communities. The aim of the study is to assess the indicators of the vital state of Scots pine in the steppe Voronezh region under drought conditions and under anthropogenic influence. To study the state of forest woody plants, we selected two Scots pine plantations growing in contrasting ecological conditions of the steppe zone of the Central Black Earth region. The main indicators of the vital state were assessed: dechromation of needles, defoliation of the crown, the number of new cones, and the total score of the vital state of each plant and the studied plantation as a whole was calculated using the totality of these characteristics. It is found that a plantation under anthropogenic load is subjected to greater stress and has worse performance compared to a plantation from the same climatic zone, but growing on a relatively ecologically clean territory. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Drought; Economics; Anthropogenic influence; Changing climate; Climatic factors; Daily temperatures; Drought conditions; Ecological conditions; Forest community; Tree plantations; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112536335

The pollutants data were collected from Iran Department of Environment including 10 air pollution monitoring stations for the period of our study. Cumulative relative risk and attributable number/fraction were calculated for each pollutants by a Quasi-Poisson time-series regression and distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM). The maximum lag was set to 14 days because harvesting effect is more likely happened during few days. We used percentile 25 as reference value in order to calculate cumulative relative risk and attributable fraction. About 69,000 patients with cardiovascular symptoms have been admitted into the hospital during 4 years. The cumulative relative risk during the 14 days was 1.13 (1.01, 1.26), 1.15 (1.02, 1.29), and 1.08 (1.01, 1.18) for CO, NO2, and PM2.5, respectively. The numbers attributed to all values of CO were more than others; about 3800 EDVs were significantly attributed to CO, of which over 3000 were significantly attributed to high values of the pollutant. Low values of all pollutants were, not surprisingly, responsible for low number of EDVs. PM2.5, CO, and NO2 were responsible to considerable attributable number of EDVs.

While several recent publications indicate that ERFs based on exposure models resolving within-city gradients are steeper per concentration unit (μgm−3), the ERF for PM2.5 recommended by the World Health Organization does not reflect this observation and is heavily influenced by studies based on between-city exposure estimates. We evaluated the potential health benefits of three air pollution abatement strategies: electrification of light vehicles, reduced use of studded tires, and introduction of congestion charges in Stockholm and Gothenburg, using different ERFs. We demonstrated that using a single ERF for PM2.5 likely results in an underestimation of the effect of local measures and may be misleading when evaluating abatement strategies. We also suggest applying ERFs that distinguish between near-source and regional contributions of exposure to PM2.5. If separate ERFs are applied for near-source and regional PM2.5, congestion charges as well as a reduction of studded tire use are estimated to be associated with a significant reduction in the mortality burden in both Gothenburg and Stockholm. In some scenarios the number of premature deaths is more than 10 times higher using separate ERFs in comparison to using a single ERF irrespective of sources as recommended by the WHO. For electrification, the net change in attributable deaths is small or within the uncertainty range depending on the choice of ERF. © 2021 by the authors.

The book considers a possible reform of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change institutional arrangement, inspired by the practice and model of participation of Arctic Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic Council. Different non-State entities play a fundamental role in the development and enforcement of the climate change regime by enhancing the knowledge base of decision-making, keeping States in line with their commitments, and engaging in private initiatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of global warming. Albeit non-governmental and subnational actors increasingly work alongside States in the making of a climate change regime, the category of observers through which they participate in intergovernmental negotiations only gives them limited rights and their participation in international norm-making has at times been impaired. The relevance of a human rights-based approach consists in recognising the status of individuals and groups as rights-holders under human rights law, a paradigm that was first established by Arctic Indigenous Peoples when claiming their participatory rights in the Arctic Council, the main forum of governance of the Arctic region. This book argues that, in the absence of a globally binding treaty regulating procedural rights in intergovernmental negotiations, the emerging relationship between human rights and climate change could serve as a legal basis for the enhancement of non-governmental actors' procedural rights, establishing the right to participation as a right in itself and which can benefit the governance of climate change. Due to the relevance of the addressed subject, the book is destined to a broad readership and will be of use to academic researchers, law practitioners, policy-makers and non-governmental organisations' representatives. © 2022 Marzia Scopelliti.

However, a reduction in aboveground biomass production and reproductive output may occur when warming is accompanied by drought that crosses critical water deficit thresholds. Tracking warmer temperatures has been shown to be species-specific with unknown impacts on community composition and productivity. The variability in species’ ability to leverage earlier leaf unfolding and flowering into increased aboveground net primary production (ANPP) or increased investments into reproductive organs has heretofore been poorly explored. We tested whether phenological sensitivity to temperature, as a result of experimental warming, directly translated into increased plant performance, as measured by ANPP and flower abundance. In order to experimentally simulate climate warming, we translocated a total of 45 intact soil–plant communities downslope along an elevational gradient of 900 m within the European Alps from 1260 to 350 m asl and weekly recorded flower abundance and total green cover as well as cumulative biomass production at peak growing season. We found that advanced phenology at lower elevations was related to increased reproductive performance and conditional on whether they experienced drought stress. While a temperature increase of +1K had positive effects on the amount of reproductive organs for species with accelerated phenology, temperature increase going along with drier conditions resulted in plants being unable to sustain early investment in reproduction as measured by flower abundance. This finding highlights that the interaction of two climate change drivers, warming and drought, can push communities’ past resistance thresholds. Moreover, we detected biotic competition mechanisms and shifts toward forb-depressed states with graminoids best taking advantage of experimentally altered increased temperature and reduced precipitation. Our results suggest that while species may track warmer future climates, concurrent drought events post a high risk for failure of temperature-driven improvement of reproductive performance and biomass production in the European Alps. © 2021 The Authors.","alpine; Bavarian Alps; climate change; phenological sensitivity; plant community; plant functional type; plant reproduction; translocation experiment; transplant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111530315

This study provides a parametric techno-economic analysis of PV + HP systems to identify the critical economic parameters on profitability and make policy recommendations. A case study in Vienna is modelled using demand from the Building Model Generator and black box efficiency models for the HP and PV simulated with hourly time steps. The results show that both air-source and ground source heat pumps are currently profitable with PV under current subsidy schemes. The benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) is highly influenced by capital costs and subsidies, however natural gas prices have the greatest influence. Increasing natural gas prices by 0.01 €/kWh, or 17%, is enough to replace all other complicated subsidies for both HP and PV.

Off-road sources of BC are increasingly important as emissions from on-road vehicles continue to decrease. This study characterizes harbor craft emissions and activity, including tugboats, passenger boats, and fishing vessels. Vessel traffic data suggest that the Southern California tugboat fleet is composed of relatively few unique vessels, yet tugboats spent more non-idle operating time within 3 nautical miles of California's coast than all other vessel types (including large ocean-going vessels). Fuel-based BC emission factors (EFBC) were measured from shore in the San Pedro Bay Port Complex in Los Angeles using the plume capture method, yielding 78 EFBC values from ~45 unique vessels. Passenger boats had the highest geometric mean EFBC (0.56 ± 0.86 g/kg). Tugboats had higher EFBC while moving with versus without loads (0.64 ± 0.29 and 0.48 ± 0.67 g/kg, respectively). Non-idle EFBC for vessels were skewed, with the dirtiest 20% of plume intercepts contributing ~47% of BC emissions. Given the trends observed in both vessel activity and EFBC values, tugboats could be worthwhile targets for emissions reductions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosols; Black carbon; Emission factors; Marine vessels; Tugboats","Aerosols; Air quality; Carbon; Fisheries; Fleet operations; Fuels; Ports and harbors; Roads and streets; Black carbon; Black carbon emission; Carbon activities; Emission factors; Fuel combustion; Human health; Marine vessels; Particulate matter emissions; Road vehicles; Southern California; Tugboats; black carbon; diesel fuel; sulfur; air quality; black carbon; carbon emission; combustion; fuel consumption; harbor; particulate matter; pollutant source; traffic emission; aerosol; air pollution control; air quality; Article; California; carbon footprint; controlled study; environmental impact; geographic distribution; health hazard; operation duration; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; ship; work environment; California; Los Angeles [California]; San Pedro Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106319766

Both natural and human-induced disasters present major risks to sustainable development trajectories and require strategic management within regional and local plans. Climate change and its impacts, including intensified storms, flash floods, and other water-based disasters (WD), also pose a serious and increasing threat. Small, remote communities prone to weather extremes are particularly vulnerable as they often lack effective early warning systems and experience energy insufficiency. Humanitarian engineering provides a transdisciplinary approach to these issues, supporting practical development resources such as renewable energy, which can also be adapted for disaster response. This study details an exploratory investigation of community vulnerability and capability mapping (VCM) that identifies communities with high WD risk and limited response capability which may benefit from risk reduction engagement and program co-development. By presenting criteria appropriate for VCM, we highlight the anthropocentric characteristics that could potentially be incorporated within community-led action as part of a comprehensive scheme that promotes sustainable development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK part of Springer Nature.","Community; Early warning; Off-grid renewable energy; Sustainable development goal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098689643

Cost-effective means of locating both anthropogenic and natural sources of methane and other gases are needed in order to improve understanding of greenhouse gas budgets and facilitate mitigation. One approach uses imaging spectrometers operating on remote sensing platforms, such as aircraft or satellites, to locate specific types of plumes. This paper develops spectral algorithms for the detection of any absorptive gas, for example, methane in the shortwave infrared region. The presence of a target gas is inferred from its known absorptivity spectrum along with local background statistics gathered by the sensor. The problem of distinguishing the target signal from clutter is usually solved by modeling the spectral background with some member of the class of elliptical distributions, most commonly a multivariate Gaussian. That class of models is replaced here by the lognormal distribution. A logarithmic transformation then recasts the associated hypothesis test into a standard form, allowing derivation of a uniformly most powerful solution. It is theoretically optimal simultaneously for all gas concentrations. This leads further to new algorithms for the detection and quantification of gas mixtures. © 2021","Decision theory; Detection algorithms; Estimation; Gas plumes; Imaging spectrometry; Methane; Remote sensing; Uniformly most powerful detector","Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Decision theory; Estimation; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Waste management; Agriculture wastes; Cluttered backgrounds; Cost-effective means; Detection algorithm; Energy sector; Gas plumes; Imaging spectrometry; Remote-sensing; Uniformly most powerful detector; Waste energy; Remote sensing; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; detection method; greenhouse gas; plume; pollutant source; remote sensing; sensor; spectrometer; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104122130

The techno-economic potential of 20 decarbonisation options is assessed. While previous analyses focus on the production processes, this analysis covers the full product life cycle CO2 emissions. The analysis elaborates the carbon accounting complexity that results from the non-energy use of fossil fuels, and highlights the importance of strategies that consider the carbon stored in synthetic organic products—an aspect that warrants more attention in long-term energy scenarios and strategies. Average mitigation costs in the sector would amount to 64 United States dollars (USD) per tonne of CO2 for full decarbonisation in 2050. The rapidly declining renewables cost is one main cause for this low-cost estimate. Renewable energy supply solutions, in combination with electrification, account for 40% of total emissions reductions. Annual biomass use grows to 1.3 gigatonnes; green hydrogen electrolyser capacity grows to 2435 gigawatts and recycling rates increase six-fold, while product demand is reduced by a third, compared to the reference case. CO2 capture, storage and use equals 30% of the total decarbonisation effort (1.49 gigatonnes per year), where about one-third of the captured CO2 is of biogenic origin. Circular economy concepts, including recycling, account for 16%, while energy efficiency accounts for 12% of the decarbonisation needed. Achieving full decarbonisation in this sector will increase energy and feedstock costs by more than 35%. The analysis shows the importance of renewables-based solutions, accounting for more than half of the total emissions reduction potential, which was higher than previous estimates. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the rapid increase in energy demand, depletion of fossil fuels and environmental concerns, many developing and developed countries are moving towards alternative renewable resources such as solar energy, wind energy and biomass. Wind energy as a renewable energy source is gaining a lot of significant attention. Wind energy is a sustainable solution to produce energy having potential benefits such as clean source, reduced toxic gases emission and environmental friendly protocol for operation. Pakistan is among the top countries facing the worst energy crisis due to different political and financial issues. Pakistan is blessed with a huge potential of wind energy having all the basic requirements such as windy regions and good wind speed for harnessing energy. Pakistan can utilize the potential of wind energy to reduce the problem of energy outrage in the country and also take steps towards green economy from conventional fuel economy. This critical review highlights the current status, potential and the steps taken in the past and present to overcome the energy shortage in Pakistan by employing wind energy. Outlook on wind speed data, deployment of wind energy, environmental effect of wind energy and its barriers in the adoption are discussed with recommendations and suggestions to utilize this clean energy in an effective way.

The uniqueness of mount karst is mainly in the abundance of carbon stocks in the karst. The karst area's location has underground river flows, shallow soil solum, and high levels of drought. The objectives were to create actionable strategies for climate change mitigation to reduce the risk of damage to karst areas. The mitigation action strategy aims to reduce the carbon emissions rate from various sources and increase the Karts area's absorption rate, a community forest area. The methodology uses qualitative research comparing baseline carbon data based on the allometric model. Data collection carried out using the FGD (Focus Group Discussion) method. The results showed that community forests' average carbon stock was still below the lowest standard of carbon stock's feasibility in the woods. This situation does not guarantee optimal carbon storage sustainability due to the phenomenon of land-use change and need-cutting. Therefore, the mitigation action strategy needed is to encourage local policies at both the village and district levels in climate change mitigation efforts. This policy will form the basis for mainstreaming climate change mitigation as part of the government's widely supported work. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Digital storage; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Absorption rates; Allometric models; Carbon emissions; Climate change mitigation; Community forest; Data collection; Qualitative research; Underground rivers; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112419949

Household consumption patterns are proven to have contributed 60-70% to global emissions. Hence, we aim to analyze the impact of Indonesia's household environmental load for the transition towards low-carbon living to reduce GHG emissions that cause climate change. This study aims to investigate the relationship between several household expenditure categories to CO2 emission, using Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) data as the only large-scale longitudinal survey available in Indonesia, which means showing carbon footprint at the level of Indonesia household consumption practices. Generally, the results show that energy for houses (electricity and kerosene), and household electrical appliances are the top three carbon footprint generators. Based on the results, the total emission in urban areas is way higher than in rural areas. Correlation analysis indicates that both of factors, number of household members and total income did not significantly affects (low correlation) total emission in the urban areas (r < 0.5), while total income impacts the rural regions (r = 0.88) in 1993.

Currently, at least 172 million people breathe unhealthy levels of air pollution in LAC countries. Several cohort studies have indicated that air pollution increases the risk of developing dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms underlying the association are still not clear. Air pollution causes and aggravates five established risk factors for dementia (obesity, hypertension, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and heart diseases) and is linked to three other risk factors (physical inactivity, cognitive inactivity, and depression). Some of these risk factors could be mediating the association between air pollution and dementia. Reducing the risks for dementia is crucial and urgently needed in LAC countries. There is room for improving air quality in many urban areas in the LAC region and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a routealready explored by many urban areas in developing regions. Moreover, reducing air pollution has proved to improve health outcomes before. In this article, we propose that despite the ongoing and valid scientific discussion, if air pollution can or cannot directly affect the brain and cause or aggravate dementia, we are ready to consider air pollution as a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia in LAC and possibly in other LMICs. We suggest that controlling and reducing current air pollution levels in LAC and other LMIC regions now could strongly contribute. © Copyright © 2021 Santos, Yariwake, Marques, Veras and Fajersztajn.","air pollution; Alzheimer; dementia; developing countries; Latin America; low-and-middle income countries; particulate matter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112595088

A review of articles published in recent years that examine the various research subareas related to urbanism climate change and the present pandemic situation is performed. The concepts of green and biophilic urbanism have been growing and getting strength, as a holistic concept for tomorrows sustainable urban areas based on the consistent and safe use of energy, soil, water, green spaces, materials, and mobility. These new trends are based on social needs, with integrated strategies and policies that combine adaptation and mitigation to face urban growth's negative impact. The review focused on articles published in the last 20 years with the keywords “urbanism” and “climate change”.

The term has paved the way for the development of programs and policies that preserve and restore these threatened coastal ecosystems for climate change mitigation. Blue carbon research has focused on quantifying carbon stocks and burial rates in sediments or accumulating as biomass. This focus on habitat-bound carbon led us to losing sight of the mobile blue carbon fraction. Oceans, the largest active reservoir of carbon, have become somewhat of a blind spot. Multiple recent investigations have revealed high outwelling (i.e., lateral fluxes or horizontal exports) of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon, as well as particulate organic carbon (POC) from blue carbon habitats. In this paper, we conceptualize outwelling in mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass and macroalgae ecosystems, diagnose key challenges preventing robust quantification, and pave the way for future work integrating mobile carbon in the blue carbon framework. Outwelling in mangroves and saltmarshes is usually dominated by DIC (mostly as bicarbonate), while POC seems to be the major carbon species exported from seagrass meadows and macroalgae forests. Carbon outwelling science is still in its infancy, and estimates remain limited spatially and temporally. Nevertheless, the existing datasets imply that carbon outwelling followed by ocean storage is relevant and may exceed local sediment burial as a long-term (>centuries) blue carbon sequestration mechanism. If this proves correct as more data emerge, ignoring carbon outwelling may underestimate the perceived sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems. © 2021 The Authors","Alkalinity; Carbon sequestration; Coastal carbon; Detritus","biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; coastal zone; terminology; Matthiola; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104344514

Cooking with electricity could contribute to achieving universal access to energy by 2030. This paper uses geospatially-based techniques—a computer model named REM, for Reference Electrification Model—to show the impact of integrating electric cooking into electrification planning. Three household scenarios were analyzed: One for providing basic electricity access with no electric cooking, another for cooking with electricity, and the third for cooking half of the meals with electricity and half with another fuel, with a clean stacking process. Results of the application of REM to the three scenarios were obtained for the Nyagatare District, Rwanda. The case study showed that electric cooking substantially changes the mix of technologies and the total cost of the least-cost electrification plan. It also showed that electric cooking can be cost competitive compared to LPG and charcoal in grid-connected households and can reduce greenhouse emissions. Stacking with energy-efficient electric appliances provides most of the benefits of full electric cooking at a lower cost and is a pathway worthy of further consideration. © 2021 by the authors.","Clean cooking; ECook; Electrification; Electrification modes; Energy access; Geospatial planning; Low- and middle-income countries; Reference Electrification Model; SDG7; Stacking scenarios","Charcoal; Energy efficiency; Liquefied petroleum gas; Computer modeling; Cost competitive; Electricity access; Electrification model; Greenhouse emissions; Household scenarios; Optimal planning; Stacking process; Electric utilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110887418

This paper addresses the gap by investigating the role of local CSOs in helping to anticipate the effect of climate change. This study looked into the case of Riau because it has many CSOs concerned with environmental problems. The objectives of this research are to classify the environmental CSOs in Riau and analyze their contribution to climate change resilience. Using a qualitative approach, the data were collected by using interviews on a series of participants, including CSO's activists, government officials, academicians, and community leaders. We reveal that local CSOs can be classified as conservation, advocation, empowerment, and conflict resolution. Along with their own and government programs, the CSOs have been contributed to tackling climate change by ensuring forest and peatland preservation.

This is the primary way many individuals experience climate change, which has led researchers to investigate the influence of personal experience on climate change concern and action. However, existing evidence is still limited and in some cases contradictory. At the same time, behavioral decision research has highlighted the importance of pre-existing values and beliefs in shaping how individuals experience changes in environmental conditions. This is in line with theories of motivated reasoning, which suggest that people interpret and process information in a biased manner to maintain their prior beliefs. Yet, the evidence for directional motivated reasoning in the context of climate change beliefs has recently been questioned. In the current paper, we critically review the literature on the interrelationships between personal experience of local weather anomalies, extreme weather events and climate change beliefs. Overall, our review shows that there is some evidence that local warming can generate climate change concern, but the capacity for personal experience to promote action may rely upon the experience first being attributed to climate change. Rare extreme weather events will likely have limited impact on judgments and decisions unless they have occurred recently. However, even recent events may have limited impact among individuals who hold strong pre-existing beliefs rejecting the reality of climate change. We identify limitations of existing research and suggest directions for future work. © Copyright © 2021 Sambrook, Konstantinidis, Russell and Okan.","climate change; climate change beliefs; extreme weather; personal experience; prior beliefs",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110500256

Here we examine how natural regeneration is associated with changing plant diversity and carbon stocks in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. Aboveground carbon stocks and plant species diversity (using taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic and conservation metrics) were estimated in areas undergoing natural regeneration, ranging in age from seven to &gt;80 years. Aboveground carbon, diversity and conservation metrics increase rapidly and concomitantly over time during forest natural regeneration, but even with carbon increase over time, we found the maximum taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity possible for the region. These results show the importance of considering regeneration as an alternative to increase carbon stocks, diversity, and species conservation in carbon-focused restoration plans. Our results showed co-benefits between carbon stocks, diversity, and conservation. Diversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) increases along with carbon stocks, but functional evenness does not. Age of the areas also influences co-benefits, as they increase over time. Thus, we demonstrate that ecological restoration not only sequesters carbon and has benefits with respect to climate change but is also responsible for increasing biodiversity and conservation. This mutualism between different benefits of natural regeneration attends to a variety of international concerns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Ecosystem services; IUCN red list; Paris Agreement; Restoration","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Image reconstruction; Plants (botany); Reforestation; Restoration; Tropics; Above-ground carbons; Atlantic forest; Brazil; Carbon stocks; Co benefits; Ecological restoration; Ecosystem services; IUCN red list; Natural regeneration; Paris agreement; Carbon; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; conservation status; landscape ecology; phylogenetics; restoration ecology; species conservation; species diversity; tropical environment; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Reforestation; Restoration; Tropics; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104290880

The cultivation of hybrid varieties has contributed immensely towards food security and made it possible to meet the requirements of the rapidly increasing human population. A typical plant breeding approach involves hybridization i.e. crossing two genetically different individuals, to create genetic variation. At the genetic level, the genomes of two individuals combine to form a hybrid, but what happens to the associated microbiota is largely unknown. Endophytes are one such class of plant-associated microbiota that have been reported to inhabit the internal tissues of plants, without causing any disease symptoms. With the advent of the holobiome concept, the importance of microbiome in plant health and productivity is being increasingly realized. In this perspective, understanding the nature of plant-endophyte association in hybrids and transmission/colonization of endophytes upon hybridization (i.e. from parents to progenies) is a pre-requisite for laying the foundation of plant holobiont breeding. This emerging discipline aims to integrate the best of both worlds (hybrid plant genome and microbiome) for realizing the untapped potential of the plant microbiota (and hence, the holobiont) to adverse environmental conditions. This review attempts to summarize our current understanding of the hybrid plant-associated microbiome with respect to its parental lines and wild progenitors. Further, the review highlights some research gaps in the field and beckons the attention of scientific community towards understanding and applying this knowledge for further boosting the crop productivity, the need of the hour. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Endophyte; Heterosis; Holobiome; Hybridization; Hybrids; Microbiome","colonization; crop production; endophyte; food security; genetic variation; hybridization; Microbiota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102477854

Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) calculated for four samples ranged between 0.707663 and 0.707784, indicating an age of 45.1–51.9 million years (Ypresian–Lutetian/Bartonian). The presence of echinoid thorns in the units indicates a shallow marine environment where carbonates developed on the seaward side of a reef.

The rock samples labeled as VR1, VR2, VR3, and VR4 were experimentally investigated by a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The neutron transmission factor (TF) was estimated by using the Monte Carlo technique for different thicknesses varying from 0 to 3 mm. Moreover, we studied the charged particles' interaction properties with the present volcanic rocks for projectile energy up to 2.5 MeV.

Reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from buildings helps de-crease global warming and enhances the natural environment. This can only happen by transition-ing from traditional to sustainable architecture and urban planning. For decades, sustainable architecture and urban planning have been applied in many countries' building sectors, but others among the poor and least developed countries are left behind. Kabul, the capital of one of the least developed countries, Afghanistan, has experienced a remarkable growth rate in population and building since 2001. This rapid and uncontrolled growth of building construction caused problems from different perspectives, especially from the sustainability perspective. In this paper, the current state of the building industry in Kabul is evaluated from a sustainability perspective, especially those con-structed after the year 2000. This assessment helps to rate and see how sustainable each type of building is. Analysis of the collected data clarifies that buildings’ sustainability level in Kabul city is significantly low. Based on the results, recommendations provide a better future for the building industry and ensure that existing and future buildings are sufficiently sustainable to protect the environment of Kabul city and of the globe. © 2021 by the authors.

This study proposes combining metagenomic and host genomic data for selective breeding of the cow hologenome toward reduced methane emissions. We analyzed nanopore long reads from the rumen metagenome of 437 Holstein cows from 14 commercial herds in 4 northern regions in Spain. After filtering, data were treated as compositional. The large complexity of the rumen microbiota was aggregated, through principal component analysis (PCA), into few principal components (PC) that were used as proxies of the core metagenome. The PCA allowed us to condense the huge and fuzzy taxonomical and functional information from the metagenome into a few PC. Bivariate animal models were applied using these PC and methane production as phenotypes. The variability condensed in these PC is controlled by the cow genome, with heritability estimates for the first PC of ~0.30 at all taxonomic levels, with a large probability (>83%) of the posterior distribution being >0.20 and with the 95% highest posterior density interval (95%HPD) not containing zero. Most genetic correlation estimates between PC1 and methane were large (≥0.70), with most of the posterior distribution (>82%) being >0.50 and with its 95%HPD not containing zero. Enteric methane production was positively associated with relative abundance of eukaryotes (protozoa and fungi) through the first component of the PCA at phylum, class, order, family, and genus. Nanopore long reads allowed the characterization of the core rumen metagenome using whole-metagenome sequencing, and the purposed aggregated variables could be used in animal breeding programs to reduce methane emissions in future generations. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association","genetic correlation; heritability; methane; microbiome; principal component analysis","methane; animal; bovine; female; fermentation; genetics; metabolism; microflora; rumen; selective breeding; Spain; Animals; Cattle; Female; Fermentation; Methane; Microbiota; Rumen; Selective Breeding; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107948303

More than 1200 rock slabs yielding plant fossils were collected from six different outcrops in Guappero Valley in the San Lorenzo a Vaccoli area (NE of the Pisani Mountains, near Lucca), the type-locality of the formation. The present study concerns two outcrops at Via Pari that are characterized by a wide range of plant fossils (20 taxa) belonging to the lycopsids (Stigmaria), sphenopsids (Calamites, Asterophyllites, Calamostachys, Sphenophyllum, Bowmanites), ferns (Acitheca, Diplazites, Cyathocarpus), seed ferns (Alethopteris, ?Autunia, gen. indet.), cordaites (Cordaites) and seeds (Carpolithes). This first description of the plant fossil collection and the revision of its stratigraphical context with respect to the surrounding famous fossiliferous sections of the Guappero Valley refine the stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental framework of the Late Palaeozoic successions of the Pisani Mts. and more generally of the Apennine chain. The qualitative and quantitative analyses show significant environmental variations between neighbouring outcrops in the Via Pari area - i.e., more humid conditions in 'Via Pari Buca' than in 'Via Pari Smottamento' - and suggest a latest Carboniferous (Gzhelian) instead of an early Permian age as proposed by previous authors. Moreover, the differences in composition between the plant assemblages of the Via Pari sections with the historical assemblage of the nearby Monte Vignale outcrop (containing typical Permian and more xerophytic elements) in the De Stefani Collection of the Florence Natural History Museum is explained by a younger age (early Permian) of the latter. © 2021 Universita degli Studi di Milano.

Methods: An attributional life cycle assessment was conducted on eight different scenarios that reduce the inputs of herbicides and insecticides compared against a business as usual (BAU) scenario. We assess several impact categories based on ReCiPe, namely global warming potential, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial toxicity, freshwater toxicity, marine toxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity and human non-carcinogenic toxicity, human health and ecosystems. A water footprint assessment based on the AWARE method accounts for potential impacts within the watershed. Results and discussion: Results show that in our impact assessment, more sustainable farming practices do not always outperform the BAU scenario, which relies on synthetic fertiliser and agrochemicals. As a main trend, most of the impact categories were dominated by energy requirements of wine grape production in an irrigated vineyard, namely the usage of electricity for irrigation pumps and diesel for agricultural machinery. The most favourable scenario across the impact categories provided a low diesel usage, strongly reduced herbicides and the absence of insecticides as it applied cover crops and an integrated pest management. Pesticides and heavy metals contained in agrochemicals are the main contributors to emissions to soil that affected the toxicity categories and impose a risk on human health, which is particularly relevant for the manual labour-intensive South African wine sector. However, we suggest that impacts of agrochemicals on human health and the environment are undervalued in the assessment. The 70% reduction of toxic agrochemicals such as Glyphosate and Paraquat and the 100% reduction of Chlorpyriphos in vineyards hardly affected the model results for human and ecotoxicity. Our concerns are magnified by the fact that manual labour plays a substantial role in South African vineyards, increasing the exposure of humans to these toxic chemicals at their workplace. Conclusions: A more sustainable wine grape production is possible when shifting to integrated grape production practices that reduce the inputs of agrochemicals. Further, improved water and related electricity management through drip irrigation, deficit irrigation and photovoltaic-powered irrigation is recommendable, relieving stress on local water bodies, enhancing drought-preparedness planning and curbing CO2 emissions embodied in products. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon footprint; Irrigation; Life cycle assessment; Scenario analysis; South Africa; Water footprint; Wine grapes","chlorpyrifos; glyphosate; herbicide; insecticide; paraquat; acidification; agricultural worker; Article; carbon footprint; ecosystem; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; eutrophication; grape; greenhouse effect; irrigation (agriculture); life cycle assessment; pest control; reduction (chemistry); risk factor; South Africa; toxicity; vineyard; workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105378086

In the case of extreme storm events, urban pluvial flooding is generated by the excess of surface runoff that could not be conveyed by pressurized sewer pipes, due to its limited capacity or, many times, due to the poor efficiency of surface drainage systems to collect uncontrolled overland flow. Generally, the hydraulic design of sewer systems is addressed more for underground networks, neglecting the surface drainage system, although inadequate inlet spacings and locations can cause dangerous flooding with rele-vant socio-economic impacts and the interruption of critical services and urban activities. Several experimental and numerical studies carried out at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) and other research institutions demonstrated that the hydraulic efficiency of inlets can be very low under critical conditions (e.g., high circulating overland flow on steep areas). In these cases, the hydraulic efficiency of conventional grated inlets and continuous transverse elements can be around 10–20%. Their hydraulic capacity, expressed in terms of discharge coefficients, shows the same criticism with values quite far from those that are usually used in several project practice phases. The grate clogging phenomenon and more intense storm events produced by climate change could further reduce the inlets’ performance. In this context, in order to improve the flood urban resilience of our cities, the relevance of the hydraulic behavior of surface drainage systems is clear. © 2021 by the authors.

Developed in recent decades, continental-scale monitoring of climate and forest dynamics enables quantitative examination of vegetation– climate relationships through a data-driven paradigm. Here, we apply a data-intensive approach to investigate forest–climate interactions across the conterminous USA. We apply multivariate statistical methods (stepwise regression, principal component analysis) including machine learning to infer significant climatic drivers of standing forest basal area. We focus our analysis on the ecoregional scale. For most ecoregions analyzed, both stepwise regression and random forests indicate that factors related to precipitation are the most significant predictors of forest basal area. In almost half of US ecoregions, precipitation of the coldest quarter is the single most important driver of basal area. The demonstrated data-driven approach may be used to inform forest-climate envelope modeling and the forecasting of large-scale forest dynamics under climate change scenarios. These results have important implications for climate, biodiversity, industrial forestry, and indigenous communities in a changing world. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is crucial to assess the impact of atmospheric conditions on air quality and air pollutant dispersion in the face of the potential variability of all sources. In this study, the impact of mobility restrictions on the air quality was analyzed for the most populous Brazilian State, São Paulo, severely impacted by COVID-19. Ground-based air quality data (PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2, NOx, NO2, NO, and O3) were used from 50 automatic air quality monitoring stations to evaluate the changes in concentrations before (January 01 - March 25) and during the partial quarantine (March 16 - June 30). Rainfall, fires, and daily cell phone mobility data were also used as supplementary information to the analyses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the air quality data during and before mobility restrictions. In general, the results demonstrated no substantial improvements in air quality for most of the pollutants when comparing before and during restrictions periods. Besides, when the analyzed period of 2020 is compared with the year 2019, there is no significant air quality improvement in the São Paulo State. However, special attention should be given to the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP), due to the vast population residing in this area and exposed to air pollution. The region reached an average decrease of 29% in CO, 28% in NOx, 40% in NO, 19% in SO2, 15% in PM2.5, and 8% in PM10 concentrations during the mobility restrictions period compared to the same period in 2019. The only pollutant that showed an increase in concentration was ozone, with a 20% increase compared to 2019 during the mobility restrictions period. Before the mobility restrictions period, the region reached an average decrease of 30% in CO, 39% in NOx, 63% in NO, 12% in SO2, 23% in PM2.5, 18% in PM10, and 16% in O3 concentrations when compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, Cubatão, a highly industrialized area, showed statistically significant increases above 20% for most monitored pollutants in both periods of 2020 compared to 2019. This study reinforces that the main driving force of pollutant concentration variability is the dynamics of the atmosphere at its various time scales. An abnormal rainy season, with above average rainfall before the restrictions and below average after it, generated a scenario in which the probable significant reductions in emissions did not substantially affect the concentration of pollutants. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollutants; Air quality; Coronavirus disease; Mobility restriction","carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; rain; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric dynamics; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease spread; environmental impact assessment; ground-based measurement; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; social mobility; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmosphere; Brazil; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; fire; human; lockdown; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; population dispersal; priority journal; rainy season; social distancing; air pollutant; air pollution; Brazil; city; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; pandemic; particulate matter; policy; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Brazil; Cities; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Policy; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105800690

This polygenic selection does not leave intense sweep signatures on the genome, rather many loci experience small allele frequency shifts, resulting in large cumulative phenotypic changes. Directional selection and local adaptation are changing populations; but, identifying loci underlying polygenic or environmental selection has been difficult. We use genomic data on tens of thousands of cattle from three populations, distributed over time and landscapes, in linear mixed models with novel dependent variables to map signatures of selection on complex traits and local adaptation. We identify 207 genomic loci associated with an animal's birth date, representing ongoing selection for monogenic and polygenic traits. Additionally, hundreds of additional loci are associated with continuous and discrete environments, providing evidence for historical local adaptation. These candidate loci highlight the nervous system's possible role in local adaptation. While advanced technologies have increased the rate of directional selection in cattle, it has likely been at the expense of historically generated local adaptation, which is especially problematic in changing climates. When applied to large, diverse cattle datasets, these selection mapping methods provide an insight into how selection on complex traits continually shapes the genome. Further, understanding the genomic loci implicated in adaptation may help us breed more adapted and efficient cattle, and begin to understand the basis for mammalian adaptation, especially in changing climates. These selection mapping approaches help clarify selective forces and loci in evolutionary, model, and agricultural contexts.

We sampled >1300 fish from 80 species in 14 remote headwater streams during the dry season in French Guiana. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses and mixing models were run to estimate the trophic position (TP) of each species and its dependence on terrestrial organic carbon sources. Matching patterns were found between nitrogen stable isotope ratios and the literature on diets of species at the base and top of the food web. Nearly 60% of the species fed exclusively on animal prey (mean TP >3), including piscivorous and parasitic fish species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TP were distributed broadly along the phylogeny and changed gradually within lineages. Carbon stable isotope ratios differed strongly between herbivores that fed on aquatic primary producers and those that fed on terrestrial plants along banksides. Terrestrial carbon was dominant in nearly 90% of species, and most of them depended more or less exclusively on terrestrial carbon. Ancestral state reconstructions indicated that only a few lineages showed local changes toward the consumption of algal carbon. We conclude that fish in neotropical headwater streams shaded by a dense tree canopy depend strongly on terrestrial subsidies. Changes in this aquatic-terrestrial linkage would have major consequences for the remarkable fish biodiversity in these streams.

High precipitation and a low N uptake by the subsequent crop in fall cause a high risk of N2O emissions and nitrate leaching. Microbial decomposition of crop residues or high carbon amendments may immobilize mineral N temporarily and may prevent losses by direct N2O emissions. Five treatments, including crop residue removal and application of different organic amendments after harvest, were tested in a field trial in Northern Germany to elucidate the potential of this mechanism as a mitigation option. N2O emissions and the soil mineral nitrogen status were monitored from August to March for three consecutive years. Observed emissions ranged from 0.1 to 3.4 kg N ha−1 in 180 days. An empirical model approach was applied to separate the impact of spatially and temporally heterogeneous environmental conditions between the plots of the field experiment from treatment effects in the subsequent statistical analysis of N2O emissions. Results show that the exchange of the initial crop residues with organic amendments with high C:N ratios (i.e., winter wheat straw and sawdust) after the harvest of faba bean or oilseed rape can reduce N2O emission during fall and winter by up to 45%. © Copyright © 2021 Rothardt, Fuß, Pahlmann and Kage.","brassica napus; N loss mitigation; N2O emission; organic soil amendments; residue management; triticum aestivum; vicia faba",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111608110

With the advent of the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer on the Very Large Telescope (MUSE) as an efficient wide-field integral-field spectrograph, the PNLF method is due for a renaissance, as the spatial and spectral information contained in the instrument's data cubes provides many advantages over classical narrowband imaging. Here we use archival MUSE data to explore the potential of a novel differential emission-line filter (DELF) technique to produce spectrophotometry that is more accurate and more sensitive than other methods. We show that DELF analyses are superior to classical techniques in high surface brightness regions of galaxies, and we validate the method both through simulations and via the analysis of data from two early-type galaxies (NGC 1380 and NGC 474) and one late-type spiral (NGC 628). We demonstrate that with adaptive optics support or under excellent seeing conditions, the technique is capable of producing precision (≲0.05 mag) [O iii] photometry out to distances of 40 Mpc while providing discrimination between planetary nebulae and other emission-line objects such as H ii regions, supernova remnants, and background galaxies. These capabilities enable us to use MUSE to measure precise PNLF distances beyond the reach of Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch method and become an additional tool for constraining the local value of the Hubble constant. © 2021.

To meet its pledge of peak carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, China plans to shift away from coal. Fuel switching to natural gas for electrical generation is an interim solution that is in the portfolio of measures for meeting these goals. However, because of variability in emissions from coal and natural gas supply chains, the potential for benefiting from fuel switching also varies. Here, we use a high-resolution basin-to-power plant analysis for estimating methane and CO2emissions in natural gas and coal supply chains. We illustrate how the variations in supply chains at the level of the sourcing of natural gas and coal from individual production regions can lead to differences in the effectiveness of fuel switching in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The analyses are applied to four switching scenarios from domestic coal to imported natural gas at representative power plants in China. Life cycle emission factors for the natural gas supply chains evaluated in this study range from 650 to 1000 kg carbon dioxide/MWh of electricity generated and from 2.3 to 13 kg methane/MWh, depending on the allocation choice, power generation technology, and production region. For the coal supply chain, emissions range from 850 to 1100 kg carbon dioxide/MWh and from 0.4 to 4.0 kg methane/MWh, depending on the power generation technology and production region. We show that for these scenarios, in the short term fuel switching can increase radiative forcing by a factor of 3 or decrease it by 70%, depending on the supply chains, generation technology, and, in the case of natural gas, co-product allocation choices in the supply chain. We also quantify consumptive losses of natural gas over long supply chains and show that fuel switching results in differences in radiative forcing that evolve over time due to the influence of methane emissions. © 2021 The Authors.

It does so by relating their intellectual concepts and reflections to the rise of electronics and computer-aided simulation. A scene in Epstein's late film Le Tempestaire (1947), commingling mythical and modern practices of weather control, is analyzed as a primeval scene for the medial handover between time manipulating cinema and the model time of computer simulations. Instead of placing one knowledge practice over the other (the indigenous and local over the dominant and global, the scientific over the mythical, the human over the digital, etc.) the chapter argues for ways of seeing correspondence and continuity between them. It thereby follows the invitation extended by Serres and Epstein, who both theorized and celebrated what this chapter calls ""time depth"": not a clash but a compositum of temporal scales that feeds off the abundance and thickness of variable, interconnected times that saturate the geosphere and anthroposphere. Today, when dangerously rapid climate change catapults the planet back into climates last seen millions of years ago, such time depth becomes a prerequisite, not just for sharpening our sensibilities for ""deep time,"" but also for acknowledging the generous productivity of myth, science and simulation in situating the human amid hybrid temporalities. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Gabriele Dürbeck and Philip Hüpkes.

Ethanol is one of these fuels due to its presence in the energy matrix of several countries. Among the methods applied to use ethanol in compression ignition engines, the primary technique currently studied is port fuel injection (PFI). This research studies the feasibility of using ethanol as a partial fuel in a generator set analyzed beyond the technical and environmental parameters and the economic aspect. The experiments were conducted in a diesel single-cylinder engine, with its original diesel fuel direct injection system, and added an auxiliary PFI system for the ethanol supply. The research gap is based on the lack of studies that include, in addition to the analysis of performance parameters and gaseous emissions, the economic viability assessment for the studied engine, which is also a fundamental factor in an actual application. The engine was tested under different conditions of six progressive replacements of diesel fuel by ethanol, starting only with diesel fuel (baseline test) and increasing ethanol mass fraction up to 0.634. The measured data showed that ethanol effectively increased ignition delay and reduced combustion duration, which did not lead to increased efficiency and reduced fuel consumption. The maximum in-cylinder pressure was 71.3 bar in the baseline test and dropped progressively to 51.6 bar when in the most significant substitution. The rate of heat release increased by about 92.5% with ethanol concerning the baseline test. When ethanol was used, the CO emissions decreased by up to 43%, resulting in about 2.4 g/kWh, while NOx emissions reduced by up to 20% compared to the baseline test, achieving 0.69 g/kWh. The economic analysis made it clear that the operational cost increased when the engine worked with ethanol replacing partially diesel fuel. However, with a slight increase in operational cost, especially in São Paulo (SP) state, it is possible to reduce pollutant emissions. For the baseline test, the operating cost was 0.354 U$/kWh. The specific fuel cost reaches a maximum of 0.441 U$/kWh, 25% higher than the respective baseline test, increasing ethanol fraction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Compression ignition engine; Dual fuel; Economic viability analysis; Ethanol","Cost benefit analysis; Diesel fuels; Direct injection; Dual fuel engines; Economic analysis; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ignition; Laws and legislation; Testing; Baseline tests; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Dual-fuels; Economic viability analysis; Environmental economics; Fuel ethanol; Port fuel injections; Port injection; Technical analysis; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105731427

The tumor stroma of ACCs includes cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) expressing Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP), a new target for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Here we describe the value of PET/ computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging using 68Ga-labelled FAP-Inhibitors (68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT) and their clinical potential for staging and radiotherapy planning in 12 ACC patients (7 primary, 5 recurrent). Patients and methods: Patients underwent contrast enhanced staging CT (ceCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (ceMRI) before 68Ga-FAPI - PET/CT. PET-scans were acquired 10, 60 and 180 minutes after administration of 150–250 MBq of 68Ga-labelled FAPI tracers. SUVmax and SUVmean values of ACCs and healthy organs were obtained using a 60% of maximum iso-contour. FAP and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) immunohistochemistry was performed in 13 cases (3 with and 10 without 68Ga FAPI-PET/CT). Staging and radiotherapy planning based on 68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT versus ceCT/MRI alone were compared. Results: We observed elevated tracer uptake in all ACCs. Immunohistochemistry showed FAP-expressing CAFs in the tumor. Compared to conventional staging, 68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT led to upstaging in 2/12 patients and to detection of additional metastases in 3 patients, thus in total 42% of patients had their staging altered. Moreover, 68Ga-FAPI PET improved the accuracy of target volume delineation for radiotherapy, as compared to CT and MRI. Conclusion: 68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT is a promising imaging modality for ACC, increasing the accuracy of staging exams and radiotherapy planning volumes, as compared conventional to CT and MRI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","ACC; Adenoid cystic carcinoma; FAP; Fibroblast Activation Protein; Positron Emission Tomography; Radiotherapy","alpha smooth muscle actin; fap inhibitor ga 68; radiopharmaceutical agent; smooth muscle actin; unclassified drug; gallium; adenoid cystic carcinoma; adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical article; cohort analysis; contrast enhancement; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; male; maximum standardized uptake value; mean standardized uptake value; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; adenoid cystic carcinoma; diagnostic imaging; positron emission tomography; Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic; Gallium Radioisotopes; Humans; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Positron-Emission Tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106965311

The lockdowns significantly reduced road traffic and meant that many people worked remotely. Therefore, the question arose as to how the reduced road traffic and stays of residents at home affected the degree of pollution and the structure of major air pollutants. To answer this question, the article presents an analysis of changes in typical air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2) in the five largest Polish cities and one of the voivodships. The data from the Polish State Environmental Monitoring were used for the analysis. The analysis showed that the period of the first lockdown in Poland (April 2020), despite the reduced road traffic, resulted in a significant increase in PM10 emissions (9–91% during working days and an average of 30% on Saturdays and Sundays), a slight increase in PM2.5 emissions (on average from 2% to 11% for all analyzed locations), and a reduction in NO2 emissions (on average from 6% to 11% for all analyzed locations) compared to the period before the lockdown. However, the changes were not homogeneous—in Łódź and Warsaw, in most cases, an increase in all analyzed pollutants was observed, and the greatest decrease in pollution took place in Małopolska voivodship (including Kraków). Comparing the data from April 2020 to the data from April 2019, the overall difference in the PMs concentrations was small, although there are places where there has been a significant decrease (Wrocław, Poznań), and there were also places where the concentration increased (Warsaw, Łódź, Małopolska). In the case of nitrogen dioxide, pollution concentration decreased in most locations. The only exception was the background stations in Warsaw, where the increase was 27%. © 2021 by the authors.

Habitat projections are therefore critical to inform management decisions. Past and ongoing research has improved streamflow and temperature modelling in ungauged regions, but no studies merge these advancements with climate modelling for regional streamflow and stream temperatures predictions that describe stream habitat change. Here, we predict change in streamflow and stream temperature at the reach scale using projections from downscaled global climate models (GCMs) and the ‘business as usual’ carbon emission scenario. We focus on unaltered streams in six southern California watersheds using data from baseline (1982–2014) and projected end-of-century (2082–2100). Stream temperature is projected to increase regionally, with high-elevation stream reaches increasing most rapidly. There is less consistency in the streamflow projections, but a spatial and temporal homogenization of stream flow characteristics was predicted, that is, flows become more similar across the region with less inter-annual variation. Additionally, there is a regional trend towards larger high flow magnitudes and more storm events. Despite the increased frequency and magnitude of storm events, high-elevation streams are predicted to become drier for a greater portion of the year. Conversely, low-elevation streams are predicted to have longer hydroperiods. Mapping future streamflow and stream temperatures at the reach scale can direct conservation efforts to streams that remain suitable, restoration to areas that decrease in suitability for target species, and support water policies that consider future stream condition. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","climate change; CMIP5; conservation planning; hydrologic modelling; random forest; riparian habitat; stream temperature","Climate models; Conservation; Data streams; Ecosystems; Storms; Stream flow; Water management; Air temperature changes; Flow charac-teristics; Global climate model; Interannual variation; Low-elevation streams; Management decisions; Stream temperatures; Temperature modelling; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; riparian forest; sensitivity analysis; temperature profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105238947

A key shortcoming in the scientific understanding of these impacts is the lack of studies that are conducted in a coordinated and consistent fashion, producing directly comparable outputs. This Viewpoint discusses and exemplifies a bottom-up initiative generating new research evidence in a more coordinated and consistent way compared with previous efforts. It describes one of the largest model comparisons of projected health impacts due to climate change, so far. Yet, the included studies constitute only a selection of health impacts in a variety of geographical locations, and are therefore not a comprehensive assessment of all possible impact pathways and potential consequences. The new findings of these studies shed light on the complex and multidirectional impacts of climate change on health, where impacts can be both adverse or beneficial. However, the adverse impacts dominate overall, especially in the scenarios with more greenhouse gas forcing. Overall, the future population at risk of disease and incidence rates are predicted to increase substantially, but in a highly location-specific and disease-specific fashion. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation can substantially reduce risk and resultant morbidity and mortality. The potential positive impact of adaptation has not been included in the models applied, and thus remains a major source of uncertainty. This bottom-up initiative lays out a research strategy that brings more meaningful research outputs and calls for greater coordination of research initiatives across the health community. © 2021 The Author(s).

We employed existing approaches to calculate the potential for a suite of Natural Climate Solution (NCS) pathways to reduce Washington's net emissions under three implementation scenarios: Limited, Moderate, and Ambitious. We found that NCS could reduce emissions between 4.3 and 8.8 MMT CO2eyr−1 in thirty-one years, accounting for 4% to 9% of the State's net zero goal. These potential reductions largely rely on changing forest management practices on portions of private and public timber lands. We also mapped the distribution of each pathway's Ambitious potential emissions reductions by county, revealing spatial clustering of high potential reductions in three regions closely tied to major business sectors: private industrial forestry in southwestern coastal forests, cropland agriculture in the Columbia Basin, and urban and rural development in the Puget Trough. Overall, potential emissions reductions are provided largely by a single pathway, Extended Timber Harvest Rotations, which mostly clusters in southwestern counties. However, mapping distribution of each of the other pathways reveals wider distribution of each pathway's unique geographic relevance to support fair, just, and efficient deployment. Although the relative potential for a single pathway to contribute to statewide emissions reductions may be small, they could provide co-benefits to people, communities, economies, and nature for adaptation and resiliency across the state.

Results show that these temporary bans reduce car trips by 6–9% during peak hours, and by 7–8% during off-peak hours. This is consistent with air pollution reductions during peak hours, and with increases in the use of Santiago's mass-transit systems during hours the systems run with excess capacity.

World health organization (WHO) data from six regions between April and August 2020 was evaluated. Emission levels during the COVID-19 lockdown were reviewed. The global renewable energy potentials were ascertained. The paper suggests that investment in renewable energy resources for various countries’ energy needs will help sustain the green and clean environment created by the COVID-19 lockdown even after COVID-19 era lockdown. Also, building large scale and distributed energy storage infrastructure and application of artificial intelligence would ensure security of energy supply and handle unstable nature of solar and wind energy. The COVID-19 lockdown significantly reduced air pollution. The application of biofuels to generate energy and power was found to significantly reduce air pollutant emissions similar to COVID-19 lockdown. © 2021 The Author(s)","COVID-19 pandemic; Energy policy; Environmental pollution; Lockdown; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109533967

The Spanish Government has been performing modifications on its Building Technical Code (BTC) to address this issue, following European Directives. An assessment of the development of the Spanish BTC from its first 2006 version has been conducted in this work. A standard Spanish detached house was placed in the different Spanish climatic zones, designed with the minimum requirements of the 2006 and 2013 BTCs, and was then analyzed using the software Cerma. The results show that energy demand is reduced and the energy rating is improved with the stricter requirements introduced in the 2013 BTC. Although energy demand and CO2 emissions vary significantly among the 13 different climatic zones studied, the BTC modifications allow to reach a minimum energy rating independently of the climatic zone where the house is located. Opaque enclosures and internal loads were found to be the main contributors to building-related emissions. Additionally, possible actions to improve energy rating in detached houses are evaluated, finding that a moderate insulation thickness increase and the installation of heat pumps allow to reach the highest energy rating, being the improvement more apparent in northern and central regions. The results of this work may be extrapolated to other countries with similar climatic conditions to the studied zones, providing guidelines to fulfill energy saving regulations, evaluate emission sources and improve building energy efficiency.

Here, we present a first attempt to “geoengineer” a well-known teleconnection between sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and Sahelian precipitation. Using idealized earth system model simulations, we show that selectively cooling the Indian Ocean efficiently increases precipitation in the Sahel region, widening the seasonally migrating rainband over Africa. Applying the SST perturbations derived from the idealized experiments to observationally constrained historical ones, we find that our intervention can reverse conditions as extreme as the mid-20th century Sahelian drought, albeit less efficiently than in the idealized simulations. Side effects include changes in the seasonal distribution of Sahelian precipitation and substantial precipitation reductions in sub-Saharan East Africa.

Crops most affected include cotton, tomato, soybean, grain crops such as corn and sorghum, chickpea and other pulses. Adults of this species possess strong migratory abilities (>2000 km), high fecundity and rapid reproductive rates; completing 4–6 generations per year in most cropping regions. Furthermore, the larvae are polyphagous, with a wide and diverse host range and possess the ability to enter diapause in order to survive adverse climatic conditions. At present, it is distributed across most of Oceania, Asia, Africa and southern Europe and has recently spread to South America. Various control measures have been trialled or proposed for the treatment of this pest, including synthetic insecticides, phytopesticides, microbial pesticides, macro-biocontrol agents (both parasitoids and predators) and the development of genetically modified crops (e.g. Bt cotton). Successful control necessitates the use of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, wherein biological, chemical and physical control measures are combined for the greatest control efficacy. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Biocontrol; Bt cotton; cosmopolitan pest; insecticide resistance","biological control; climate conditions; cotton; estimation method; fecundity; fruit; home range; integrated approach; maize; management practice; moth; pest damage; reproduction; sorghum; soybean; Africa; Asia; Europe; South America; Cicer arietinum; Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum; Helicoverpa armigera; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Lycopersicon esculentum; Noctuidae; Oceania",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103398869

Consequently, environmental exposures, including air pollution, have been hypothesized to contribute to the etiology of neurodegeneration. Because persistently elevated rates of AD mortality in the southern Piedmont area of North Carolina (NC) have been documented, we studied mortality and hospital admissions for AD, non-AD dementia, and PD in residential populations aged 65+ with long-term exposures to elevated levels of ambient air particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards (≥10μg/m3). Health data were obtained from the State Center for Health Statistics and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. PM2.5 levels were obtained from the MODIS/MISR and SeaWiFS datafiles. Residents in the Study group of elevated air particulate matter (87 zip codes with PM2.5≥10μg/m3) were compared to the residents in the Control group with low levels of air particulate matter (81 zip codes with PM2.5≤7.61μg/m3), and were found to have higher age-adjusted rates of mortality and hospital admissions for AD, non-AD dementia, and PD, including a most pronounced increase in AD mortality (323/100,000 vs. 257/ 100,000, respectively). After adjustment for multiple co-factors, the risk of death (odds ratio, or OR) from AD in the Study group (OR = 1.35, 95%CI[1.24–1.48]) was significantly higher than ORs of non-AD dementia or PD (OR = 0.97, 95%CI[0.90–1.04] and OR = 1.13, 95%CI [0.92–1.31]). The OR of hospital admissions was significantly increased only for AD as a primary case of hospitalization (OR = 1.54, 95%CI[1.31–1.82]). Conclusion: NC residents aged 65+ with long-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 levels exceeding the WHO standard had significantly increased risks of death and hospital admissions for AD.

This paper discusses the wind energy system connected to the micro grid system used for small scale operations. Wind Energy Systems are connected to the grid through a conventional two level inverter which results in high value of THD and harmonics in current. This problem can be overcome by multilevel converter with different switching strategies. The simulation is done in MATLAB tool and comparison is made to prove the results with hybrid multilevel inverter provide low value of THD. Distribution of Reusable Energy based power generation plants, their incorporation into the already existing utility grid will result to the concept of Micro grid and Smart grid system which can be obtained from the Simulation and investigation of a standalone DC Micro grid System. Proposed system utilizes wind Energy system as the main source of the grid and battery as the Energy Storage System (ESS). Usage of renewable energy sources for electrical application will meaningfully lower the fuel consumption for the generation of electrical power that in turn automatically reduces the emissions of greenhouse toxic gas. Along with wind energy system, this paper proposes a design that joins the doubly taken care of enlistment generator (DFIG) based breeze turbine and Solid State Transformer activity. Because of the breeze power being a wild asset, different issues in regards to control quality and security issues are created.

The results showed that adding DM was beneficial for reducing CH4 emissions and greenhouse gas emission equivalent (GHGE) values by 15.63–24.25% and 14.33–69.08%, respectively. Meanwhile, the main contributor to the GHGE value was N2O (58.76–75.98%), followed by CH4 (17.22–29.16%) and NH3 (6.38–13.36%). Moreover, the maximum values in the degradation of total organic matter and the formation rate of humic acid were 20.46% and 82.19% in 10% DM added treatment (T3), respectively. Furthermore, the increase in spectral parameters, including the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), the specific UV absorbance at 280 nm (SUVA280) and Fourier transform - infrared parameters were facilitated by DM amendment. Additionally, the higher values of the relative abundances of Proteobacteria (50.98%) and Bacteroidetes (12.73%), and related metabolisms such as carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism, as well as the lower value of methane metabolism reported in T3, supported the difference in CH4 and humification of the two treatments.

Although there is disagreement about the underlying reasons for this diagnosis, there are few attempts to further our understanding of how the liberal order can be reinvigorated. This paper probes the potential of blockchain technology to promote international cooperation. Blockchain technology is a data structure that enables global governance stakeholders to establish decentralized governance systems which provide high-powered incentives for enhanced cooperation. By outlining the contours of a blockchain-based global governance system for climate policy, the paper illustrates that blockchain technology holds theoretical promise to foster cooperation in three ways: leveraging new sources of information through blockchain-based prediction markets; allaying coordinating problems through reducing the cost of transactions for side payments; and allowing states and other global governance actors to make more credible commitments given guaranteed execution of blockchain-enabled smart contracts. By empowering local knowledge holders and non-state actors that traditionally lacked the means to coordinate efforts to influence global politics, blockchain technology also promises to advance an international order based on liberal values. In actuality, however, emerging blockchain-based global governance systems will fall short of the libertarian ideal of 'fully-automated liberalism' as their design and operation will remain under the shadow of power. © The Author(s), 2020.

Treatment of MRONJ is considered primarily conservative with oral mouth rinses and antibiotics but may demand surgery, depending on the complaints and general condition of the patient, the extent of the necrosis, and the overall prognosis with respect to the underlying disease. A 77 year old female patient with invasive ductal breast cancer and bone metastases was treated with intravenous bisphosphonate (BP) zoledronic acid. During therapy, she developed MRONJ in the mandible with severe pain. Clinical examination revealed confluent exposed bone of the lower left jaw and a fistula at the right molar region. The panoramic radiograph revealed a mandibular osseous involvement with diffuse radiopaque areas between radiolucent areas. For preoperative planning, 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) of the jaw was performed, showing substantially increased 18F-fluoride uptake in regions 38 to 47 of the mandible with a focal gap in region 36 (area of clinically exposed bone). CT revealed medullary sclerosis and cortical thickening with confluent periosteal reaction and focal cortical erosion in the regions 37 to 42, whereas the regions 43 to 47 were only subtly sclerotic without cortical thickening. After systemic antibiotic therapy with sultamicillin following significant symptom and pain relief, 18F-fluoride PET/CT imaging was performed again after 5 months. No changes in either CT and PET were observed in regions 38 to 42, whereas the bony sclerosis was slightly increased in regions 43 to 47 with a slight reduction of 18F-fluoride uptake. 18F-fluoride PET/CT showed no significant changes assessing the extent of MRONJ prior and after systemic antibiotic therapy, providing no evidence that conservative treatment reduced the extent of the MRONJ-affected jawbone. The additional information of 18F-fluoride PET enables to identify the true extent of MRONJ which may be underestimated by CT imaging alone.

As a result, recent studies have attempted to address the problem of how to optimally integrate satellite systems with other sectors of the urban sphere, such as the local economy, the power supply, and the regional carbon footprint. However, such studies are merely based on the spatial domain, thus neglecting potential time-dependent strategies that could further improve the sustainability of metropolitan water systems. Therefore, in this study a new conceptual framework is proposed for the dynamic management of hybrid systems comprised of both centralized and satellite WRRFs. Furthermore, a novel set of integrated real-time control (RTC) strategies are considered to analyze three different scenarios: 1) demand response, 2) flow equalization of the centralized WRRF and 3) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Data from a case study in California is used to develop an integrated dynamic model of a system of 8 facilities. Our results show that by dynamically shifting the dry-weather influent wastewater flows between hydraulically connected WRRFs, a reduction in power demand (up to 25%), energy use (4%), operating costs (8.5%) and indirect carbon emissions (4.5%) can be achieved. Therefore, this study suggests that a certain degree of hydraulic interconnection coupled with dynamic load-shifting strategies, can broaden the operational flexibility and overall sustainability of hybrid WRRF systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decentralized wastewater treatment; Demand response; Integrated modeling; Real-time control; Urban water management; Water-energy nexus","Carbon footprint; Dynamic loads; Electric power utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Operating costs; Satellites; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Decentralized wastewater treatment; Demand response; Integrated modeling; Load shifting; Power demands; Real-time control; Resource recovery; Urban water management; Water-energy nexus; Waters resources; Real time control; carbon; abatement cost; conceptual framework; cost analysis; energy use; greenhouse gas; recycling; urban area; wastewater treatment; Article; California; carbon footprint; chemical oxygen demand; circadian rhythm; conceptual framework; cost benefit analysis; effluent; energy consumption; greenhouse gas; power supply; simulation; waste water treatment plant; water management; water supply; city; greenhouse effect; wastewater; California; United States; Carbon Footprint; Cities; Greenhouse Effect; Waste Water; Water Purification; Water Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107031317

Also, the bypassing of regional level legislation, policy frameworks, and socio-culturally appropriate design and instrumentation in favor of a ""globalist"" process of fragmented institutionalism, have contributed to a vacuum that has impeded regions such as the Middle East and Northern Africa to intensely and effectively address climate change and ensuing region-specific sustainability challenges.

Despite the persistent occurrence of reworked fine fraction carbonates as attested by microfossils across the investigated interval, the carbon isotope stratigraphy of Lurestan shows a good correlation with those in the eastern and western Tethys from the Shahneshin section in central Zargos (Fars Province) and Gubbio of northern Apennines in Italy (Gubbio). The succession can be assigned an age range from late Campanian to early Danian based on the integrated stratigraphy. The results from the Gandab section, as well as field observations in more northeasterly areas of Lurestan, point to lateral facies variation of the Campanian–Danian interval associated with tectonic activity during the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene of the Zagros Basin. According to the known distribution of facies across the SW-NE transect of Lurestan and detailed ages delineated in the Gandab section, a schematic model of syntectonic sedimentation and facies distribution is drawn.

Subsequently, a set of vital green elements that achieved (RII value ≥ 0.76) were identified that upgraded and strengthened each UGI indicator's quality. Additionally, it helps to reinforce an intricate connection among climate resilience strategies, green spaces, ecosystem functions, and human health/wellbeing in the study region.

Reducing climate-related impacts on oak woodland habitats and ecosystems through adaptation management requires knowledge of different site interactions in relation to species tolerance. In Britain, the required thematic detail of woodland type is unavailable from digital maps. A species distribution model (SDM) ensemble, using biomod2 algorithms, was used to predict oak woodland. The model was cross-validated (50%:50% - training:testing) 30 times, with each of 15 random sets of absence data, matching the size of presence data, to maximize environmental variation while maintaining data prevalence. Four biomod2 algorithms provided stable and consistent TSS-weighted ensemble mean results predicting oak woodland as a probability raster. Biophysical data from the Ecological Site Classification (forest site classification) for Britain were used to characterize oak woodland sites. Several forest datasets were used, each with merits and weaknesses: public forest estate subcompartment database map (PFE map) for oak-stand locations as a training dataset; the national forest inventory (NFI) “published regional reports” of oak woodland area; and an “NFI map” of indicative forest type broad habitat. Broadleaved woodland polygons of the NFI map were filled with the biomod2 oak woodland probability raster. Ranked pixels were selected up to the published NFI regional area estimate of oak woodland and matched to the elevation distribution of oak woodland stands, from “NFI survey” sample squares. Validation using separate oak woodland data showed that the elevation filter significantly improved the accuracy of predictions from 55% (p =.53) to 83% coincidence success rate (p <.0001). The biomod2 ensemble, with masking and filtering, produced a predicted oak woodland map, from which site characteristics will be used in climate change interaction studies, supporting adaptation management recommendations for forest policy and practice. © 2021 Crown copyright.

However, the configuration and operational features of a DH system affect significantly its environmental performance. The objective of the present study is the energetic and environmental assessment of DH networks that present differences in size and operating configurations, to define relevant environmental performance indicators. Three case studies in Italy are analyzed, following a methodology based on the impact pathway approach that was presented by the authors in previous studies. Case studies are evaluated in terms of total emission, pollutant concentration (NOx, CO, PM), and health damage external costs. Results show that lower pollutant emissions are associated with the installation of a DH system compared to autonomous residential boilers. Air quality is also improved and health externalities are reduced. The results of CO2 savings are differentiated depending on the efficiency and emission factors of the systems. An inter-comparison of different cases is then presented, based on the elaboration of specific indicators of environmental and health impacts. This section shows that, besides the size of the DH system, other factors, such as population density and geographical distribution of pollutants concentration, are important. Among the indicators considered, those based on health externalities provide more complete and comparable information on the final impact of the alternative solutions on the exposed population. Their application seems thus promising for the evaluation of alternative planning strategies for DH systems. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; District heating network; Emission; Environmental sustainability; Externalities; Health impact assessment","air quality; carbon emission; environmental assessment; environmental indicator; geographical distribution; heating; methodology; population density; spatiotemporal analysis; Italy; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; heating; Italy; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Indicators; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Italy; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084119518

The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has further disrupted agricultural activities and supply chains and has become a serious threat for public health. Like in many developing countries, South Asian farmers are now facing the double challenge of addressing the impacts of a changing climate and managing the disruptions caused by COVID-19. Despite growing concern, there is limited understanding of how climate change, public health, and COVID-19 interact, and of the possible pathways to achieving a climate-friendly recovery from COVID-19 to achieve food and nutrition security. In view of this, this paper explores the multifaceted challenges that farmers are now facing in South Asia due to climate change and the disruption caused by COVID-19 from the agricultural and food security lens. The analysis reveals that the complex interactions of COVID-19 and climate change have impacted all dimensions of food security. These interlinkages demand an integrated approach in dealing with food, public health, and climate change to harness synergies and minimize trade-offs between food production, public health, and climate mitigation. I present a framework to address the immediate challenge of COVID-19 and the longer-term challenge of anthropogenic climate change. Key elements of the framework include the strengthening health sector response capacities, strengthening of local and regional food systems, making agriculture resilient to pandemics, adopting flexible and smart approaches—including the implementation of climate-smart agricultural interventions on different scales, promotion of appropriate research and innovation, and the integration of short-term support to address the challenges of COVID-19 to build long-term productivity, and resilience of food systems by investing on natural capital. This framework would enable policy makers to choose the appropriate policy responses at different scales, to address these twin challenges of COVID-19 and climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Rasul.","climate change; climate smart agriculture; COVID-19; COVID-19 smart food system; food security; public health; South Asia; sustainable agriculture",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112099605

In the UK, 28 local authorities with illegal pollution levels have been mandated by the Government to develop plans to rapidly reduce pollution to legal limits. These plans include consideration of implementing one of four of charging 'Clean Air Zone' (CAZ) classes in areas of high pollution which would charge older polluting vehicles a daily charge to enter. While this offers a potential to improve air quality, the extent to which CAZ might impact (for example, economically) on socio-economically deprived groups and local businesses is unclear. AIMS: To explore the acceptability and perceived unintended consequences of a CAZ and other initiatives to improve air quality with seldom-heard communities living in deprived, multi-ethnic areas within the city of Bradford, UK. METHODS: Ten semi-structured focus groups were conducted with people who live in areas of high pollution and deprivation. A total of 87 people participated from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds with the majority of Pakistani origin. Recorded data were transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: As poor air quality was not always visible it was seen as a hidden issue by many, and not prioritised over other more visible environmental issues (e.g. fly-tipping, littering). There was resistance to proposals which included charging private vehicles. Many felt that low-income families did not have the resources to purchase compliant vehicles or pay daily charges, placing a disproportionate burden on them. It was also felt that low-income taxi drivers would be disproportionately affected financially by proposals. Public transport infrastructure was felt to be inadequate. Other traffic management or emission reduction activities were also explored. Views towards these initiatives were more positive if they did not directly affect individuals financially. CONCLUSION: Air quality initiatives such as CAZs were felt to be likely to financially disadvantage communities already living in socio-economic and environmental poverty. Policy makers need to carefully consider appropriate mitigation strategies to ensure that health and economic inequalities are not increased by implementation of CAZ. Given air quality is low priority for some groups, careful engagement and communication will be required to increase acceptance interventions such as CAZs.","Air pollutants; Air quality; Bradford; Clean air zone; Cycle lanes; Environmental justice; Health inequalities; Seldom heard; Traffic; Transport","air pollution; human; pollution; poverty; prevention and control; total quality management; United Kingdom; Air Pollution; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Poverty; Quality Improvement; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110903121

Environmental justice scholars have since the 1980s identified urban “fence-line” communities as Sacrifice Zones, such as those along the industrialized Mississippi River corridor downstream of Baton Rouge, La., where public health and property values are impacted by plant emissions. More recent scholarship has identified analogous dispossession in coastal Louisiana, where indigenous and communities of color suffer environmental degradation and land loss from oil industry practices. Coastal oil and gas operations have left behind thousands of miles of pipelines, canals and subsiding oil fields that have accelerated marsh desiccation and land loss. This article argues that both inland and coastal areas of Louisiana are being sacrificed by the fossil fuel industry on a continuum of harm along pipelines from wellheads to inland plants. Oil wells, refineries, and petrochemical plants exist as nodes along a single line of production and manufactured demand for petroleum-based products, which also litter waterways and oceans. Such a continuum establishes a single Sacrifice Zone that conjoins multiple sites.

However, the usefulness of the cycle has become questionable in diverse urban settings. Thus, this research uses a pragmatic approach to identify challenges in the effectiveness of the conventional disaster risk management cycle and its phases in the context of urban flooding in Pakistan. Institutions involved in flood risk management were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Three focus group discussions were also held to understand the viewpoints of selected communities. Thematic analysis was used to categorize views and responses under each phase. The analysis reveals that, despite the advent of disaster risk reduction strategies, local institutions are still relying on reactive approaches and are managing flood risk on an ad-hoc basis. Weak governance and limited corrective measures for existing development patterns are making it difficult to manage flood risks. There is an urgent need to perform multi-hazard vulnerability and risk assessment, and develop specific strategies under the philosophies of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. This study recommends the inclusion of climate change adaptation and resilience in the current management cycle for reducing future urban risks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk management; Disaster risk reduction, urban resilience; Urban flooding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107950893

This study aimed to investigate the association between parental support and students’ psychological complaints, while also examining the possible mediating role that a good school climate may have. Data derives from 5783 senior-level students (age 15–16) distributed over 152 school units in Stockholm municipality. Regression linear analysis was used for the analysis and Baron and Kenny’s four-step mediation model has been applied. Sobel’s test was conducted in order to test the significance of the mediation effect. The results show that there is a significant negative association between parental support and students’ psychological complaints, and that school climate has a mediating role in this association. It can be concluded that school climate has a partly mediating role in the association between parental support and students’ psychological complaints. Therefore, it seems important to develop the school climate in order to strengthen this source of support to reduce mental health problems among adolescents. © 2021 by the authors.","Adolescence; Mediating; Mental health problems; Parental support; Psychological complaints; School climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113899059

Vehicle emissions generally depend on many factors, such as the nature of the vehicle, driving style, traffic conditions, emission control technologies, and operational conditions. Concerns about the certification cycles used by various regulatory authorities are growing due to the difference in emission during certification procedure and Real Driving Emissions (RDE). Under laboratory condi-tions, certification tests are performed in a ‘chassis dynamometer’ for light‐duty vehicles (LDVs) and an ‘engine dynamometer’ for heavy‐duty vehicles (HDVs). As a result, the test drive cycles used to measure the automotive emissions do not correctly reflect the vehicle’s real‐world driving pattern. Consequently, the RDE regulation is being phased in to reduce the disparity between type approval and vehicle’s real‐world emissions. According to this review, different variables such as traffic signals, driving dynamics, congestions, altitude, ambient temperature, and so on have a ma-jor influence on actual driving pollution. Aside from that, cold‐start and hot‐start have been shown to have an effect on on‐road pollution. Contrary to common opinion, new technology such as start-stop systems boost automotive emissions rather than decreasing them owing to unfavourable conditions from the point of view of exhaust emissions and exhaust after‐treatment systems. In addi-tion, the driving dynamics are not represented in the current laboratory‐based test procedures. As a result, it is critical to establish an on‐road testing protocol to obtain a true representation of vehic-ular emissions and reduce emissions to a standard level. The incorporation of RDE clauses into certification procedures would have a positive impact on global air quality. © 2021 by the authors.

Brake wear accounts for 55% of non-exhaust emissions and significantly contributes to urban health diseases related to air pollution. A major part of the studies reported in the scientific literature are focused on experimental methods to sample and characterize brake wear particles in a reliable, representative, and repeatable way. In this framework, simulation is an important tool, which makes it possible to give interpretations of the experimental results, formulate new testing approaches, and predict the emission produced by brakes. The present comprehensive literature review aims to introduce the state of the art of the research on the different aspects of airborne wear debris resulting from brake systems which can be used as inputs in future simulation models. In this review, previous studies focusing on airborne emissions produced by brake systems are investigated in three main categories: The subsystem level, system level, and environmental level. As well as all the information provided in the literature, the simulation methodologies are also investigated at all levels. It can be concluded from the present review study that various factors, such as the uncertainty and repeatability of the brake wear experiments, distinguish the results of the subsystem and system levels. This gap should be taken into account in the development of future experimental and simulation methods for the investigation of airborne brake wear emissions. © 2021 by the authors.","Airborne particles; Brake wear; Emission factor; Non-exhaust emission; Simulation","Pollution; Wear of materials; Airborne emissions; Airborne pollutants; Environmental levels; Exhaust emission; Experimental methods; Literature reviews; Scientific literature; Simulation methodology; Brakes; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; experiment; particulate matter; traffic emission; wear",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109860363

Almost all countries worldwide are experiencing Covid-19 is no exception impacting the agricultural sector. This decrease in production and welfare level is due to the reduction of agricultural crop production. One of the risk factors for food security in the Covid pandemic era is extreme weather. Climate change causes global and domestic food stocks to decline and causes fluctuations in food prices and the food logistics system. This condition impacted the decrease in farmers' income and welfare (NTP = Farmer Exchange Rate) and resulted in the poverty of farmers' households. This study aims to (1) identify the production and income reductions from climate change and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, (2) analyze the poverty level of farmer households, (3) knowing the coping mechanism of farmer households to address climate change and the impact of Covid-19.

Industrial activities and transportation are some of the main contributors to carbon dioxide emission. Bridges are the key element in the transportation system and many of them are reaching the end of their designed service life. Replacing bridges requires a significant amount of construction materials and equipment, which will lead to significant carbon dioxide emissions. In this work, we conclude that carbon dioxide emission can be reduced by applying structural health monitoring (SHM) instrumentation and techniques to bridge management. In this work, two medium span steel girder bridges have been used to study the impact of the application of SHM on the emitted carbon dioxide. From two monitored bridges traffic load strains were used to monitor the load distribution factor and neutral axis position of each girder. This data can be used to extend the service life of these bridges. By extending the service life of a bridge, the average annual carbon dioxide emission associated with the bridge is reduced. Considering the emission due to material production and construction, the carbon dioxide emission due to bridge reconstruction will decrease by 9–17% under the assumption that the application of SHM will extend the service life of a bridge by 5–10 years. Data from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for the state of Iowa, which includes the number of structurally deficient bridges, was used to estimate the short-term and long-term cumulative CO2 emission for a fleet of bridges. It was concluded that if all structurally deficient bridges (rating 3 or less) in Iowa were replaced for the 2000–2019 time period, the cumulative CO2 emission would have been 4,38,483 tonnes. However, if SHM were to be applied and extended the service life of 80% of these bridges by 5 or 10 years the total emission would have been reduced to 2,84,048 tonnes or 1,75,695 tonnes. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bridges; Carbon dioxide emission; Greenhouse gas emission; Structural health monitoring; Sustainability","Bridges; Construction equipment; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Highway administration; Industrial emissions; Lead compounds; Service life; Structural health monitoring; Bridge reconstruction; Carbon dioxide emissions; Federal Highway Administration; Industrial activities; Load distribution factor; Steel girder bridge; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Transportation system; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102080596

This region is also particularly vulnerable to forest mortality from drought, insect attack, and wildfires, thus requiring constant monitoring to assess ecosystem health. Carbon monitoring techniques are challenged by the complex mountainous terrain, thus there is an opportunity for data assimilation systems that combine land surface models and satellite-derived observations to provide improved carbon monitoring. Here, we use the Data Assimilation Research Testbed to adjust the Community Land Model (CLM5.0) with remotely sensed observations of leaf area and above-ground biomass. The adjusted simulation significantly reduced the above-ground biomass and leaf area, leading to a reduction in both photosynthesis and respiration fluxes. The reduction in the carbon fluxes mostly offset, thus both the adjusted and free simulation projected a weak carbon sink to the land. This result differed from a separate observation-constrained model (FLUXCOM) that projected strong carbon uptake to the land. Simulation diagnostics suggested water limitation had an important influence upon the magnitude and spatial pattern of carbon uptake through photosynthesis. We recommend that additional observations important for water cycling (e.g., snow water equivalent, land surface temperature) be included to improve the veracity of the spatial pattern in carbon uptake. Furthermore, the assimilation system should be enhanced to maximize the number of the simulated state variables that are adjusted, especially those related to the recommended observed quantities including water cycling and soil carbon. © 2021.

Generally, this relationship is manifested as a positive carbon isotopic excursion where the rising limb of the excursion is associated with transgression. These excursions exist because sea level can influence 1) local/regional/global carbon cycling, 2) basin restriction and meteoric influence, and 3) carbonate sedimentation. The first two processes are influenced, in part, by the large carbon reservoir represented by the terrestrial biosphere. Our goal is to explore the relationship between carbon isotopes and sea level prior to the evolution of vascular plants at a time when the terrestrial carbon reservoir was far smaller. This study focuses on the Upper Ordovician Union Furnace section in Pennsylvania, where a previously documented ~1‰ increase in δ13C values in the upper Sandbian (458.4–453.0 Ma; referred to as the “baseline shift”) has been interpreted to reflect a perturbation to the global carbon cycle due to the proliferation of non-vascular plants. By focusing on the interval deposited before the “baseline shift”, we were able to examine the relationship between sea level, carbon isotopes, and some of the earliest terrestrial ecosystems. We present a high-resolution δ13C record directly tied to the sedimentological and sequence stratigraphic framework. By sampling genetically related packages of rock we were able to document a relationship between carbon isotopes and sea level at the sequence and parasequence level. Our results show that carbon isotopic values decreased during transgressions and increased during regressions. This seemingly inverse relationship between δ13C values and sea level is interpreted to reflect increased terrestrial fluxes during regression in a world devoid of vascular plants. Our results suggest that the early colonization of land by non-vascular plants impacted regional carbon cycling in the Appalachian Basin and eventually the global carbon cycle in the Late Ordovician. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Appalachian Basin; Carbon cycle; Epicontinental sea; Non-vascular plants; Sandbian; Sea level","carbon cycle; carbon isotope; colonization; depositional environment; isotopic analysis; Ordovician; parasequence; perturbation; plant; sea level change; terrestrial environment; vascular plant; Appalachian Basin; Black River [Michigan]; Michigan; Pennsylvania; Trenton; United States; Embryophyta; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105820205

Traffic flow decreased by up to 80% during the lockdown and remained relatively low during the full relaxation (June and July). After the lockdown a significant shift from public transport to private vehicles (+21% in Barcelona) persisted due to the pervasive fear that using public transport might increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which need to be reverted as soon as possible. NO2 levels fell below 50% of the WHO annual air quality guidelines (WHOAQGs), but those of PM2.5 were reduced less than expected due to the lower contributions from traffic, increased contributions from agricultural and domestic biomass burning, or meteorological conditions favoring high secondary aerosol formation yields. Even during the lockdown, the annual PM2.5 WHOAQG was exceeded in cities within the NE and E regions with high NH3 emissions from farming and agriculture. Decreases in PM10 levels were greater than in PM2.5 due to reduced emissions from road dust, vehicle wear, and construction/demolition. Averaged O3 daily maximum 8-h (8hDM) experienced a generalized decrease in the rural receptor sites in the relaxation (June–July) with −20% reduced mobility. For urban areas O3 8hDM responses were heterogeneous, with increases or decreases depending on the period and location. Thus, after canceling out the effect of meteorology, 5 out of 11 cities experienced O3 decreases during the lockdown, while the remaining 6 either did not experience relevant reductions or increased. During the relaxation period and coinciding with the growing O3 season (June–July), most cities experienced decreases. However, the O3 WHOAQG was still exceeded during the lockdown and full relaxation periods in several cities. For secondary pollutants, such as O3 and PM2.5, further chemical and dispersion modeling along with source apportionment techniques to identify major precursor reduction targets are required to evaluate their abatement potential. © 2021 The Authors","Air quality; Air quality policy; Pollution abatement; Tropospheric ozone","Agriculture; Ammonia; Public policy; Urban growth; Air quality policy; Barcelona; PM$-2.5$; Pollution abatement; Private vehicles; Public transport; Quality change; Quality guidelines; Traffic flow; Tropospheric ozone; Air quality; ammonia; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; emission control; ozone; particulate matter; pollution policy; troposphere; air pollution; air quality; Article; biomass; burn; coronavirus disease 2019; human; lockdown; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; quarantine; rural area; Spain; traffic and transport; troposphere; urban area; air pollutant; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Spain; Spain; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102893564

China owns the largest CO2 emission in the world. For the sake of clarifying China’s emission sharing responsibilities and set emission reduction targets, a considerable number of scholars have worked to project China’s embodied CO2 emission. Single Regional Input–output (SRIO) model is widely used for investigating CO2 emission issues. Considering the ubiquitous time lag of input–output data, entropy optimization model is introduced to estimate SRIO tables. However, the uncertainty in the corresponding model parameters necessarily has a serious impact on the estimation results. To consider the impact of uncertainties, we introduce robust optimization into entropy minimization model for SRIO table estimation. Based on three different uncertainty sets, we constructed three robust entropy minimization models to construct 2016 China’s SRIO tables and calculate China’s embodied CO2 emission based on those tables. The estimation results show that the model based on the ball uncertainty set has the best performance with less uncertainty, while the model based on the budgeted uncertainty set performances more ‘robust’ facing greater uncertainty, which means its performance is less volatile at different levels of uncertainty. Moreover, the embodied carbon emission is predicted to reach 9632.57 Mt CO2. The top emitter is the sector of supply of electricity, heating and water, which accounts for more than 40% of total CO2 emission. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.","CO2 emission; Entropy minimization; Environment management; Robust optimization; Single regional Input–output model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096473993

The results show that all of the analyzed CMIP6 coupled models can reproduce the SEISAMW and its seasonal cycle, albeit with discrepancies of formation region and properties among the models. The SEISAMW subduction rate shows significant interannual variability, which is primarily induced by lateral induction in these models, in agreement with observations. Furthermore, the longterm trends of the SEISAMW show volume loss in accordance with the descending trend of the subduction rate, which are co-occurred with the ascending trend of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) indices in most of the analyzed CMIP6 models, similar to those in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 coupled models. Meanwhile, the potential density of the SEISAMWs show decreasing trends in these volume loss models, which could be explained by the warming (SAM0-UNICON, CESM2-WACCM, CAS-ESM2-0 and CIESM), the freshening (IPSL-CM6A-LR, CAMS-CSM1-0, MRI-ESM2-0, and FGOALS-f3-L) or the both (FIO-ESM-2-0, E3SM-1-0, and CanESM5) trends of the SEISAMWs in different CMIP6 coupled models.

Here, a one-pot solvothermal method to synthesize S,N-codoped and Si-coupled solid-state carbon nanodot composites (S,N-CNDs/silica) is reported. Leveraging regulating the content of a dopant and the volume ratio of H2O and EtOH solvents, which result in different surface structures of CNDs and CNDs/silica composites during the cross-linked coupling reaction, the PL emissions of the resulting composites shifted from blue to olivine to classify into blue, green, and olivine corresponding to the fluorescence quantum yields (FLQYs) of 10%, 51%, and 9%, respectively. Clearly, the green emitting CNDs/silica composite (G-CNDs/silica) has the highest value, which can be applied to detect latent fingerprints and fabricate LED devices. The result shows that rich details in latent fingerprints can be recognized by the imaging of G-CNDs/silica powder and the WLED device using G-CNDs/silica as a green phosphor to obtain a very high color rendering index (CRI) of 94.2 at a CIE of (0.34, 0.33). © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2021.",,"Composite structures; Crosslinking; Diamonds; Fluorescence; Green manufacturing; Nanodots; Olivine; Silica; Surface structure; Fingerprint Recognition; Fluorescence quantum yield; Fluorescent materials; High color rendering index; Multi-color emissions; Multicolor fluorescence; Optical performance; Solvothermal method; Palmprint recognition; carbon nanoparticle; silicon dioxide; Article; controlled study; finger dermatoglyphics; fluorescence; quantum yield; solid state; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109159960

The WCRZ is rich in biodiversity and may be influenced by the air pollutants transported from the SCB towards the QTP. As air pollution can cause adverse effects on ecosystem health, this study investigated the fluxes, ecological risks, and sources of sulfur and nitrogen deposition by using a source-oriented community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model for the entire WCRZ and its constituent national nature reserves in 2015. Results indicate that for sulfur (75%) and nitrogen (70%), the majority of the WCRZ area had annual total deposition fluxes higher than their critical loads. In addition, the annual volume-weighted mean (VWM) total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) wet deposition concentrations in almost the entire WCRZ exceeded the standard for total nitrogen of surface water in protected areas (0.2 mg N L−1). This exceedance is detrimental for the headwater watersheds that have precipitation as their sole water source. In each of the national nature reserves (NNRs), the average annual total deposition fluxes ranged between ~12–38 (sulfur) and ~ 15–38 kg S(N) ha−1 a−1 (nitrogen). About 40–100% (sulfur) and 5–85% (nitrogen) of the areas have annual total fluxes higher than the corresponding critical loads. Furthermore, the average VWM TIN concentration of wet deposition in each WCRZ NNR is higher than 0.2 mg N L−1. Therefore, sulfur and nitrogen deposition likely pose severe risks to some important natural ecosystems in the WCRZ. Based on the source apportionment results, to reduce sulfur and nitrogen deposition in the WCRZ, both SCB and non-SCB emissions should be controlled.

Therefore, three waste management scenarios are proposed and assessed in this study based on their potential to reduce waste and GHG emissions, and recover energy and recyclables in Oman from 2020 to 2040. The first scenario included recycling, anaerobic digestion (AD), and landfill disposal; while second scenario entailed recycling, incineration, and ash disposal. The third scenario involved incineration and AD plants, and landfilling of residues. The analysis indicated that the disposal of waste in scenario 2 will be the lowest during the entire study period (30–24%), followed by scenario 3 (32–41%) and scenario 1 (94–58%). Moreover, during the assessment period, scenario 3 will generate a total of 47 TWh electricity, higher than scenario 2 (29 TWh) and scenario 1 (4.7 TWh). Disposal of MSW is estimated to produce 309,803 GgCO2e from 2020 to 2040; however, these emissions can be reduced by 53, 94 and 90% by the implementation of scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Furthermore, the average global warming factors after energy and material recovery further indicate that scenario 2 and scenario 3 result in net GHG emission savings of − 0.4 and – 0.28 GgCO2e/Gg of MSW, except for scenario 1 which will produce 2.37 GgCO2e/Gg of MSW. The analysis showed that in terms of reducing waste disposal and GHG emissions, scenario 2 is the best performing option; however, scenario 3 has the highest energy output. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Anaerobic digestion; Global warming factor; Incineration; Landfill; Recycling","Anaerobic digestion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Recycling; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Electricity generation; Landfill disposal; Management scenarios; Management systems; Material recovery; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Resource recovery; Waste diversion; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105426846

The method of determining plant samples was carried out on cashew crops by monoculture, the age groups (KU) were differentiated 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, the measuring plots were determined purposively due to the limited population in the same age plot. Carbon stocks were analyzed using the allomeric method, while CO2 emissions were calculated descriptively. The results showed that cashew plants have the ability to increase carbon stocks and reduce CO2 gas emissions, this ability is kuadratic in line with plant KU. The highest carbon stock by KU 4 plants, the highest ability to reduce CO2 emissions is found in plants aged 30-40 years.

Climate scientists and policymakers have asked each discipline to anticipate and create mitigation and adaptation plans in preparation for a worsening future. Companion animals both impact and are impacted by the changing climate through their intrinsically linked relationships to human society. In this theoretical paper, we argue that companion animal scientists are well-suited to address climate change issues. We identify several anticipated climate change outcomes, such as an increase in extreme weather events, human migration, disasters, and an increase in human inequity, and connect these outcomes to identified or hypothesized impacts on companion animals and the human animal bond. We suggest opportunities to reduce climate change impacts on companion animals that include alterations to owner caretaking behaviors and breeding practices, and education of owners and governments on zoonosis and disaster preparedness. Furthermore, building climate resilience through decreasing inequity in companion animal fields is paramount; and we propose that a starting place can be in animal sheltering and other support services. We also summarize how companion animals and owners caretaking behaviors are impacting climate change through the use of finite natural resources as well as pollution and carbon emissions. We propose that replacement, reduction, and refinement, that guide laboratory animal research, can also be useful to mitigate the effects of companion animals on the environment. We suggest criteria for successful mitigation and adaptation plans to include equitability, sustainability, respect for animals, and measurability. Finally, we end on a call to all companion animal professionals to actively consider their role in mitigating the impact of companion animals on the climate and preparing for the fallout of climate change in their communities. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

The record spans almost the entire Holocene period and provides evidence that the wetland species Cladium mariscus (Cyperaceae) was present in this region as late as the Greenlandian period. In addition, the combination of C. mariscus and Carex elata beds were most likely an important part of the littoral zone vegetation during that period. Our investigations are based on plant macro-remain analysis, radiocarbon dating and physical sedimentary analysis of the former Danube side channel. The palaeo-channel infill active in the Late Pleistocene reflects complete hydroseral succession of a terrestrialised palaeo-lake. The earlier of two possible hiatuses in the fossil record was likely associated with a disturbance which caused Cladium mariscus to disappear from the local plant spectra. The most likely drivers of C. mariscus’ decline are a climate change of 8.6 cal ka BP associated with water fluctuations and the local habitat alteration to an eutrophic environment. These are discussed herein together with the isolated scattered populations surviving in the surrounding micro-region throughout the Meghalayan period. Finally, there are only two known remaining C. mariscus sites in the Žitný Ostrov Island area, and the key modern driving factor was the dramatic water regime changes in 19–20th Century caused by anthropogenic impact. These were caused by the construction of drainage canal systems and the transition from alluvial meadows to agricultural land. © 2021, Slovak Academy of Sciences.","Cladium mariscus; Ecological conditions; Holocene; Palaeochannel; Pannonian plain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101812134

We determined hydraulic roughness at three spatial scales: reach, patch, and pixel. For the reach scale, one roughness value was set for the channel, and one value for the entire floodplain. For the patch scale, vegetation heights were used to classify the floodplain into grass, scrub, and small and large trees, with a single roughness value for each. The roughness values for the reach and patch methods were calibrated using a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model (HEC-RAS) and data from in situ velocity sensors. For the pixel method, we applied empirical equations that directly estimated roughness from vegetation height for each pixel of the raster (no calibration necessary). Model simulations incorporating these roughness datasets in 2D HEC-RAS were validated against water surface elevations (WSE) from seventeen groundwa-ter wells for seven high-flow events during the Fall of 2018 and 2019, and compared to marked flood extents. The reach method tended to overestimate while the pixel method tended to underestimate the flood extent. There were no visual differences between DLS and SfM within the pixel and patch methods when comparing flood extents. All model simulations were not significantly different with respect to the well WSEs (p > 0.05). The pixel methods had the lowest WSE RMSEs (SfM: 0.136 m, DLS: 0.124 m). The other methods had RMSE values 0.01–0.02 m larger than the DLS pixel method. Models with DLS data also had lower WSE RMSEs by 0.01 m when compared to models utilizing SfM. This difference might not justify the increased cost of a DLS setup over SfM (~150,000 vs. ~2000 USD for this study), though our use of the DLS DEM to determine SfM vegetation heights might explain this minimal difference. We expect a poorer performance of the SfM-derived vegetation heights/roughness values if we were using a SfM DEM, although further work is needed. These results will help improve hydrodynamic modeling efforts, which are becoming increasingly im-portant for management and planning in response to climate change, specifically in regions were high flow events are increasing. © 2021 by the authors.

In water manipulation experiments, fine root lifespan can vary with soil water content. Soil water content is generally structured by complex topography, which is largely unaccounted for in landscape- and ecosystem-scale carbon models. Topography governs the range of soil water content experienced by roots which may impact their lifespan. We hypothesized that root lifespan varied nonlinearly across a temperate, mesic, forested catchment due to differences in soil water content associated with topographic position. We expected regions of the landscape that were too wet or too dry would have soils that were not optimal for roots and thus result in shorter root lifespans. Specifically, we hypothesized that root lifespan would be longest in areas that consistently had soil water content in the middle of the soil water content spectrum, while in soils at either very low or very high soil water content, root lifespan would be relatively short. We tested this hypothesis by collecting and analyzing two years of minirhizotron and soil moisture data in plots widely distributed in the Shale Hills catchment of the Susquehanna-Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory in Pennsylvania. We found that fine root lifespans were longer in traditionally wetter topographic regions, but detected no short term (biweekly) effect of soil moisture on root lifespan. Additionally, depth in soil, soil series, slope face orientation, and season of birth strongly affected root lifespans across the catchment. In contrast, lifespan was unaffected by root diameter or mycorrhizal association. Failure to account for these variables could result in erroneous estimates of fine root lifespan and, consequentially, carbon flux in temperate forested regions. © 2021 Primka IV et al.

A crucial issue to enforce common environmental guidelines is environmental convergence. States converging in environmental variables are expected to be able to jointly develop and implement environmental policies. Convergence in environmental indicators may also help determine the efficiency and speed of those policies. This paper employs a multilevel club convergence approach to analyze convergence in the evolution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among the European Union (EU)-28 members, on a search for countries transitioning from disequilibrium to specific steady-state positions. Overall convergence is rejected, with club composition depending on the specific period (1990–2017, 2005–2017) and emissions categories (global, Emission Trading System (ETS), Effort Sharing Decision (ESD)) analyzed. Some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and Denmark) are consistently located in clubs outperforming the EU's average in terms of emissions reductions, for both the whole and the most recent periods, and for both ETS and ESD emissions. At the other end, Germany (with a large industrial and export basis), Ireland (with the strongest gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the EU in recent years) and most Eastern EU members have underperformed after 2005, almost reversing their previous positions when the study begins in year 1990. Member States show large mitigation potentials in both ETS emissions (e.g., in the aviation sector) and the multiplicity of sectors (especially road transport) covered by the ESD. The presence of multiple convergence clubs, reinforced by persistence of the results across the various periods and sectors analyzed, may also indicate the convenience of more differentiated, specific policies and regulations with a view to reducing heterogeneity among member states. Innovation in production and business systems, the promotion of green energy, collaboration and efficient technology transfer between countries, a transparent regulatory framework, and the promotion of green attitudes are key measures for reducing GHG emissions, especially in those countries with the worst performance. © 2021","Clubs of convergence; Effort sharing decision; Emission trading system; European Union; GHG emissions","Climate change; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Electrostatic devices; Emission control; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; International law; Technology transfer; Convergence approach; Emission trading systems; Environmental guidelines; Environmental indicators; Environmental policy; Environmental variables; Gross domestic product growths; Regulatory frameworks; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101572064

The assessment has been conducted for megacities of India (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata) for four months, that is, March and April in 2019 and 2020 using Sentinel 5P and MCD19A2 data. A decrease in concentrations of air pollutants, specifically NO2 and SO2, has been observed during the lockdown period in all the cities; whereas CO and AOD have exhibited discrete pattern of spatio-temporal variation. Four megacities except Kolkata have revealed a positive correlation between NO2 concentration and population density. The results conclude overall improvement in air quality during COVID-19 led lockdown. The current situation provides a unique opportunity to implement a structural economic change that could help us move towards a city with low emission economy. Realizing the achievable improvement of air quality, the study suggests further in-depth research on source attribution of individual pollutants to assess the prospect of emission reduction actions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollutants; Air quality monitoring; COVID-19; MODIS; Sentinel 5P; Urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109500239

Likewise, it has been shown that clean energy reduces air pollution, so this would be a way out of environmental pollution.

Thus, this study explores the long-term nexus between CO2 emissions and renewable energy, energy efficiency, fossil fuels, GDP, property rights from 1995 to 2019 in nine developed countries. The results reveal a long-term equilibrium relationship in developed European countries, but not in developed non-European countries. The main results show that renewable energy and energy efficiency are negatively correlated with CO2 emissions. In developed European countries, a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption represents a 0.03% decrease in CO2 emissions.

The urban population risks more likely to suffer to pollution related to high concentrations of air pollutants, such as in particulate matter smaller than 10gμm (PM10). Since the composition of these particulates varies with space and time, the understanding of the origin is essential to determine the most efficient control strategies. A source contribution calculation allows us to provide such information and thus to determine the geographical location of the sources (e.g. city or country) responsible for the air pollution episodes. In this study, the calculations provided by the regional European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme/Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West (EMEP/MSC-W) rv4.15 model in a forecast mode, with a 0.25° longitude × 0.125° latitude resolution, and based on a scenario approach, have been explored. To do so, the work has focused on event occurring between 1 and 9 December 2016. This source contribution calculation aims at quantifying over 34 European cities, the ""city""contribution of these PM10, i.e. from the city itself, on an hourly basis. Since the methodology used in the model is based on reduced anthropogenic emissions, compared to a reference run, the choice of the percentage in the reductions has been tested by using three different values (5g%, 15g%, and 50g%). The definition of the ""city""contribution, and thus the definition of the area defining the cities is also an important parameter. The impact of the definition of these urban areas, for the studied cities, was investigated (i.e. one model grid cell, nine grid cells and the grid cells covering the definition given by the global administrative area-GADM). Using a 15g% reduction in the emission and larger cities for our source contribution calculation (e.g. nine grid cells and GADM) helps to reduce the non-linearity in the concentration changes. This non-linearity is observed in the mismatch between the total concentration and the sum of the concentrations from different calculated sources. When this non-linearity is observed, it impacts the NO3-, NH4+, and H2O concentrations. However, the mean non-linearity represents only less than 2g% of the total modelled PM10 calculated by the system. During the studied episode, it was found that 20g% of the surface predicted PM10 had been from the ""city"", essentially composed of primary components. In total, 60g% of the hourly PM10 concentrations predicted by the model came from the countries in the regional domain, and they were essentially composed of NO3-(by 35 g%). The two other secondary inorganic aerosols are also important components of this ""rest of Europe""contribution, since SO42- and NH4+ represent together almost 30g% of this contribution. The rest of the PM10 was mainly due to natural sources. It was also shown that the central European cities were mainly impacted by the surrounding countries while the cities located a bit away from the rest of the other European countries (e.g. Oslo and Lisbon) had larger ""city""contributions. The usefulness of the forecasting tool has also been illustrated with an example in Paris, since the system has been able to predict the primary sources of a local polluted event on 1-2 December 2016, as documented by local authorities. © 2021 Matthieu Pommier.",,"particulate matter; pollutant source; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; urban pollution; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109099406

The availability of spatially interpolated climate data has the potential to make viticultural climate analyses possible at specific sites without the expense and uncertainty of collecting climate data within vineyards. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy and precision of climatic indices calculated using an on-site climate sensor and an interpolated climate dataset to assess whether the effect of spatial variability in climate at this fine spatial scale significantly affects phonological modelling outcomes. Methods and Results: Four sites comprising two topographically homogenous vineyards and two topographically diverse vineyards in three wine regions in Victoria (Australia) were studied across four growing seasons. A freely available database of interpolated Australian climate data based on government climate station records (Scientific Information for Land Owners, SILO) provided temperature data for grid cells containing the sites (resolution 0.05° latitude by 0.05° longitude, approximately 5 km × 5 km). In-vineyard data loggers collected temperature data for the same time period. The results indicated that the only significant difference between the two climate data sources was the minimum temperatures in the topographically varied vineyards where night-time thermal layering is likely to occur. Conclusion: The interpolated climate data closely matched the in-vineyard recorded maximum temperatures in all cases and minimum temperatures for the topographically homogeneous vineyards. However, minimum temperatures were not as accurately predicted by the interpolated data for the topographically complex sites. Therefore, this specific interpolated dataset was a reasonable substitute for in-vineyard collected data only for vineyard sites that are unlikely to experience night-time thermal layering. Significance of the Study: Access to accurate climate data from a free interpolation service, such as SILO provides a valuable tool tomanage blocks or sections within vineyards more precisely for vineyards that do not have a weather station on site. Care, nevertheless, is required to account for minimum temperature discrepancies in topographically varied vineyards, due to the potential for cool air pooling at night, that may not be reflected in interpolated climate data. © Copyright © 2021 Pipan, Hall, Rogiers and Holzapfel.","climate change; climate data; climatic indices; phenology; viticulture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111414096

The survey shows that Europe has been active in the implementation and development of large-scale gasification systems, with various trends occurring that reflect the need of new knowledge and cost-competitive technologies. Large-scale gasification processes are becoming increasingly considered for biofuels and biochemicals synthesis and the economy of generating renewable bioproducts from biomass is becoming more attractive than power. However, large-scale gasification plants still entail significant issues (e.g., biomass collection and processing, producer gas cleaning costs) that decrease the projects economic viability and may cause the interruption of operation of existing plants. This study shows that the commercial breakthrough of large-scale biomass gasification must be supported by: high integration of low-cost wastes as co-feedstocks, development of cost-efficient gas upgrading processes, usage of recognized operational strategies from demonstration/industrial plants (e.g., adjusting the availability and accessibility of catalytically active ash components), improvement of governmental policies (e.g., carbon tax increase) and integration of the process in comprehensive biorefinery designs. These aspects are mandatory for biomass gasification technologies to be able to represent an important role in the combat against climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biomass; Europe; Gasification; Industrial","Climate change; Costs; Gas plants; Gasification; Surveys; 'current; Bio-energy; Biomass Gasification; Cost competitive; Current status; Europe; Future perspectives; Future trends; Gasification process; Large-scales; Biomass",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105001108

However, the primary responsible sources are not well evidenced in this region. The dispersion of black carbon emissions from the Southern Hemisphere was conducting using atmospheric chemical transport model and we compared the results with satellite registries from March 1st to April 30th in 2014. The emission inventory considered the anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions from global datasets. The largest and most populated cities in Southern Hemisphere showed the higher emission of BC. As a result, the average daily concentrations of atmospheric BC were around 4 ng/m3 in most regions of Antarctica according to its pristine characteristics. We analyzed fifteen relevant sites in coastal zones of Antartica and some peaks registered by the satellite records were not replicated by model outputs and it was mainly associated with the lack of emissions. Finally, we made simulations in the same period without biomass burning emissions and we observed decreased concentrations of BC in the range of 20–50%. As a result, we show that the black carbon transportation from the continental land to the polar region took place in 17–24 days during the Austral summer and the biomass burning emissions were the primary source. Black Carbon deposition in Antarctica is not permanent, but the uncontrolled emissions from Southern Hemisphere can increase its transportation to the white continent and make its accumulation during the period when the weak polar vortex occurs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Antarctica; Anthropogenic sources; Biomass burning; Black carbon; CMAQ; Hemispheric simulation","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Carbon; Coastal zones; Global warming; Reservoirs (water); Antarctica; Anthropocene; Anthropogenic sources; Biomass burning emissions; Biomass-burning; Black carbon; Climate change policies; CMAQ; Hemispheric simulation; Southern Hemisphere; Biomass; black carbon; Anthropocene; biomass burning; black carbon; climate change; concentration (composition); dispersion; environmental policy; source apportionment; Southern Hemisphere; air pollution; Antarctica; Article; atmosphere; biomass; climate change; concentration (parameter); dispersion; environmental impact; meteorological phenomena; priority journal; Southern Hemisphere; Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102475188

Scientific literature and empirical evidence point at multi-level climate governance as a crucial factor to engage subnational levels in the achievement of national and international objectives. This work focuses on the multi-level climate governance arrangements in Italy to investigate how Italian regions/provinces/cities are contributing to the achievement of national commitments. To this purpose, the paper undertakes a review of the climate policies of different tiers of government adopted to date and of the interrelationships among them. The results of the analysis show that the effective coordination between the different government levels should be strengthened to further incentivize and support initiatives at the local level. Results also show the relevant role played by international regional and city climate networks in boosting local and regional climate planning in Italy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Climate change; EURO-LCP Initiative; Local climate plans; Multi-level governance; Regions","climate change; empirical analysis; environmental policy; governance approach; international agreement; literature review; achievement; article; city; climate change; government; Italy; city; government; United Nations; Italy; Cities; Climate Change; Government; Italy; United Nations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103656331

The increase in food waste has serious negative impacts on environmental sustainability, water and land resources, and food security, as well as climate and greenhouse gas emissions. Through a specific case study in Da Nang City, Vietnam, this paper examines the extent of food waste generation at the consumption stages, the eating habits of consumers, food waste from households and service establishments, as well as prospects for the reuse of food waste as pig feed. The results of this study indicate that per capita food waste generation in Da Nang has increased from 0.39 to 0.41kg in 2016, 0.46 in 2017, and reached 0.52kg in 2018. According to the results of our consumer survey, 20% of respondents stated that they often generate food waste, 67% stated they sometimes do, and 13% stated they rarely do. Furthermore, 66% of surveyed households stated that their food waste is collected and transported by pig farmers to be used as feed for pigs. The use of food waste as feed for pigs is a typical feature in Da Nang. The study also found that there is a high level of consumer awareness and willingness to participate in the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) program, which was being initiated by the city government. In service facilities such as resorts and hotels, daily food waste reached 100–200 kg in large facilities and 20–120 kg in small facilities. This waste was also collected for use in pig farming. However, there has been a fall in demand for pig feed in line with a decrease in the number of pig farms due to the African swine fever epidemic that occurred during the implementation of this study. This paper suggests that there is a strong need to take both consumer-oriented waste prevention and waste management measures, such as waste segregation at source and introduction of effective food waste recycling techniques, to ensure that food waste can be safely and sustainably used as a “valuable resource” rather than “wasted.”. © 2021 by the authors.

Main technical challenge and a key factor in techno-economic analysis of the energy system of the future, based on variable renewable energy sources, is their variable production and its integration. In order to deal with this problem in long-term energy planning, different approaches have been tried, focusing on overcapacity, storage capacities and sectors coupling with heating and transport. In this research, different flexibility options, storage and demand response technologies are modelled on a national energy systems level. With the case study area modelled in EnergyPLAN model, the goal of the research is to show how each flexibility option influences the economically feasible generation capacities of renewable energy sources, storage technologies and demand response in order to reach a certain share of renewable energy in final energy consumed. To follow the numerous possible configurations of the system, flexibility index for each option and a flexibility vector for each scenario are introduced.

We examined how place attachment may influence different types of climate-induced displacement at both the park and park system level. Previous research suggests that visitors who have greater place attachment to parks within a system may be more likely to tolerate changed environmental conditions before they are displaced from the system entirely or change their choice of park or time of visit within it. Our study, based on the Vermont State Parks system (U.S.), used an on-site visitor questionnaire to examine potential system, spatial, and temporal displacements resulting from ranges of five regionally specific probable manifestations of climate change. As hypothesized, we found that those with lower place attachment were more likely to be displaced. Specifically, these visitors would be more likely to shift their visitation to more southern and lower elevation parks to avoid increased rainfall, earlier/later in the season to avoid higher day or night time temperatures, and out of the park system entirely with more days above 90 F or biting insects. Our approach to examining climate change, place attachment, and displacement has relevance for considering how these three areas impact tourism and visitor use management, as well as utility for managers of these destinations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Displacement; Nature-based tourism; Place attachment; State parks; Vermont; Visitor use management","Ecology; Environmental conditions; Night time; Park system; Potential shift; Potential systems; Temporal displacement; Vermont; Climate change; rain; climate change; displacement; environmental change; environmental conditions; greenspace; insect; rainfall; research work; temperature; Article; climate change; manager; questionnaire; season; temperature; time; tourism; Vermont; recreation; recreational park; United States; Vermont; Hexapoda; Climate Change; Parks, Recreational; Recreation; Seasons; Surveys and Questionnaires; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105926800

Yet adoption rates in many places are low. We investigated the factors affecting the probability of Brazilian farmers adopting an IS. Using data from 3150 farmers across all 26 Brazilian states, we tested the importance of four groups of variables in affecting adoption: farmer characteristics (age and education); farm characteristics (size and feedlot infrastructure); information networks (social networks and extension); and market incentives (export share and environmental risk). A logistic regression model found all eight variables to be statistically significant predictors of IS adoption. The two information network variables had the greatest impacts on IS adoption. This result demonstrates a central role for public agencies like EMBRAPA in developing and communicating new agricultural practices, as well as the role of producer cooperatives and associations in making information about IS technologies available to farmers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cattle; Greenhouse gas emissions; Information networks; Low carbon agriculture","agricultural practice; agricultural worker; cattle; communication; farmers knowledge; greenhouse gas; information technology; technology adoption; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104304363

Higher PSII heat tolerance could lead to (a) increases in the high-temperature compensation point (Tmax); (b) increases in the thermal breadth of photosynthesis (i.e. the photosynthetic parameter Ω) to promote a thermal generalist strategy of carbon assimilation; (c) increases in the optimum rate of carbon assimilation Popt and faster carbon assimilation and/or (d) increases in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis (Topt). To address these hypotheses, we tested if the Tcrit, T50 and T95 PSII heat tolerances were correlated with carbon assimilation parameters for 21 plant species. Our results did not support Hypothesis 1, but we observed that T50 may be used to estimate the upper thermal limit for Tmax at the species level, and that community mean Tcrit may be useful for approximating Tmax. The T50 and T95 heat tolerance metrics were positively correlated with Ω in support of Hypothesis 2. We found no support for Hypotheses 3 or 4.

As the largest CO2 source among all industrial sectors, the electricity sector plays an important role in China's recent stagnating CO2 emissions and achieving mitigation targets. Here we estimate CO2 emissions from electricity production by using up-to-date emission factors and calculate the CO2 emissions embodied in purchased electricity using the Quasi-Input-Output (QIO) model. In addition, we quantify the drivers of CO2 emissions from electricity production and consumption using the index and structural decomposition analysis. Our results show that China's economic transition and increasing electricity intensity largely contributed to the growth of CO2 emissions in the electricity sector, while the improvement of energy efficiency, non-fossil fuel substitution, and shrinking share of industrial output reduced CO2 emissions. The consumption-based CO2 emissions in developed regions in China are higher than their production-based CO2 emissions in 12 provinces. The recent slowing down of economic growth, energy transition, improved efficiency, non-fossil fuel substitution, and electricity trade have altered the CO2 trajectory in the electricity sector since 2008 global financial crisis. This study could help policymakers better understand CO2 emissions in the electricity sector and formulate effective policies to decarbonize the electricity sector in the future. © 2021","Decomposition; Electricity sector; Embodied CO2 emissions; Peak and decline; Quasi-Input-Output","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economic analysis; Electric industry; Energy efficiency; Industrial economics; Industrial emissions; Climate change mitigation; Economic transitions; Electricity intensities; Electricity production; Electricity sector; Energy transitions; Global financial crisis; Structural decomposition analysis; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101605183

It is well known that the Himalayas region is affected by climate change, as reflected in the basic knowledge of farmers in the region. A questionnaire-based survey involving a total of 747 households was conducted to gather information on climate change and its impact, where the survey addressed four physiographic regions of the trans-boundary Koshi River Basin (KRB). Moreover, climatic data were used to calculate climatic trends between 1980 and 2018. The Mann–Kendall trend test was performed and the Sen’s slope calculated to analyze the inter-annual climatic trends over time. The survey noted that, for the basin, there was an increase in temperature, climate-induced diseases of crops, an increase in the frequency of pests as well as drought and floods and a decrease in rainfall, all which are strong indicators of climate change. It was perceived that these indicators had adverse impacts on crop production (89.4%), human health (82.5%), livestock (68.7%) and vegetation (52.1%). The observed climatic trends for all the physiographic regions included an increasing temperature trend and a decreasing rainfall trend. The rate of change varied according to each region, hence strongly supporting the farmers’ local knowledge of climate change. The highest increasing trend of temperature noted in the hill region at 0.0975◦ C/a (p = 0.0002) and sharpest decreasing trend of rainfall in the mountain region by −10.424 mm/a (p = 0.016) between 1980 and 2018. Formulation of suitable adaptation strategies according to physiographic region can minimize the impact of climate change. New adaptation strategies proposed include the introduction of infrastructure for irrigation systems, the development of crop seeds that are more tolerant to drought, pests and disease tolerance, and the construction of local hospitals for the benefit of farming communities. © 2021 by the authors.

Accurate and constant air quality forecasting on a local scale facilitates the control of air pollution and the design of effective strategies to limit air pollutant emissions. CAMS provides 4-day-ahead regional (EU) forecasts in a 10 km spatial resolution, adding value to the Copernicus EO and delivering open-access consistent air quality forecasts. In this work, we evaluate the CAMS PM forecasts at a local scale against in-situ measurements, spanning 2 years, obtained from a network of stations located in an urban coastal Mediterranean city in Greece. Moreover, we investigate the potential of modelling techniques to accurately forecast the spatiotemporal pattern of particulate pollution using only open data from CAMS and calibrated low-cost sensors. Specifically, we compare the performance of the Analog Ensemble (AnEn) technique and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in forecasting PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations for the next four days, at 6 h increments, at a station level. The results show an underestimation of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by a factor of 2 in CAMS forecasts during winter, indicating a misrepresentation of anthropogenic particulate emissions such as wood-burning, while overestimation is evident for the other seasons. Both AnEn and LSTM models provide bias-calibrated forecasts and capture adequately the spatial and temporal variations of the ground-level observations reducing the RMSE of CAMS by roughly 50% for PM2.5 and 60% for PM10 . AnEn marginally outperforms the LSTM using annual verification statistics. The most profound difference in the predictive skill of the models occurs in winter, when PM is elevated, where AnEn is significantly more efficient. Moreover, the predictive skill of AnEn degrades more slowly as the forecast interval increases. Both AnEn and LSTM techniques are proven to be reliable tools for air pollution forecasting, and they could be used in other regions with small modifications. © 2021 by the authors.

The emissions trading system is assumed to accomplish China's emissions reduction targets set under the Paris Climate Agreement. A multi-regional, multi-sectoral, recursive-dynamic computable general equilibrium model is developed for the analysis. The results show that the emissions trading scheme would reduce provincial CO2 emissions by 4%–22% relative to the baseline levels in 2030. It would cause the provincial GDP to change from −4.6% to 1.8% relative to the 2030 baseline levels. The magnitudes of the impacts on provincial economies and CO2 emissions are sensitive to initial emissions allocation rules. Some provinces that face GDP loss under one rule of emissions allocation would experience GDP gains under the other rules, and vice versa. However, emissions-intensive provincial economies—Neimenggu, Ningxia, Shanxi, and Shaanxi—are found to experience higher GDP loss irrespective of the allowance allocation rules. Meanwhile, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Liaoning are found to experience higher GDP under all the rules of allowances allocation. © 2021","Auction; Carbon pricing; Climate change mitigation; Dynamic multi-regional CGE model; Economic impact of carbon pricing; Emissions quota allocation; Emissions trading system","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Allocation rule; Baseline levels; Carbon pricing; Climate change mitigation; CO$-2$/ emission; Dynamic multi-regional CGE model; Economic impact of carbon pricing; Emission quota allocation; Emission trading systems; Emissions Trading Scheme; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104350134

We describe here a previously unexplored approach using active liquids able to sustain levitation in the absence of any external forcing at ambient temperature. We focus on the particular case of carbonated water placed on a superhydrophobic solid and demonstrate how millimetric fizzy drops self-generate a gas cushion that provides levitation on time scales on the order of a minute. Last, we generalize this new regime to different kinds of chemically reactive droplets able to jump from the Cassie-Baxter state to a levitating regime, paving the way to the levitation of nonvolatile liquids.

However, there is yet a lack of uptake of ZCB in high-rise high-density contexts, and mystery exists about its feasibility and societal acceptance. This paper aims to demystify ZCB development in high-rise high-density cities by identifying and examining the drivers, barriers and strategies within Hong Kong as a typical case. Based on the systems theory that addresses ZCBs as complex systems, the research was conducted through a questionnaire survey with 219 effective responses from and six follow-up focus group meetings with industry stakeholders. Key drivers and barriers were systematically identified, covering economic, legislative, cultural, supply chain, geographical, and skill and knowledge aspects. Specifically, economic drivers and barriers were found most significant. A novel multi-level framework of strategies was further derived, integrating micro-level measures, meso-level initiatives and macro-level visions for achieving ZCBs in high-rise high-density cities. The framework contributes a new perspective to examine ZCB drivers and barriers, and lays the foundation for a strategic decision-making tool to support ZCB developments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission; High-rise high-density city; Sustainable built environment; Systems approach; Systems theory; Zero carbon building","Behavioral research; Climate change; Decision making; Environmental management; Renewable energy resources; Supply chains; Surveys; System theory; Building development; Carbon emissions; High rise; High-density cities; High-rise high-density city; Low carbon economy; Sustainable build environment; Systems approach; Zero carbon building; Zero carbons; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104340882

In this backdrop, we analyzed the experiences, lessons, and insights from three key global carbon markets, namely North America, the EU and China, in terms of the barriers to linking the global carbon market, with a focus on China, using thematic analysis. The four most commonly cited linkage design elements (barriers) were the legal basis; monitoring, reporting, and verification; political feasibility; and the price-management mechanism. Like-minded jurisdictions with similar political views and design features will have a higher chance of linking. Additionally, sustaining market liquidity, widening sectoral coverage, minimizing carbon leakage, ensuring offset quality, and a transparent allowance and cap setting rules are crucial steps towards linkage. These outcomes can be used as an ETS linkage-ready design framework for CETS and ETS under development to overcome barriers to future international ETS linkages. © 2021 by the authors.

Transport emissions are a major source of carbon emissions, and cities grapple with reducing carbon emissions, and improving the air quality for their citizens. London's new transport strategy document, called Mayor's Transport Strategy 2018, aims to achieve a zero-carbon city by 2050 and set out many actions to facilitate this transition. However, London needs a prioritisation framework which would take into account the financial, environmental and social impacts of these actions. Considering the uncertainties around these actions, which has been now significantly more crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study proposes a novel extension of Best-Worst Method (BWM) and extension of the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Iterative Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)) method using D numbers. This TODIM-D based fuzzy MCDM approach provides a prioritisation framework for the actions associated with zero-carbon city policies set out in London's strategy document. According to the results of the proposed method, “introducing zero-emission zones” should be selected as the first initiative to implement.

This study combined mineralogical analysis with conventional statistical and geospatial methods to separate anthropogenically impacted soils from unimpacted soils in the Yellowknife area, Northwest Territories, Canada, a region that was exposed to 60 years of arsenic (As)-rich atmospheric mining emissions (1938–1999) and that hosts natural enrichments of As. High concentrations of As (up to 4700 mg kg−1) were measured in publicly accessible soils near decommissioned roaster stacks in the region and strong relationships between As and distance from the main emission sources persisted in surface soils and soils at depth in the soil profile more than 60 years after the bulk of mining emissions were released. Mineralogical analysis provided unambiguous evidence regarding the source of As minerals and highlighted that most As in surface soils within 15 km of Yellowknife is hosted as anthropogenic arsenic trioxide (As2O3), produced by roaster stack emissions. Statistical protocols for the estimation of geochemical background were applied to an existing database of till geochemistry (N = 1490) after removing samples from mining impacted areas. Results suggested geochemical background for the region is 0.25–15 mg kg−1 As, comparable to global averages, with upper thresholds elevated in volcanic units (30 mg kg−1 As) that often host sulfide mineralization in greenstone belts in the region. © 2021 The Authors","Giant Mine; Mining impacts; Soil recovery; Subarctic","Air pollution; Atmospheric movements; Calcination; Geochemistry; Mineralogy; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Atmospheric emission; Geochemical background; Mineralogical analysis; Mining pollutions; Pollutant dispersions; Publicly accessible; Statistical protocol; Sulfide mineralization; Soil pollution; arsenic trioxide; sulfide; arsenic; mine; mineralogy; mining; soil chemistry; soil pollution; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; Article; Canada; chemical parameters; concentration (parameter); dispersion; environmental enrichment; environmental impact; geochemistry; human activities; mineralization; mineralogy; mining; soil analysis; soil depth; soil pollution; soil property; statistical analysis; surface soil; Canada; Northwest Territories; Yellowknife",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101660944

The waste sector contributes significantly to this verified increase in emissions, not only because of the quantity of waste generated, but also because of waste treatment, a highly polluting process. To deal with these issues, several directives are being implemented at a European level. In order to confirm if these policies to reduce GHG emissions associated with waste disposal are efficient, this paper aims to assess the environmental efficiencies that result from waste generation. The data used in this study encompass a set of 15 European countries for the period between 2001 and 2015. Eco-efficiency is measured by using the ratio of GDP per capita and GHG emissions per capita derived from the waste sector, and is assessed by the application of the data envelopment analysis approach. Additionally, we also evaluate the state of decoupling between the waste sector emissions (GHG emissions) and economic growth. This analysis intends to understand which economic drivers produce decoupling effects, and to assess to what extent additional factors are influencing this core relationship. Globally, the results show that Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden present better economic and environmental performance when compared to the other countries. Luxembourg is beyond doubt the most efficient country, presenting the highest scores in most of the years between 2001 and 2015. On the other hand, countries like France, Portugal and Austria report the worst performance, presenting eco-efficiency scores below 20%, for the whole period under analysis. In addition, the results of the decoupling elasticity analysis suggest that the optimal decoupling state occurs when there is a drastic and significant reduction in the mean variations of the GHG emissions in the waste sector and a low variation in the average economic growth rate. Our results reinforce the existence of a discrepancy in waste management within the different member states. The countries, which include in their waste management a wider variety of waste treatments, are more efficient than the ones that are still using landfilling as the principal form of waste disposal. Recycling rates play a crucial role for the countries to move up in the “Waste hierarchy”, as well as the implementation of the EU directives relating to waste management. Taking all this in consideration, policy makers must reinforce these directives not only at a national, but also at regional level. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","DEA; Decoupling indicator; Eco-efficiency; GHG emissions; Waste management","data envelopment analysis; economic growth; emission control; greenhouse gas; human activity; landfill; policy implementation; recycling; waste disposal; waste management; waste treatment; Austria; Belgium; France; Luxembourg; Netherlands; Portugal; Sweden; United Kingdom; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083373017

Moreover, MGs are, above all, designed to considerably improve the autonomy, sustainability, and reliability of future electrical distribution grid. At the same time, aspects of MGs energy management, taking into consideration distribution generation systems, energy storage devices, electric vehicles, and consumption components have been widely investigated. Besides, grid architectures including DC, AC, or hybrid power generation systems, energy dispatching problems modelling, operating modes (islanded or grid connected), MGs sizing, simulations and problems solving optimization approaches, and other aspects, have been raised as topics of great interest for both electrical and computer sciences research communities. Furthermore, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and government policies and incentives have paved the way to massive electric vehicle (EV) deployment. Hence, several research studies have been conducted to investigate the integration of EVs in national power grid and future MGs. Specifically, EV charging stations’ bi-directional power flow control and energy management have been considerably explored. These issues index challenging research topics, which are in most cases still under progress. This paper gives an overview of MGs technology advancement in recent decades, taking into consideration distributed energy generation (DER), energy storage systems (ESS), EVs, and loads. It reviews the main MGs architecture, operating modes, sizing and energy management systems (EMS) and EVs integration. © 2021 by the authors.

However, few studies have examined how mitigation and adaptation efforts relate to each other in a large number of differently sized cities, and therefore we know little about whether forerunners in mitigation are also leading in adaptation or if cities tend to focus on just one policy field. This article develops an internationally applicable approach to rank cities on climate policy that incorporates multiple indicators related to (1) local commitments on mitigation and adaptation, (2) urban mitigation and adaptation plans and (3) climate adaptation and mitigation ambitions. We apply this method to rank 104 differently sized German cities and identify six clusters: climate policy leaders, climate adaptation leaders, climate mitigation leaders, climate policy followers, climate policy latecomers and climate policy laggards. The article seeks explanations for particular cities’ positions and shows that coping with climate change in a balanced way on a high level depends on structural factors, in particular city size, the pathways of local climate policies since the 1990s and funding programmes for both climate mitigation and adaptation. © 2021, The Author(s).","City ranking; Climate adaptation; Climate mitigation; Climate policy integration; Germany; Urban planning","Economic and social effects; City sizes; Climate mitigations; Climate policy; Local climate; Multiple indicators; Structural factor; Trade off; Urban areas; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; mitigation; urban area; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110449531

The role of wood products in climate change mitigation has been studied from several perspectives, but not yet from a consumer's view. In this study, we examine the impact of wooden housing on consumer carbon footprints in Finland. We use the 2016 Finnish Household Budget Survey and Exiobase 2015, a global multi-regional input-output model. The sample size is 3700 households, of which 45% live in a wooden house. We find that residents of wooden houses have a 12(±3)% (950 kg CO2-eq/year) lower carbon footprint on average than residents of non-wooden houses, when income, household type, education of the main income provider, age of the house, owner-occupancy and urban zone are controlled in regression analysis. This is not fully explained by the impact of the construction material, which suggests that the residents of wooden houses may have some features in their lifestyles that lower their carbon footprints further. In addition, we find that an investment in a new wooden house in an urban area has a strong reducing impact on a consumer's carbon footprint, while investments in other types of housing have a weaker or no reducing impact. Our findings support wooden housing as a meaningful sustainable consumption choice. © 2021 The Author(s).

We introduce a Renewable Contribution parameter that defines the share of the company profit petroleum that should be re-invested in renewable energy in the host country and we develop an optimization model that defines the state objective function and constraints. We apply the modified PSC to the case of Lebanon after populating various oil and gas and renewable energy scenarios.

The geographical position is connected to the coast of the Flores Sea and the Indian Ocean. Fishing is the main livelihood for approximately 13% of the district population. There are 60 reef fish species found in the area, and small scale fishers were mostly operated to support their livelihood. This study aims to determine the vulnerability of five high-value reef fish species to environmental exposure, i.e., Plectropomus leopardus (Lacepede, 1802); Variola louti (Forsskal, 1775); Epinephelus fuscogutattus (Forsskal, 1775); Lutjanus malabaricus (Bloch & Schneider, 1801); and Lutjanus gibbus (Forsskal, 1775). The observation was carried out during 2019. The analysis was performed by the method for assessing the vulnerability of marine fish and shellfish species to a changing climate. The approach consisted of sensitivity attribute and exposure factor based on reasonable time series data availability. The results indicated that the vulnerability indices of P. leopardus, V. louti, and E. fuscoguttatus to aquatic environment variabilities were high. This means that the three populations are strongly influenced by environmental conditions on the coral reef ecosystem. The vulnerability indices of L. malabaricus and L. gibbus to the aquatic environment variables were moderate or sufficiently affected by environmental conditions to the coral reef ecosystem. One should be considered that these findings with the data-quality scoring at a category 2 and 3 or limited data to adequate data. These indices showed that necessary to manage and protect the marine and coastal ecosystems of Komodo National Park and its surroundings from anthropogenic pressures and adapt to environmental exposure factors. This should be supported by the identification of grouper and snapper spawning aggregation areas in the National Park. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biodiversity; Conservation; Fish; Reefs; Anthropogenic pressures; Aquatic environments; Coral reef ecosystems; Environmental conditions; Environmental exposure; Geographical positions; Spawning aggregations; Vulnerability index; Aquatic ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110472873

The review study highlights the interlinkages that exists between the resources within the nexus and discusses a nexus-based approach to solving the individual resource needs of arid regions. An EWF nexus-based assessment of the state of Qatar (as a case study) is conducted, and several response options that utilise nanomaterials and sustainable energy technologies to improve the overall performance of the nexus are proposed. Based on the needs of the selected case study, an integrated renewable energy-based solution to the key nexus needs for arid regions is proposed. A solar-powered multigeneration system operating with copper-based nanofluid in the solar collector is thermodynamically analysed, and the result demonstrates that the system that produces power, freshwater, and cooling for greenhouse farming has energy and exergy efficiencies of 19% and 16.4% respectively. The deployment of the multigeneration system would lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at a rate of 1111 kg/h for CO2, 4.52 kg/h for NOX, and 8.95 kg/h for SOX. An assessment of the proposed system illustrates that the key resources of the nexus can be met sustainably when renewable energy is integrated into the energy mix in the region. The study concluded that a nexus-based solution to the energy, food, and water challenges would not only lead to improved resource efficiency, but has the potential to decrease the carbon footprint of the region. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Energy; Food; Multi-generation; Nanofluids; Nanotechnology; Water","Arid regions; Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nanofluidics; Nanostructured materials; Solar energy; Water; Case-studies; Energy; Energy-based solutions; Integrated technologies; Interlinkages; Multi generations; Nanofluids; Performance; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy technology; Food products",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104820630

During the last decade, extensive research has been conducted on the design and evaluation of AMOD systems using simulation models. This paper adds to this growing body of literature by investigating the network impacts of AMOD through high-fidelity activity- and agent-based traffic simulation, including detailed models of AMOD fleet operations. Through scenario simulations of the entire island of Singapore, we explore network traffic dynamics by employing the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). Taking into account the spatial variability of density, we are able to capture the hysteresis loops, which inevitably form in a network of this size. Model estimation results at both the vehicle and passenger flow level are documented. Environmental impacts including energy and emissions are also discussed. Findings from the case study of Singapore suggest that the introduction of AMOD may bring about significant impacts on network performance in terms of increased VKT, additional travel delay and energy consumption, while reducing vehicle emissions, with respect to the baseline. Despite the increase in network congestion, production of passenger flows remains relatively unchanged. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based simulation; Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD); Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD); Multimodality","Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Design and evaluations; Energy and emissions; Macroscopic fundamental diagram; Network traffic dynamics; Scenario simulations; Spatial variability; Technological advancement; Traffic simulations; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103774924

Recent studies have shown vegetation greening in the region, but few have investigated the impact of this greening on carbon and water cycles. We used a combination of earth observation (EO) data and a diagnostic model to evaluate the extent of the vegetation greening and its impacts on carbon sequestration potential (i.e., Gross Primary Productivity-GPP) and the water cycle (i.e., Evapotranspiration-ET and Water Use Efficiency-WUE) from 1982 to 2015. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of key climatic variables (i.e., precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation) on vegetation greening, carbon sequestration potential and the water cycle. Our results showed widespread vegetation greening during the first half of the study period (1982–2000), driven mainly by increase in precipitation. However, the rate of greening reduced or became stagnant during the latter half of the study (2000–2015), but did not revert to pre-greening levels of 1980s, implying a persistent ecosystem change. The vegetation greening and increased precipitation resulted in a ~ 17.95% increase in GPP (from ~3.9 PgC/year in 1982 to ~4.6 PgC/year in 2000) and a ~ 21.28% increase in ET (from ~47 mm/year in 1982 to ~57 mm/year in 2015). The WUE showed an overall reduction, mainly attributed to large increases in ET not matched by similar magnitude of increases in GPP. Currently, there is lack of consensus on the magnitude of the contribution of drylands to the global carbon and water cycle. This study shows that drylands undergoing ecosystem change, coupled with climate change, may in future become important contributors to the global carbon and water cycle. Therefore, they could play a key role in future global warming and climate change mitigation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Gross primary productivity; SCARF model; Vegetation greening; Water use efficiency","Carbon; Ecosystems; Global warming; Water supply; Carbon sequestration potential; Climatic variables; Earth observation data; Ecosystem changes; Global warming and climate changes; Gross primary productivity; Vegetation greening; Water use efficiency; Vegetation; air temperature; carbon cycle; climate change; ecosystem dynamics; evapotranspiration; global warming; hydrological cycle; mitigation; precipitation (climatology); primary production; solar radiation; vegetation cover; vulnerability; water use efficiency; Guinea; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sudan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106945457

Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) are inherently climate-sensitive due to the sensitivity of tick lifecycles to climate. Key direct climate and weather sensitivities include survival of individual ticks, and the duration of development and host-seeking activity of ticks. These sensitivities mean that in some regions a warming climate may increase tick survival, shorten life-cycles and lengthen the duration of tick activity seasons. Indirect effects of climate change on host communities may, with changes in tick abundance, facilitate enhanced transmission of tick-borne pathogens. High temperatures, and extreme weather events (heat, cold, and flooding) are anticipated with climate change, and these may reduce tick survival and pathogen transmission in some locations. Studies of the possible effects of climate change on TTBDs to date generally project poleward range expansion of geographical ranges (with possible contraction of ranges away from the increasingly hot tropics), upslope elevational range spread in mountainous regions, and increased abundance of ticks in many current endemic regions. However, relatively few studies, using long-term (multi-decade) observations, provide evidence of recent range changes of tick populations that could be attributed to recent climate change. Further integrated 'One Health' observational and modeling studies are needed to detect changes in TTBD occurrence, attribute them to climate change, and to develop predictive models of public- and animal-health needs to plan for TTBD emergence. © 2020 Crown copyright 2020.

Surface temperatures and mutual collision velocities differ between the terrestrial planet region and the main asteroid belt. To investigate the dependence of crater shape on temperature, velocity and impactor density, we conducted impact experiments on room- and low-temperature iron meteorite and iron alloy targets (carbon steel SS400 and iron‑nickel alloy) with velocities of 0.8–7 km s−1. The projectiles were rock cylinders and metal spheres and cylinders. Oblique impact experiments were also conducted using stainless steel projectiles and SS400 steel targets which produced more prominent radial patterns downrange at room temperature than at low temperature. Crater diameters and depths were measured and compiled using non-dimensional parameter sets based on the π-group crater scaling relations. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted using iSALE-2D code with the Johnson–Cook strength model. Both experimental and numerical results showed that the crater depth and diameter decreased with decreasing temperature, which strengthened the target, and with decreasing impact velocity. The decreasing tendency was more prominent for depth than for diameter, i.e., the depth/diameter ratio was smaller for the low temperature and low velocity conditions. The depth/diameter ratios of craters formed by rock projectiles were shallower than those of craters formed by metallic projectiles. Our results imply that the frequency distribution of the depth/diameter ratio for craters on the surface of metallic bodies may be used as a probe of the past impact environment of metallic bodies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Asteroids; Crater; Impact processes; Iron meteorite; Meteorites",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102739192

The warming on the African continent is projected to be greater than the global average with an increased average temperature of 3–6°C by the end of the century under a high Representative Concentration Pathway. In Africa, the Sub-Saharan region is identified as the most vulnerable to the changing climate due to its very low capacity to adapt to or mitigate climate change. While it is common to identify studies conducted to assess how climate change independently impacts water, land, or food resources, very limited studies have sought to address the interlinkages, synergies, and trade-offs existing between climate change, water, land, and food (WLF) resources as a system in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The climate change and WLF security nexus, therefore, seeks to address this shortfall in literature and subsequently serve as a relevant source of information for decision-making and policy implementation concerning climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Despite claims that law can play a central role in overcoming these challenges and advancing adaptation trajectories, there is relatively little research that connects law, adaptation, and coastal landscapes through the lens of legal geography. This paper systematically makes these connections to empirically explore the role of law in climate change adaptation. In doing so, the paper posits a ‘Coastal Lawscape’ as a useful frame through which to both theorise and to empirically explore coastal climate change adaptation. After detailing the concept of Coastal Lawscape, the paper explores how Coastal Lawscape manifests and influences climate change adaptation trajectories via a case study of four sites within one state jurisdiction. The empirical evidence shows that Coastal Lawscape comprises legal, political and cultural normative systems, and argues that understanding the interconnectedness of these systems is critical for advancing coastal climate change adaptation literature and policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,"adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone; coastal zone management; complexity; environmental policy; literature review; marine policy; policy approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107083664

Sussex, BN2 4GJ, United Kingdom","Transformative learning is highly sought by practitioners and academics in sustainable development, education for sustainable development, and adult education, because it involves shifts in perspectives which can potentially underpin significant changes in worldviews and ways of learning. A practice-based design process for crystallizing local shared values, called WeValue InSitu, is already reported to regularly produce transformative learning (TL), but its lack of discipline- or theory-based origins means there are currently no ways to formalise its mechanisms. There is thus a need to conceptualize the sub-processes within it in order to provide a theoretical underpinning, and to extract key contributions to the production of transformative learning (TL). Here, Polanyi's fine-toothed micro-processes are used to analyse discourses from transcripts of a WeValue InSitu event to reveal patterns of meaning-making and meaning-checking cycles. Also identified are key facilitator actions of: redirecting, challenging, refocusing, reflecting back, and disentangling concepts. These findings allow a self-consistent conceptualization of the WeValue InSitu sub-processes and thus a formal methodology. Furthermore, these will lead to more widespread transferability and scaling-up of WeValue InSitu in the field, to meet demand for its known uses e.g. in climate change adaptation planning, sustainability assessments, and education. The reconceptualized sub-processes also contribute to wider TL research, since it will enable reliable TL production to replace fortuitous case studies. With that, there can now be a new TL research agenda for systematic studies e.g. of TL learning mechanisms and contextual influences on TL. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Crystallization; Meaning-making; Personal knowledge theory; Transformational learning; WeValue; WeValue InSitu","Climate change; Planning; Sustainable development; Adult education; Education for sustainable development; In-situ process; Meaning makings; Personal knowledge theory; Sub process; Transformational learning; Transformative learning; Wevalue; Wevalue insitu; Crystallization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104674535

Recently a double compression expansion engine concept using isobaric combustion was proposed to improve the engine performance. However, the knowledge about the in-cylinder isobaric combustion process is limited. This study investigated isobaric combustion in both metal and optical engines utilizing a centrally placed direct injector and a multiple injections strategy, and the performance and emissions of isobaric combustion and conventional diesel combustion (CDC) were compared. Mie scattering and fuel-tracer planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) were used to visualize the liquid-phase fuel penetration length and fuel distribution under non-reactive conditions, respectively. The natural flame luminosity and spatial soot distribution were measured with high-speed imaging and laser-induced incandescence (LII), respectively. Results demonstrate an increased soot formation in the isobaric cases compared with the CDC case. The successive fuel injection into reacting zones, which induces a locally fuel-rich mixture and less fuel–air mixing, accounts for the high soot emissions in the isobaric combustion. This study further demonstrates that the late injections of the isobaric cases lead to more combustion in the squish zone and near the cylinder walls, which increases the local temperature gradient and may result in more heat losses. There is still room to reduce the heat losses in the isobaric combustion although the total heat loss of the isobaric combustion is lower than the CDC case due to a lower combustion temperature. Multiple injectors are suggested to reduce the soot emissions of the isobaric combustion by spreading the different injections in space. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy-duty engines; Isobaric combustion; Laser-induced incandescence; Multiple injections; Optical diagnostics; Planar laser-induced fluorescence","Combustion; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Engine cylinders; Fluorescence; Fuels; Heat losses; Laser optics; Soot; Comparatives studies; Diesel combustion; Heavy duty engines; Isobaric combustion; Laser-induced incandescence; Multiple injections; Optical diagnostics; Optical engine; Planar laser-induced fluorescence; Soot emissions; Laser produced plasmas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103012264

The transportation sector accounts for 15% of total GHG emissions and 23% of CO 2 emissions, of which 30% of CO 2 comes from burning fossil fuels. Government policies in the context of preventing the spread of Covid 19 and enforcement of restrictions on Community Activities (PPKM), have provided benefits for the environment in terms of reducing air pollution by up to 42% (liputan6.com). The Covid 19 pandemic has an impact on the public transportation business, based on sales data from PT KAI (Persero) that there was a decrease in the number of longdistance train passengers using rail transportation services, namely in April 2019 there were 3,879,792 passengers while in April 2020 it fell to 286 268 passengers. This research aims at understanding the risk perception that affects the planned attitudes and behaviour of potential passengers to travel by train during the pandemic. 368 samples were collected from Operation Area 1 to Operation Area 9. Employing SEM analysis with the SmartPLS, the result shows that the customers intend to continue traveling using railway public services. However, a certain level of anxiety and perceived risk grows due to a lack of information. namely, uncertainty whether the use of public transportation may bear the potential for covid 19 transmissions. Hence the government's actions in dealing with the pandemic could reassure the customers to continue using the railway services. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Risk perception; Sales; Community activities; Energy emissions; Perceived risk; Public services; Public transportation; Rail transportation; Railway services; Transportation sector; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112416852

While grazing exclosures can be important reservoirs of biodiversity and carbon, their potential in playing a dual role of conservation of biodiversity and mitigation of climate change effects is not yet established. To address this gap, we assessed the effect of diversity on aboveground carbon (AGC) and the relative importance of the driving biotic (functional diversity, functional composition and structural diversity) and abiotic (climate, topography and soil) mechanisms. We used a dataset from 133 inventory plots across three altitudinal zones, i.e., highland, midland and lowland, in northern Ethiopia, which allowed local- (within altitudinal zone) and broad- (across altitudinal zones) environmental scale analysis of diversity-AGC relationships. We found that species richness-AGC relationship shifted from neutral in highlands to positive in mid- and lowlands as well as across the altitudinal zones. Structural diversity was consistently the strongest mediator of the positive effects of species richness on AGC within and across altitudinal zones, whereas functional composition linked species richness to AGC at the broad environmental scale only. Abiotic factors had direct and indirect effects via biotic factors on AGC, but their relative importance varied with altitudinal zones. Our results indicate that the effect of species diversity on AGC was altitude-dependent and operated more strongly through structural diversity (representing niche complementarity effect) than functional composition (representing selection effect). Our study suggests that maintaining high structural diversity and managing functionally important species while promoting favourable climatic and soil conditions can enhance carbon storage in grazing exclosures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental gradients; Functional traits; Niche complementarity; Selection effects; Structural diversity; Structural equation modelling","Biodiversity; Climate change; Topography; Above-ground carbons; Altitudinal zones; Associated functions; Functional compositions; Functional diversity; Grazing exclosures; Species richness; Structural diversity; Forestry; carbon; aboveground biomass; aboveground production; biodiversity; carbon; carbon storage; data set; environmental gradient; functional role; grazing; niche; species diversity; species richness; tropical region; Article; climate; Ethiopia; grazing exclosure; landscape; priority journal; soil; species diversity; species richness; topography; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101300238

Because agriculture’s productivity is based on this process, a combination of technologies to reduce emissions and enhance soil carbon storage can allow this sector to achieve net negative emissions while maintaining high productivity. Unfortunately, current row-crop agricultural practice generates about 5% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and European Union. To reduce these emissions, significant effort has been focused on changing farm management practices to maximize soil carbon. In contrast, the potential to reduce emissions has largely been neglected. Through a combination of innovations in digital agriculture, crop and microbial genetics, and electrification, we estimate that a 71% (1,744 kg CO2e/ha) reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from row crop agriculture is possible within the next 15 y. Importantly, emission reduction can lower the barrier to broad adoption by proceeding through multiple stages with meaningful improvements that gradually facilitate the transition to net negative practices. Emerging voluntary and regulatory ecosystems services markets will incentivize progress along this transition pathway and guide public and private investments toward technology development. In the difficult quest for net negative emissions, all tools, including emission reduction and soil carbon storage, must be developed to allow agriculture to maintain its critical societal function of provisioning society while, at the same time, generating environmental benefits. © 2021 Optical Society of America.","Agriculture emission reduction; Crop genetics; Electrification; Innovation; Soil health","carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen fertilizer; agriculture; agronomic trait; carbon footprint; carbon storage; climate change; controlled study; crop production; ecosystem; European Union; microbial genetics; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant genetics; productivity; Review; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108991347

The assessment reveals that the LCCO2 reduction cost greatly varies from 860 to 323,000 [JPY/t-CO2] depending on the areas. Areas where LCCO2 reduction costs are less than 30,000 [JPY/t-CO2] are the medium and large scale remote islands of Okinawa, the Okinawa main island, the large-scale remote islands of Kyushu, and the large-scale remote islands of Shikoku, where the installation of OTEC systems are promising. There are the two main reasons for the small LCCO2 reduction costs in these areas; first, the amount of power generation is large because of the low latitude. Second, the effect of combined use of deep sea water is large because these areas have large cooling demand due to the low latitude or the large regional scale. © 2021 Japan Institute of Energy.

It presents an hard spectral index and its gamma-ray flux extends up to energies close to 100 TeV without significant suppression. Amongst the HAWC sources, it is the most luminous in the multi-TeV domain and therefore is one of the first that should be searched for with a neutrino telescope in the northern hemisphere. Using an updated effective area for the forthcoming KM3NeT detector, we study the possibility to detect this source within ten years of its running time. We show how the Fermi-LAT data could help in providing a morphology information on the source region. We conclude that, considering a neutrino energy threshold around 10 TeV, about a four to five sigma detection has to be expected after ten years of observations, depending on the details of the considered scenario.

This new arena demands more participatory procedures to expand the knowledge-making beyond researchers and experts. One way that science has started to interact with society has been the increasing number of online platforms that have emerged as alternative forums, providing the opportunity for engaging a variety of tools, models, results, and preferences. This study presents I2 AM PARIS, a platform dedicated to delivering on comprehensive and comprehensible scientific information in support of climate policymaking. It does so by bringing the climate-economy modelling community together in a common workspace, with shared protocols, data exchange formats, and nomenclature, and by making the used and produced information accessible to and digestible by all stakeholders. To this end stakeholders, who lie at the heart of the platform, have co-designed the presentation of the platform in order to respond to pertinent questions in the climate debate co-created with stakeholders and the scientific processes together. Oriented on documenting detailed capabilities of integrated assessment models, providing access to input datasets and assumptions driving them, and offering ad hoc visualisation and databases of their outputs, I2 AM PARIS emphasises transparency, reproducibility, inclusivity, plurality, and comprehensibility. © 2021 IEEE.","climate policy; climate-economy modelling; integrated assessment models; open science","Electronic data interchange; Climate policy; Climate science; Climate-economy modeling; Integrated assessment models; Modeling results; Online platforms; Open science; Policy support; Research process; Tool models; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111369028

For 10 plants, we calculated the cumulative net carbon emissions over time (t) from the fuel transition (CCE(t)) and carbon payback time (CPT), a measure of the time it takes for a fuel transition to biomass to reduce the amount of carbon emitted to the atmosphere relative to a continuation of using fossil fuels. Subsequently, we derived the relative cumulative net carbon emissions (RCCE(t)), as a measure of the carbon emission savings/costs induced by the fuel transition. Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses of key parameters, with special focus on emissions from indirect/market mediated effects. For fuel transitions from coal to biomass, CPT ranged from 0 to 13 years indicating that carbon emission benefits were achieved at the latest after 13 years. Relative cumulative net carbon emissions 30 years after the fuel transition (RCCE(30)) ranged from 0.29 to 0.85 corresponding to emission savings of 15–71% relative to continued use of coal. For fuel transitions from natural gas to biomass, CPT ranged from 9 to 34 years and RCCE(30) from 0.81 to 1.03. Sensitivity analyses showed that the use of truly residual biomass (harvest residues or industrial residues with no alternative use), biomass harvest from productive forests and short transport distances are instrumental in achieving a short carbon payback time and large emission savings. The quantification of indirect or market mediated GHG emissions is controversial and uncertain. We analysed additional carbon emissions related to indirect land use change (iLUC), indirect wood use change (iWUC) and indirect fuel use change (iFUC). Including iLUC added 1–4 years, iWUC added 1–3 years and iFUC added 1 year to the mean CPT. © 2021 The Authors.

The input for stochastic model is derived from a Regional Climate Model. The sub-hourly extreme rainfall intensity derived from stochastic model outputs was validated against observed rain-gauge data over the historical period. Considering the advantage in computational efficiency of the stochastic downscaling method, thousand scenarios of rainfall projections at very high temporal and spatial resolution were generated. The implication of this approach is that, from these stochastically downscaled time series of rainfall, it is possible to study future sub-hourly extreme rainfall intensities which would be useful to address issue of flash floods/drainage systems. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Dynamical downscaling; Extremes; Rainfall; Stochastic modelling","Climate change; Climate models; Computational efficiency; Flood control; Rain; Rain gages; Stochastic systems; Climate change adaptation; Downscaling methods; Drainage infrastructure; Extreme rainfall; Historical periods; Rain gauge data; Regional climate modeling; Temporal and spatial; Stochastic models; atmospheric deposition; climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; downscaling; drainage network; efficiency measurement; extreme event; flash flood; numerical model; rainfall; regional climate; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; stochasticity; time series; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094160121

Typically, metal halide (MH) lamps are used in the commercial fishery to attract fish, however these lights require more energy, have a shorter lifespan, and lower chromatic performance than light emitting diode (LED) lamps. This study examined catch efficiency and fuel consumption when using LED lamps in combination with reduced numbers of MH lamps (10.24 kW), compared to conventional lighting (28.6 kW), used during purse seining off the coast of Ninh Thuan province, Vietnam. The economic performance associated with using LED lamps in this fishery was also assessed. We found no significant differences in catch rates between the different light treatments, however fuel consumption was significantly reduced. Fuel consumption per nightly trip using LED with MH lamps was 70.8 l (11.1 l/h) compared to114 l (17.45 l/hr) using MH lamps alone, an estimated 37.9% reduction in fuel consumption. An investment in LED lamps by a fishing enterprise will require additional initial costs, however our analysis revealed the financial break-event point can be reached after approximately 101 nightly trips when the fuel price is at the 2015 level of USD $0.74 per l.

The variation and change in the global climatic factors have a notable impact on the local climate of a region. The changing climate is widely regarded as one of the most serious global health threats of the 21st century. Among various kinds of diseases, the most vulnerable to these changes are vector-borne diseases. In the Indian context, particularly Delhi city is the most vulnerable to dengue, a kind of vector-borne disease having its highest impact. We sought to identify and explore the correlation and influence of the global climatic phenomena and local climatic factors with the reported number of dengue cases in Delhi. The temporal expansions of reported dengue cases in Delhi have a variation from its first major outbreak in the city during the year 1996 to 2015. A statistical tool like Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC) is used in this study to establish the interrelationship and the level of impact and local climatic variation on dengue. An exceptional negative correlation value of r =-0.82 between the monsoon index and the dengue incidences was reported during the positive years and also maintains a very high positive correlation with other global climatic indices. The study here finds that there is a strong correlation of climatic variation which further influences the epidemiology of dengue in Delhi. © 2021, World Research Association.

However, the precursor sources of ASOA are poorly understood, and there are large uncertainties in the health benefits that might accrue from reducing anthropogenic organic emissions. We show that the production of ASOA in 11 urban areas on three continents is strongly correlated with the reactivity of specific anthropogenic volatile organic compounds. The differences in ASOA production across different cities can be explained by differences in the emissions of aromatics and intermediate- and semi-volatile organic compounds, indicating the importance of controlling these ASOA precursors. With an improved model representation of ASOA driven by the observations, we attribute 340ĝ000 PM2.5-related premature deaths per year to ASOA, which is over an order of magnitude higher than prior studies. A sensitivity case with a more recently proposed model for attributing mortality to PM2.5 (the Global Exposure Mortality Model) results in up to 900ĝ000 deaths. A limitation of this study is the extrapolation from cities with detailed studies and regions where detailed emission inventories are available to other regions where uncertainties in emissions are larger. In addition to further development of institutional air quality management infrastructure, comprehensive air quality campaigns in the countries in South and Central America, Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East are needed for further progress in this area. © 2021 Benjamin A.

In this regard, the effect of V5+ doping on the dynamics of spin and oxidation states of Co ions in the La0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ system has been studied using structural, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, magnetic and transport measurements. The La0.5Sr0.5Co1−xVxO3−δ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.1) series was prepared by conventional solid-state reaction method and its chemical homogeneity was established by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The increase of lattice parameters/volume with increasing V5+ content in rhombohedrally crystallized (R3-c) samples is attributed to the presence of Co2+ ions. The presence of Co2+ ions and the reduction of Co3+ ion concentration with V substitution is verified from the results of core-level photoemission spectra of Co. Detailed magnetic measurements show an increase in Curie temperature, effective magnetic moment, soft magnetic nature and suggesting strengthening of underlying magnetic interactions. As a result of multiple oxidation states of Co ions and the delocalization of electrons, rise in the conductivity is noticed. Such enhancement in the conductivity and ferromagnetic ordering temperature, simultaneously, with V doping implies a strong coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom. To understand the underlying mechanism more clearly, different possible scenarios have been discussed. The most appropriate scenario i.e., the conversion of Co3+ ions into Co2+ ions and admixture of Co4+ ion spin states with V5+ doping was found to be consistent with all the experimental observations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cobaltites; Magnetic properties; Spin state transition; Transport properties; XPS","Chemical bonds; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electron transport properties; Electrospinning; Ferromagnetism; Inductively coupled plasma; Ions; Magnetic moments; Magnetic properties; Mass spectrometry; Solid state reactions; Spin dynamics; Transport properties; Co ions; Cobaltite; Magnetic and transport properties; Metallicities; Oxidation state; Property; Spin state; Spin state transition; Xray photo-emission spectroscopy (XPS); X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104996410

Namely, we created three Inter-Regional IONGESs with different assumptions for the wide-area operation of the power grid. The results show that the technical constraints of the power grid influence the interregional distribution of renewable energy. Top ten regional renewable energy sectors (TOP10), which has a large production scale, account for approximately 54% of renewable energy generation, which was found to be biased. From the viewpoint of consumers in each region, we analyzed the share of the electricity cost required to support their consumption. If the CP mechanism is implemented under the technical constraints of the current power grid, consumers in each region will be impacted unequally. However, it was found that such inequality will be solved under the wide-area operation of the power grid. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carbon pricing; Inter-Regional Input–Output Table for a Next Generation Energy System (Inter-Regional IONGES); Renewable energy; Wide-area power grid operation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082797710

However, most African countries are still lagging in taking the initial steps of identifying and prioritising blue economy sectors and understanding the risk to sea and ocean health. Many have not developed integrated blue economy strategies and road maps, and this delays the progress and vision for an African blue economy envisaged by Agenda 2063 and 2050 Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy. For Africa, however, the blue economy offers greater opportunity beyond the economy and the environment. It presents Africa with a unique opportunity to achieve its national objectives, to improve regional integration, and to exert influence in the global setting. In this review, we agree with Schot and Steinmueller (2018) that we need to develop new framings and begin to experiment with new policy practices to address social and environmental challenges. Furthermore, we maintain that existing theories and knowledge based on innovation studies in Africa may be significant for designing and implementing policies towards climate change mitigation, blue economy governance, and sustainability transitions. Finally, we conclude by highlighting how experimentation is the key feature of transformative innovation policy that Africa has to employ in its blue economy while emphasizing how Africa (and the Global South generally) are in a unique position to develop their own transformation models that are different from those of the Global North. © 2021 by the authors.

Outputs from the model are used to provide scientists and policy makers with climate change information related to oceanic conditions that influence harmful algal blooms in the region. Four simulations were developed to include a 20-year hindcast simulation (1997–2016), a 31-year historical simulation (1975–2005), and two 30-year future climate model projections (2006–2035) for the representative carbon pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. We evaluated the hindcast model skill by comparing the simulation outputs with measured observational data and calculated statistics such as the bias, and the root mean square error (RMSE). The observations consisted of satellite sea surface temperature and, CTD temperature and salinity profile data collected in Irish waters. The sea surface temperature RMSEs between the 20-year hindcast simulation and the satellite data were ca. 0.50°C. A minimum RMSE of ca. 0.20°C was recorded in December 2015. The basin-averaged bias (difference) and RMSE for near bottom temperature between the RCP 4.5 and the historical simulation was 0.14°C and 0.27°C respectively. The sea surface temperature anomaly pattern for the RCP 8.5 shows warming across the whole model domain. The sea surface salinity and near bottom salinity climate simulation anomaly maps indicate a general freshening on the southwest Irish shelf. A change of ca. 0.2 sea surface salinity and near bottom salinity was observed. The RCP 8.5 simulation shows the highest current velocities when compared to other simulations.

A fifth-generation DHC (5GDHC) system that supplies a heat-transport medium at a temperature close to the ground and uses various unused heat sources is proposed. Meanwhile, some DHC systems installed in Japan are first-generation DHC (1GDHC) systems that use fossil fuels as a heat source. Based on these scenarios, this study focuses on the energy-saving effects of introducing a CO2 network system in Tokyo, which is based on the same concepts as the 5GDHC systems. The purpose of this study is to estimate the utility value of unused heat sources for the CO2 network system. An analytical model is developed that calculates the energy consumption of the system under exogenous conditions, such as those for energy consumers and heat sources. Applying a model to a domestic urban area in Tokyo, where a conventional 1GDHC system was introduced, it was confirmed that for a total head of groundwater of 50 m, river water of 10 m, and sewage water of 10 m, the potential annual CO2 reduction is approximately 5,000 ton/y compared with the 1GDHC system. These values are feasible in Tokyo, and therefore, this system looks promising. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 networks; Distributed heat pump; District heating and cooling systems; Energy conservation; Unused energy sources","Cooling systems; District heating; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Groundwater; Sewage; CO$-2$/ emission; CO2 network; Distributed heat pumps; District heating and cooling; District heating and cooling systems; Energy; Heat sources; Network systems; Unused energy source; Utility values; Carbon dioxide; abundance estimation; carbon dioxide; estimation method; fossil fuel; groundwater; heat source; river water; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Tokyo [Kanto]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103047561

Galilei, 2, Frascati, 00044, Italy","Since 8 April 2010 ESA's Earth Explorer mission CryoSat-2 has been measuring marine and land ice thickness variations with a dedicated altimeter. With the effects of a fast-changing climate becoming apparent, it is increasingly important to understand exactly how Earth's ice fields are responding and regulate climate and sea level. It is therefore of utmost importance that the quality of the CryoSat-2 altimeter data meets the highest accuracy and precision level, not only over the ice caps and sea-ice surface but over the oceans as well. The SIRAL altimeter of CryoSat-2 is capable of measuring high-resolution geophysical parameters from the open ocean to the coast. In this paper, we validate the CryoSat-2 geophysical ocean product, Baseline-B (GOP). The analyses focus on long-term monitoring, validation, and cross-calibration of these ocean altimeter data with all the concurrent altimeter data in the Radar Altimeter Database System RADS and with independent in-situ tide gauge measurements from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level PSMSL. The objective is to evaluate the stability of the CryoSat-2 measurement system and the identification and explanation of biases and bias drifts. A persistent monitoring of these biases in time is important to establish the data's usefulness for investigation of long-term sea level and ice topography/volume changes. The results constitute the final status of the GOP baseline-B product for use as essential climate variables. GOP ocean data has a -6.3±0.2 cm range bias w.r.t. to all calibrated satellites in RADS and a drift of 0.14 mm yr−1 w.r.t. Jason-2. GOP data has significant wave height and sea state biases close to that of the Jasons’, and seems to be better handling the LRM-SAR transitions than the RADS CryoSat-2 product. GOP data w.r.t. PSMSL tide gauge data has an average correlation of R = 0.83, a mean st. dev. of σ = 6.30 cm, and a drift of 0.11 mm yr−1, equivalent to 40 Gt yr−1 ice sheet mass loss. It is concluded that GOP CryoSat-2 performs better than RADS CryoSat-2, which seems to suffer from a 480-day platform temperature cycle. GOP is also on a par with the altimeter data from the Jason reference missions, and well suited for ocean and climate studies. © 2019 COSPAR","Altimetry; CryoSat-2; ECV; GOP; RADS; Validation","Aneroid altimeters; Earth (planet); Geophysics; Glaciers; Meteorological instruments; Ocean currents; Radio altimeters; Sea ice; Sea level; Synthetic aperture radar; System stability; Tide gages; Topography; Altimetry; Cryosat; Earth Explorer Mission; Geophysical parameters; Permanent service for mean sea levels; RADS; Significant wave height; Validation; Geodetic satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073006359

More-extensive approaches require subsequent instrumentation with metal artifacts impairing follow-up imaging. Here, we present a technical note on percutaneous instrumentation using carbon fiber–reinforced polyether ether ketone (CFR-PEEK) hardware combined with a minimally invasive posterolateral approach for tumor resection. Methods: We present a Technical Note and according case series of 7 patients with dumbbell tumors in the lumbar and thoracolumbar spine operated on between 2017 and 2020. CFR-PEEK pedicle screws and rods were inserted percutaneously. Afterwards, a dedicated self-standing retractor for posterolateral approaches was connected to the screws. Following a unilateral facetectomy, the tumor was resected in a microsurgical fashion. Clinical data are reported with respect to the Preferred Reporting Of CasE Series in Surgery (PROCESS) guidelines. Results: Four patients presented with de novo tumors. Three patients were treated for residual tumor mass after previous surgeries. Gross total resection was achieved in all 7 cases, as demonstrated by early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Histopathology demonstrated 5 World Health Organization grade I schwannomas, 1 grade II hemangiopericytoma, and 1 cavernous hemangioma. No postoperative complications were observed. CFR-PEEK hardware allowed unambiguous visualization of the resection cavity on follow-up imaging. Conclusions: Resection of dumbbell tumors via a minimally invasive posterolateral approach and instrumentation with CFR-PEEK hardware allows maximal and safe resection.

As a woody plant, cocoa can absorb CO2 from the air and store it in the form of carbon (C) in its body (biomass). The absorption process of CO2 also affects the rate of photosynthesis in plants as the main ingredient in the breakdown of carbon in the plant body, especially cocoa. This research was conducted in Gantarangkeke District, Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi. Sampling was carried out by purposive sampling method on the basis of consideration of the type, density and cropping system applied. The estimation of biomass used a non-destructive method by measuring the diameter at breast height (DBH 1.3 m) and the height of the cocoa. Carbon storage in cocoa is differentiated by several plant ages, namely 5 years and 10 years. The results showed that the carbon stock in Bantaeng Regency was 27.05 tons/Ha. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Food supply; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Integrated circuits; Nondestructive examination; Absorption process; Calculation analysis; Carbon stocks; Carbon storage; Cropping systems; Diameter-at-breast heights; Nondestructive methods; Sampling method; Cocoa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111971387

Extracellular carbonic anhydrase (eCA) is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyses the relatively slow interconversion between HCO3− and CO2. Early results indicated that sub-nanomolar levels of eCA at the sea surface were sufficient to enhance the oceanic uptake rate of CO2 on a global scale by 15%, an addition of 0.37 Pg C year−1. Despite its central role in the marine carbon cycle, only in recent years have new analytical techniques allowed the first quantifications of eCA and its activity in the oceans. This opens up new research areas in the field of marine biogeochemistry and climate change. Light and suitable pH conditions, as well as growth stage, are crucial factors in eCA expression. Previous studies showed that phytoplankton eCA activity and concentrations are affected by environmental stressors such as ocean acidification and UV radiation as well as changing light conditions. For this reason, eCA is suggested as a biochemical indicator in biomonitoring programmes and could be used for future response prediction studies in changing oceans. This review aims to identify the current knowledge and gaps where new research efforts should be focused to better determine the potential feedback of phytoplankton via eCA in the marine carbon cycle in changing oceans. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we have compiled and analyzed the published data for perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonates (PFSAs) in surface waters of coastal seas, the Great Lakes, and open oceans to examine temporal and geospatial trends. Mass discharges from major rivers were also estimated. A large number of measurements of individual PFAS have been made in these surface waters (29a »500 values), with seven C4-C10 PFSAs and nine C4-C12 PFCAs accounting for 83% of all data. However, most results (85% for PFSAs; 80% for PFCAs) were for the coastal seas of Western Europe, China, Korea, and Japan, while results were limited for coastal North America and lacking for South America and Africa. Highest median concentrations of PFCAs and PFSAs were reported in the Bohai and Yellow Seas region of China as well as in the North and Baltic seas in Europe. Significant declines in median PFSAs and C7-C12 PFCAs were also observed for the period 2012-2018 in these same regions, and for 2004-2017 in the Great Lakes. Mass discharge estimates indicated continued substantial riverine emissions of long chain (C7-C12) PFCAs in the period 2015-2019 for the coastal seas of China and reductions in emissions for Western European rivers compared to earlier time periods. © 2021 The Authors.

We conducted an assessment and reflection using a feedback framework for strategic adaptive management in three woodland restoration initiatives in South Africa. This is because assessment and reflection are critical components for successful strategic adaptive management. We found that the three restoration initiatives have had a limited emphasis on sustainable livelihood-driven outcomes, because the initiatives mainly aimed to restore biodiversity, ecosystem infrastructure and ecosystem services. Consequently, we propose a modified livelihood framework that suggests a more inclusive approach towards achieving positive human outcome-driven restoration of degraded woodlands. Based on the framework, we emphasise that restoration initiatives should seek to invest in ecosystem restoration in the context of sustainable development goals, to enhance people's livelihoods, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Harmonizing the competing needs for resource allocation, sustainable interventions and livelihoods sustenance will be important, given the limited extent of alternative locally based livelihood options in the rural disadvantaged areas. This is because most of the rural population is largely dependent on woodland ecosystem services for their livelihoods. We then suggest that to ensure that human-driven outcomes are also equally prioritised; the assessment, reflection and feedback framework and the livelihoods framework should form part of restoration initiatives. © 2021 SAAB","Biodiversity conservation; Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Ecosystem services; Livelihoods; Sustainability","adaptive management; assessment method; biodiversity; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; environmental restoration; land use change; livelihood; population growth; project management; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; South Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103085422

Three patches of the grassland including protected grassland, private grazing land used by smallholder farmers and ranch were selected for the study to represent three different grazing land management practices. Quadrats of 0.5 m × 0.5 m were used to determine biomass yield and collect samples of herbaceous forages from each site (12 quadrats from each site). For woody species four 10 m × 10 m plots were established along transect of 200 m with 20 m distance between plots to identify available species (in the ranch only). A total of 20 herbaceous species were identified, out of which 45% were grasses, 15% legumes, 10% sedges and 30% forbs. Out of 17 browse species identified in the ranch, 47.1% were trees while 52.9% were shrubs. The total biomass production from protected grassland (4.34 t/ha) was higher (P<0.05) than that of private grazing land (3.66 t/ha) and ranch (3.76 t/ha). Biomass production of sedge and forbs were the highest (P<0.05) in ranch. The ranges of chemical constituents for grasses were 8.44–10.74%, 52.8–72%, 27.7–37.4%, 3.1–5.6%, 58.2–76% for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), respectively. The CP and IVDMD for legumes varied from 15.64–20.33% and 80.1–85–1%, respectively. For browses the ranges of CP and IVDMD were 15.41–27.19% and 57.4–81.9%, respectively. Among grass species, Eragrostis botryodes generated less methane. In general, legumes (5.5–6.5 mL/200 mg) and sedge (6 mL/200 mg) produced less amount of methane compared with grasses (7–10.5 mL/200 mg). Browses (9.5–13.5 mL/200 mg) produced more methane compared with herbaceous species (5.5–10.5 mL/200 mg). In conclusion protecting grassland and using cut and carry feeding system promoted more herbage production. The CP content of grass is generally good but supplementation with legumes and browses are required in practical feeding. The use of legumes with grasses and other browse species is recommended as a feeding strategy to reduce methane production However; further investigations on animal response trials are suggested to see the potential of these feed resources. © 2021 The Authors","Biomass yield; Browse species; Grassland forage; Herbaceous species; In vitro gas production, Kofele",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101650355

Mean PM10 mass concentration (66.1 µg m−3) significantly exceeds the annual mean air quality guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization. The statistical analysis of concentration data and meteorological parameters allows us to recognize the importance of wind intensity speed (Wsp) and wind direction conditions in the enrichment of PM concentrations. The proximity and magnitude of the emitting source is also relevant for PM concentration. Such conditions favored that higher metal concentration was recognized at the north of the studied area. By means principal component analysis (PCA) was difficult to identify the groups of metals associated with specific sources (anthropogenic and geogenic) given the high complexity of the study area and the long period of time evaluated. Metal concentration trend shows an important positive trend for Pt, V and Cr, while PM10, Ni, Cu, Ag and Sb show a trend of moderate increase. In contrast, Pb and Co registered a strong percentage reduction, while Hg, Mn, As and Cd show a slight reduction, probably resulting from the implementation of regulatory measures and influenced by urban changes associated at the north of the studied area. The results of this research provide information that should be considered for evaluating the impact of anthropogenic sources and applying regulatory measures to control emissions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Atmospheric pollution; Historical trend; Metals; Mexico city metropolitan area; PM10","air quality; atmospheric pollution; complexity; concentration (composition); historical perspective; metal; metropolitan area; particulate matter; trend analysis; wind direction; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; heavy metal; metal; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; Mexico; particulate matter; procedures; season; wind; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Metals; Metals, Heavy; Mexico; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100978510

Microbial interactions within peatlands can regulate greenhouse gas production, organic matter turnover, and nutrient cycling. Here we analyze bacterial and fungal communities along a steep P gradient in a tropical peat dome and investigate community level traits and network analyses to better understand the composition and potential interactions of microorganisms in these understudied systems and their relationship to peatland biogeochemistry. We found that both bacterial and fungal community compositions were significantly different along the P gradient, and that the low-P bog plain was characterized by distinct fungal and bacterial families. At low P, the dominant fungal families were cosmopolitan parasites and endophytes, including Clavicipitaceae (19%) in shallow soils (0–4 cm), Hypocreaceae (50%) in intermediate-depth soils (4–8 cm), and Chaetothyriaceae (45%) in deep soils (24–30 cm). In contrast, high- and intermediate-P sites were dominated by saprotrophic families at all depths. Bacterial communities were consistently dominated by the acidophilic Koribacteraceae family, with the exception of the low-P bog site, which was dominated by Acetobacteraceae (19%) and Syntrophaceae (11%). These two families, as well as Rhodospirillaceae, Syntrophobacteraceae, Syntrophorhabdaceae, Spirochaetaceae, and Methylococcaceae appeared within low-P bacterial networks, suggesting the presence of a syntrophic-methanogenic consortium in these soils. Further investigation into the active microbial communities at these sites, when paired with CH4 and CO2 gas exchange, and the quantification of metabolic intermediates will validate these potential interactions and provide insight into microbially driven biogeochemical cycling within these globally important tropical peatlands. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bacterial and fungal communities; Metabarcoding; Microbial networks; Peat; Phosphorus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078635139

One strategy to produce highly efficient UC emission in the solid state is to create systems that can efficiently transport generated triplets to distances significantly longer than afforded by the Dexter mechanism under restriction of molecular movement. In this work, we present a new solid state UC system through integration of conjugated poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivatives, with tethered and/or blended chromophores of (9,10-bisphenylethynylanthracene (BPEA) as an emitter and palladium(II) meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrine (TBP)) as a sensitizer. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of a small ratio (ca. 3%) of covalently bound BPEA onto the PPV backbone enhances UC emission around an order of magnitude compared to the homo-PPV when mixed with 2 wt % TBP. On the other hand, time-resolved measurements find more rapid consumption of the generated sensitizer triplets with BPEA increased concentrations (up to 50 mol %), suggesting that these BPEA units provide accelerated triplet energy transfer (TET) compared to in homo-PPV, however there exists a significant loss channel via energy back transfer in PPV-BPEA with higher contents of the BPEA unit. Moreover, microsecond time scale decay behavior, where a small population of triplets exist, show that triplets were mainly transmitted through the conjugated polymer phase. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Conjugated polymers; Energy conversion; Energy transfer; Palladium compounds; Photoluminescence spectroscopy; Photons; Covalently bound; Molecular movement; Photon up conversions; Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) derivatives; Small population; Time resolved measurement; Triplet energy transfer; Triplet-triplet annihilation; Chromophores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110992459

The uncertainty of model results stems from many factors, including uncertainty in multiphase flow parameters. Specifically, relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships depend on both the rock properties and fluid properties, and the latter may be highly nonlinear as fluid temperature, and pressure conditions change. Forecasts of trapping mechanisms, phase behavior, and plume movement are impacted by choice of relative permeability and capillary pressure functions and how those functions are calibrated and constrained. In particular, one of the most neglected aspects of such simulations is meaningful capillary pressure processes. A primary goal of this study is to quantify the difference in forecasts for models that utilize capillary pressure functions calibrated with measured data from the results of models without such. Additionally, the relative permeability models developed here were derived from measured capillary pressure data. Those data were used to constrain saturation endpoints in the relative permeability curves and dictate how that relative permeability was distributed spatially. The main conclusions drawn from this analysis include (1) heterogeneity in relative permeability plays a significant role in simulated forecasts of CO2 migration, trapping mechanisms and storage capacity, as well as oil and water production, and (2) capillary pressure, and in particular, the magnitude of capillarity also plays a significant role in these processes. Conversely, if the magnitude of capillarity is small relative to in situ fluid pressures, it imparts insignificant effects on these processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Capillary pressure; CCUS; Geologic carbon storage; Relative Permeability","Capillary tubes; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Forecasting; Multiphase flow; Petroleum industry; Capillary pressure function; Fluid temperatures; Geologic carbon storages; Pressure conditions; Relative permeability; Relative permeability curves; Relative permeability model; Trapping mechanisms; Capillarity; capillary pressure; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; computer simulation; forecasting method; multiphase flow; numerical model; permeability; quantitative analysis; underground storage; Anadarko Basin; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110186649

This paper closely examines the processes undertaken during the development of EU Territorial Just Transition Plans (TJTPs) for the three Swedish regions of Gotland, Norrbotten, and Västra Gö-taland. The aim is to establish whether the content and actions outlined in the TJTPs were driven by the technical, social, or spatial dimensions of a just transition. The analysis is primarily based on a socio-economic and governance impact assessment conducted in each region as part of the TJTP formulation process. These data are also supported by observations of the TJTP development process by the article authors who were part of the team put together by DG Reform to work with the preparation of the TJTPs. The paper finds that the TJTPs development process was largely driven by technical considerations, rather than spatial and socio-economic issues. This indicates that a more open and inclusive place-based territorial approach to climate transition policy formulation and implementation is required. A balance between the technical, social, and spatial elements of a just transition is needed if policies are going to meet the requirements of local and regional citizens and provide sustainable socio-economic growth and environmental protection, without risks of delocal-izing energy-intensive processes to other regions. © 2021 by the authors.

We performed timing and spectral analyses of multi-epoch Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) Circinus ULX5 with the aim of putting constraints on the mass of the central object and the accretion mode operating in this source. Aims. We investigate whether the source contains a stellar mass black hole (BH) with a super-Eddington accretion flow or an intermediate mass black hole accreting matter in a sub-Eddington mode. Moreover, we search for major observed changes in spectra and timing and determine whether they are associated with major structural changes in the disk, similarly to those in black hole X-ray binaries. Methods. We collected all available broadband data from 2001 to 2018 including Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR. We a performed timing and spectral analyses to study the relation between luminosity and inner disk temperature. We proceeded with time-averaged spectral analysis using phenomenological models of different accretion modes. Finally, we constructed the hardness ratio versus intensity diagram to reveal spectral state transitions in Circinus ULX5. Results. Our spectral analysis revealed at least three distinctive spectral states of Circinus ULX5 that are analagous to state transitions in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries. Disk-dominated spectra are found in high flux states and the power-law dominated spectra are found in lower flux states. The source was also observed in an intermediate state, where the flux was low, but the spectrum is dominated by a disk component. Over eighteen years of collected data, ULX5 appeared two times in the high, three times in the low, and two times in the intermediate state. The fastest observed transition was ∼seven months. Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that the central object in Circinus ULX5 is a stellar mass BH (< 10 M·) or, possibly, a neutron star (NS) despite there being no detection of pulsations in the light curves. The fractional variability amplitudes are consistent with state transitions in Circinus ULX5, wherein higher variability from the power law-like Comptonized emission becomes suppressed in the thermal disk-dominated state. © ESO 2021.","Accretion; Accretion disks; Stars: black holes; X-rays: binaries","Gravitation; Spectrum analysis; X rays; Disk temperatures; Intensity diagrams; Intermediate mass black holes; Intermediate state; Phenomenological models; State transitions; Stellar-mass black holes; Ultraluminous x-ray sources; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110419765

In the theoretical phase, different scenarios were designed based on a 25% and 50% reduction in the volume of motorcycles and personal vehicles separately, as well as a simultaneous reduction of 50% for motorcycles and personal vehicles. The effect of running these scenarios on reducing air pollution was investigated using emission inventory model and on noise pollution by CadnaA software according to DIN 45687 and ISO 17534 Series. In the field phase, the exposure of a cyclist to noise pollution in the use of different modes of transportation was investigated in two main and secondary routes based on the weighted-time average method. Considering the 64% share of passenger cars in the total volume of motor vehicle traffic in Tehran, the highest noise reduction is expected to occur in the scenario of 50% replacement of private cars with bicycles under which, the average sound level near the main thoroughfares and highways will decrease by 1.8 dBA and PM2.5 and NO2 emissions by about 11 and 1196 t/y, respectively. According to the field investigations, noise levels for motorcyclists, cyclists, drivers, and public transport passengers were far higher than for car drivers, which may be attributed to the loud background noise and lack of a control system such as a proper cabin. By replacing cars and motorcycles with bicycles, air and noise pollution will definitely be reduced and cyclists will be less exposed to pollution. Accordingly, exposure to air and noise contaminants should be considered as effective decision-making criteria when locating bicycle lanes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Cyclists; Emission inventory; Exposure; Noise pollution; Transportation mode",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108294602

Despite their rise, the literature is yet to fully engage with this complexity, as siloed disciplinary focuses on specific aspects of climate actions in city networks are far behind explaining the reality of these networks. Since there is a dispersed understanding of climate actions in city networks across different fields of research, we adopt an interdisciplinary approach to identify the key drivers of climate actions in city networks. Urban studies' focus is on networking and the political economy behind it. On the other hand, sustainability transition studies has provided an in-depth understanding of the socio-cultural context, and scholars in environmental science illuminate the environmental context of cities. By synthesizing these three fields, this paper proposes a framework that ensures a comprehensive understanding of drivers of climate actions in city networks. It consists of thirteen attributes under four themes of networking context, political economy, socio-cultural context, and environmental context. The framework's utility is identifying the limitations of studies and a comprehensive comparison of cities to unpack the drivers of climate actions in city networks to encourage networking. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","City comparison; City networks; Climate actions; Drivers; Interdisciplinary approach; Knowledge exchange",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111138898

For this purpose, first, the methodological requirements of the model for the study area, including wind speed, relative humidity, and temperature, were analyzed. Then, the concentration of SO2 emission from the power plant stack was calculated using the Aeroqual Model 200. The obtained data were processed and loaded into the Airpacts model version 1.0. After localization of the costs for reconstruction of 1 m2 of façade, including the costs of purchasing materials, installation, and transport from the power plant, the damage posed by SO2 to the building façades in Qazvin was calculated. Outputs of the modified model suggested that the damage to the building façades included cleansing in contact with SO2 was 494,558,878.12 m2. Based on the calculations, the cost of damage caused by SO2 was estimated to be $0.25 per Megawatt-hour (MWh) electricity generation, reaching an amount of $29,422 annually. Based on the localized results obtained by the modified Airpacts, the external cost of damage to the façades was $0.3 per MWh electricity generation, reaching an amount of $35,720 annually.

Vaclav Smil [1] argues 'commonly used measures of energy use - be it conversion efficiencies, energy costs, per capita utilization levels, growth rates, consumption elasticity, or output rations - are just helpful indicators of the performance and dynamics of processes whose aim should not be merely to secure basic existential needs or to satisfy assorted consumerist urges but also to enrich intellectual lives and to make us more successful as a social and caring species.' Energy and electricity access and use is valuable not in itself, but for what it enables women and men 'to do or achieve' [2]. Grubler studied the history of past energy transitions and identifies 'grand patterns', one of which being the critical importance of end-use - consumers and demand - 'with technology and the social settings co-evolving, depending on each other' [3]. Feminist studies in science and technology treat technology as a 'socio-technical' product and describe the relationship between gender and technology as one of mutual shaping [4]. Gender and development studies put forward the concept of 'gender mainstreaming' which has been applied to infrastructure programs, such as energy, transport and digital infrastructure, based on gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) approaches. The paper draws from these frameworks. Norbert Wiener considered the resilience of urban centres in preparation for a potential nuclear attack and outlined what he considered to be some key features of urban plans. In the first draft of his urban plan, titled 'Civilian Defense Plan', his central argument is that the atomic bomb has rendered our previous understanding of civil defense obsolete and that 'we need to reorganize our cities where they stand' - markets, points for medical supplies, hospitals, transportation, etc [5]. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the inter-relatedness and inter-connections between physical infrastructure, key utilities and services, and economic, health and social outcomes. There is an urgent need to rethink and transform cities to respond to the reality of Covid-19 and potential future pandemics, and to recover better, by building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities. International experiences show that cities with similar densities and levels of economic development have fared very differently in their ability to contain Covid-19. This indicates that the strength and duration of impacts of Covid-19 are not solely determined by a city's population density, but also by local capacity and preparedness to deal with such crises, infrastructure and service delivery systems, citizen's trust and confidence in society's institutions and the level of functional responsibilities and resources available to them through decentralized systems. Some of the key lessons for recovery and 'building back better' include the importance of an effective health system response, urban and regional planning, physical distancing, city-wide slum upgrading and housing programs, land-use and regulations to regulate hygiene conditions, significantly scaling up the low-carbon energy and infrastructure transition, access to key utilities and services for poor and vulnerable groups such as women, slum and transient populations, people with disabilities and the elderly, social protection, rethinking business supply chains, more resilient and inclusive ICT and digital connectivity and a pressing need to address gender inequality and social exclusion in relation to vulnerabilities. These new challenges require a new approach that integrates governance, physical environment and infrastructure, social environment, economic environment, planning and resourcing for resilience, and gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). The objective of the study was to develop an integrated approach to strengthening urban resilience based on infrastructure, energy and health linkages, with a focus on GESI impacts. Drawing from lessons learned from various connected fields: climate-related disaster programs to designing infrastructure; power and energy systems to incorporate resilience and reliability; universal health coverage and health system strengthening; and the preliminary lessons drawn from the activities undertaken to control the Covid-19 pandemic, a Resilience Assessment Framework has been proposed. The framework is intended to be used to assess the current resilience maturity level of a city. It can also be applied to measure progress, at different time intervals, towards a prospective target maturity level. © 2021 IEEE.","energy; gender; health; inclusion; infrastructure; resilience","Decentralized systems; Developing countries; Energy utilization; Network security; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Energy; Energy inclusions; Gender equality; Health systems; Infrastructure; Maturity levels; Resilience; Social inclusion; Social well-being; Urban resilience; Health",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115946153

Net Zero Energy (NZ) buildings would reduce greenhouse gases. The current definition of NZ lacks consensus and has created uncertainties, which cause delays in the adoption of NZ. This paper proposes a Process for Clarification to Accelerate the Net Zero (PC-A-NZ) through three integrated steps: variations, strategies, and requirements. We expand on the results in published NZ literature to clarify the differences in definition and strategy. The objective of this review is to (1) distinguish current variable parameters that are slowing the acceptance of NZ, and (2) focus the discussion internationally on moving faster toward applying NZ to a larger common agreement. The publications of global NZ target assessment and energy efficient strategies will be reviewed to address the main requirements in expediting NZ’s successful progress. Our NZ review analysis highlights (1) how the existing NZ definitions and criteria differ, (2) how calculation strategies vary, and (3) how standards and requirements are often localized. The proposed PC-A-NZ will help policymakers and stakeholders to re-evaluate the existing definitions, standards, and requirements to optimize the use of renewable technologies, improved energy efficiency and electrification to speed up achieving the NZ targets. Definition: There are multiple NZ definitions that vary in source and supply requirement, timescale, emission source, and grid connection. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 in Guangzhou, we developed land use regression (LUR) models using data from 49 routine air quality monitoring stations. The R2, adjust R2 and 10-fold cross validation R2 for the annual PM2.5 LUR model were 0.78, 0.72 and 0.66, respectively, indicating the robustness of the model. In all the LUR models, traffic variables (e.g., length of main road and the distance to nearest ancillary) were the most common variables in the LUR models, suggesting vehicle emission was the most important contributor to PM2.5 and controlling vehicle emissions would be an effective way to reduce PM2.5. The predicted PM2.5 exhibited significant variations with different land uses, with the highest value for impervious surfaces, followed by green land, cropland, forest and water areas. Guangzhou as the third largest city that PM2.5 concentration has achieved CAAQS Grade II guideline in China, it represents a useful case study city to examine the health and economic benefits of further reduction of PM2.5 to the lower concentration ranges. So, the health and economic benefits of reducing PM2.5 in Guangzhou was further estimated using the BenMAP model, based on the annual PM2.5 concentration predicted by the LUR model. The results showed that the avoided all cause mortalities were 992 cases (95% CI: 221–2140) and the corresponding economic benefits were 1478 million CNY (95% CI: 257–2524) (willingness to pay approach) if the annual PM2.5 concentration can be reduced to the annual CAAQS Grade I guideline value of 15 μg/m3. Our results are expected to provide valuable information for further air pollution control strategies in China. © 2021","BenMAP; Guangzhou; Health benefit; Land use regression model; PM2.5","Air pollution control; Air quality; Economic and social effects; Economics; Health; Quality management; Regression analysis; % reductions; Air quality management; BenMAP; Economic benefits; Guangzhou; Health benefits; Land-use regression models; PM$-2.5$; Spatio-temporal variation; Vehicle emission; Land use; water; air quality; health impact; numerical model; particulate matter; public health; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; cause of death; China; concentration (parameter); cropland; economics; exhaust gas; exposure; forest; land use; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; priority journal; public health; seasonal variation; statistical model; traffic; Willingness To Pay; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102808670

Achieving clear, coherent, and ambitious urban greening strategies, embedded in urban planning and developed in a co-creative, participatory and inclusive manner, is highly challenging within the EU enlargement context. In this article, such challenges are studied through two recent urban development initiatives in Belgrade, the Capital of Serbia: the first initiative focuses on planning the new Linear Park, within the framework of the CLEVER Cities Horizon 2020 project; the second initiative envisages the transformation of the privatised Avala Film Complex in the Košutnjak Urban Forest, primarily led by private interests but supported by the local authorities. The multiple-case study research method is applied, with an exploratory purpose and as a basis for potential future research on evaluation of co-creation processes for NBS implementation. The theoretical basis of this article is founded in the research on sustainability transitions, focusing on multi-level perspective (MLP) framework. The urban planning system in Belgrade and Serbia is observed as a socio-technical regime of the MLP. In such framework, we recognize co-creative planning of the Linear Park as a niche innovation. We interpret opposition towards planning of the Avala Film Complex as escalation, or an extreme element of the socio-technical landscape, comprised of civic unrests and political tensions on one side, combined with the climate crisis and excessive pollution on the other side. Moreover, the article examines informal urban planning instruments that can be implemented by the practitioners of niche innovations, that could support urban planners and NBS advocates in the Serbian and EU enlargement contexts to face the challenges of motivating all stakeholders to proactively, constructively and appropriately engage in co-creation. © 2021 by the authors.

The goal of this paper was to evaluate the impact of weather conditions on tourism-related conditions and their changes in the multiannual period. In the analysis, the indices of heat days, the UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index) and CTIS (Climate Tourism Information Scheme) tools were used. The research on heat days and the UTCI indicated a significant increase in the heat-stress frequency over the last decades. Simultaneously, the number of weather types related to cold stress has considerably decreased. Such trends were noticed in the entire region, in all the considered hypsometric zones. The rising tendency was also observed for strong and very strong heat stress (UTCI &gt; 32◦C), which negatively affects health problems. The analysis showed that the most extreme thermal and biothermal conditions, in terms of heat stress, occur under southern and eastern anticyclonic circulation. The CTIS analysis showed that favorable weather conditions for most of tourism activities are noticed in the warm half-year. The usefulness of weather conditions for tourism can vary depending on atmospheric circulation. © 2021 by the author.

Diverse cultural groups in the Himalayan regions have their own local indigenous healthcare systems, with medicinal plant applications that differ depending on geography and ecology. Therefore, it is important to understand plant ecological behavior for prioritizing conservation efforts and comprehending the impact of climate change on plant phenological traits. Methods: Ethnopharmacological data was collected through interviews and group discussions using semi-structured and close-ended questionnaires from different ethnic groups i.e., Gujjar, Bakarwal, and Kashmiri. The data was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and ordination techniques (Principal Component Analysis) using multivariate software. Results: The present investigation documented a total of 32 plant species belonging to 31 genera in 23 families. Across the 23 families, the distribution of species was unequal, half of the species belonged to just 6 families (Asteraceae, Berberidaceae, Lamiaceae, Ranunculaceae, Solanaceae and Amaranthaceae) while the remaining half belonged to 17 families. Amongst the parts of plants, roots were the most utilized plant part with 25% of usage followed by whole plant (22%). Gastro-intestinal disorders were treated with most species (18%), followed by pulmonary infections (13%). A heat map showed two distinctly separated clusters based on the degree of intensity of flowering timing of the flora and month. Based on the conservation assessment, out 19% of all species observed fell in the Critically Endangered category of IUCN, followed by 6% in the Vulnerable category. Conclusions: This study provides the ethnopharmacological and ecological scope of the plants of the Kashmir in the northern Himalaya. There is need to develop strategies to conserve and sustainably harvest these plants in order to maintain their long-term benefits in the medicinal field. © 2021, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

In the present study, the role of the sodium bicarbonate transporters (NBCs) in prostate cancer cell proliferation and viability was examined. qPCR revealed heterogeneous expression of five NBC isoforms in human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3, 22RV1, C4-2, DU145, and the prostate cell line RWPE-1. In fluorescence pH measurement of LNCaP cells, which predominantly express NBCe1, Na+ and HCO3 -mediated acid extrusion was identified by bath ion replacement and sensitivity to the NBC inhibitor S0859. NBCe1 knockdown using siRNA oligonucleotides decreased the number of viable cells, and pharmacological inhibition with S0859 (50 μM) resulted in a similar decrease. NBCe1 knockdown and inhibition also increased cell death, but this effect was small and slow. In PC3 cells, which express all NBC isoforms, NBCe1 knockdown decreased viable cell number and increased cell death. The effects of NBCe1 knockdown were comparable to those by S0859, indicating that NBCe1 among NBCs primarily contributes to PC3 cell proliferation and viability. S0859 inhibition also decreased the formation of cell spheres in 3D cultures. Immunohistochemistry of human prostate cancer tissue microarrays revealed NBCe1 localization to the glandular epithelial cells in prostate tissue and robust expression in acinar and duct adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that NBCe1 regulates acid extrusion in prostate cancer cells and inhibiting or abolishing this transporter decreases cancer cell proliferation. © 2021 Spandidos Publications.

One promising example involves the integration of biomass boilers with concentrated solar power (CSP) referred to as hybrid concentrated solar biomass (HCSB) plants. This study evaluates the technical feasibility of a potential plant design for a rice-straw-fed HCSB plant. A case study for the Riverina-Murray region of Australia, a prime area for deployment owing to abundant solar and biomass resources is presented. Based on an assessment of different hybrid concepts, we investigate a solar-biomass hybridization with a concentrated solar tower system. With this hybrid concept, both the CSP and biomass boiler can raise steam to feed the high-pressure turbine enabling greater thermal efficiency. We evaluate HCSB plant performance at four scales: 5, 15, 30 and 50 MWe. Depending on size, HCSB plants reach thermal efficiencies from 21 to 34%. Considering the economic feasibility, assuming an internal rate of return (IRR) of 11%, viable deployment requires an electricity price of AU$ 120–350/MWh. The techno-economic assessment demonstrates advantages compared to standalone CSP plants and highlights the competitiveness of HCSB plants compared to other renewable technologies in Australia.

Therefore, this study examines the effect of MSW management on GHG emissions in Pakistan and suggests the best suitable strategies for alleviating GHG emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 waste model (WM) was used to create inventory of GHG emissions from landfilling. The solid waste management GHG (SWM-GHG) calculator and strengths–weaknesses–opportunities–threat (SWOT) analyses were used as strategic planning tools to reduce GHG emissions by improving MSW management in Pakistan. The IPCC 2006 WM estimated 14,987,113 metric tonnes (Mt) carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) of GHG emissions in 2016. The SWM-GHG calculator, on the other hand, estimated 23,319,370 Mt CO2-eq of GHG emissions from management of 30,764,000 Mt of MSW in 2016, which included 8% recycling, 2% composting, and 90% disposal in open dumps. To reduce GHG emissions, two strategies including recycling-focused and incineration-focused were analysed. The recycling approach can reduce more GHG emissions than incineration, as it can reduce 36% of GHG emissions (as compared to GHG emission in 2016) by recycling 23% of MSW, anaerobically digesting 10% of MSW, and disposing of 67% of MSW in sanitary landfills (with energy recovery). Moreover, the SWOT analysis suggested integration of the informal sector, adoption of anaerobic digestion and formulation of explicit MSW regulations for improving the current management of MSW which will also result in lower GHG emissions. © The Author(s) 2021.","greenhouse gases; landfilling; methane; Municipal solid waste; recycling; waste-to-energy","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Mathematical instruments; Recycling; Storm sewers; Waste incineration; Energy recovery; GHG emission; Informal sector; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Landfilling; Msw managements; Municipal solid waste (MSW); SWOT analysis; Municipal solid waste; biogas; cadmium; methane; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; recycling; strategic approach; waste management; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; chemical oxygen demand; climate change; energy consumption; energy recovery; environmental protection; government; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; human; incineration; landfill; middle income country; municipal solid waste; nephrolithiasis; productivity; pyrolysis; recycling; solid waste; strategic planning; technology; waste management; waste water management; waste-to-energy; greenhouse gas; Pakistan; waste disposal; waste management; Pakistan; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Pakistan; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100546442

The majority of studies show that financial support and environmental taxes are one of the most effective measures for the mitigation of the negative consequences of climate change. The EU countries em-ploy different environmental support measures and environmental taxes to reduce GHG emissions. There is a shortage of new studies on these measures. The aim of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of the environmental support measures of the EU countries with the effectiveness of environmental taxes in relation to the reduction of GHG emissions. This study is characterized by the broad scope of its data analysis and its systematic approach to the EU’s environmental policy measures. An empirical study was performed for the EU countries with the aim of addressing this research problem and substantiating theoretical insights. A total of 27 EU member states from 2009 to 2018 were selected as research samples. The research is based on a cause-and-effect relationship, where the factors affecting environmental pollution (environmental taxes and subsidies) are the cause, and GHG emissions are the effect. Statistical research methods were used in the empirical study: descriptive statistics, the Shapiro–Wilk test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), simple regression and cluster analysis. The results show that the older member countries of the EU, which had directed the financial measures of environmental policy towards a reduction in energy con-sumption, managed to achieve a greater reduction in GHG emissions compared to the countries which had not applied those measures. The Central and Eastern European countries are characterized by lower environmental taxes and lower expenditure allocated to environmental protection. The countries with a higher GDP per capita have greater GHG emissions that the countries with lower GDP per capita. This is associated with greater consumption, waste, and energy consumption. The study conducted gives rise to a discussion regarding data sufficiency in the assessment and forecasting of GHG emissions and their environmental consequences. © 2021 by the authors.

However, we argue that community projects do so in ‘liminal’ ways—on the threshold of (unactualised) social change. We employed an ethnographic approach involving participant observation and qualitative inter-views to investigate two community climate action projects in Scotland supported by the Climate Challenge Fund (CCF). We identify some of the outcomes and barriers of these projects in relation to promoting wellbeing through work, transport, participation and green spaces for food produc-tion, biodiversity and recreation. Projects’ achievements are contextualised in light of the urgent imperative to tackle climate change and against a background of social inequality. Liminal community projects are structurally constrained in their potential to create wider systemic changes. How-ever, the projects’ potential to promote wellbeing among their participants can intersect with climate change mitigation when systemic and wide‐ranging changes are adopted. These changes must in-volve a meaningful shift towards an economy that centres wellbeing, framed through principles of environmental justice and promoting social equity. © 2021 by the authors.

In response, the Chinese government has introduced the National Sustainable Development Planning of Resource-Based Cities Policy (SDPRP) to address sustainable development issues in resource-based cities. However, few studies have evaluated the environmental effects of the implementation of the SDPRP. Therefore, difference-in-differences (DID) and mediation effect models were applied to investigate the impact of the SDPRP on pollution emission intensity using balanced panel data for 270 prefecture-level cities in China from 2003 to 2018. The statistical results reveal that the SDPRP significantly reduced pollution emission intensity. Robustness test results showed that the conclusions are robust. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of the SDPRP on pollution emission intensity increased year after year. We also found that the SDPRP can reduce pollution emission intensity by facilitating technological innovation, accelerating digital transformation, and improving human capital level, in which the role of human capital is stronger, while the role of digital transformation is weaker. The heterogeneity results suggest that compared with mature resource-based cities, the SDPRP had a stronger inhibitory effect on the pollution emission intensity in declining resource-based cities. However, the impact of the SDPRP on pollution emission intensities in growing resource-based cities was significant, while it was not significant in regenerative resource-based cities. Similarly, the SDPRP had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on pollution emission intensity in megacities than in large cities, while it increased the pollution emission intensity in small-and medium-sized cities. © 2021 by the authors.

The model performance of PRECIS is validated using comparisons with observations and HadGEM2-ES projections, and the bias correction adds fidelity to the projections of basic climate variables and extreme climate events. In the future, our single-realisation estimates show that the number of frost days is projected to decrease and days with tropical nights are projected to increase. Including northeast China, Sichuan Basin, middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River and south China, the number of consecutive dry days will increase from our single-realisation estimates, which will exhibit a spatial distribution almost similar to that of consecutive wet days in the coming decades. Although precipitation indices associated with duration will increase, a simple precipitation index depicting the intensity of extreme events will decrease over east and south China in the future from our single-realisation projections. Daily rainfall above 50 mm, which is usually regarded as a rainstorm event, is predicted to increase under the RCP4.5 scenario over most of China from our single-realisation estimates; while the same change pattern will occur in southernmost China, similarly spatially distributed for the RCP8.5 scenario, the number of rainstorm will first increase in the middle of the twenty-first century and then slow at the end of the twenty-first century in the Yangtze River region. In conclusion, our single-realisation estimates indicate that the persistence of extreme precipitation will increase with time, but the change of extreme precipitation intensity is not significant in the future. The comparison of climatic extreme events under the RCP4.5 scenario with those under the RCP8.5 scenario shows that extreme climate events will be enhanced under the higher emissions scenario; hence, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will help alleviate climate change effects in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; climate prediction; comparative study; extreme event; regional climate; spatial distribution; twenty first century; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105372148

These characteristics uniquely situate it as a potential leader for sea-level rise research. Climate science is already growing, and at the center of the UAE's pivot toward climate research is a burgeoning concern for sea-level rise. Over 85% of the UAE's population and more than 90% of the nation's infrastructure is within a few meters of present-day sea-level. With its low-lying and shallow-sloping geography (about 35 cm per km), this high-value coastline, including the rapidly expanding cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, is particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise. Meanwhile, limited regional research and data scarcity create deep uncertainty for sea-level projections. We set out a potential roadmap for the UAE to capitalize on its strengths to create usable and relevant sea-level projections for the region. With a newly established Climate Change Research Network, the UAE government is beginning to draw together universities and research centers for “furthering effective data collection and management, and advancing policy-relevant research on climate impacts and adaptation1.” By consolidating ideas from the science community within the UAE, we identify promoters and barriers to data gathering, information sharing, science-policy communication, and funding access. Our paper proposes pathways forward for the UAE to integrate sea-level science with coastal development and form best practices that can be scaled across climate science and throughout the region. © Copyright © 2021 Melville-Rea, Eayrs, Anwahi, Burt, Holland, Samara, Paparella, Al Murshidi, Al-Shehhi and Holland.","adaptation; Arabian Gulf; climate change; sea-level rise; United Arab Emirates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112598908

Numerous modelling studies have indicated that alterations at the land surface can result in considerable changes in precipitation. Yet land-cover-induced precipitation changes remain largely unconstrained by observations. Here we use an observation-based continental-scale statistical model to show that forestation of rain-fed agricultural land in Europe triggers substantial changes in precipitation. Locally, we find an increase in precipitation following forestation, in particular in winter, which is supported by a paired rain-gauge analysis. In addition, forests are estimated to increase downwind precipitation in most regions during summer. By contrast, the downwind effect in winter is positive in coastal areas but near neutral and negative in Continental and Northern Europe, respectively. The combined local and non-local effects of a realistic reforestation scenario, constrained by sustainability safeguards, are estimated to increase summer precipitation by 7.6 ± 6.7% on average over Europe (0.13 ± 0.11 mm d–1), potentially offsetting a substantial part of the projected precipitation decrease from climate change. We therefore conclude that land-cover-induced alterations of precipitation should be considered when developing land-management strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"agricultural land; climate change; empirical analysis; energy balance; estimation method; land surface; precipitation (climatology); reforestation; sustainability; Northern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109331832

The Bayesian belief network was constructed with four tiers: 1) exposure, expressed as MAAT, and the state variables of elevation and land cover; 2) sensitivity, expressed as ecosystem conditions relevant to peat carbon mass and its quality for decomposition, peat wetness, and fire; 3) carbon dioxide and methane fluxes and peat combustion; and 4) vulnerability of peat carbon sink strength under warmer MAAT. Simulations were conducted using current (−3.0 to 0.0°C), moderately warmer (0.1–4.0°C), and severely warmer (4.1–9.0°C) climate scenarios. Results from the severely warmer climate scenario projected an overall drying of peat, with approximately 20% reduction in the strong sink categories of net ecosystem exchange and peat carbon sink strength for the severely and, to a lesser degree, the moderately warmer climate scenarios relative to current MAAT. In the warmest temperature simulation, probability of methane emission decreased slightly and the probability of the strong peat carbon sink strength was 27% lower due to peat combustion. Our Bayesian belief network can assist land planners in decision-making for peatland-dominated landscapes, such as identifying high carbon storage areas and those projected to be at greatest risk of carbon loss due to climate change. Such areas may be designated, for example, as protected or reduced management intensity. The Bayesian belief network presented here is built on an in-depth knowledge synthesis to construct conditional probability tables, so is expected to apply to other peatland-dense jurisdictions by changing only elevation, peatland types, and MAAT. © Copyright © 2021 McLaughlin and Packalen.","climate warming; hudson bay lowlands; land use planning; moisture index; peat carbon vulnerability; probabilistic modelling","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Combustion; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Methane; Network security; Peat; Plants (botany); Probability; Wetlands; Carbon storage and fluxes; Conditional probability tables; Decision support tools; Future climate scenarios; Mean annual air temperatures; Net ecosystem exchange; Probabilistic modelling; Temperature simulations; Bayesian networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111925531

In response to decreasing levels of acidic deposition, soils and drainage waters in some regions of North America have become gradually less acidic. Thresholds of atmospheric deposition at which adverse ecological effects are manifested are called critical loads (CLs) and/or target loads (TLs). Target loads are developed based on approaches that account for spatial and temporal aspects of acidification and recovery. Exceedance represents the extent to which current or projected future levels of acidic deposition exceed the level expected to cause ecological harm. We report TLs of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition and the potential for ecosystem recovery of watershed soils and streams in the Adirondack region of New York State, resources that have been less thoroughly investigated than lakes. Regional TLs were calculated by statistical extrapolation of hindcast and forecast simulations of 25 watersheds using the process-based model PnET-BGC coupled with empirical observations of stream hydrology and established sensitivity of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) to soil base saturation and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) to stream acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). Historical impacts and the expected recovery timeline of regional soil and stream chemistry and fish community condition within the Adirondack Park were evaluated. Analysis suggests that many low-order Adirondack streams and associated watershed soils have low TLs (&lt;40 meq/m2/yr of N + S deposition) to achieve specified benchmarks for recovery of soil base saturation or stream ANC. Acid-sensitive headwater and low-order streams and watershed soils in the region are expected to experience continued adverse effects from N and S deposition well into the future even under aggressive emissions reductions. Watershed soils and streams in the western Adirondack Park are particularly vulnerable to acidic deposition and currently in exceedance of TLs. The methods used for linking statistical and process-based models to consider chemical and biological response under varying flow conditions at the regional scale in this study can be applied to other areas of concern. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Acidification; Adirondack park; Brook trout; Nitrogen; Soil; Stream; Sugar maple; Sulfur; Target load","Acidification; Atmospheric chemistry; Biodiversity; Deposition; Forestry; Meteorological problems; Parks; Phosphorus; Recovery; Seebeck effect; Soils; Watersheds; Acidic deposition; Adirondack park; Brook trout; Drainage water; Process-based modeling; Soil base saturation; Soil water; Stream; Sugar maple; Target load; Nitrogen; nitrogen; sulfur; nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; angiosperm; atmospheric deposition; ecological impact; ecosystem response; fish; nitrogen; pollution effect; soil water; streamwater; sulfur; watershed; Acer saccharum; acid deposition; acidification; Article; atmospheric pressure; biological activity; chemical interaction; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental decision making; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental protection; forecasting; geographic distribution; nonhuman; Salvelinus fontinalis; soil analysis; stream (river); United States; water analysis; watershed management; acid rain; animal; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; New York; North America; soil; Adirondack Mountains; Adirondack Park; New York [United States]; United States; Acer saccharum; Salvelinus fontinalis; Acid Rain; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; New York; Nitrogen; North America; Soil; Sulfur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104288204

Emissions inventories were developed for the 2016 base year and a capacity development pathway established by Mexico over a 15-year planning horizon to 2031. Between 2016 and 2031, steep declines in generation from fuel oil-fired thermoelectric, turbogas, and coal plants in favor of a buildout of natural gas combined cycle and clean energy technologies were predicted to drive reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) of 68%, 61%, 13% and 7%, respectively, with an increase in carbon monoxide (CO) of 4%. Retirement of fuel oil-fired thermoelectric and coal generation contributed to substantial reductions in 24 h average PM2.5 concentrations in Mexican and U.S. border states even with rising demand. In contrast, little change in maximum daily average eight-hour ozone concentrations was predicted with expansion of natural gas combined cycle generation, which is a source of NO x and CO.

In the case of predicted climate change, they may act as a significant source of greenhouse gases efflux. A four-year transplantation experiment (transplantation of soil cores of 20 cm in height and 10 cm in diameter to other natural positions) with the peat horizon was arranged to assess the temperature sensitivity of CO2 efflux from palsa peatlands in the north of Western Siberia. The rise in temperature by 7°С caused a positive feedback (30–70%) of CO2 efflux (measured by the closed chamber method) from transplanted soils as compared with the control. Temperature dependence of CO2 efflux from transplanted soils had the highest value (R2 = 0.8) in the first two years as a result of maximum contrast of temperature conditions between sites and decreased in the next two years. On the contrary, the temperature sensitivity of CO2 efflux from transplanted soils showed a high value during most of observations (Q10 = 3–6) thus indicating the increased rate of organic matter mineralization in peat soils of permafrost area for a long (four years) period. Our results might be useful for calibration of regional carbon cycle data sets that consider the contribution of organic permafrost-affected soils. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","climate change; peat; permafrost; Q10; soil respiration","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; mineralization; organic matter; peat soil; peatland; permafrost; soil respiration; temperature effect; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111502383

CO2 concentrations were monitored every 2–4 h from 2006 to 2012 at twelve locations in two Gibraltar caves, New St. Michael's (240–275 m altitude) and Ragged Staff (0–70 m), providing detailed records of spatial distribution and temporal changes responding to transient meteorological conditions and seasonal cycles. Cave atmospheres are dynamic mixtures of external air and CO2-rich ground air containing soil-respired CO2 augmented by CO2 derived from oxidation of organic matter washed down into the vadose fracture porosity. The dominant feature of the cave air records is seasonal alternation between high and low CO2 states caused by reversals in ventilation and ground air advection into or away from the caves. The high and low pCO2 states are tightly coupled between the two caves in an antiphase relationship, with rapid switching in response to temperature-controlled density differences between external air and isothermal ground air at mean annual surface temperature (18 °C). The diurnal temperature cycle modulates this pattern, producing four ventilation-advection modes. Summer and winter modes occur when diurnal temperatures are respectively entirely above or below the core temperature of the Rock. During transitional modes the core temperature lies within the diurnal range and pCO2 fluctuates rapidly as the flow of low-CO2 external air through cave entrances alters in response. Strong easterly winds reduce CO2 concentrations in ground air entering the caves and progressively lower cave air CO2. The effects of the CO2 regime on δ13C in speleothem are restricted to variations of 2–3‰, suggesting that larger changes of up to 6‰ across major climatic transitions probably reflect changes in production, transport and oxidation rate of organic matter in the vadose zone. Direct observations of these processes would improve future understanding of the climatic significance of δ13C records in speleothems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cave air CO2; Climate transitions; Ground air CO2; Speleothem proxies; Ventilation-advection; Wind","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Caves; Groundwater; Organic compounds; Ventilation; $+13$/C; Cave air CO2; Climate transition; CO$-2$/ concentration; Core temperature; External control; Gibraltars; Ground air CO2; Speleothem proxy; Ventilation-advection; Advection; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; organic matter; advection; cave; cave system; seasonal variation; speleothem; ventilation; wind-driven circulation; advection; air conditioning; air temperature; altitude; Article; cave; chemical analysis; chemical interaction; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; core temperature; environmental temperature; Gibraltar; isotherm; meteorological phenomena; oxidation; porosity; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil; spatial analysis; summer; surface property; temporal analysis; wind; winter; Gibraltar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102117218

Therefore, a field experiment was conducted in an arid region of Saudi Arabia to evaluate the effects of two drip irrigation systems [surface (DI) and subsurface (SDI)] and three irrigation levels [100%, 70%, and 50% of crop evapotranspiration (I100, I70, and I50, respectively)] on the growth traits, tuber yield, and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. θv was 13.74 and 23.85% lower under the DI system and 11.90 and 24.14% lower under the SDI system with the I70 and I50 treatments, respectively, than with the I100 treatment, and was also lower under the DI system than under the SDI system. The fresh and dry vegetative parts of the plants were heavier with the I100 treatment under the SDI system than with the I70 and I50 treatments under the DI system, and the leaf area indexes were also significantly lower with I70 and I50 than with I100 but were not affected by the irrigation system. The fresh and dry tuber yields were lowest with the I50 treatment (23.97 and 3.93 Mg ha−1, respectively), followed by I70 (28.61 and 4.98 Mg ha−1, respectively), and I100 (34.43 and 6.67 Mg ha−1, respectively) and were higher under the SDI system than under the DI system. By contrast, IWUE was highest with the I50 treatment (6.49 and 7.02 kg m−3) and lowest with the I100 treatment (5.62 and 5.85 kg m−3) under the DI and SDI systems, respectively. These findings indicate that full irrigation (I100) with the SDI system maximizes potato yield but decreases IWUE, whereas integration of the SDI system with deficit irrigation is effective in improving water productivity due to less water being consumed, allowing these practices to be used under scarce water conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",,"Agricultural robots; Climate change; Crops; Efficiency; Plants (botany); Water management; Water supply; Agricultural water; Crop evapotranspiration; Deficit irrigation; Drip irrigation systems; Irrigation systems; Irrigation water use efficiency; Subsurface drip irrigation; Water productivity; Subirrigation; arid region; climate change; drip irrigation; evapotranspiration; growing season; irrigation system; leaf area index; potato; water use efficiency; Saudi Arabia; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099104792

The adoption of such policies is dictated by climate change, and by the will to reduce GHG emissions and increase the use of energy from renewable sources. Among all the different air conditioning systems, the split systems represent most Room Air Conditioners (RAC) units installed in Europe. Their integration with the buildings of historical centres is not successful due to the sound emissions of external units and their visual impact on buildings' facades. The acoustic and the visual impact are evaluated separately, by comparing the results of outdoor noise prediction models with noise limits levels at receivers or using local regulations. A virtual reality environment has been prepared to carry out a laboratory experiment to understand better how Air Conditioning (AC) split units affect the residents' overall perceptions. This paper investigates the combined (auditory and visual) impacts of installing external units of split systems on historical buildings' facades.

Main conclusions suggest that visual elements more integrated on the façade of the historical building can help reduce the auditory and the visual impact of these elements. Moreover, well-integrated and pleasant elements led to a lower auditory perception of the loudness and noise annoyance than less integrated elements. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air conditioning noise; Audio-Visual impact; Building integration; Noise annoyance","Air conditioning; Audition; Buildings; Climate change; Cooling systems; Greenhouse gases; Noise pollution; Predictive analytics; Auditory perception; Awareness campaigns; Energy from renewable sources; Historical buildings; Laboratory experiments; Perceptual attributes; Room air conditioners; Virtual-reality environment; Acoustic noise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101552580

It first describes the context and diversity of infrastructure needs and investments in the MENA Region and discusses the challenges in meeting these needs with traditional financing models, especially public private partnerships (PPPs). The chapter then makes the case for maximizing financing for climate resilient infrastructure by using blockchain technology, which can address, among others, the barriers and challenges of PPP financing and improve its use and reach. Finally, the chapter concludes that the high infrastructure climate resilient investment gap in the MENA Region can be addressed by focusing on attracting and using investments in a smart and conducive framework, using blockchain technology as a technological and financial enabler for addressing some of the bottlenecks of old financing partnerships such as the PPPs. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

When selecting the type of possible intervention to be applied, the choice falls between two alternatives: simple unsustainable ordinary maintenance versus ecological retrofitting i.e., an increase in the quality of the indoor environment and building energy saving using local bio-natural materials and products. The present research seeks to respond to the requests of recent comprehen-sive reviews which ask for the retrofitting of the world’s huge existing building stocks and portfolios by proposing an approach and testing it in a specific case study (at the unit, building and urban block level) which can then be carried out and repeated in the future on a larger urban scale. The real-world experimentation in the provided case study achieved the important outcome and goal of a Green Building strategy and post-carbon city framework i.e. the significant enhancement of the thermal performance of the buildings as a result of a few targeted key external works and the con-sequent saving of energy in those already existing (but not preserved and not included in the state national register or record of monuments) Liberty-style constructions. All the above show that these important existing buildings can be ecologically retrofitted at an affordable cost, although initially slightly more expensive than the cost of ordinary unsustainable maintenance. However, this difference is offset by the favorable pay-back period, which is fast, acceptable and of short duration. The tried and tested approach, the positive proposed case study and the experimental database-GIS joint platform (the details of which can be found in an additional supplementary research which is currently being carried out) are the bases on which a future decision support system will be proposed. This support system can be carried out as a tailor-made solution for the ecological retrofitting of the enormous existing building stocks and portfolios which must be considered on a larger scale i.e., at ward, quartier, city, regional and country level. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper simulates the main last mile distribution models that can be adopted in a mega-city such as Madrid. In particular, the impact of carrying out the full load of the last mile distribution by means of electric vehicles is analyzed. Two fundamental aspects are studied, the efficiency of the different routes developed by each transport vehicle and the impact that these routes have in the electrical distribution network. For this purpose, an intelligent route planner, capable of optimizing the distribution of the load among the number of vehicles available in each postal service hub (PSH), is combined with a Reference Network Model that designs and expands the distribution network to supply consumers and electric vehicles. Several scenarios in terms of location and segmentation of postal service hubs are analyzed. From this analysis, it is concluded that reinforcements on the distribution network are avoided if the operation is decentralized (using fourteen PSHs), since a centralized operation (a single PSH) would require longer routes with higher energy consumption. Moreover, decentralized operation would enhance the emissions reduction achieved by electrifying the fleet, since the estimated absolute emissions of the electrified fleet for a decentralized scenario are up to 50% lower compared to a centralized one. Finally, the results reveal that smart charging strategies also contribute to lessen the incremental costs in the distribution network, in addition to significantly reducing the cost of energy supply. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle charging; Last mile distribution; Power distribution networks; Vehicle routing problem","Electric automobiles; Electric network parameters; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Freight transportation; Postal services; Transportation routes; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Centralized operations; Distribution models; Electrical distribution networks; Emissions reduction; Number of vehicles; Transport vehicles; Urban distribution; Vehicle technology; Electric load distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101358891

Global change (i.e., changing climate and increasing human impact) is currently influencing scavenger communities. Thus, understanding what promotes species richness in scavenger communities can help prioritize management actions. Using a long-term dataset from camera traps deployed with animal carcasses as bait along a 1881 km latitudinal gradient in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern USA, we investigated the relative impact of climate and humans on the species richness and diversity of vertebrate scavengers. Our most supported models for both mammalian and avian scavengers included climatic, but not human, variables. The richness of mammalian and avian scavengers detected was highest during relatively warm (5–10°C) and dry (100–150 mm precipitation) winters, when food was likely limited and both reliance on and detection of carrion was high. The diversity of mammalian and avian scavengers detected was highest under drier conditions. We then used these results to project the future species richness of scavengers that would be detected within our sampling area and under the climate scenario of 2070 (emissions level RCP8.5). Our predictions suggest up to 80% and 67% reductions, respectively, in the richness of avian and mammalian scavengers that would be detected at baited sites. Climate-induced shifts in behavior (i.e., reduction in scavenging, even if present) at this scale could have cascading implications for ecosystem function, resilience, and human health. Further, our study highlights the importance of conducting studies of scavenger community dynamics within ecosystems across wide spatial gradients within temperate environments. More broadly, these findings build upon our understanding of the impacts of climate-induced adjustments in behavior that can likely have negative impacts on systems at a large scale. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

For decades, claims of mistrust and distrust have dominated climate change policy arenas: doubts about climate change science and disagreements over rights and responsibilities related to mitigation, adaptation, loss, and damages undermine trust, impeding progress toward effective global climate action. And although frequently invoked in explanations of weak or failed climate action, there is limited research exploring the role of trust as a distinct concept in global climate governance. Here we seek to address this gap by developing a relational framework that focuses attention on how trust dynamics shape cooperation in four types of relationships: reliance, reciprocity, responsibility, and recognition. Applying this framework to the UNFCCC, we consider how efforts like expanded participation impact the relational landscape in global climate governance. We focus in particular on Indigenous Peoples and non-state actors to demonstrate how the UNFCCC's efforts to address its legitimacy and credibility problems have neither adequately considered trust nor created opportunities to develop the transformative relationships needed for more effective climate governance. We suggest that greater attention to trust can help scholars and practitioners better understand how relational phenomena shape the landscape of governance possibilities.

The restrictions on working activities, journeys and relationships imposed by the lockdown have had important consequences, including for environmental quality. This review aims to provide a structured and critical evaluation of the recent scientific bibliography that analyzed and described the impact of lockdown on human activities and on air quality. The results indicate an important effect of the lockdown during the first few months of 2020 on air pollution levels, compared to previous periods. The concentrations of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide have decreased. Tropospheric ozone, on the other hand, has significantly increased. These results are important indicators that can become decision drivers for future policies and strategies in industrial and logistics activities (including the mobility sector) aimed at their environmental sustainability. The scenario imposed by COVID-19 has supported the understanding of the link between the reduction of polluting emissions and the state of air quality and will be able to support strategic choices for the future sustainable growth of the industrial and logistics sector. © 2021 The Authors.

In turn, efforts should be devoted to reducing emitted GHGs from this sector, and many such opportunities lie in the road transport life cycle. This paper investigated fourteen emission reduction scenarios based on the green initiatives issued by the Abu Dhabi Government. The explored measures are either related to road works and road municipal services or to traffic movement. The proposed measures were evaluated with reference to a baseline study previously reported by the authors for three different road projects in Abu Dhabi city. Findings reveal that normalized GHG emission reduction could be significantly reduced by (i) replacing 30% of internal combustion engine passenger cars with battery electric vehicles where the power demand is covered almost equally from nuclear and liquified natural gas (LNG) sources, (ii) reducing the number of passenger cars by 10%, and (iii) having one-fifth of passenger cars powered by LNG. A lesser significant reduction could be achieved by replacing conventional lamps with light-emitting diode (LED) lamps or by having one-fourth of lighting powered by solar energy. Even lesser reduction could be achieved by (i) replacing a portion of Portland cement with ground granulated blast furnace slag in concrete structures, (ii) fully utilizing treated sewage effluent for roadside-plant irrigation, (iii) reducing desalinated water used for roadside-plant irrigation by 20%, and (iv) increasing the number of higher efficiency passenger cars by 10%. Replacing hot-mix asphalt with warm-mix asphalt and using asphalt with a high stiffness modulus in the base layer results in low emission reduction. The use of 15% recycled asphalt or the use of 50% recycled aggregate in road construction has the least impact on emission reduction. When all explored scenarios were combined, an overall normalized GHG emissions reduction of 9–17% during the road project life cycle could be achieved. © 2021 by the authors.

The method for choosing an appropriate threshold in peaks-over threshold approach is also another problem of endless debate. In this era of climate change and global warming, extreme temperatures accompanied by heat waves and cold waves pose serious economic and health challenges particularly in small economies or developing countries like South Africa. The present study attempts to address these problems, in particular, to deal with and capture dependencies in extreme values of two variables, by applying bivariate conditional extremes modelling with a time-varying threshold to Limpopo province’s monthly maximum temperature series. Limpopo and North West provinces are the two hottest provinces in South Africa characterised by heat waves and the present study is carried out in the Limpopo province at Mara, Messina, Polokwane and Thabazimbi meteorological stations for the period 1994–2009. With the aim to model extremal dependence of maximum temperature at these four meteorological stations, two modelling approaches are applied: bivariate conditional extremes model and time-varying threshold. The latter approach was used to capture the climate change effects in the data. The main contribution of this paper is in combining these two approaches in bivariate extremal dependence modelling of maximum temperature extremes in the Limpopo province of South Africa. The findings of the study revealed both significant positive and negative extremal dependence in some pairs of meteorological stations. Among the major findings were the significant strong positive extremal dependence of Thabazimbi on high-temperature values at Mara and the strong negative extremal dependence of Polokwane on high-temperature values at Messina. The findings of this study play an important role in revealing information useful to meteorologists, climatologists, agriculturalists, and planners in the energy sector among others. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Bivariate extreme modelling; Climate change; Conditional extremes model; Laplace margins; Temperature extremes; Time-varying threshold","climate change; extreme event; global warming; high temperature; Laplace transform; numerical model; temperature anomaly; Limpopo; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100794236

Four hydrocarbons within the typical size of major components in RP-3, i.e., n-dodecane, iso-dodecane (2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane), decalin and n-butylbenzene, were included in the component palette to improve the ability of the surrogate to mimic the properties related to the molecular weight. Seven properties, cetane number, molecular weight, H/C ratio, threshold sooting index, lower heating value, the proportion of -CH3 and -CH2 in the total carbons were selected as targets aiming at the comprehensive emulation of the chemical and physical propensities of RP-3. By sequential use of the genetic algorithm and a local search method, a surrogate containing 27.44% n-dodecane, 28.81% iso-dodecane, 26.12% decalin and 17.63% n-butylbenzene by mole was formulated. The autoignition delay times of the surrogate were measured using a heated rapid compression machine at pressures of 10, 15, 20 bar and equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 over low-to-intermediate temperature range. Results show that the surrogate can not only emulate the target properties but also the key non-targeted properties. A kinetic model of 3065 species and 11,898 reactions was then developed based on the proposed surrogate to describe the chemical process during the combustion of RP-3. Simulations show that the model can predict the fundamental combustion datasets in the present work and literature satisfactorily, suggesting the rationality and applicability of the model. Rate of production and evolution histories of OH and HO2 were then conducted using the kinetic model to provide insight into the combustion of RP-3. Analysis suggests that negative temperature coefficient behavior also exists in the first stage ignition. © 2021 The Combustion Institute","Detailed kinetic mechanism; Heated rapid compression machine; Ignition delay time; RP-3 kerosene; Surrogate fuel","Calorific value; Genetic algorithms; Jet fuel; Kerosene; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Molecular weight; Temperature; Aviation fuel; Detailed kinetic mechanisms; Dodecane; Heated rapid compression machine; Ignition delay time; Kinetic models; N -dodecane; Property; RP-3 kerosene; Surrogate fuels; Ignition; ascorbic acid; carbon; decalin; dodecane; fuel; hydrocarbon; iso dodecane (2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane); n butylbenzene; unclassified drug; army; Article; aviation; chemical reaction kinetics; China; combustion; compression; genetic algorithm; heating; molecular weight; pressure; priority journal; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102574291

These impacts are expected to worsen, as climatic conditions become hotter and drier. This study estimates the impacts of climate change on the agriculture sector and household welfare in Mozambique using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. Specifically, the study investigates the impact of climate change on agricultural production, looking at implications for various crops and regions in the country. It also reports climate change impacts on both urban and rural household welfare. A probabilistic approach considering a distribution of climate shocks under two global mitigation futures (i.e. unconstrained emissions and level 1 stabilization) is used to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the economy, providing a range for the potential impact of climate change and the uncertainties related to it. Climate impacts are considered through five key channels: agriculture, roads, hydropower, sea-level rise and cyclones. The analysis shows that acute negative impacts are experienced in the agricultural sector, particularly for maize and cassava as crop yields decrease. Successful global mitigation efforts of reducing CO2 concentration to 560 ppm by 2100 (L1S) decreases the degree of uncertainty of the impact of climate change on the Mozambican economy, as the GDP is expected to increase up to USD 6.0 billion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture sector; Climate change; DCGE model; Household welfare; Mozambique","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Crops; Disasters; Probability distributions; Sea level; Storms; Agricultural productions; Agricultural sector; Climate change impact; Climatic conditions; Degree of uncertainty; Dynamic computable general equilibrium models; Geographical locations; Probabilistic approaches; Climate change; agroindustry; carbon dioxide; cassava; climate change; climate effect; computable general equilibrium analysis; crop plant; Gross Domestic Product; maize; Mozambique; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109607759

Considering most of the tourism practices are based on outdoor activities in cities such as Antalya, it is of great importance to determine bioclimatic comfort level as well as the attitudes of people toward climate change who live in those conditions to be able to take proper precautions in terms of tourism and urban planning. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to reveal the bioclimatic comfort conditions of Antalya city center, and a comprehensive questionnaire was conducted with the people living in the area questioning the opinions on reasons and consequences of climate change, perceivable effects of climate change in Antalya, and suggestions to prevent or reduce the adverse effects. The areas with appropriate bioclimatic comfort conditions were determined and mapped via geographical information systems using temperature and relative humidity data of the years between 1960 and 2018. The data gathered via questionnaires were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, regression, correlation, and structural equation modelling via SPSS and AMOS software. According to the results, it was determined that in some parts of city center the bioclimatic comfort conditions decreased to levels that could reach harmful dimensions for human health and the analysis of the questionnaires revealed that people living in that area state that the effects of climate change are perceivable as the precipitation seasons have become irregular. According to the participants, it was determined that a 1-unit increase in environmental measures causes a decrease of 0.136 units in disasters (R2 = 1.1%). In comparison, 1-unit increase of Administrative Precautions will cause 0.030 units decrease in effects of climate change on vital needs (R2 = 1.4%).

Breeding for new soybean varieties with efficient root systems has tremendous potential in enhancing resource use efficiency and plant adaptation for challenging climates. In this study, root related traits were analyzed in a panel of 260 spring soybean with genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genotyping was done with specific locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), and five GWAS models (GLM, MLM, CMLM, FaST-LMM, and EMMAX) were used for analysis. A total of 179,960 highly consistent SNP markers distributed over the entire genome with an inter-marker distance of 2.36 kb was used for GWAS analysis. Overall, 27 significant SNPs with a phenotypic contribution ranging from 20 to 72% and distributed on chromosomes 2, 6, 8, 9, 13, 16 and 18 were identified and two of them were found to be associated with multiple root-related traits. Based on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) distance of 9.5 kb for the different chromosomes, 11 root and shoot regulating genes were detected based on LD region of a maximum 55-bp and phenotypic contribution greater than 22%. Expression analysis revealed an association between expression levels of those genes and the degree of root branching number. The current study provides new insights into the genetic architecture of soybean roots, and the underlying SNPs/genes could be critical for future breeding of high-efficient root system in soybean. © Copyright © 2021 Mandozai, Moussa, Zhang, Qu, Du, Anwari, Al Amin and Wang.","genes; GWAS; qRT-PCR; root and shoot related traits; SLAF-seq; SNPs; soybean",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112279155

Understanding the mechanisms underlying sustained stimulation of bacterial activity remains a key challenge for optimizing bioremediation - particularly in northern regions. Positron emission tomography (PET) can trace microbial activity within the naturally occurring soil structure of intact soils. Here, we use PET to test two hypotheses: (1) optimizing phosphate bioavailability in soil will outperform a generic biostimulatory solution in promoting hydrocarbon remediation and (2) oligotrophic biostimulation will be more effective than eutrophic approaches. In so doing, we highlight the key bacterial taxa that underlie aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation in subarctic soils. In particular, we showed that (i) optimized phosphate bioavailability outperformed generic biostimulatory solutions in promoting hydrocarbon degradation, (ii) oligotrophic biostimulation is more effective than eutrophic approaches, and (iii) optimized biostimulatory solutions stimulated specific soil regions and bacterial consortia. The knowledge gleaned from this study will be crucial in developing field-scale biodegradation treatments for sustained stimulation of bacterial activity in northern regions. © 2021 The Authors.

These activities deteriorate the quality of the environment and raise the level of particulate matter (PM2.5). The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of economic capabilities and population agglomeration on PM2.5 emissions for the sample of 23 sub-Saharan African countries—a highly polluted region of the world. The study used panel regression from 2007 to 2015 and found that production capabilities are highly significant and directly effecting PM2.5 emissions. The Kuznets hypothesis does not hold in this region, and the concentration of population in urban areas is also significant. To avoid the problem of possible endogeneity in the empirical model and for robustness check, the study also utilized system GMM and found consistent results. The findings of the study are highly valuable to reduce PM2.5 and propose that the policymakers in Sub-Saharan African countries should opt for industrial specialization rather than economic complexity and ensure that the proper measures are taken to control PM2.5. Moreover, population concentrations should not be taken place in a few main urban cities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Economic capacity; Kuznets hypothesis; PM2.5 emission; Population agglomeration","agglomeration; economic conditions; emission; environmental economics; Kuznets curve; particulate matter; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; Sub-Saharan Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Africa South of the Sahara; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091513802

The emission is scattered in both the Crab Nebula and the interstellar medium, causing multipath propagation and thus scintillation. We study the scintillation of the Crab's giant pulses using phased Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope data at 1668 MHz. We find that giant pulse spectra correlate at only ∼2%, much lower than the one-third correlation expected from a randomized signal imparted with the same impulse response function. In addition, we find that the main pulse and the interpulse appear to scintillate differently; the 2D cross-correlation of scintillation between the interpulse and main pulse has a lower amplitude and is wider in time and frequency delay than the 2D autocorrelation of the main pulses. These lines of evidence suggest that the giant pulse emission regions are extended, and that the main pulse and interpulse arise in physically distinct regions that are resolved by the scattering screen. Assuming the scattering takes place in the nebular filaments, the emission regions are of order a light-cylinder radius, as projected on the sky. With further very long baseline interferometry and multifrequency data, it may be possible to measure the distance to the scattering screens, the size of giant pulse emission regions, and the physical separation between the pulse components. © 2021.

To better design such structures, the effects of climate events must be well understood, and the conventional design procedures must be improved by incorporating the knowledge of climatology in geotechnical engineering. In this study, a new climate-adaptive design method is developed to investigate the impact of extreme climate events on the safety and serviceability performances of embedded footing through incorporating the site-specific hydrological loads such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and water table depth to geotechnical parameters. The proposed method was applied to two arid climate sites in the United States, Austin, TX, and Albuquerque, NM. The site-specific extreme hydrological cycle was determined based on historical records. The mathematical model was solved for temporal and spatial variations of the degree of saturation and matric suction considering the hydrological loads as the upper and lower boundary conditions, respectively. The results showed that the worst performance (higher elastic settlement and lower ultimate bearing capacity) was observed during the period when the degree of saturation in the influence zone was the highest.

This paper provides a review of the current state of EE research by mapping the research landscape in business and economics to understand the socioeconomic dimensions within these research areas. To identify key information, we examine the trends and characteristics of 2935 relevant scientific publications over a 30-year period from 1990 to 2019 in the Social Science Citation Index of the Web of Science database using bibliometric analysis with a R language package called ‘bibliometrix’. Our analysis shows an increasing trend in publications from 2006 onwards; the period remarkably coincides with the implementation phase of the Kyoto protocol in 2005. Accordingly, we observe that EE research has a strong association with issues like CO2 emissions, climate change, sustainability, and the growing importance of these issues in recent years. Thus, our findings provide crucial understandings by incorporating a wide array of scientific outputs in response to calls for greater theoretical clarification of EE research. These findings provide insights into the current state of the art of, and identify crucial areas for future, research. Hence, our research assists in formulating environmentally sustainable policies to tackle the adverse effects of CO2 emissions and related climate change through providing critical grasps on the scholarly development related to EE. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bibliometric analysis; Carbon emissions; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy Policy; Energy sustainability","bibliography; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; database; energy efficiency; Kyoto Protocol; mapping method; sustainability; bibliometrics; climate change; commercial phenomena; energy conservation; publication; Bibliometrics; Climate Change; Commerce; Conservation of Energy Resources; Publications",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106260149

The accumulated geodynamic potential acts on the living conditions of humans through its manifestation and development (evolution) in the natural environment with stress relief in the geophysical fields of the Earth. This works evaluates the level of geodynamic potential of the blocks in the northeastern segment of eastern Caucasus located in the arid climate zone in order to make recommendations for appropriate services that prevent harsh geoecological consequences. Paleoseismogeological and structural-tectonic methods with respect to the geodynamic potential of the regional blocks and analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of seismicity during the instrumental observation period are the main methods of study. Analysis of the study results shows that the region has the Earth’s crust blocks with a critical level of geodynamic potential. A pattern for potential zones of potential earthquake sources and regional blocks with critical geodynamic potential is constructed. The geodynamic potential of the blocks in the northeastern segment of the eastern Caucasus is assessed under the conditions of steppification of terrestrial ecosystems and its geoecologocal significance is shown. The potential zones of expectation of potential sources of strong earthquakes, which may negatively affect ecological safety in the region, are identified.

A HSR is proposed in this paper as a useful tool to conceptualize major changes in social thinking, at the interface of individual and collective dynamics. A HSR is defined as the crystallization of a meaning-complex on what is valuable and vital for a community, generating competing for social identities, practices, and social policies. The paper revisits the concept initiated by Moscovici and focuses on the role of competing groups, generating opposing perspectives. We argue that at this crucial point, close attention to the way in which meaning is negotiated across a series of key elements of the HSR of survival will help better informing communication and action concerning climate change. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.","climate change; COVID-19; environment; psychology; social representations",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110628373

There is no information on the fertilization with coated urea in the cultivation of cactus pear under rainfed conditions in the savannah region. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the forage potential of Nopalea cochenillifera variety Doce in yellow latosol under rainfed conditions in the Brazilian savannah, comparing the fertilization with urea and coated urea in different levels. A randomized block design was adopted, in a 2 × 4 × 2 factorial scheme, with the factors corresponding to two sources of nitrogen (urea and urea coated with polymers, N+), four levels of nitrogen (0, 60, 120 and 240 kg/ha/year) and two harvests (year I and year II). The plants were evaluated after 1 year of growth, in each year of evaluation, regarding the characteristics of growth, production, chemical and mineral composition and nutritional value. The level of 240 kg/ha provided higher emission of cladodes per plant (17.33 and 18.17), respectively, for N+ and urea. The highest nitrogen use efficiency was found in the level of 60 kg N/ha (142 kg/ha/year). NFC values were 3.5 g/kg dry matter (DM) higher when the cactus pear was fertilized with urea in year I and 5.4 g/kg DM in year II. The use of conventional urea promoted better results of agronomic and nutritional characteristics of the cactus pear, under rainfed regime, when compared to the use of urea coated with polymers.

However, climate variability and its impacts are affecting fishers, their communities, and fishing grounds. This study aimed to determine the perceived impacts of climate change and vulnerability of small-scale fisheries in selected fishing communities around the Davao Gulf. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to gather data on the perceptions of fishers (N = 220) on the impacts of climate change on their livelihood and communities. Seven focus groups corroborated the collected data and conclusions reached (N = 15). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the sources of vulnerability and number of impacts of climate change. Regression was used to determine factors influencing the catch per unit effort (CPUE). The PCA results showed that for the vulnerability, the sources, coral bleaching, inadequate food, lack of credit access, changes in weather pattern and hotter temperature contributed highly. For the climate change impacts, the factors, less seasonality, unclear reproductive patterns, diseases in the catch, invasive species, decrease in catch and venturing farther to fish offshore were substantially influential. Further analysis showed that disease and invasive species, decrease in fish catch, fishing farther offshore, and monthly income affected the CPUE of the fisheries. Recommendations for climate change vulnerability reduction based on the conclusions reached in this study include more financial credit access, apprehension of illegal fishers, increased capacity building and technical skills for coastal communities, supplemental livelihoods, and information dissemination on climate change adaptation strategies. © Copyright © 2021 Macusi, Camaso, Barboza and Macusi.","adaptation; climate change impacts; Davao Gulf; Mindanao; Philippines; small-scale fisheries; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110747354

The transport sector is responsible for a large share of energy consumption and GHGs emissions while contributing to the increase in air pollution. Although new technologies are available, the use of diesel in road transport is still predominant. These new technologies, nonetheless, still present inconsistencies in their environment, economic performances and do not necessarily provide improvements when considering the entire fuel life cycle used in medium and heavy-duty trucks. This systematic review addresses the uncertainties in life cycle studies regarding the road transport sector fuel consumption, GHGs, and air pollutant emissions economic analyses. Results show that there are higher chances of reducing GHGs emissions through biogas or fuel-cell hydrogen trucks, while PM2.5 and NOx emissions have higher chances of being reduced with fuel-cell hydrogen or natural gas trucks. There is, however, a reduced interest by the scientific community in the transport literature in dealing with air pollutants, and the focus is mainly on GHGs emissions. When it comes to economic viability, natural gas and hybrid trucks are the best substitutes.

This proposed model can help maritime regulators, such as those who work in maritime departments, to trade-off shipping costs for the minimization of CO2 and SOx emissions by selecting appropriate routes and speeds. The total costs are the sum of the fuel costs, fixed time costs, and cargo inventory costs. The difference between the significance of SOx emissions inside and outside ECAs was considered. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) was used to obtain the Pareto-optimal set of the multi-objective optimization model and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to find the trade-off solution from the Pareto-optimal set. The model was applied for a case study of a service route from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada to Brunswick, Georgia, United States. Compared to an actual scenario without any optimization, the results show that the model can simultaneously reduce a ship's total costs and emissions, as well as avoid increase in the total costs that accompany increase in fuel prices. Moreover, the model can provide different optimal routes and speeds for different levels of ship emissions (CO2 and total SOx inside ECAs). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Maritime transportation; Multi-objective optimization; Route and speed optimization; Ship emissions","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Genetic algorithms; Pareto principle; Ships; Speed; Transportation routes; Waterway transportation; Maritime transportation; Minimisation; Multi-objective optimization models; Multi-objectives optimization; Pareto-optimal sets; Route optimization; Routings; Ship emissions; Shipping cost; Speed optimization; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105319127

Freshwater mussels are particularly sensitive to this threat, because of their sedentary nature and limited mobility as juveniles or adults. The freshwater mussel Westralunio carteri, which is endemic to south-western Australia, has undergone a 49% reduction in range in the last 50 years, and a drying climate presents substantial extinction risk, as highlighted by two recent cases of mass mortality. Experimental studies found that mussels respond to water emersion by first tracking receding water levels, then burrowing. The amount of horizontal movement by mussels was not affected by size, but smaller mussels initiated burrowing sooner and were also more likely to be predated if they remained on the surface. Burrowing and shading both significantly reduced mortality rate and increased survival time when mussels were exposed to drying; when shaded or allowed to burrow, mussels could survive at least 62 days out of water. Predicted future reductions in streamflow are likely to increase the mortality rate in W. carteri, but it may be possible to partially avert the adverse effects of drying rivers by increasing riparian shading. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Drought; Extinction; Mass mortality; Westralunio carteri","arid region; biodiversity; bivalve; burrowing; climate change; endangered species; endemic species; extinction risk; home range; mass mortality; mobility; movement; semiarid region; streamflow; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084128001

It was found that under the influence of airborne pollution in the first place the moss–lichen layer is destroyed with elimination of sensitive species of mosses and lichens; the structure of biomass changes and both the total stock of aboveground biomass and stocks of individual components decrease. The results of studying the elemental composition of dominant species of plants (Vaccinium myrtillus L., V. vitis-idaea L., V. uliginosum L., Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup), mosses (Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt.) and lichens (Cladonia stellaris (Opiz) Pouza et Vĕzda) of northern taiga forests revealed an imbalance in their mineral nutrition. Using metabolomic analysis, the macroprofile of the component composition of the secondary metabolites in the leaves of 3 species of the Vaccinium genus was characterized, the specificity of the composition of metabolites in each studied species was revealed. Despite the reduction in atmospheric emissions by Severonickel Combine, the restoration of the ground cover in pine forests is inhibited (buffer zone) or it cannot even begin (impact zone) due to the high level of soil contamination with heavy metals. The mineral nutrition of higher plants, mosses and lichens is disturbed: as one approaches the source of pollution, the accumulation of heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Co, Fe) increases; their ratio changes; the content of micro- (Mn) and essential macroelements (Ca, Mg) decreases in the leaves of the dwarf shrubs and the moss. The changes in the metabolite profiles of the leaves of the genus Vaccinium are due to both the plant species and the level of airborne pollution. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","airborne technogenic pollution; biomass; Cladonia stellaris; Empetrum hermaphroditum; heavy metals; Kola Peninsula; metabolic profiling; mineral composition; northern pine forests; Pleurozium schreberi; Vaccinium genus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110672863

However, the influence of warming, increased precipitation and their interaction on plant functional traits in the desert steppe are unclear. Therefore, after simulating warming (ambient temperature, warming 2℃ and warming 4℃) and increasing precipitation (natural precipitation, precipitation increased by 25% and 50%) for 6 years, we measured the morphological characteristics, photosynthesis parameters, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents of leaves of Stipa breviflora Griseb.

Results showed that both warming and increased precipitation reduced the importance value (IV) of S. breviflora, while the IV of annual herbs significantly increased (P < 0.05). Warming, increased precipitation and their interactions all improve the adaptability of S. breviflora functional traits and have a positive impact on its IV, which indicates that climate change is beneficial to the growth of S. breviflora. However, a structural equation model based on ANOVA analysis and correlation analysis showed that a sharp decrease in the density of S. breviflora due to warming was the main reason for decreasing its IV in our study (P < 0.05). Warming promotes intensified competition among species, and annual herbs have an advantage in the competition. Therefore, our research reveals the succession strategy of S. breviflora and provides a theoretical basis for studying the response mechanisms of desert steppe plant communities to climate change. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Desert steppe; Importance value; Plant functional traits; Stipa breviflora","Climate models; Ecosystems; Landforms; Plants (botany); Desert steppe; Functional traits; Grassland ecosystems; Importance value; Plant communities; Plant functional trait; Service functions; Stability function; Stipa breviflora; Temperate desert steppes; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; future prospect; grass; grassland; plant community; steppe; temperate environment; Stipa breviflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104302430

This article empirically investigated the impact of the ETS on firm behaviors and competitiveness (i.e., cost competitiveness and green competitiveness) by surveying all power firms in the GD ETS. Low-carbon management, carbon asset transactions, and energy saving and emission reduction technology were identified as firm behaviors. The relationships among the ETS, firm behaviors, and firm competitiveness were tested by using bootstrap multiple mediation analyses. The results showed that the GD ETS has a positive impact on firm behaviors. The three examined firm behaviors actually reflect the depth of firm participation in the ETS. The more the firm participates, the greater the mediating effects that the firm behaviors exert on firm competitiveness are. Both carbon asset transactions and energy saving and emission reduction technology have a mediating effect on the relationship between the GD ETS and cost competitiveness, while only the latter mediates the relationship between the GD ETS and green competitiveness.

However, seedlings planted early in the summer are not dormant and experience active growth, which makes them vulnerable to planting stress. The artificial reduction of the photoperiod in the nursery is used to harden seedlings of boreal and alpine tree species for summer planting. Little, however, is known about the effect of artificial reduction of photoperiod with respect to summer planting in temperate monsoon climate tree species. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of length and timing of photoperiod reduction on seedling morphology and physiology attributes in the nursery and on the field performance of Pinus tabuliformis. We applied four photoperiod treatments (6 h, 8 h, 10 h, control) in the nursery on four dates in the summer (June 23, July 3, July 13, and July 23). The nursery and field site were located near Beijing, Northern China. We measured seedling morphology and non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen concentrations in the nursery and in the field. Additionally, we measured field mortality and plant growth for three years. The reduction of the photoperiod did not have any effect on bud set, but it reduced seedling growth and non-structural carbohydrate concentration, while increasing plant N concentration. A delay in the application of photoperiod treatments increased plant size and the proportion of seedlings that developed buds, and it decreased plant non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen concentration. High field mortality was typically observed in the winter, and the early application of photoperiod treatments increased winter mortality but enhanced field growth. Mortality during the first winter was negatively related to plant non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen concentrations at the beginning of the cold season. In contrast, photoperiod had no effect on outplanting mortality and a minor effect on field growth. Field growth in subsequent growing seasons was directly related to the size of the plant at the beginning of the first cold season. However, field growth during the growing season immediately after planting was negatively related to seedling size, and positively related to non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen concentrations at planting. This study demonstrates that summer planting of container seedlings is feasible for P. tabuliformis, and there is no need to reduce the photoperiod in the nursery before outplanting. Optimizing the planting date during the summer appears to be critical for good mid-term growth and low winter mortality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial photoperiod reduction; Blackout; Carbohydrate reserves; Hardening; Nitrogen; Pinus tabuliformis; Plant quality; Planting date; Summer planting","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbohydrates; Forestry; Hardening; Morphology; Plants (botany); Seed; % reductions; Artificial photoperiod reduction; Blackout; Carbohydrate reserves; Non-structural carbohydrates; Pinus tabuliformis; Plant quality; Planting date; Plantings; Summer planting; Nitrogen; climate change; coniferous tree; growing season; monsoon; morphology; mortality; optimization; photoperiod; physiology; seedling; Anatomy; Carbohydrates; Forestry; Hardening; Nitrogen; Beijing [China]; China; Coniferophyta; Pinus tabuliformis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103929636

The accurate identification of the nonlinear relationship between O3 and its precursors is a prerequisite for formulating effective O3 control measures. At present, precursor-based O3 isopleth diagrams are widely used to infer O3 control strategy at a particular location. However, there is frequently a large gap between the O3-precursor nonlinearity delineated by the O3 isopleths and the emission source control measures to reduce O3 levels. Consequently, we developed an emission source-based O3 isopleth diagram that directly illustrates the O3 level changes in response to synergistic control on two types of emission sources using a validated numerical modeling system and the latest regional emission inventory. Isopleths can be further upgraded to isosurfaces when co-control on three types of emission sources is investigated. Using Guangzhou and Foshan as examples, we demonstrate that similar precursor-based O3 isopleths can be associated with significantly different emission source co-control strategies. In Guangzhou, controlling solvent use emissions was the most effective approach to reduce peak O3 levels. In Foshan, co-control of on-road mobile, solvent use, and fixed combustion sources with a ratio of 3:1:2 or 3:1:3 was best to effectively reduce the peak O3 levels below 145 ppbv. This study underscores the importance of using emission source-based O3 isopleths and isosurface diagrams to guide a precursor emission control strategy that can effectively reduce the peak O3 levels in a particular area. © 2021","Ozone-precursor nonlinearity; Pearl River Delta; Source-based ozone isosurface; Tropospheric ozone pollution","Developing countries; Emission control; Ozone; Combustion sources; Control measures; Control strategies; Effective approaches; Emission inventories; Emission sources; Non-linear relationships; Synergistic control; Air pollution; diagram; emission inventory; identification method; nonlinearity; pollutant source; pollution control; troposphere; China; Foshan; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Zhujiang Delta; ozone; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; pollution; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100163839

The potential contribution of renewable energy technology to energy stability, climate change mitigation and economic growth is immense. Biogas, is a renewable energy resource and enriched with methane, produced through the breakdown of organic matters (anaerobically). The large quantity of livestock has significant contributions in Pakistan's economy, and also having a high potential for production of biogas. Therefore, this study was conducted in 6 southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, to identify the expected willingness of households for adopting any biogas system. A sum of 360 households (livestock-farmers) was selected for data collection by the procedure of equal allocation. The identification of the influencing factors on the household's willingness to adopt any biogas system was determined through probit analysis. It has been validated from the research outcomes of probit analysis that the selected household's qualification, electricity shortfall on daily basis and its impact on children's education and female work, awareness of the selected household's about the biogas utilization and its benefits as well as the availability of space have demonstrated their significance and relationship with the household's willingness to adopt biogas system. The overall model is statistically significant at 1% significance level and confirmed the impact of socioeconomic features as the prominent factors for the household's decision to adopt a biogas system. This study suggests the public awareness, which has more significant impact on identifying the household's adoption behavior.

Investigated in particular are spatiotemporal patterns in SST and sea ice state and dynamics, with rankings of the latter to highlight extreme conditions relative to the examined 1981-2010 climatology. Results from this study show that SSTs in northwestern Hudson Bay from May to July, 2016-2018, are high relative to the climatology for SST (1982-2010). SSTs are also warmer in 2016 and 2017 than in 2018 relative to their climatology. Similarly, unusually low sea ice cover existed from August to December of 2016 and July to September of 2017, while unusually high sea ice cover existed in January, February, and October of 2018. The ice-free season was approximately 20 days longer in 2016 than in 2018. Unusually high ice-drift speeds occurred in April of 2016 and 2017 and in May of 2018, coinciding with strong winds in 2016 and 2018 and following strong winds in March 2017. Strong meridional circulation was observed in spring of 2016 and winter of 2017, while weak meridional circulation existed in 2018. In a case study of an extreme event, a blizzard from 7 to 9 March 2017, evaluated using Lagrangian dispersion statistics, is shown to have suppressed sea ice deformation off the coast of Churchill. These results are relevant to describing and planning for possible future pathways and scenarios under continued climate change and river regulation. © 2021 The Author(s).

Investigated in particular are spatiotemporal changes in sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration and thickness, and zonal and meridional sea ice drift in response to (i) climate change through comparison of historical (1981-2010) and future (2021-2050 and 2041-2070) simulations, (ii) regulation through comparison of historical (1981-2010) naturalized and regulated simulations, and (iii) climate change and regulation combined through comparison of future (2021-2050 and 2041-2070) naturalized and regulated simulations. Also investigated is use of the diagnostic known as e-folding time spatial distribution to monitor changes in persistence in these variables in response to changing climate and regulation impacts in the Hudson Bay Complex. Results from this analysis highlight bay-wide and regional reductions in sea ice concentration and thickness in southwest and northeast Hudson Bay in response to a changing climate, and east-west asymmetry in sea ice drift response in support of past studies. Regulation is also shown to amplify or suppress the climate change signal. Specifically, regulation amplifies sea surface temperatures from April to August, suppresses sea ice loss by approximately 30% in March, contributes to enhanced sea ice drift speed by approximately 30%, and reduces meridional circulation by approximately 20% in January due to enhanced zonal drift. Results further suggest that the offshore impacts of regulation are amplified in a changing climate. © 2021 The Author(s).

Previous studies found that the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature can largely determine biochar properties, which in turn, impact the stability of native soil organic matter (SOM) and soil microorganisms. The Schima superba and Cunninghamia lanceolata are two tree species widely distributed in the subtropical region of southern China, but how the biochars from these two species influence the soil C sequestration and microbial communities of plantation remain poorly understood. In this study, we produced biochars from these two different feedstocks (13C-labeled S. superba and C. lanceolata litters) at three pyrolysis temperatures (350°C, 550°C, 750°C), then added them to the soils from C. lanceolata plantation, and maintained the experiments at 25°C for 112 days. We found both C mineralization and soil microbial community structures were strongly, but inconsistent, affected by biochar feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. The C. lanceolata biochar triggered the negative priming effect faster and greater compared with the S. superba biochar amendment. Biochars produced at 550°C showed the most significant negative priming effect during the whole incubation period, regardless of the different feedstocks. The cumulative amount of CO2 derived from biochars was significantly decreased with pyrolysis temperature (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that biochars prepared at higher temperatures were more stable in the soil. Further, the soil microbial community structure was only affected by biochar pyrolysis temperature rather than biochar feedstock and their interaction. Together, our results reveal that biochar feedstock and pyrolysis temperature may play more important roles in dictating the priming effect than the structure of microbial community for C. lanceolata plantation. Overall, we concluded that the biochars prepared at 550°C could rapidly decrease the turnover of native SOM in a short term and biochar amendment has the potential to be a management practice for soil C sequestration in the C. lanceolata plantation. © Copyright © 2021 Lu, Yin, Li, Ma, Gao and Yin.","biochar; feedstock; microbial community structure; mineralization; priming effect; pyrolysis temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112402422

The research conducted by Chinese scholars on CO2 geological storage in the Ordos Basin has mainly focused on numerical simulations of CO2 storage, the estimation of the CO2 storage capacity, and the CO2 storage mechanism. Few studies have been conducted on the selection of CO2 geological storage area, or even on a methodology for ranking CO2 geological storage sites in carbonate reservoirs. This study provides a reference for the ranking of CGS areas in carbonate reservoirs. First, from the geological view of CO2 storage reservoir, logging data and core petrographic analyses with cast thin sections, scanning electron microscopy and formation water salinity tests were used to systematically investigate the reservoir type, lithology, porosity, permeability, burial depth, thickness, temperature, and pressure conditions, and water salinity of the Majiagou formation. Second, from the perspective of CO2 storage safety, literature research, and seismic interpretation data were used to investigate the sealing performance of the strata overlying the Majiagou Formation and its related fault system in detail. Third, from the economic perspective of CO2 storage, considering the distance from the source of the CO2 emissions, the extent of the regional exploration, and the degree of the influence of CO2 storage on the exploitation of other mineral resources, the CO2 storage areas in the Majiagou Formation in the Ordos Basin were prioritized. The results show that (1) the Wushenqi-Jingbian-Yan'an karst slope area (I1) is the best CO2 geological storage area, (2) the Yulin-Mizhi karst basin area (I2) is a favorable area for CGS in the Ordos Basin. (3) A site ranking methodology for CGS is also proposed, providing a reference for the selection of CO2 geological storage areas in carbonate reservoirs based on the technical, safety, and economic feasibility of the CGS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonate reservoir; CO2 geological storage; Majiagou Formation; Ordos Basin; Site ranking methodology","Carbonation; Digital storage; Emission control; Lithology; Metamorphic rocks; Mineral exploration; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Scanning electron microscopy; Seismology; CO2 emission reduction; Co2 geological storages; Economic feasibilities; Formation-water salinity; Literature researches; Petrographic analysis; Ranking methodologies; Seismic interpretation; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon storage; data interpretation; emission control; hydrocarbon reservoir; ranking; salinity; China; Ordos Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108734480

TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 106 km2 ± 0.5 × 106 km2). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia. © 2021","Climate change; Cloud-base height; ENSO; IOD; MODIS; Reanalysis; TRMM; Tropical Montane Cloud Forests","Atmospheric pressure; Decision trees; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiometers; Rain gages; Tropics; Cloud base; Cloud-base height; El Nino southern oscillation; Indian Ocean dipole; Land-cover change; Random forest classifier; Reanalysis; Tree cover; TRMM; Tropical montane cloud forest; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; climate classification; cloud forest; ecosystem service; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Indian Ocean Dipole; land cover; land management; MODIS; precipitation (climatology); satellite data; species diversity; street vendor; temporal variation; tree; Africa; Central America; North America; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105262348

This study permitted a high-resolution reconstruction of paleoenvironmental evolution for the last ~2700 cal yr BP in the highest mountain range of southern Iberian Peninsula. An overall trend towards a climatic aridification and a reduction of aquatic environments is observed in this record. Insolation and long-term positive North Atlantic Oscillation trends were the most important factors controlling this aridification, forcing regional and local environmental changes. Four phases are differentiated within the paleoenvironmental evolution of BdlR-03: (1) a pre-bog environment from 2700 to 2600 cal yr BP with important siliciclastic sedimentation and low organic content; (2) a bog environment with important presence of terrestrial vascular plant, water availability and maximum humid conditions between ~2600 and ~1870 cal yr BP, coinciding with the Iberian-Roman Humid Period; (3) a subsequent drier bog environment, between ~1870 and ~300 cal yr BP during the Dark Ages, the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the first stages of the Little Ice Age, characterized by lower productivity that affected the development of terrestrial vascular plants and aquatic environments; and (4) a wetland environment with an increase of aquatic algae, development of ephemeral pools and unstable climate conditions between ~300 cal yr BP and the present, coinciding with the final stages of the Little Ice Age and the Modern Global Warming. This recent environmental pattern, which is opposite to the general aridification trend in the western Mediterranean, is likely explained by the gradual melting of the perennial ice and/or snow packs at higher elevations in the last centuries. Aeolian inputs would have continuously contributed nutrients to these nutrient-impoverished alpine environments. High dust inputs are especially noticed during the last ~200 years, which can be explained by human-induced enhanced aridification and the development of the commercial agriculture in some North African regions.

For that, a literature review about the link between tourism and climate is mandatory. Therefore, the present paper aims to establish the evolution of the relationship between tourism and climate, since relevant studies were published from 1940 to 2020. A bibliometric analysis using qualitative and quantitative methods were used for measuring the coverage ratio of tourism and climate (change) in spatial-temporal studies. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were used to carry out an in-depth analysis based on 889 publications related to tourism climatology. These were synthesized in attributes and codes (e.g. location, journal name, geographic level, methods of analysis, results, implications, and trends). It is true that in the context of tourism research, themes and assumptions give or take a few exceptions, remain constant. Most of the 889 studies analyzed focused on climatological hotspots, such as impacts of climate change on tourism (28.4%) and urban and bioclimatic comfort of tourists in affected destinations (13.2%), with a lower coverage of tourism-related topics such as policies of climate change in tourism (6.1%) or strategies and concrete options to re-enable tourist destinations for climate change (0.2%). The research methods, procedures and results can contribute to advance tourism climatology to a new phase of theoretical and practical application for tourism planning. © 2021 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

We first enhance the UKCA gas-phase chemistry scheme by incorporating reactive volatile organic compound (VOC) tracers that are necessary to represent urban and regional-scale O3 photochemistry. We demonstrate that the model with the improved chemistry scheme captures the observed magnitudes and diurnal patterns of surface O3 concentrations across these regions well. Simulated O3 concentrations are highest in Beijing and Shijiazhuang on the North China Plain and in Chongqing, lower in Shanghai and Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta, and lowest in Guangzhou in the Pearl River Delta despite the highest daytime O3 production rates in Guangzhou. NOx/VOC and H2O2/HNO3 ratios indicate that O3 production across all regions except Chongqing is VOC limited. We confirm this by constructing O3 response surfaces for each region changing NOx and VOC emissions and further contrast the effectiveness of measures to reduce surface O3 concentrations. In VOC-limited regions, reducing NOx emissions by 20% leads to a substantial O3 increase (11%) in Shanghai. We find that reductions in NOx emissions alone of more than 70% are required to decrease O3 concentrations across all regions. Reductions in VOC emissions alone of 20% produce the largest decrease (-11%) in O3 levels in Shanghai and Guangzhou and the smallest decrease (-1%) in Chongqing. These responses are substantially different from those currently found in highly populated regions in other parts of the world, likely due to higher NOx emission levels in these Chinese regions. Our work provides an assessment of the effectiveness of emission control strategies to mitigate surface O3 pollution in these major industrial regions and emphasises that combined NOx and VOC emission controls play a pivotal role in effectively offsetting high O3 levels. It also demonstrates new capabilities in capturing regional air pollution that will permit this model to be used for future studies of regional air-quality-climate interactions. © Copyright:",,"atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); emission control; ozone; photochemistry; summer; tracer; volatile organic compound; Beijing [China]; China; Chongqing; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Hebei; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Shanghai; Shijiazhuang; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110538698

The Chinese government has clearly stated that it is necessary to make full use of market means to improve the level of environmental governance. Emissions trading scheme (ETS) is a typical market means to accelerate low-carbon economic transition. Low-carbon technological innovation is one of the key factors affecting carbon emissions. However, literature on the relationship between ETS and low-carbon technological innovation is relatively scarce at present. This study assesses the effect of pilot ETSs on low-carbon technological innovation, and a difference in differences (DID) model is adopted to analyze China's provincial panel data from 2003 to 2017. The results indicate that China's pilot ETSs can significantly promote low-carbon technological innovation, and changing the window period, PSM-DID and placebo test all verify the robustness of this finding. The dynamic effect test reveals that China's pilot ETSs will gradually increase the effect on low-carbon technological innovation over time. The heterogeneity analysis shows that the effect of China's pilot ETSs on low-carbon technological innovation is more obvious in Guangdong, Hubei, Tianjin and Chongqing. The mechanism analysis suggests that marketization degree and green consumption concept can positively moderate the impact of China's pilot ETSs on low-carbon technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrading plays a positive mediating role between China's pilot ETSs and low-carbon technological innovation. This study is conducive to assessing the policy effectiveness of China's pilot ETSs and provides an empirical evidence for promoting the development of the carbon emissions trading market. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Difference in differences model; Emissions trading scheme; Heterogeneity analysis; Low-carbon technological innovation; Mechanism analysis","Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; Green manufacturing; Carbon emission reductions; Difference-in-differences; Emissions Trading Scheme; Environmental governances; Industrial structures; Low-carbon economic; Mechanism analysis; Technological innovation; Carbon; carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; government; innovation; China; Chongqing; Guangdong; Hubei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103696355

Its use is expected to mitigate the problems of environmental pollution and global warming caused by the excessive use of conventional fossil fuels. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for water splitting has attracted considerable attention because of its environmental friendliness. To improve electrocatalyst performance and reduce operation cost, carbon-based metal hybrid materials exhibiting high efficiency and catalytic activity have been developed. Among them, carbon dots (CDs) have garnered significant research attention and have been widely applied in biosensing, bioimaging, and energy conversion/storage because of their facile synthesis, biocompatibility, tunable photoluminescence, excellent stability, and good electronic properties. CDs are widely used as carriers in the construction of electrocatalysts prepared from carbon-based metal hybrid materials. At present, it is believed that CDs exhibit excellent confinement effects, which can effectively inhibit the growth and agglomeration of metal nanoparticles, thereby preparing well-distributed carbon-based metal hybrid materials with a uniform and controllable size. However, the formation process of the small-molecule raw materials of CDs has not been elucidated. In this study, CDs and small-molecule raw materials from synthetic CDs were used as precursors to prepare nitrogen-doped CD-supported ruthenium nanoparticle (Ru@CDs) and small-molecule-supported ruthenium nanoparticle (Ru@Molecule) hybrid materials, respectively. The interaction between the small molecules and Ru in the process of CD formation and the effect on HER performance were explored. Moreover, we prepared different carriers such as metal organic frameworks(MOF), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene (GO)-supported ruthenium nanoparticle hybrid materials. Among them, Ru@CDs exhibited controllable size and excellent dispersibility and exhibited outstanding HER activity and good stability. Ru@CDs were found to require a low overpotential of 22 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA·cm−2. Moreover, we observed the presence of an intermediate state between the molecules and CDs and demonstrated that the intermediate state exhibits no confinement effect. Furthermore, we found that with increasing calcination temperature, the intermediate state gradually changes to CDs. The unique spatial confinement between CDs and metal ions is key to the formation of monodisperse Ru nanoparticles. Our results confirmed that Ru@CDs serve as excellent HER catalyst supports. This work not only reveals the effect of the unique spatial confinement of CDs on the supported metals and their promoting effect on electrocatalytic activity but also provides guides the future development of CD-based metal hybrid electrocatalysts. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.","Carbon dots; Carbon-base carriers; Hybrid materials; Hydrogen evolution reaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107399266

Although people spend more than 80% of their time indoors, the role of air purifiers in mitigating personal exposure to indoor PM2.5 of outdoor origin has not yet been quantified, especially in under-developed regions. Here, we performed a comprehensive simulation at the 10 km × 10 km geographical resolution in mainland China to quantify the health benefits and costs of indoor air purification in four intervention scenarios, S1 to S4, where target indoor PM2.5 concentrations were 35, 25, 15, and 10 μg/m3. In intervention scenarios S1 to S4, 93,200 (95% uncertainty interval 78,900–113,600), 115,300 (97,700−140,800), 163,400 (138,300−198,800), and 207,900 (176,300−251,800) deaths that cost 82, 175, 438, and 798 billion Chinese Yuan can be avoided and 93%, 80%, 53%, and 26% of the cities have a positive net monetary benefit. We found that achieving indoor PM2.5 concentration of 35 or 25 μg/m3 using air purifiers is cost-effective at reducing PM2.5 related deaths and PM2.5 concentration of 25 μg/m3 is a suitable indoor PM2.5 target for China. Multifaceted efforts are necessary to ensure equitable access to air purifiers and the knowledge to effectively operate them to make sure the benefits reach the whole population. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air purifier; Cost-benefit analysis; Exposure; PM2.5","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Geographical regions; Health; Particles (particulate matter); Air purifier; Ambients; Benefits and costs; Cost-benefits analysis; Exposure; Fine particulates; Health benefits; Health costs; Particulate pollution; PM$-2.5$; Cost benefit analysis; airflow; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); conceptual framework; emission inventory; health risk; indoor air; particulate matter; pollution exposure; purification; ambient air; Article; China; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; death; disease burden; energy consumption; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; income; indoor environment; Monte Carlo method; mortality rate; PM2.5 exposure; population distribution; population exposure; sensitivity analysis; simulation; vulnerable population; air filter; air pollutant; air pollution; city; cost benefit analysis; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; prevention and control; China; Air Filters; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; China; Cities; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102060064

However, whether soil heterogeneity also modulates responses of plant communities to climate change, including climate extremes, remains largely an open question. Here, we explore responses of plant communities to drought extremes across four levels of spatial soil heterogeneity, with cell sizes varying from very small to very large, i.e. 0, 12, 24 and 48 cm. These were created in mesocosms by alternating nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor substrate in three dimensions. A seed mixture of 24 grassland species was evenly sown on each mesocosm in spring. In late summer, a three-week drought was imposed with a rainout shelter. During the drought, soil water content at the mesocosm scale decreased more at intermediate (12 and 24 cm) than at small or large (0 and 48 cm) cell sizes, which was reflected in increased senescence and drought-induced heat stress. These responses could be traced to greater plant biomass coupled with higher water demand at those intermediate cell sizes, likely related to between-cell access to nutrients and effects of diversity and community composition. Our results indicate that soil heterogeneity can modulate the impact of drought extremes on plant communities, though more research is needed on the transition between intermediate and extreme cell sizes, where heterogeneity effects seem to change most. We propose that soil heterogeneity be considered more explicitly in studies of changing precipitation regimes. © 2021 Nordic Society Oikos.

However, a continuing challenge for inverse models that are used to estimate these sources and sinks is the sheer number of satellite observations, sometimes in the millions per day. These massive datasets often make it prohibitive to implement inverse modeling calculations and/or assimilate the observations using many types of atmospheric models. Although these satellite datasets are very large, the information content of any single observation is often modest and non-exclusive due to redundancy with neighboring observations and due to measurement noise. In this study, we develop an adaptive approach to reduce the size of satellite datasets using geostatistics. A guiding principle is to reduce the data more in regions with little variability in the observations and less in regions with high variability. We subsequently tune and evaluate the approach using synthetic and real data case studies for North America from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. The proposed approach to data reduction yields more accurate CO2 flux estimates than the commonly used method of binning and averaging the satellite data. We further develop a metric for choosing a level of data reduction; we can reduce the satellite dataset to an average of one observation per g1/4g80-140gkm for the specific case studies here without substantially compromising the flux estimate, but we find that reducing the data further quickly degrades the accuracy of the estimated fluxes. Overall, the approach developed here could be applied to a range of inverse problems that use very large trace gas datasets. © Copyright:",,"adaptive management; atmospheric modeling; data set; geostatistics; greenhouse gas; inverse analysis; numerical model; OCO; satellite altimetry; source-sink dynamics; North America; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111733106

Due to it being relatively new on the market, the field lacks a refined assessment of the instrument's performance under various settings and data post-processing approaches. This study assessed the mobile real-time performance of the MA200 to determine a suitable noise reduction algorithm in an urban area, Augsburg, Germany. Noise reduction and negative value mitigation were explored via different data post-processing methods (i.e., local polynomial regression (LPR), optimized noise reduction averaging (ONA), and centred moving average (CMA)) under common sampling interval times (i.e., 5, 10, and 30ĝ€¯s). After noise reduction, the treated data were evaluated and compared by (1) the amount of useful information attributed to retention of microenvironmental characteristics, (2) the relative number of negative values remaining, (3) the reduction and retention of peak samples, and (4) the amount of useful signal retained after correction for local background conditions. Our results identify CMA as a useful tool for isolating the central trends of raw black carbon concentration data in real time while reducing nonsensical negative values and the occurrence and magnitudes of peak samples that affect visual assessment of the data without substantially affecting bias. Correction for local background concentrations improved the CMA treatment by bringing nuanced microenvironmental changes into view. This analysis employs a number of different post-processing methods for black carbon data, providing comparative insights for researchers looking for black carbon data smoothing approaches, specifically in a mobile monitoring framework and data collected using the microAeth® series of Aethalometer. © Copyright:",,"air quality; black carbon; concentration (composition); data set; detection method; real time; roadside environment; smoothing; Augsburg; Bavaria; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111734736

These lakes are important water reservoirs and sensitive to TP climate changes. They regulate regional water circulations, and further influence local ecosystems. Many lakes in ITP are surrounded by conspicuous paleoshorelines indicating much higher past lake levels. Previous studies found that lakes in the western ITP (west of ∼86°E) apparently expanded to higher levels than those to the east during the Holocene high lake level stage, however, there is no in-depth study on the reasons for the spatial differences of high lake levels within the ITP. In this study, we first identify Holocene lake level (or lake extent) changes over the ITP by combining published lake level variation data with our reconstruction of Dagze Co lake level variations. We then investigate spatial differences in the magnitude of lake expansions and explore the underlying forces driving these differences using the transient climate evolution of the last 21 ka (TraCE-21ka) and Kiel Climate Model (KCM) simulation results. We find that lakes in the ITP expanded to their highest levels during the early Holocene when the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) greatly intensified. After the mid-Holocene, lake levels fell as a result of the weakening of the ISM. The early Holocene northward shift of the westerly jet and a positive phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) resulted in the intensification of southwesterly winds on the southwest TP flank. Concurrently, westerly winds over the TP weakened, causing a differential increase in water vapor transport to the ITP with higher precipitation levels in the southwestern ITP and lower levels to the northeast. These wind-driven differential precipitation levels caused lakes in the southwestern ITP to expand to higher levels than those in the central, northern and northeastern ITP. During the early Holocene, expansion of lakes in the northwestern ITP was enhanced by an increase in glacier melt water besides the increased summer rainfall associated with the intensified ISM. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Madsen and Zhang.","holocene; inner Tibetan plateau; lake extent changes; lake level variations; paleoshoreline","Climate change; Climate models; Expansion; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Atlantic multidecadal oscillations; Indian summer monsoon; Lake-level variations; Precipitation level; South-westerly winds; Spatial differences; Water circulation; Water vapor transport; Lakes; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; glacier; Holocene; lake level; meltwater; reconstruction; shoreline; spatial variation; temporal variation; water vapor; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110488196

The purpose of this paper is to verify whether air pollution has a certain impact on the migration of high human capital, which is rarely studied in the literature. Based on the panel data of 35 developed cities of China from 2006 to 2016, this paper uses ordinary least square (OLS) method and two-stage least squares (2SLS) method to empirically analyze the impact of air pollution on the number of international students studying in Chinese universities. The results show that cities with severe air pollution would have significantly fewer international students. Moreover, heterogeneity analysis indicates that self-financed international students are more sensitive to air pollution than public-funded students. This research indicates that air pollution governance is crucial in introducing international talents towards a higher human capital goal. © 2021","2SLS; Air pollution; High human capital; International students","Least squares approximations; Personnel; Population dynamics; Students; Chinese universities; Empirical studies; Human capitals; International students; Major cities; Ordinary least square methods; Technological progress; Two stage least squares; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100404438

This gives rise to the demand of quantifying the contribution of natural and human impacts to runoff changes of rivers for river management. In this study, Mann-Kendall test and BFAST algorithm were used to evaluate the trends of runoff change in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River from 1965 to 2016, and to identify the breakpoints of runoff changes in the two reaches. Based on the data-driven analysis of runoff generation mechanism, the natural annual runoff was related with a comprehensive climatic factor integrating temperature and precipitation, and the impacts of human activities and climate change on the runoff changes were quantitatively distinguished by comparing the measured runoff with the “natural runoff”. For revealing the periodical changes in correlation between climate factors and runoff, the method of cross wavelet transform was used, and the time-frequency characteristics of precipitation/temperature against runoff were also examined. The results show that the breakpoints were the year 1987 in the upper reaches, 1986 and 2003 in the middle reaches. Compared with the baseline period (1965–1987), the contribution rates of climate change and human activities to runoff change in the upper reaches of the river were 56% and 44% respectively in 1988–2016. For the middle reaches, compared with the reference period (1965–1986), the contribution from climate change in 1987–2003 and 2004–2016 was 38% and 41% respectively, and that from human activities was 62% and 59% respectively. The results of cross wavelet transform analysis support the growth of climatic contribution to runoff reduction in the middle Yellow River from 1987–2003 to 2004–2016. Apparently, the influencing degree of climate change on runoff in the upper reaches was similar to that of human activities, while human activities played a dominant role in runoff change in the middle reaches. Moreover, the construction of reservoirs and human water consumption were the key factors for the decline of runoff in the upstream, and the reduction of runoff in the middle reaches was related to the large-scale implementation of water conservancy and soil and water conservation in the region. © 2021 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division","Climate change; Human activities; Runoff; The Yellow River","Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Runoff; Soil conservation; Water conservation; Water management; Wavelet transforms; Contribution rate; Cross-wavelet transform; Data-driven analysis; Mann-Kendall test; Runoff generation mechanisms; Soil and water conservation; Time frequency characteristics; Water consumption; Climate change; climate change; environmental factor; human activity; runoff; trend analysis; China; Yellow River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106360674

The influence of land surface temperature (LST) on pollution was also explored. PM2.5 was strongly correlated with CO and NO2 and moderately correlated with SO2. The four pollutants were negatively correlated with O3. The correlation strengthened in winter and changed significantly in summer. Notably, PM2.5 showed the most obvious decline and also exhibited seasonal variability, with higher levels in autumn and winter. Spatially, PM2.5 was higher in the south and lower in the north. PM2.5 levels were higher in urban zones. For gaseous pollutants, CO, SO2, and NO2 levels decreased with a small decrease in NO2, and their spatiotemporal characteristics showed consistency with PM2.5, whereas O3 showed the opposite trend.

To enhance urban forest adaptability and resilience to climate change impacts, tree species with high local climate adaptability and robust stress tolerance should be identified and selected. Climate events in the Shanghai area, such as late frost, chilling, heat waves, drought, typhoons, waterlogging, soil salinization, pests, and disease, directly or indirectly impact urban forests and trees. For urban tree species selection in the context of climate change, an assessment framework was proposed and applied to assess the climate change adaptability of 65 urban tree species in Shanghai using a method combined with quantitative data and qualitative descriptions. In this study, the climate types of tree species were divided into four groups according to annual mean temperature (AMT) and annual precipitation (AP): temperate, cool subtropical, warm subtropical, and moist subtropical species. The results showed that hardness, heat tolerance, chilling requirement, and drought tolerance were categorized as climate-related tolerances, while other tolerances were categorized as non-climate-related tolerances. The tree species’ optimal AMT and AP were significantly correlated with climate-related tolerances, but they did not respond to the non-climate-related tolerances. The warm subtropical species had higher stress tolerances than other climate types in the Shanghai area; therefore, the warm subtropical species with high tolerances were the most suitable alternatives for urban tree species selection with regards to Shanghai's climate change impacts. This study also found that the AMT optimum is a better index to reflect tree species’ climate-related tolerances rather than the AP optimum. Finally, the adaptability assessment framework of climate change impact will offer guidance for future-oriented urban forest management and urban tree species selection in Shanghai. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Stress tolerance; Urban ecosystem resilience; Urban forest management; Urban tree species selection","accuracy assessment; adaptation; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; condition factor; environmental factor; forest management; street vendor; tree; urban ecosystem; urban forestry; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106207326

The method allows to identify high-resolution structural adjustment intervention points that combine reduction in GHG emission and local environmental damage with stable performance in economy-wide welfare. Investigating the Chinese economy, our results show that key leverage points for simultaneously reducing GHG and local pollutants include electricity inputs of various industries, building materials inputs of housing construction, and fertilizer inputs of agriculture. Therefore, emerging political interventions include reducing the fertilizer use in agriculture, improving the electricity efficiency in raw chemical materials manufacturing and in the metal products industry, and saving inputs of steel, cement, and other building materials in construction, e.g., by transition to prefabricated or 3D printing construction. Urban households can reshape final demand by moderating electricity consumption and adjusting investments in real estate. Reduced export of low-value added steel and metal products would further improve environment and contribute to global climate change mitigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Co-control; Elasticity analysis; Greenhouse gas; Input-output; Pollutant; Structure adjustment","3D printers; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Air pollution; Cement industry; Cement manufacture; Cements; Climate change; Construction; Construction industry; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Industrial economics; Investments; Quality control; Water pollution; Water quality; Construction activities; Electricity efficiencies; Electricity-consumption; Environmental damage; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Housing construction; Local air pollutions; Greenhouse gases; climate change; economic conditions; economic structure; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental economics; global climate; spatiotemporal analysis; structural adjustment; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110972557

Recent research has offered different insights regarding the effect of technical change on CO2 emissions but ignored the bias of technical changes which lead to changes in CO2 emissions. To fill the gap, this paper uses the 2008 to 2015 provincial-level data on China’s 22 industrial sub-sectors to investigate both the effect of directed technical change on CO2 emissions and its heterogeneity. We find that the technical change in most industrial sectors in China was capital-biased, although a labor-biased trend was evident. Labor-biased technical change is conducive to CO2 reduction, while capital-biased technical change has the opposite effect. Moreover, this effect is different by developmental periods, industries, and regions. Therefore, we propose that the government promotes labor-biased technical change based on the differentiated characteristics. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Climate change; Directed technical change","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; industrial emission; technical change; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098670233

The CoPc@P-g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst exhibited the highest efficiency for the photoreduction of CO2 with a high yield of 295 μmol-g−1 for CO under the experimental conditions. Also, hydrogen with low concentration was identified as a by-product under the experimental conditions. The photocatalyst had stability for six consecutive runs with negligible loss of the activity and no leaching of the cobalt content at the end of the sixth run of the photoreduction experiment. The stability of the photocatalysts is an advantage, which made it a suitable candidate for the current reaction system. © 2021","C1 hydrocarbon synthesis; CO2 reduction; Cobalt phthalocyanine; g-C3N4; Photocatalysis","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Carbon nitride; Coal liquefaction; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Greenhouse gases; Irradiation; Light; Cobalt phthalocyanine; Experimental conditions; Fischer-Tropsch process; Growing process; Hybrid photocatalysts; Low concentrations; Photo-reduction; Visible-light irradiation; Cobalt compounds; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; cobalt; graphite; hydrocarbon; hydrogen; methanol; nitrogen derivative; phosphorus; phthalocyanine; Article; catalyst; complex formation; concentration (parameter); greenhouse gas; hybrid; leaching; photocatalysis; priority journal; quantum yield; reduction (chemistry); synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103257105

DMSP derived from dinoflagellates is an important reducing sulfur and carbon source for heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Although dinoflagellates have outstanding ability in DMSP biosynthesis, and the inter-specific variation of cellular DMSP concentrations in different species and strains has been well described, the effects of DMSP level on microbial community structure are still unclear. In this study, the ability of seven dinoflagellates to synthesize DMSP and their effects on the composition of associated bacterial community were investigated. Total concentration of DMSP (2397.25 ± 187.17 μM) and single cell DMSP content (34.25 ± 2.67 pmol cell−1) were the highest in Protoceratium reticulatum, while the DMSP contents of Prorocentrum texanum and Amphidinium carterae were significantly lower than those of other dinoflagellates. Bacterial community structure in dinoflagellate culture was determined by cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches. There were significantly differences in the richness and diversity of bacteria in different dinoflagellate cultures with different DMSP contents. In addition, abundant of Roseobacter-clade bacteria (well-known DMSP degraders) were found in the cultures of six dinoflagellates. Genomic analysis indicated that the Roseobacter-clade bacteria isolated from dinoflagellate could degrade DMSP by cleavage pathway. The results demonstrated that DMSP could be an important factor affecting the abundance and composition of bacterial community in phycosphere of dinoflagellates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing; Bacterial community; Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP); Dinoflagellate; DMSP catabolism genes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106474291

In an attempt to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions which are the major anthropogenic contributors to air pollution, China initiated an electricity price subsidy (EPS) policy in November 2011 for incentivizing coal-fired power plants to install denitrification units. However, the effectiveness of the policy in the reduction of NOX emissions and its sustainability are yet to be investigated. This study attempts to examine the effects of the EPS policy on NOX emissions and NOX removal, based on a panel-data set covering 113 prefectural-level cities in China during 2008–2015. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) regression model, we find that for each additional power plant in cities, the EPS policy significantly reduces NOX emissions by 1.1% and increases NOX removal by 2.8%. Furthermore, the results reveal that the overall effect of the EPS policy shows a positive trend with time accompanied by an increase in price subsidy, indicating that the efficacy of the policy designed for the reduction of harmful air pollutants is sustainable. In particular, we confirm that compensating for the construction and operation costs of denitrification units is an effective mechanism which encourages the coal-fired power plants to invest more in such units. The findings of the study accentuate the significant implication that economic-incentive policies play a crucial role in combating air pollution and environmental degradation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Coal-fired power industry; Difference-in-differences model; Economic-incentive policy; Electricity price subsidy; NOX emissions","nitrogen oxide; coal; atmospheric pollution; denitrification; environmental degradation; nitric oxide; nitrogen oxides; power plant; price determination; sustainability; sustainable development; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; city; coal mining; controlled study; cost minimization analysis; denitrification; difference in differences regression; econometric model; economic incentive; electric power plant; electricity price subsidy; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; industrialization; nitrogen oxide emission; population density; price; regression analysis; sustainable development; trend study; air pollutant; electricity; human; policy; prevention and control; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Coal; Electricity; Humans; Policy; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104424749

Adaptation measures that integrate technological, nature-based, and social solutions can provide multiple co-benefits to address complex socioecological issues in cities while increasing resilience to potential impacts. However, there remain many challenges to developing and implementing integrated solutions. In this Viewpoint, we consider the value of integrating across the three solution sets, the challenges and potential enablers for integrating solution sets, and present examples of challenges and adopted solutions in three cities with different urban contexts and climates (Freiburg, Germany; Durban, South Africa; and Singapore). We conclude with a discussion of research directions and provide a road map to identify the actions that enable successful implementation of integrated climate solutions. We highlight the need for more systematic research that targets enabling environments for integration; achieving integrated solutions in different contexts to avoid maladaptation; simultaneously improving liveability, sustainability, and equality; and replicating via transfer and scale-up of local solutions. Cities in systematically disadvantaged countries (sometimes referred to as the Global South) are central to future urban development and must be prioritised. Helping decision makers and communities understand the potential opportunities associated with integrated solutions for climate change will encourage urgent and deliberate strides towards adapting cities to the dynamic climate reality. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, the public is worried about the influence of paraxylene plants on the environment. The contradiction between supporting paraxylene and opposing it poses a considerable challenge for the Chinese government. Therefore, objective evaluation of paraxylene plants' impact on the environment is of great significance to industrial development. Using the urban panel data of 102 cities in China from 2003 to 2017, this paper applies the PSM-DID method to study the relationship between paraxylene plants and air quality. This paper shows that paraxylene plants play a significantly positive role in aggravating urban air pollution. Specifically, paraxylene plants increase not only industrial dust pollution but also increase SO2 emissions. This influence is still valid after multiple robustness tests. Moreover, the mechanism analysis reveals that paraxylene plants' construction promotes income growth but hinders foreign direct investment. Finally, this paper provides policy suggestions on promoting paraxylene industrial development in terms of governments, enterprises, and the public. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Chinese cities; Paraxylene plants; PSM-DID method","Air quality; Chinese cities; Chinese Government; Impact on the environment; Industrial development; Objective evaluation; Panel data; Paraxylene; Paraxylene plant; PSM-DID method; Public IS; Chemical industry; air quality; atmospheric pollution; data set; foreign direct investment; industrial emission; source apportionment; urban area; air pollution; air quality; article; China; city; foreign direct investment; government; industrialization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102872053

Thus, it is of great significance to identify the determinants of China's CO2 emissions (CCEs). Using an extended logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI), this study focused on investigating the roles of R&amp;D (research and development) efficiency, R&amp;D intensity, investment intensity, labor productivity, employment structure, urban employment ratio, and population urbanization level on CCEs. Then, the grey model and scenario analysis were used to forecast the future situation of CCEs. Results indicate that during 2000-2016, (1) R&amp;D efficiency and energy intensity decline were the foremost contributors in emission mitigation. The rise of urban employment proportion in total employment was also helpful in reducing CO2 emissions. (2) R&amp;D intensity contributed to emission-mitigation in most years, but restrained the decrease of CCEs in some specific years. (3) On the contrary, labor productivity growth, investment intensity increase, and urbanization level improvement all exerted positive impacts on CO2 emissions growth.

However, to take full advantage of these, the corrosion mechanisms that govern their failure need to be properly understood. Hence, the electrochemical response, especially after passive film breakdown, of the aluminium alloy AA5083 was analysed via potentiodynamic polarisation. By starting the scans at the relatively negative potential of −1.4 V (vs. SCE), the reduction of water in the electrolyte causes a localised increase in pH, leading to a preferential attack on the susceptible regions in the (sensitised) microstructure; that is, the deleterious β-Al3Mg2 along the grain boundaries. Subsequently, in the later stages of the potentiodynamic scan, these regions that have been degraded by the dissolution of β-Al3Mg2 undergo imperfect repassivation, leading them to be vulnerable to localised breakdowns. These conditions allowed for the discovery of a discernible trend after breakdown, in which AA5083 microstructures with a more extensive β-Al3Mg2 region (both in size and in amount) recorded a more rapid increase in the measured current density. In particular, the potential at which the anodic current density reached 1 × 10−4 A cm−2 was correlated with the extent of β-Al3Mg2 formed during isothermal heat-treatments. This work provides a possible pathway towards the development of an electrochemical quantification technique for the extent of β-Al3Mg2 growth, degree of sensitisation, and, ultimately, the intergranular corrosion (IGC) susceptibility of the microstructure of AA5083 components used in industrial applications. © 2021 by the authors.

However, limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Here, we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with HIV/AIDS transmission and health outcomes: increased food insecurity, increased prevalence of other infectious diseases, increased human migration, and erosion of public health infrastructure. This framework is based on an in-depth literature review in PubMed and Google Scholar from June 6 to June 27, 2019. The pathways linking climate change with HIV transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors. Food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk-taking behaviours and migration, as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies, particularly in those areas of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia heavily impacted by both HIV and climate change. Environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co-benefits that may help PLWHIV adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change.

To advance our understanding of these questions and to provide insights into biological conservation, we assessed elevational variations in the range sizes of vascular plants with different life forms and biogeographical affinities and explored the main drivers underlying these variations in the longest valley in China's Himalayas, the Gyirong Valley. Elevational range sizes of vascular plants were documented in 96 sampling plots along an elevational gradient ranging from 1,800 to 5,400 m above sea level. We assessed the elevational variations in range size by averaging the range sizes of all recorded species within each sampling plot. We then related the range size to climate, disturbance, and the mid-domain effect and explored the relative importance of these factors in explaining the range size variations using the Random Forest model. A total of 545 vascular plants were recorded in the sampling plots along the elevational gradient. Of these, 158, 387, 337, and 112 were woody, herbaceous, temperate, and tropical species, respectively. The range size of each group of vascular plants exhibited uniform increasing trends along the elevational gradient, which was consistent with the prediction of Rapoport's rule. Climate was the main driver of the increasing trends of vascular plant range sizes in the Gyirong Valley. The climate variability hypothesis and mean climate condition hypothesis could both explain the elevation–range size relationships. Our results reinforce the previous notion that Rapoport's rule applies to regions where the influence of climate is the most pronounced, and call for close attention to the impact of climate change to prevent species range contraction and even extinction due to global warming. © 2021 The Authors.

Land-use optimization can effectively cope with these hazards. However, the trade-offs between multi-hazard mitigation and economic development impose many limitations in practice. Furthermore, current region-based optimization methods no longer meet the precise management demand, and both subdivision and spatial heterogeneity identification have the potential for wider applicability. Hence, a systematic integration of climate adaptation and urban construction through land-use planning is urgently required. This paper proposes a new land-use decision approach for improving climate adaptability of urbanization. This approach involves multi-objective optimization, spatial subdivision, and urbanization stage identification, which enable the simultaneous achievement of environmental and economic benefits. Taking Xiamen as case study, the results showed that excessive pursuit of land economic output (LEO) limits the chance of mitigating UHI and USF. Improving the LEO per unit area of construction land could disrupt the link between land exploitation and the increasing side effects of climate hazards. Future urbanization hotspots in Xiamen will likely emerge at the urban fringe in Tong'an District and Xiang'an District. Within each developing unit, the upper limit of construction land was 81.06 hm2 and the green space was recommended to be 7.29–21.94 hm2. Construction land and bare land contributed most to UHI and USF, while forest and grassland were highly efficient in heat and runoff mitigation. The developed approach proved to be effective and practicable, especially for reducing the impacts of extreme UHI and USF. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Land-use decision; Multi-objective optimization; Urban heat island; Urban storm flood; Urbanization identification","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Hazards; Land use; Landforms; Multiobjective optimization; Storms; Construction land; Economic benefits; Economic output; Land economics; Land-use decisions; Multi-objectives optimization; Stage identifications; Urban heat island; Urban storm flood; Urbanization identification; Floods; storm water; climate change; decision making; flooding; heat island; land use planning; optimization; stormwater; urbanization; wastewater treatment; Article; building industry; China; climate adaptability; climate change; decision making; economic aspect; environmental factor; environmental temperature; forest; grassland; land economic output; land use; process optimization; runoff; thermoregulation; urban heat island; urban storm flood; urbanization; water management; China; Fujian; Xiamen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102654549

Under this premise, this study attempts to analyze the roles of green investments and other key macroeconomic aggregates in reducing carbon emissions in 30 provinces in China from 1995 to 2017. The robust econometric tools efficient in handling cross-sectional dependency and slope heterogeneity issues were utilized. The Westerlund cointegration analysis confirms the long-term association between the variables of concern. Moreover, the elasticity estimates from the cross-section augmented autoregressive distributed a lag approach indicate that investments in green projects are seen to reduce short- and long-term carbon emission levels. In contrast, the extraction of natural resources, the development of the financial sector, and energy investments increase carbon emissions, both in the short and long term. Furthermore, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality analysis indicate bidirectional causation amongst carbon emissions and the other macroeconomic aggregates considered in this study. © 2020","carbon emissions; energy investment; financial development; green investment; natural resources rent; People's Republic of China","Aggregates; Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Carbon emissions; Causality analysis; Cointegration analysis; Energy investments; Financial sectors; People's Republic of China; Slope heterogeneity; Term associations; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096872573

To accurately predict NOx emission of the coal-fired boiler with strong variable correlations, nonlinear and time-varying characteristics for determining the amount of injected ammonia, a soft sensor modeling method based on the moving window partial least squares (MWPLS) and locally weighted regression, referred to as variable exponentially weighted MWPLS (VEW-MWPLS), is proposed. It adjusts the window size in disguised form by automatically strengthen or weaken the information in the selected window according to the prediction errors of the current model.

The numerical results have demonstrated that VEW-MWPLS algorithm can reduce the mean and standard deviation of prediction errors by one order of magnitude, and reduce the computational complexity by two orders of magnitude when being compared with other algorithms.

Unlike previous studies that allocated CO2 emission quotas directly to Chinese provinces, we propose a two-step allocation scheme of “country to region” and “region to province” to formulate the provincial CO2 emission quotas allocation. In the first step, considering the regional coordination development, the Shapley value method is used to assign the CO2 emission quotas to China's eastern, central, and western regions by simulating the regional collaborative abatement. In the second step, we use the entropy method to obtain the initial CO2 emission quotas for each province combining the principles of fairness, efficiency, feasibility, and sustainability. Then, a zero-sum gains data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA) model is applied to evaluate initial allocation efficiency and reallocate the CO2 emission quotas to realize efficiency optimization within the region. The results show that the eastern region obtains the largest CO2 emission quotas, followed by central and western regions. The energy-abundant and economic-prosperous provinces, such as Shandong, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, face great pressures on CO2 reduction. Compared with existing literature, the proposed scheme's regional allocation results are more balanced, which will narrow the gaps of regional economic development. Since the emission reduction pressure varies in provinces, developing differentiated policies is critical to realizing China's reduction targets. By considering regional fairness, this paper provides a reference for allocating CO2 emission quota among provinces to improve adaptability to the current conditions of China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission quota allocation; Multi-principles allocation; Regional fairness; Shapley value method","Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Emission control; Game theory; Regional planning; CO$-2$/ emission; CO2 emission quota allocation; Eastern regions; Emission quota; Emissions Trading Scheme; Multi-principle allocation; Regional coordination; Regional fairness; Shapley value method; Western region; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105692082

This study mainly studies the nexus of digital economy development and environmental quality for 217 cities in China from 2003 to 2018. Specifically, this study first evaluates the degree of coupling coordination between the digital economy system and the environmental system. Results show that the coupling coordination degree between the digital economy system and the environmental system shows a fluctuating rise from 2003 to 2018. Furthermore, this study empirically in-vestigates the impact of digital economy development on PM2.5, which represents environmental quality, and results show that digital economy development significantly reduces PM2.5. The above finding is still valid by using the quasi-natural experiment of broadband China for the robustness test. Urbanization, population density, and economic development have caused threshold effects. When the urbanization rate and population density exceed a certain threshold, the digital economy significantly inhibits PM2.5. In contrast, when the per capita GDP exceeds a certain threshold, the digital economy significantly promotes PM2.5.

Spatial and temporal variations of past vegetation can be traced by fossil pollen data mapping. In this paper, we synthesized 57 continuous pollen records on the QTP covering the past 15 kyr to depict large-scale vegetation change and its response to climate variations. In order to minimize potential chronological biases, age-depth models were revised using a state-of-the-art and consistent method for all the records. The spatial and temporal variation of major pollen taxa were examined based on interpolated pollen maps at 1000-year intervals. The arboreal pollen (AP, mainly of Pinus, Betula and Abies/Picea) content expressed significant climate signals over a broad spatial and temporal gradient. During the late glacial period, high proportions of AP widely occurred in regions that are presently unforested owing to the sparse local vegetation coverage. For the Holocene period, AP showed relatively high contributions in records from the southeastern margin of the QTP, with a decreasing gradient in abundance towards the northwest. The transportation of AP to unforested regions corresponds closely to the intensity of monsoon wind, which can be used to track the Holocene evolution of the summer monsoon. The dominant shrub and herbaceous taxa (including Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Cyperaceae, Poaceae and Ephedra) generally represent developments of local vegetation responding to climate variations. In addition, the persistent increase in Poaceae pollen during the mid to late Holocene correlates possibly to regional human activities. The inferred spatial and temporal patterns of major pollen types on the QTP provide significant knowledge about long-term vegetation change and its potential response to climate variations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine ecosystem; Asian summer monsoon; Fossil pollen record; Spatial interpolation","climate variation; fossil record; herb; Holocene; late glacial; long-term change; mapping method; pollen; shrub; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Amaranthaceae; Artemisia; Betula; Cyperaceae; Ephedra; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105835416

A growing number of studies are conducted to develop local mitigation strategies for improving air quality. This review paper critically evaluates the available literature to provide a better understanding of potential local mitigation strategies and ascertain the methods for reducing local air pollution exposure. For these purposes, the first part of the review is categorized into three groups: (i) improving urban ventilation and turbulence level for pollutant dispersion. (ii) controlling source-receptor pathways by constructing barriers. (iii) capturing and mitigating air pollution by introducing pollutant sinks. Subsequently, a series of studies on optimization frameworks are summarized. It is found that surrogate model-based optimization frameworks efficiently handle multi-objective optimizations at a low computational cost. Finally, this review examines publications on the evaluation theory for pollutant dispersion to determine feasible methods for the removal of pollutants from urban areas.

In the present study, field experiments were conducted for measuring Hg in ambient atmosphere and upland agricultural soils within a radius of 10 km surrounding a large scale coal-fired power plant (1550 MW) in Tangshan, Hebei province. Short-term (20 min) average of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM or Hg0) in ambient air varying from 1.5 to 9.0 ng/m3 and total Hg (THg) in surface agricultural soil (0–20 cm) varying from 9.2 to 43.5 μg/kg at different sites were observed. THg in two soil cores decreased with depth, with concentrations being 2–2.5 times higher in the surface layer than that in the deep layer (50–60 cm), indicating the possibility of the atmospheric input of Hg. Based on the information of the total atmospheric Hg emission since this CFPP’s operation in 1970s and the increased THg in nearby soils, it was estimated that about 3.9% discharged Hg has accumulated in the nearby agricultural soils. The low retention rate of the total emitted Hg by soils is a result of high proportion of Hg0 (79.5%) in stack gas emission and potential loss of Hg from soil surface reemission. The positive shifting (~ 0.5‰) of Hg isotopic signature (δ202Hg) from deep soil to surface soil reflected Hg deposition from nearby CFPP emissions that are featured with much heavier Hg isotopic signatures inherited from feed coal (δ202Hg: –0.50‰) and different combustion products (δ202Hg: –0.95 to 3.71‰) compared with that in deep soil layer (δ202Hg: ca –1.50‰). Overall, this study demonstrated that this CFPP has a slight but distinguishable effect on the elevation of ambient GEM and agricultural soil THg in the local environment.

These approaches are normally empirically derived and were limited to relevant conditions. The deviations may be also related to the inlet or outlet temperatures of the secondary fluid in the heat pump gas cooler. Thus, this study aims to develop a rational method to predict optimum discharge pressure based on the simulated data through exergy analysis. To simplify the simulation, the model assumes the constant heat transfer capacity (UA) within the evaporator, and the model is verified with a 70 kW trans-critical CO2 heat pump system. The influence of inlet (10–45 °C) and outlet (40–90 °C) water temperature on the system performance are examined from the perspective of the first and the second law of thermodynamics. The detailed exergy analysis for the cycle and each component is elaborated in detail subject to discharge pressure. It is found that the maximum COP declines but the Popt rises upon variable outlet temperature and inlet temperature of heated water. The Popt is mainly controlled by a gas cooler when compared to other components. The irreversibility of the gas cooler accounts for 3% to 3.6% of total heating capacity when Popt occurs regardless of the inlet or outlet water temperature. The corresponding maximum COP is about 4 times larger than the reciprocal of the irreversibility rate of the compressor. Yet, a new strategy is proposed to predict the Popt in terms of the irreversibility of the gas cooler. The proposed method is rationally based and can quickly diagnose the Popt through the four terminal thermal states instead of continuous monitoring the local maximum COP. Compared with the eight existing correlations listed in Appendix, the proposed novel method yields the least average and standard deviation of 2.6% and 3.1%, respectively when compared to the existing correlations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide, optimal discharge pressure; Exergy analysis; Heat pump; Irreversibility; Trans-critical","Cooling systems; Exergy; Forecasting; Heat pump systems; Heat transfer; Pumps; Temperature; Carbon dioxide, optimal discharge pressure; Discharge pressures; Exergy Analysis; Gas cooler; Heat pumps; Heat-pump systems; Heated waters; Irreversibility; Maximum COP; Trans-critical; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105899621

Environ-economic evaluation of the overall AD process at different total solids (TS) was performed with the estimated treatment capacity of 9600 tons/year and service life of 20 years. Results showed that TS increase from 6% to 22% enhanced both cumulative and volumetric methane (CH4) production. Further TS increase to 25%, however, reduced CH4 yield. Environ-economic assessment indicated that TS increase enhanced volumetric waste treatment capacity and thus AD environmental footprints. Environmental credits from digestate and biogas utilization could compensate the adverse environmental impacts of other processes in AD plants. Furthermore, biogas and nutrients in digestate determined AD net-present value.

Packing density and mechanical strength were much greater than those using normal tubular and disc membranes. The membrane in the central channel of monolith was thinner than these of the side channels. The best monolith supported SSZ-13 membrane (with spacers) showed a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 72 and a CO2 permeance of 163 × 10-8 mol/(m2 s Pa) at pressure drop of 2.0 MPa and feed flow rate of 20 standard L/min for an equimolar CO2/CH4 mixture. Such separation performance was higher than most of zeolite membranes prepared on single-channel tubes or discs. The effects of temperature, pressure drop and fluid state on separation performance of the membranes were investigated. The extent of concentration polarization through monolith supported membrane was modelled by the concentration polarization index (CPI). Increasing feed flow rate and inserting spacers into the channels were effective ways to reduce the negative influence of concentration polarization.

This paper innovatively adopted the meta-analysis method in view of published LCA studies to assess the energy use and environmental impacts of WWTPs during their life cycle. The search and screening process determined a useful data source with 54 LCA literatures covering 109 relevant case studies. The meta-analysis results revealed that, compared with other regions, the WWTPs in China have the higher intensity in terms of energy use, global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical oxidation (PHO), freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FETP) and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential (TETP) categories, implying that the energy conservation and emission reduction strategies are necessary to wastewater treatment industry in China. Moreover, compared with A/A/O and CASS processes, the A/O process consumes less energy and results in lower GWP and AP intensity, but affects adversely the natural water-body protection due to undesirable treatment efficiency. Furthermore, the treatment capacities of medium and large scales (i.e. 5-20 × 104 m3/d) are most reasonable sizes for WWTPs since their intensity of energy use, GWP, EP and AP are under a relatively low level. Finally, a strict effluent discharge standard is highly recommended from the perspective of protecting aquatic environment, although it leads to a higher energy consumption. The findings of this study could provide valuable references for promoting healthy and sustainable wastewater treatment industry. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Energy use; Environmental impacts; Life cycle; Meta-analysis; Wastewater treatment plants","fresh water; effluent; energy conservation; energy intensity; energy use; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; meta-analysis; sustainable development; wastewater treatment plant; acidification; aquatic environment; China; ecotoxicity; effluent; energy; energy conservation; environmental impact; environmental management; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; hydraulic retention time; life cycle; photooxidation; pollution; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; animal; environment; life cycle stage; meta analysis; sewage; wastewater; water management; China; Animals; China; Environment; Life Cycle Stages; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096127193

Am. Chem. Soc., 2019,141, 6569]. These catalysts feature slightly acidic imidazolium moieties in the secondary coordination sphere and reduce CO2at mild electrochemical potentials. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the electronic structure and reactivity for the CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR) over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using [Mn[bpyMe(ImMe)](CO)3Br]+(1+). Our work indicates that, in the absence of water, the imidazolium ligand stabilizes the Mn-CO2adduct through hydrogen bonding-like interactions, similar to the activated CO2molecule in the C-cluster of the Ni,Fe-carbon monoxide dehydrogenase II, and assists the protonation steps during CO2RR and HER. More significantly, based on the energy span model, we demonstrate that the selectivity for CO2fixation over proton reduction results from a higher activation energy for yielding the manganese dihydrogen intermediate before H2release, which is the TOF determining transition state (TDTS) under an applied potential ofΦ= −1.82 VversusFc0/+. The calculated TOF also reflects the selectivity for CO2RR, which is four orders of magnitude larger than for HER, consistent with the CPE experiments that show no hydrogen was obtained. In the case of CO2reduction, the TOF determining intermediate (TDI) corresponds to the doubly reduced active catalyst,1C2(red2), which features a manganese(0) center that couples ferromagnetically with one unpaired electron in the π* orbital of bipyridine. On the other hand, for HER, the metal-hydride intermediate,1C2(I11-R), is the TDI. Finally, second-order perturbation analyses imply that the strongest hydrogen bonding-like interaction at the C2 position in1+contributes to the higher catalytic activity with respect to [Mn[bpyMe(ImMe2)](CO)3Br]+(2+) and [Mn[bpyMe(ImMe4)](CO)3Br]+(3+) for CO2fixation, consistent with the experimental data. © the Owner Societies 2021.",,"Activation energy; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysts; Electronic structure; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Iron compounds; Manganese removal (water treatment); Applied potentials; Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; Computational studies; Coordination sphere; Electrochemical potential; Metal hydride intermediates; Orders of magnitude; Second order perturbation; Manganese compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110526269

Short-term Mega-events such as international meetings, sports tournaments, and traditional festivals can profoundly influence the local air quality. However, the extent of these influences and their role in improving or deteriorating the local air quality is still unclear. By collecting relative research from 75 publications based on more than 37 cities worldwide, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We calculated the log response ratio (RR) of the treatment (during) and control periods (before and after) of the Mega-events. The short-term policy control measures enacted during the Mega-Events consisting of meetings caused a significant decline (by −44.06%) in the ambient PM2.5 concentration. The mean daily PM2.5 concentration reduced from more than 100.00 μg/m3 before the events to 60.39 μg/m3, which is below the WHO (World Health Organization) interim target – 1 (75 μg/m3). On the contrary, setting off fireworks during the festival increased the ambient PM2.5 concentrations by 89.57% on average, with a mean daily value of 254.22 μg/m3. The variations in the effects of all event types on the air quality were primarily influenced by the background PM2.5 concentrations, with a negative correlation throughout. Moreover, the impact of events with policy control measures was also influenced by the year of the event, level of control, and location (suburban/urban) of the monitoring sites. Our findings provide evidence of the potential of human intervention on PM2.5 pollution reduction. We further highlight the crucial role of background pollution level in implementing policies during the Mega-events, which can benefit the environmental governance of developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Human activity; Mega-event; PM2.5; Policy control measure; Traditional festival","Developing countries; Control measures; Human activities; Mega-event; Meta-analysis; PM$-2.5$; Policy control; Policy control measure; Short term; Systematic Review; Traditional festival; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; festival; human activity; meta-analysis; particulate matter; pollution control; urban area; air quality; article; city; developing country; human; meta analysis; particulate matter 2.5; systematic review; World Health Organization; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental protection; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103565907

Given the priority structure of the goals, the total deviations from predetermined goals are minimized in the upper level, while the lower level of the model serves as the service route choice equilibrium problem of logistics users. To solve the proposed model, a genetic algorithm is developed, where the method of successive average (MSA) is embedded.

As a typical stable SOC, soil phytolith-occluded organic carbon (PhytOC) is one of the important mechanisms of long-term soil carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the distribution characteristics, accumulation law, and cycle process of soil PhytOC in fragile karst ecosystems are still not cognized. The purpose of the present study is to obtain the distribution pattern and change law of total SOC and soil PhytOC in different land cover types and to clarify the influencing factors and driving mechanism of land cover change on total SOC and soil PhytOC content and storage in the karst ecosystem. Materials and methods: In the typical karst area of Southwest China, five representative land cover types, including bamboo forest (BF), coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (CBF), shrub (SH), grassland (GL), and agricultural abandoned land (AAL), were selected as the research objects. The total SOC contents, soil PhytOC contents, and soil physical and chemical properties were determined in the lab. Soil PhytOC and total SOC storage were calculated by the formulas. Data were analyzed statistically by linear regression, Pearson correlation analysis, LSD multiple comparison, and principal component analysis. Results and discussion: Land cover change can affect obviously total SOC and soil PhytOC content and storage in the karst subtropical forest. Among the five land cover types, soil phytolith content, soil PhytOC content and storage, and total SOC storage of each soil profile in the BF were all significantly higher than those of the other four land covers. Among the three different soil profiles of 0~10, 10~20, and 20~30 cm, total SOC and soil PhytOC contents of the surface soil layer in the five land cover types were all the most, and the content decreased obviously with the increase of soil depth. There were significant positive correlation between the contents of soil available silicon, phytolith, and PhytOC. Soil available silicon content, soil phytolith content, and soil C/N were significantly positive related with the accumulation of total SOC and soil PhytOC. Soil PhytOC content or storage was significant or extremely significant related with total SOC content or storage. Conclusions: The results of the present study provided scientific bases for further evaluating the carbon sink capacity of soil PhytOC in the karst ecosystem, in SW China, and have important values in the reduction of carbon emission and increase of carbon sink to combat the global warming. In addition, the results of the present study also can provide theoretical references for the vegetation restoration of karst rocky desertification in Southwest China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Karst; Land cover change; Phytolith; Reserves; Soil organic carbon","accumulation; carbon sink; forest ecosystem; karst; land cover; organic carbon; phytolith; soil carbon; subtropical region; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105428618

Yet, most LCA on corn production focused on process-based approach, without considering environmental impacts embedded in economic service activities (e.g., insurance and overhead management). Besides, joint assessment on environmental and economic impacts of various corn production practices as well as trade-offs analysis between different environmental impact categories for different corn production practices also remains rare. To fill these knowledge gaps, a hybrid inventory approach is applied to account for environmental impacts of corn production employing different practices in different regions of Nebraska (a representative state of western US Corn Belt). The environmental and economic impacts of corn production are found to vary with geographical regions, water sources, and corn seed hybrids. Trade-offs between global warming potential (GWP) and overall environmental burdens (represented as a composite single score) are found among practices; that is, practices with lower GWP do not necessarily have a lower overall environmental single score (a composite of ten environmental impact categories). Improving the energy efficiency of existing diesel irrigation pumps offers an important avenue to reduce GHGs and environmental impacts from irrigated corn practices. Environmental impacts from economic service activities only have a marginal contribution to the overall results; among all practices, the largest contributions are on fossil fuel depletion (1.6 to 6.6%), implying that a process-based inventory is sufficient. The production costs and crop yield among the seven practices range from $145.6 to $218.0 per ton and 2286 to 6858 kg per acre. The analysis of crop yield variability shows that the irrigated practices help reduce variability of GWP, environmental single score, and production cost, compared to the rainfed practices. The methodology framework applying hybrid LCA and joint environmental and economic assessment at detailed process level can also be used to quantify the environmental impacts of other crops and be extended to develop fast and flexible assessment tool towards sustainable agricultural production. © 2021","Crop yield variability; Environmental economic input-output inventory; Hybrid life cycle assessment; Sustainable agricultural production","Agricultural robots; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Crops; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Geographical regions; Global warming; Life cycle; Environmental and economic impacts; Environmental burdens; Flexible assessments; Fossil-fuel depletions; Global warming potential; Marginal contribution; Process-based approach; Sustainable agricultural; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105342134

However, it remains uncertain which C input pathway is more important and how different C inputs affect the community composition of the soil fauna. A long-term (9 years) field C input manipulation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of C inputs on soil nematodes. Plant removal, litter addition, and litter removal were carried out to simulate changes in below- and aboveground C inputs. Results showed that plant removal significantly decreased soil resource availability (i.e., the soil organic C and total nitrogen). Plant removal also decreased nematode abundance (73.09%) and genus richness (17.98%). The relative abundance of bacterivores was enhanced but plant parasites and omnivores-predators were reduced by plant removal. The significantly lower soil pH and higher NO3−-N concentrations under the plant removal treatment are probably responsible for changing the community structure. Litter addition increased nematode abundance by 37.88%, but litter removal decreased the genus richness by 9.39%. There were significant interactive effects of plant removal and litter manipulation on the total nematode abundance and genus richness. Our observations suggest that belowground C input has greater impacts on soil nematodes than the above-ground C input, and that the impacts of litter on the soil nematode community could be mediated by living plants. © 2021","Bottom-up effects; Litter addition; Litter removal; Plant removal; Trophic structure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100263672

However, understanding of the underlying response mechanisms remains poor, especially for the combination (hot drought). We conducted a 4-year field experiment to examine both individual and interactive effects of drought and heat wave on carbon cycling of a semiarid grassland across individual, functional group, community and ecosystem levels. Drought did not change below-ground biomass (BGB) or above-ground biomass (AGB) due to compensation effects between grass and non-grass functional groups. However, consistently decreased BGB under heat waves limited such compensation effects, resulting in reduced AGB. Ecosystem CO2 fluxes were suppressed by droughts, attributed to stomatal closure-induced reductions in leaf photosynthesis and decreased AGB of grasses, while CO2 fluxes were little affected by heat waves. Overall the hot drought produced the lowest leaf photosynthesis, AGB and ecosystem CO2 fluxes although the interactions between heat wave and drought were usually not significant. Our results highlight that the functional group compensatory effects that maintain community-level AGB rely on feedback of root system responses, and that plant adjustments at the individual level, together with shifts in composition at the functional group level, co-regulate ecosystem carbon sink strength under climate extremes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biomass; climate extremes; CO2 flux; compensatory effect; global change; Inner Mongolia; leaf physiology; precipitation","biomass; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; drought; functional group; grass; grassland; heat wave; root system; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083636106

While great efforts were being devoted to developing highly efficient catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs), electrode improvement is another important direction for the real-world application of CO2 conversion. Toward a better understanding on the mechanism of the highly selective CO2RR catalyst on the electrode, an in-situ, high-resolution, and high-speed microscale visualization techniques are applied to observe the generation and detachment of the CO2RR products (CO and H2) on the electrode coated with molecularly dispersed electrocatalyst of methoxy group functionalized nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc-OMe MDE). The catalyst exhibits superb selectivity towards CO formation with Faradic efficiency above 98% from −0.56 V to −0.77 V vs. RHE and approaches 100% at −0.65 V vs. RHE. The CO and H2 bubbles are observed in CO2 and Ar atmosphere, which provide direct evidence for the high selectivity of NiPc-OMe MDE. Additionally, the number of reaction regions and their gas production rate increase as the applied cathodic potential increases. The in-situ optical visualization method employed in the electrochemical test system contributes to better electrode design of the CO2 electrolyzer to accelerate the transition from lab-scale investigation to industrialization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bubble behaviors; CO synthesis; Electrochemical CO2 reduction; High-speed and micro-scale visualization system; Molecularly dispersed electrocatalyst; Optical visualization","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Electrocatalysts; Gas industry; Reduction; Visualization; Cathodic potentials; Efficient catalysts; Electrochemical test; Lab-scale investigations; Nickel phthalocyanines; Optical visualization; Renewable electricity; Visualization technique; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105286319

However, as coal power would undergo significant changes under ambitious climate goals (2℃ or 1.5℃), it's not clear how the low-carbon transition of the power sector made at the provincial level would affect the catchment-level water resources in the future. With a power system model (MESEIC) and a unit-level coal-fired power unit dataset, this study explores different power sector transition pathways from 2020 to 2050, and maps out the catchment-level water stress risk of China's coal power with Monte Carlo method. Results show that the future power supply mix varies much under the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and carbon emission targets. Without carbon emission targets, coal power would continue to dominate the power supply mix advantage and would cause severe risk of water stress. Under SSP1-5, the national water withdrawal from coal power in 2050 would be 12.2–176.2 billion m3 under the reference scenario, but would decline to 10.7–59.2 billion m3 with 2℃ target and 0.11–35.5 billion m3 with 1.5℃ target. Compared with the 2℃ target, the catchment-level water stress risk generated by coal-fired power plants in north China would be significantly reduced under the stricter target of 1.5℃. However, the benefits would be reduced under SSP5 because of the application of carbon capture and storage. This study reveals the strong synergies between reducing carbon emissions and alleviating water stress risk in China's power sector, but regional risk should be noted while achieving the carbon reduction targets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission target; Coal-fired power plants; Risk assessment; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Water stress","Carbon capture; Catchments; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal storage; Fossil fuel power plants; Mining; Monte Carlo methods; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Runoff; Water supply; Carbon emission target; Carbon emissions; Coal power; Coal-fired power plant; Emission targets; Power sector; Power supply; Risks assessments; Shared socioeconomic pathway; Water stress; Coal; carbon emission; catchment; climate change; coal-fired power plant; electricity supply; Monte Carlo analysis; power generation; water resource; water stress; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105286065

The positive impact of natural gas on inhibiting PM2.5 emissions is well documented, but the regional difference in this field is scant. Therefore, this study assesses the impact of natural gas consumption on PM2.5 emissions and examines the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) relationship between economic growth and PM2.5 emissions, based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 1998 to 2016. Furthermore, the regional difference is analyzed from the perspective of economic development and natural gas development. The estimation results report two inverse relationships between PM2.5 emissions and natural gas consumption in the case of China. Specifically, at the national level, PM2.5 emissions has risen by 0.023% with natural gas consumption demonstrating 1% growth, which indicates that natural gas consumption in China will exacerbate PM2.5 emissions. However, the use of natural gas has an additional effect on PM2.5 emissions in the regions with high levels of natural gas consumption. For the high consumption region of natural gas, a 1% increment of natural gas usage inhibits the release of PM2.5 by 0.017%. The result implies that the mitigation effects on PM2.5 emissions only arise in the areas where natural gas is largely used. Furthermore, the validity of EKC pattens between economic growth and PM2.5 emissions is confirmed across China, and the EKC has reached its peak. Varied causality links among PM2.5 emissions, economic development, and natural gas consumption have been distinguished according to the causality flow. Finally, two efficient policy implications are proposed to address PM2.5 emissions and accelerate the growth of the natural gas industry in China. © 2020","China; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Natural Gas Consumption; PM2.5 Emissions; Regional Analysis","Economic and social effects; Economics; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Natural gas; Public policy; Regional planning; Environmental Kuznets curves; Fine particulate matter; Inverse relationship; Mitigation effects; Natural gas consumption; Natural gas development; Policy implications; Regional differences; Natural gas wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096679355

The construction industry is one of China's biggest carbon emitters, and its peak has a direct impact on China's carbon commitment. Due to the regional heterogeneity of different provinces, the carbon emission of construction industry (CECI) at provincial level is of unique significance. To accurately predict the peak of provincial CECI, a prediction model was established by system dynamics, including direct CECI, indirect CECI and operational CECI. Taking Jiangsu province as an example, the single and multiple scenario settings with increasing R&D investment, promoting energy-saving buildings and implementing carbon trading from 2016 to 2030 was carried out, indicating that: 1) Without any carbon emission reduction measures, the CECI would maintain an annual growth rate of 5.58% to reach 530.61 million tons by 2030, and the indirect and operational CECI account for the majority of total with an average annual growth rate of 8.02% and 2.79% respectively. 2) All three measures had good carbon reduction effects, which would reduce the total CECI by 26.46% 21.68% and 10.68% respectively by 2030, but only when implemented simultaneously can CECI peak before 2030, 308.77 million tons at 2029. In the end, three policy implications was put forward. The framework presented in this paper provided a basis for the prediction of peak CECI in a province or state, which can help policy makers plan a more reasonable low-carbon development roadmap. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; Delphi method; Dynamic modeling; Scenario simulation; System dynamics; Trend analysis","Carbon; Decarbonization; Dynamic models; Emission control; Energy conservation; Forecasting; Investments; Public policy; System theory; Carbon emissions; Decarbonisation; Delphi method; Dynamics modelling; Global development; Jiangsu province; Scenario simulations; Scenarios analysis; System Dynamics; Trend analysis; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103737064

Thus, a city’s main contributing sectors need to be identified. Territorial-based footprints focus on the final energy consumption, which is derived from the stationary and transport sectors. The consumption-based approach is based on consumption data, which are converted into carbon emissions using an input–output model. If the consumption-based approach is applied to an urban district not only emissions in the investigated area are considered, but also those that occur along the supply chain of consumed products in the urban district. The goal of this study was to apply and evaluate two different approaches to calculate an urban district’s carbon footprint to support climate protection management at the local government level. To achieve this goal, these two different approaches were applied to calculate the carbon emissions of the urban district Wedding in Berlin and were compared regarding criteria such as data availability and relevance. The footprints resulted in 400,947 t CO2 –eq. for the territorial approach and in 401,371 t CO2 –eq. per year for the consumption-based approach, which resulted in 4.61 t CO2 –eq and 4.62 t CO2 –eq per capita and year, respectively. Methodologically, the two approaches differ significantly, but the total results showed a difference of only 0.1%. Thus, this study cannot verify that the consumption-based approach mostly leads to higher emissions per capita in the Global North. This could be due to lower purchasing power and a higher share of multiple-person households in the relatively poor urban district of Wedding, Berlin. The territorial approach is more suitable to derive measures for local climate action, whereas the consumption-based approach highlights the responsibility of consumers for GHG emissions along the supply chain and the importance of the food sector. © 2021 by the authors.

The fiscal reform of 2014 contains the provisions for taxes on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, where ‘equivalent’ means that GHGs other than CO2 are expressed in CO2 terms depending on their global warming potential relative to that of CO2) as well as on local pollutants: particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The carbon tax is set at an amount of US$5 per ton of carbon dioxide (tCO2) emitted by stationary plants of at least 50 megawatts (MW), starting in 2017. This paper models a limited number of carbon tax scenarios, defined by different values of carbon tax and different ways of applying the tax. None of these scenarios represents a specific policy of the Government of Chile. Rather, scenarios are selected to help understand the main underlying relationships, transition points in the generation mix, and broad types of policy effects.

Yet, detailed knowledge about whether and how firms take adaptation action against flood hazards, including potential adaptation barriers, is surprisingly thin. We respond to this gap by offering an empirical analysis of small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), one of the front lines of future environmental risk. Drawing on qualitative interviews, our study has two main aims: first, to understand if adaptive action occurs more intensively among firms that previously faced high direct impacts, and second, to shed light on other internal firm characteristics as well as external conditions that determine firm decisions to undertake flood adaptation measures. We find that the majority of firms cope reactively to prevent severe flooding effects. Interestingly, experience with past events, including those of high impact, do not directly lead to long-term strategic adaptation. A lack of business capabilities and financial capacity, combined with insufficient support systems, largely hamper proactive adaptation. This leads to increased risks and self-reinforcing effects, which quickly endanger the future business viability of firms. Future research on adaptation to climate change should seek to improve understanding of adaptive capacities among SMEs, which are quite different from those of large international corporations. © 2021 The Authors","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Flood risk reduction; Ho Chi Minh City; Manufacturing firms; Vietnam",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107822649

In developing countries across the Middle East and North Africa, South East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the adoption of solar technology in agriculture to lift groundwater is rapidly expanding, following decreases in pump costs, economic incentives, and development partner initiatives. Solar irrigation potentially provides a cost-effective and sustainable energy source to secure food production and sustain livelihoods in line with multiple Sustainable Development Goals, but achieving such potential requires improved policies and institutions to coordinate across numerous stakeholders, objectives, and approaches. This paper uses cases and observations from across regions to propose a framework to support policy, regulation, and monitoring for environmentally sustainable and socio-economically inclusive solar irrigation investments. While not exhaustive, the components seek to address the intersection of energy, water and food security, as well as social equity. The paper emphasizes the need for an understanding of how solar irrigation can be scaled to be both accessible for smallholder farmers and environmentally sustainable. © 2021","Irrigation; Policy; Smallholder agriculture; Solar technology; Sustainability","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Food supply; Groundwater; Investments; Irrigation; Public policy; Carbon emissions; Carbon energy; Emission costs; Energy cost; Food production; Off-grid solar; Smallholder agriculture; Solar irrigations; Solar photovoltaics; Solar technology; Sustainable development; accessibility; agricultural technology; alternative energy; energy policy; irrigation; photovoltaic system; smallholder; solar power; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Middle East; North Africa; Southeast Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105893977

In this work, we explore the FEW nexus of conventional and techno-ecologically synergistic (TES) systems by evaluating combinations of various technological, agricultural, and ecological strategies from the viewpoints of electricity generation, food production, life cycle water use, carbon footprint, nutrient runoff, corporate profitability, and societal well-being. We evaluate activities related to power generation (coal and gas extraction and use, transportation options, cooling technologies, solar panels, wind turbines), food production (farming with and without tillage), waste utilization (carbon dioxide capture and conversion to hydrocarbons, green hydrogen), and ecological restoration (forests and wetlands). Application of this framework to the Muskingum River watershed in Ohio, U.S.A. indicates that seeking synergies between human and natural systems can provide innovative solutions that improve the FEW nexus while making positive contributions to society with greater respect for nature's limits. We show that the conventional engineering approach of relying only on technological approaches for meeting sustainability objectives can have limited environmental and societal benefits while reducing profitability. In contrast, techno-ecologically synergistic design between agricultural systems and wetlands can reduce nutrient runoff with little compromise in other goals. Additional synergies between farming and photovoltaic systems along with the use of wetlands can further improve the FEW nexus while reducing CO2 and nutrient emissions, with a relatively small compromise in corporate profitability. These results should motivate further work on innovative TES designs that can provide ""win-win""solutions for meeting global energy needs in an environmentally and socially beneficial manner. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Agricultural robots; Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Coal transportation; Conservation; Ecology; Electric power generation; Life cycle; Nutrients; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermal processing (foods); Wetlands; Agricultural system; Carbon dioxide capture; Ecological restoration; Electricity generation; Innovative solutions; Nutrient emissions; Photovoltaic systems; Sustainability objectives; Coal industry; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental restoration; food; food production; power generation; sustainability; sustainable development; technical efficiency; waste technology; Muskingum River; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110841923

Apart from efforts to achieve a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases so as to mitigate the problem, there is a perceived need for adaptation initiatives urgently. Ecosystems are known to play an important role in climate change adaptation processes, since some of the services they provide, may reduce the impacts of extreme events and disturbance, such as wildfires, floods, and droughts. This role is especially important in regions vulnerable to climate change such as the African continent, whose adaptation capacity is limited by many geographic and socio-economic constraints. In Africa, interventions aimed at enhancing ecosystem services may play a key role in supporting climate change adaptation efforts. In order to shed some light on this aspect, this paper reviews the role of ecosystems services and investigates how they are being influenced by climate change in Africa. It contains a set of case studies from a sample of African countries, which serve the purpose to demonstrate the damages incurred, and how such damages disrupt ecosystem services. Based on the data gathered, some measures which may assist in fostering the cause of ecosystems services are listed, so as to cater for a better protection of some of the endangered Africa ecosystems, and the services they provide. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Africa; Best practices; Climate change; Ecosystem services","Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Adaptation; Adaptation process; Africa; Best practices; Climate change adaptation; Ecosystem services; Extreme events; Greenhouses gas; Reduction of emissions; Wildfire floods; Climate change; adaptive management; best management practice; climate change; ecosystem service; endangered species; species conservation; Africa; climate change; ecosystem; review; Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102820217

The goals of reducing emissions from the transport sector and phasing out fossil-fueled vehicles in (urban) transport by 2050 present unrivaled opportunities to foster electro-mobility. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature and provides a detailed analysis of the current development of electro-mobility in Europe, assessing social, economic, and environmental aspects under a circular economy (CE) context. It also examines the existing challenges and suggests ways of addressing them towards improving the environmental performance of electro-mobility and the urban quality of life. The paper argues that a narrow technology-only agenda in electro-mobility will be less successful without the imperative of the CE, including not just materials and resources but also energy, to unlock the medium-term co-benefits of de-carbonization of both the transport as well as the building and energy sectors. The paper critically reviews some of the anticipated future developments that may guide the growth of this rapidly growing field into a CE. © 2021 by the authors.

Self-protective measures are available, but population uptake is variable. It is essential to understand human beliefs and behaviours related to air pollution in order to understand the lack of self-protection in communities. As a prelude to undertaking a comprehensive assessment of children's attitudes and beliefs on the health effects of TRAP exposure, we sought to develop and validate an appropriate instrument. Study design: This study used exploratory sequential mixed methods. Methods: This instrument, based on the constructs of the health belief model (HBM), aimed to determine factors predicting wearing a mask to protect against TRAP exposure. An initial literature-based questionnaire was modified using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and a quantitative survey pilot. This study included 121 school students and nine professional experts in Vietnam. The questionnaire was tested for content validity, agreement, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency. Results: The concordance of questionnaire items between two repeated assessments ranged from 47.2% to 78.3%, intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.16 to 0.87 and Cronbach's internal reliability coefficient for the instrument was 0.60. Conclusion: The self-administered instrument, based on the HBM, is suitable to understand health attitudes and beliefs related to self-protective behaviours to reduce TRAP exposure. © 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health","Children; Health belief model; Instrument development; Traffic-related air pollution","atmospheric pollution; child; correlation; health belief; health impact; ideology; questionnaire survey; traffic emission; air pollution; Article; child behavior; content validity; exhaust gas; exposure; health belief; health impact assessment; human; information processing; internal consistency; interview; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; student; test retest reliability; validation process; Viet Nam; attitude to health; child; prevention and control; psychometry; reproducibility; Viet Nam; Air Pollution; Child; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111010226

While the effects of competition and fire have been considered largely in isolation, theory suggests that competition with grasses for water may limit the ability of juvenile trees to grow rapidly enough to escape flames holding them in a firetrap. This study examined the growth and survival rates of trees at different life stages on plots subjected to four different grass removal treatments with those on plots subjected to three different fire treatments in two mesic savannas in Mali. Two hypotheses were tested: (i) grass removal treatments will not significantly increase tree height growth rates; and (ii), burning earlier in the dry season will result in faster height growth rates and lower death rates than burning later. Trees were measured over 2 years. To compare how treatments affected tree growth, data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance with treatment type as a fixed factor. We find that grass removal resulted in increased juvenile tree growth varying from 147 to 205% depending on treatment. Grass treatments of hoeing, clipping and herbicide resulted in fewer tree deaths. Both early and late fires resulted in increased tree growth rates, although late fires resulted in more deaths. Mid-season fires did not significantly affect growth rates. Findings suggests that competition with grasses slows juvenile tree height growth and that a change in competition intensity is sufficient to cause a shift in savanna state to a more tree dominated one with implications for savanna management and carbon sequestration schemes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Disturbance; Fire trap; Juvenile; Mesic; Savanna; Tree/grass ratio; West Africa","carbon sequestration; dry season; grass; growing season; growth; herbicide; savanna; seasonal variation; tree; Mali; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107627698

Mining activities that are not organized due to the mineral exploration process have resulted in many forest areas experiencing degradation. This degradation certainly reduces the level of carbon sequestration in the area, impacting the sustainability of environmental functions around the mining area. The high carbon stock (HCS) approach is a way to help companies implement their 'no deforestation' commitments. The high carbon stock approach will identify forests that must be protected and land that can be developed. Forests with high carbon stocks are maintained because they function as carbon stores, habitats for biodiversity, and provide the necessities of life for local communities. Therefore, this study aims to obtain data on the potential for carbon stocks and create a spatial model for distributing carbon content in the concession area of PT. Vale Indonesia can later be determined as high conservation value (HCV) areas using the high carbon stock approach. Measurement of carbon content in the study used an allometric equation that has been developed, then the distribution of carbon was made using the spatial vegetation index model obtained from Sentinel 2 imagery. The results showed an area of 30,526.49 (42.97%), which had high carbon stock with an average carbon stock of 106.09 ton/ha, which needed to be maintained as an area of high conservation value in the mining area of PT.

The relationship between satellite phenology and climate indices, namely MEI (Multivariate ENSO Index), PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and SAM (Southern Annular Mode) were established using statistical analyses for non-stationary patterns. The annual mode of phenological activity fluctuated in strength through time from the semiarid region to the border of southern Patagonia. Concomitantly, enhanced synchrony between EVI and climatic oscillations appeared over interannual cycles. Cross correlations revealed that variability in MEI was the lead predictor of EVI fluctuations over scales shorter than 4 months at lower latitudes and for the most poleward study site. The PDO was correlated with EVI over lags longer than 4 months at low latitude sites, while the SAM showed relationships with EVI only for sites located around 40◦ S. Our results indicate that the long-term phenological variability of the vegetation within protected areas along southwestern South America is controlled by processes linked to climate indices and that their influence varies latitudinally. Further studies over longer time scales will be needed to improve our understanding the impacts of climate change on vegetation condition and its effect over phenological variability. © 2021 by the authors.

In this topical review, we synthesise the literature to explain recent trends in global and regional emissions in each of these sectors. To contextualise our review, we present estimates of GHG emissions trends by sector from 1990 to 2018, describing the major sources of emissions growth, stability and decline across ten global regions. Overall, the literature and data emphasise that progress towards reducing GHG emissions has been limited. The prominent global pattern is a continuation of underlying drivers with few signs of emerging limits to demand, nor of a deep shift towards the delivery of low and zero carbon services across sectors. We observe a moderate decarbonisation of energy systems in Europe and North America, driven by fuel switching and the increasing penetration of renewables. By contrast, in rapidly industrialising regions, fossil-based energy systems have continuously expanded, only very recently slowing down in their growth. Strong demand for materials, floor area, energy services and travel have driven emissions growth in the industry, buildings and transport sectors, particularly in Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and South-East Asia. An expansion of agriculture into carbon-dense tropical forest areas has driven recent increases in AFOLU emissions in Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa. Identifying, understanding, and tackling the most persistent and climate-damaging trends across sectors is a fundamental concern for research and policy as humanity treads deeper into the Anthropocene. © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite their importance, monitoring these systems over large scales remains challenging due to difficulties in obtaining extensive up-to-date ground surveys and the need for high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery for effective space-borne monitoring. In this study, we developed methodologies to advance the monitoring of tidal marshes and adjacent deepwaters in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast United States. We combined Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 optical imagery to classify marshes and open water in both regions, with user’s and producer’s accuracies exceeding 89%. This methodology enables the assessment of marsh loss through conversion to open water at an annual resolution. We used time-series Sentinel-1 imagery to classify persistent and non-persistent marsh vegetation with greater than 93% accu-racy. Non-persistent marsh vegetation serves as an indicator of salinity regimes in tidal wetlands. Additionally, we mapped two invasive species: wetlands invasive Phragmites australis (common reed) with greater than 80% accuracy and deepwater invasive Trapa natans (water chestnut) with greater than 96% accuracy. These results have important implications for improved monitoring and management of coastal wetlands ecosystems. © 2021 by the authors.

Concurrently, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, complicated with S-protein mutations and other variants, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 2.5 million deaths globally. Chronic air pollution-mediated cardiopulmonary diseases have been associated with an increased incidence of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation following COVID-19 transmission. While the underlying mechanisms responsible for this association remain elusive, air pollutant-induced vascular oxidative stress and inflammatory responses have been implicated in amplifying COVID-19-mediated cytokine release and vascular thrombosis. In addition, prolonged exposure to certain types of particulate matter (PM2.5, d &lt; 2.5 μm) has also been correlated with increased lung epithelial and vascular endothelial expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors to which the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S) bind for fusion and internalization into host cells. Emerging literature has linked high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection to regions with elevated levels of PM2.5, suggesting that COVID-19 lockdowns have been implicated in regional reductions in air pollutant-mediated cardiopulmonary effects.

The aim of this study is to explore attitudinal and situational predictors of support for residential curbside green bin programs. Using responses to 517 household surveys from the mid-sized Canadian cities of London, Ontario (proposed green bin program) and Kitchener-Waterloo (KW), Ontario (operating green bin program for 10+ years) comparison of means t-tests, correlations and linear regression are used to test five hypotheses derived from the food waste and waste diversion literatures that predict green bin support: situational factors, current food wasting, theory of planned behaviour attitudes, concern that green bin encourages food wasting, and concern that food waste ends up in the garbage regardless of green bin. There is some support for all five hypotheses. Residents in Kitchener-Waterloo were significantly more supportive (83%) than those in London (65%). While residents in both communities are supportive because of the perceived convenience and environmental benefits of the green bin, the number of regression model predictors is greater in London (16 compared to 9 for Kitchener-Waterloo). The findings overall suggest sustained municipal education at the implementation stage may lead to positive resident habituation to green bin and thus, durable public buy-in. © 2021","Comparative; Convenience; Curbside; Food waste; Green bin; TPB","Greenhouse gases; Regression analysis; Software testing; Comparative; Convenience; Curbside; Curbside collections; Food waste; Food waste collection; Green bin; Greenhouse gas emissions; Ontario; TPB; Surveys; comparative study; food waste; household survey; prediction; urban area; waste disposal; adult; article; breed; city; education; England; female; food waste; habituation; household; human; human experiment; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; Ontario; resident; Theory of Planned Behavior; food; waste; waste disposal; Canada; Kitchener; London [Ontario]; Ontario [Canada]; Waterloo; Cities; Food; Garbage; Ontario; Refuse Disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109367286

Scientists and policy analysts increasingly seek to develop programs and policies which recognize the importance of mitigation of climate change and insurance of ecological sustainability when managing agricultural soils. In response, many countries are exploring options to develop local land-use carbon inventories to better understand the flow of carbon in agriculture to estimate its contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting. For instance, the Canadian province of Ontario does not currently have its own GHG inventory and relies on the Canada’s National Inventory Report (NIR). To address this, the province explored options to develop its own land-use carbon inventory to better understand the carbon resource in agricultural soils. As part of this undertaking, a gap analysis was conducted to identify the critical information gaps and limitations in estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring to develop a land-use carbon inventory (LUCI) for the cropland sector in Ontario. We conducted a review of analytical and modeling methods used to quantify GHG emissions and reporting for the cropland sectors in Canada, and compared them with the methods used in seven other countries (i.e., France, United Kingdom; Germany; United States of America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan). From this comparison, four target areas of research were identified to consider in the development of a cropland sector LUCI in Ontario. First, there needs to be a refinement of the modelling approach used for SOC accounting. The Century model, which is used for Ontario’s cropland sector, can benefit from updates to the crop growth model and from the inclusion of manure management and other amendments. Secondly, a raster-based spatially explicit modelling approach is recommended as an alternative to using polygon-based inputs for soil data and census information for land management. This approach can leverage readily available Earth Observation (EO) data (e.g., remote sensing maps, digital soil maps). Thirdly, the contributions from soil erosion need to be included in inventory estimates of SOC emissions and removals from cropland. Fourth, establishment of an extensive network of long-term experimental sites to calibrate and validate the SOC models (i.e., CENTURY) is required. This can be done by putting in place a ground-truth program, through farmer-led research initiatives and collaboration, to deal with uncertainties due to spatial variability and regional climates. This approach would provide opportunities for farmers to collaborate on data collection by keeping detailed records of their cropping and soil management practices, and crop yields. © 2021 by the authors.

The work considers the impact of current and historical sources of Hg on sediment pollution, together with the influence of different environmental parameters, including water inflows from the North Sea. Surface sediments (top 5 cm) were collected in 2016–2017 at 91 stations located in different areas of the Baltic Sea, including Belt Sea, Arkona Basin, Bornholm Basin, Gdańsk Basin, West Gotland Basin, East Gotland Basin, and the Bothnian Sea. Besides, the particulate matter suspended in the surface and near-bottom water was also collected. The analysis of total Hg concentration and individual Hg forms in collected samples was carried out using a 5-step thermodesorption method. This method allows for the identification of three labile and thus biologically available, fractions of Hg, which are mercury halides, organic Hg, mercury oxide and sulphate. Two stable fractions, mercury sulphide and residual Hg, were also determined. The highest Hg concentrations, reaching 341 ng g−1, were measured in the highly industrialised Kiel Bay, which was additionally a munition dumping site during and after World War II. High Hg level, ranging from 228 to 255 ng g−1, was also recorded in the surface sediments of the Arkona Basin, which was a result of the cumulative effect of several factors, such as deposition of Hg-rich riverine matter, favourable hydrodynamic conditions and military activities in the past. The relatively elevated Hg concentrations, varying from 60 to 264 ng g−1, were found in the Gdańsk Basin, a region under strong anthropopressure and dominated by soft sediments. The sum of labile Hg in sediments was high and averaged 67% (with the domination of organic Hg compounds), which means that a large part of Hg can be released to the water column. It was found that the water inflows from the North Sea intensify the remobilisation of Hg and its transformation into bioavailable labile forms. As a consequence, the load of Hg introduced into the trophic chain can increase. Despite the significant reduction of Hg emission into the Baltic in the last decades, surface sediments can be an important secondary Hg source in the marine ecosystem. This is especially dangerous in the case of the western Baltic Sea. © 2021, The Author(s).","Baltic Sea; Inflow events; Mercury; Sea-dumped munition; Speciation; Surface sediments","bioavailability; bottom water; concentration (composition); inflow; mercury (element); particulate matter; sediment pollution; Arkona Basin; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Baltic Sea; Belt Sea; Bornholm Basin; Bothnian Sea; Danish Straits; Denmark; Germany; Gotland Basin; Gulf of Bothnia; Kiel Bay; North Sea; Schleswig-Holstein; mercury; Baltic States; bioavailability; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; North Sea; sediment; water pollutant; Baltic States; Biological Availability; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Mercury; North Sea; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102281065

Water deficit leads to increasing physiological stress in plants, likely affecting floral development and causing changes in floral morphology, nectar and pollen production or scent. Understanding how these floral traits are altered by water deficit is necessary to predict changes in plant–pollinator interactions and how communities are impacted in the future. Here we employ a meta-analysis approach to synthesize the current evidence of experimental water deficit on floral traits and plant–pollinator interactions. Furthermore, we explore experimental factors potentially increasing heterogeneity between studies and provide ideas how to enhance comparability between studies. In the end, we highlight future directions and knowledge gaps for floral traits and plant–pollinator interactions under water deficit. Our analysis showed consistent decreases in floral size, number of flowers and nectar volume to reduced water availability. Other floral traits such as the start of flowering or herkogamy showed no consistent pattern. This indicates that effects of reduced water availability differ between specific traits that are potentially involved in different functions such as pollinator attraction or efficiency. We found no general decreasing visitation rates with water deficit for flower–visitor interactions. Furthermore, the comparison of available studies suggests that increased reporting of plant stress severity and including more hydraulic and physiological measurements will improve the comparability across experiments and aid a more mechanistic understanding of plant–pollinator interactions under altered environmental conditions. Overall, our results show that water deficit has the potential to strongly affect plant–pollinator interactions via changes in specific floral traits. Linking these changes to pollination services and pollinator performance is one crucial step for understanding how changing water availability and drought events under climate change will alter plant and pollinator communities. © 2021 The Authors.

Identifying the distribution of SESs is crucial for integrating and formulating effective programs and policies to ensure human well-being while protecting and conserving natural systems. This work aims to identify and spatially map the boundaries of SESs to address the questions of how SESs can be delineated and what the characteristics of these systems are. The study was carried out for the state of Uttarakhand, India, a part of the Central Himalaya. The presented approach for mapping and delineation of SESs merges socio-economic and ecological data. It also includes validation of delineated system boundaries. We used 32 variables to form socio-economic units and 14 biophysical variables for ecological units. Principal component analysis followed by sequential agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was used to delineate the units. The geospatial statistical analysis identified 6 socio-economic and 3 ecological units, together resulting in 18 SESs for the entire state. The major characteristics for SESs were identified as forest types and agricultural practices, indicating the influence and dependency of SESs on these two features. The database would facilitate diverse application studies in vulnerability assessment, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and other socio-ecological studies. Such a detailed database addresses particularly site-specific characteristics to reduce risks and impacts. Overall, the identified SESs will help in recognizing local needs and gaps in existing policies and institutional arrangements, and the given methodological framework can be applied for the entire Himalayan region and for other mountain systems across the world. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a field campaign was conducted to characterize κOA at a relative humidity of 80 % with hourly time resolution for the first time in the Pearl River Delta region of China. Observation results show that, during this campaign, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) dominated total organic aerosol mass (mass fraction > 70 % on average), which provides a unique opportunity to investigate influences of SOA formation on κOA. Results demonstrate that the commonly used organic aerosol oxidation level parameter O/C was weakly correlated with κOA and failed to describe the variations in κOA. However, the variations in κOA were well reproduced by mass fractions of organic aerosol factor resolved based on aerosol mass spectrometer measurements. The more oxygenated organic aerosol (MOOA) factor, exhibiting the highest average O/C (1/4 1) among all organic aerosol factors, was the most important factor driving the increase in κOA and was commonly associated with regional air masses. The less oxygenated organic aerosol (LOOA; average O/C of 0.72) factor revealed strong daytime production, exerting negative effects on κOA. Surprisingly, the aged biomass burning organic aerosol (aBBOA) factor also formed quickly during daytime and shared a similar diurnal pattern with LOOA but had much lower O/C (0.39) and had positive effects on κOA. The correlation coefficient between κOA and mass fractions of aBBOA and MOOA in total organic aerosol mass reached above 0.8. The contrasting effects of LOOA and aBBOA formation on κOA demonstrate that volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors from diverse sources and different SOA formation processes may result in SOA with different chemical composition, functional properties and microphysical structure, consequently exerting distinct influences on κOA and rendering single oxidation level parameters (such as O/C) unable to capture those differences. Aside from that, distinct effects of aBBOA on κOA were observed during different episodes, suggesting that the hygroscopicity of SOA associated with similar sources might also differ much under different emission and atmospheric conditions. Overall, these results highlight that it is imperative to conduct more research on κOA characterization under different meteorological and source conditions and examine its relationship with VOC precursor profiles and formation pathways to formulate a better characterization and develop more appropriate parameterization approaches in chemical and climate models. © Copyright:",,"aerosol formation; hygroscopicity; parameterization; relative humidity; temporal variation; volatile organic compound; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109496207

Between 2003 and 2019, degradation and disturbance accounted for 44% of forest carbon losses in the region, compared with 56% from deforestation (forest clearing). We found that land tenure played a decisive role in explaining these carbon losses, with Undesignated Public Forests and Other Lands (e.g., private properties) accounting for the majority (82%) of losses during the study period. Illegal deforestation and land grabbing in Undesignated Public Forests widespread and increasingly are important drivers of forest carbon emissions from the region. In contrast, indigenous Territories and Protected Natural Areas had the lowest emissions, demonstrating their effectiveness in preventing deforestation and maintaining carbon stocks. These trends underscore the urgent need to develop reliable systems for monitoring and reporting on carbon losses from forest degradation and disturbance. Together with improved governance, such actions will be crucial for Brazil to reduce pressure on standing forests; strengthen Indigenous land rights; and design effective climate mitigation strategies needed to achieve its national and international climate commitments. © Copyright © 2021 Kruid, Macedo, Gorelik, Walker, Moutinho, Brando, Castanho, Alencar, Baccini and Coe.","Amazon; emissions; forest degradation; land grabbing; land tenure; undesignated public forests",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112157928

Farmers in Jepara Regency have long been developing sugar palm agroforestry for starch. Increasing the use of sugar palm and the low knowledge of farmers about the potential of sugar palm plants are a threat to the existence of sugar palm agroforestry. This study aims to inventory the potential distribution of sugar palm with the support of remote sensing and field surveys in Pakis Aji, Bangsri, and Kembang sub-districts which was carried out in August-December 2020. The interpretation results used Landsat 8 imagery and Google Earth images in 1161 sugar palm objects with the largest number in Bangsri District. Remote sensing accuracy testing with the Omission-Commission method obtained a value of 90.8%, which means the accuracy value is very high. The correlation test between the value of vegetation density (NDVI) and the survey results obtained a value of R2 = 0.575 with a significance value of 0.00 <0.05.

The industrial sector is responsible for the overwhelming majority of emissions and needs to recognize its responsibility and contribute to mitigating the problem. Climate change and its impacts pose challenges with relevant economic implications that require a new stance on the part of companies. They need to assess and understand their exposure to climate events and develop processes to identify, assess, and respond to climate risks. This study's primary purpose is to provide an in-depth empirical analysis of the potential underlying variables influencing companies’ perceptions of exposure to climate risks. The research was conducted over a three-year period, based on 36 of the most carbon-intensive industries in the world, located in 15 countries. Evidence shows that companies feel more threatened by regulatory climate risks than physical and market risks regardless of the region. However, companies located in Europe have a greater perception of exposure to regulatory risks than companies in other regions, followed by BRICS’ companies. Perception has increased over the years in Europe. The modeling was done through a time-series cross-section-based analysis. To guarantee quality, precision, and consistency, the modeling was done using three models. The first regression model (Model 1) with panel data without robustness and two other models with verification of robustness, notably the robust covariance matrix White estimators (Model 2) and Driscoll and Kraay (Model 3) models. The evidence points out that “Climate regulation,” “Age,” “Profitability” and “Indebtedness” are the potential variables that influence the company's perception of exposure to climate risks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate risk disclosure; Exposure to climate risks; Largest carbon-intensive industries; Legitimacy theory; Management of climate risk; Risk perception","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Covariance matrix; Industrial emissions; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Time series analysis; Climate event; Climate risk disclosure; Economic implications; Empirical analysis; Exposure to climate risk; Industrial sector; Large carbon-intensive industry; Legitimacy theories; Management of climate risk; Public sector; Risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105561041

No data exist regarding its impact on PM2.5 pollution. We aimed to assess PM2.5 levels before, during, and after lockdown (7 March 2020–16 May 2020) in Volos, one of Greece’s most polluted industrialized cities, and compare PM2.5 levels with those obtained during the same period last year. Meteorological conditions were examined as confounders. Methods: The study period was discriminated into three phases (pre-lockdown: 7 March–9 March, lockdown: 10 March–4 May, and post-lockdown period: 5 May–16 May). A wireless sensors network was used to collect PM2.5, temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed data every 2 s. Results: The lockdown resulted in a significant drop of PM2.5 by 37.4% in 2020, compared to 2019 levels. The mean daily concentrations of PM2.5 exceeded the WHO’s guideline value for 24-h mean levels of PM2.5 35% of the study period. During the strictest lockdown (23 March to 4 May), the mean daily PM2.5 levels exceeded the standard 41% of the time. The transition from the pre-lockdown period into lockdown or post-lockdown periods was associated with lower PM2.5 concentrations. Conclusions: A reduction in the mean daily PM2.5 concentration was found compared to 2019. Lockdown was not enough to avoid severe exceedances of air pollution in Volos. © 2021 by the authors.

Going forward, the development of adaptation strategies and predictive models under future climate scenarios will require a better understanding of how both land-use and climate disturbances influence soil microbial functions over time. Between March and November 2018, we assessed the effects of climate change on the magnitude and temporal stability of soil basal respiration, soil microbial biomass and soil functional diversity across a range of land-use types and intensities in a large-scale field experiment. Soils were sampled from five common land-use types including conventional and organic croplands, intensive and extensive meadows, and extensive pastures, under ambient and projected future climate conditions (reduced summer precipitation and increased temperature) at the Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF) in Bad Lauchstädt, Germany. Land-use and climate treatment interaction effects were significant in September, a month when precipitation levels slightly rebounded following a period of drought in central Germany: compared to ambient climate, in future climate treatments, basal respiration declined in pastures and increased in intensive meadows, functional diversity declined in pastures and croplands, and respiration-to-biomass ratio increased in intensive and extensive meadows. Low rainfall between May and August likely strengthened soil microbial responses toward the future climate treatment in September. Although microbial biomass showed declining levels in extensive meadows and pastures under future climate treatments, overall, microbial function magnitudes were higher in these land-use types compared to croplands, indicating that improved management practices could sustain high microbial ecosystem functioning in future climates. In contrast to our hypothesis that more disturbed land-use systems would have destabilized microbial functions, intensive meadows and organic croplands showed stabilized soil microbial biomass compared to all other land-use types, suggesting that temporal stability, in addition to magnitude-based measurements, may be useful for revealing context-dependent effects on soil ecosystem functioning. © 2021 The Authors.

Assessing this latter effect is the aim of this paper. An agent-based model (ABM) was used to assess change in commercial activities by small and midsize companies in retail due to the development of parks. The paper focuses on the potential capacity of NBS green spaces to boost retail companies’ business volumes, thus increasing their revenues, and at the same time create a pleasant feeling of space usability for the population. The type of NBS is not specified but generalized into large green spaces. The simulation contains two types of agents: (1) residents and (2) shop owners. Factors that attract new retail shops to be established in an area are simplified, based on attractor points, which identify areas such as large green spaces within and around which shops can form. The simulations provided insights on the number of retail shops that can be sustained based on the purchasing behavior of citizens that walk in parks. Four European cities were explored: Szeged (Hungary), Alcalá de Henares (Spain), Çankaya Municipality (Turkey) and Milan (Italy). The model allowed analyzing the indirect economic benefit of NBSs (i.e., large green spaces in this case) on a neighborhood’s economic structure. More precisely, the presence of green parks in the model boosted the visits of customers to local small shops located within and around them, such as cafés and kiosks, allowing for the emergence of 5–6 retail shops (on average, for about 800 walking citizens) in the case of Szeged and an average 12–14 retail shops for a simulated population of 2900 persons that walk in parks in the case of Milan. Overall, results from this modeling exercise can be considered representative for large urban green areas usually visited by a substantial number of citizens. However, their pertinence to support for local policies for NBS implementation and other decision-making related activities of socioeconomic nature is hampered by the low representativeness of source data used for the simulations. © 2021 by the authors.

Ae. albopictus was first detected in the Southern Federal District of the Russian Federation in the subtropical town of Sochi in 2011. In subsequent years, this species has been described in the continental areas with more severe climate and lower winter temperatures. Methods: Genomic analysis of pooled Ae. albopictus samples collected in the mosquito populations in the coastal and continental regions of the Krasnodar Krai was conducted to look for the genetic changes associated with the spread and potential cold adaptation in Ae. albopictus. Results: The results of the phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial genomes corresponded well with the hypothesis that Ae. albopictus haplotype A1a2a1 was introduced into the region from a single source. Population analysis revealed the role of dispersal and genetic drift in the local adaptation of the Asian tiger mosquito. The absence of shared haplotypes between the samples and high fixation indices suggest that gene flow between samples was heavily restricted. Mitochondrial and genomic differentiation together with different distances between dispersal routes, natural and anthropogenic barriers and local effective population size reduction could lead to difficulties in local climatic adaptations due to reduced selection effectiveness. We have found genomic regions with selective sweep patterns which can be considered as having been affected by recent selection events. The genes located in these regions participate in neural protection, lipid conservation, and cuticle formation during diapause. These processes were shown to be important for cold adaptation in the previous transcriptomic and proteomic studies. However, the population history and relatively low coverage obtained in the present article could have negatively affect sweep detection. © 2021 Konorov et al.","Asian tiger mosquito; Cold adaptation; Invasive species; Pathogen vector; Population genomics","ADAM12 protein; genomic DNA; GTPase activating protein binding protein 1; hemicentin 2 like; long untranslated RNA; runt related transcription factor 2 like; short chain specific acyl CoA dehydrogenase; tyrosine protein phosphatase non receptor type 23 like; unclassified drug; adaptation; Aedes albopictus; Article; bioinformatics; cold acclimatization; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA isolation; effective population size; environmental factor; Firmicutes; gene expression; gene flow; gene frequency; gene mapping; gene mutation; gene sequence; gene structure; genetic drift; genetic marker; genetic variability; genomic selection; haplotype; high throughput sequencing; local adaptation; mitochondrial genome; molecular genetics; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; population differentiation; population genomics; population size; population structure; proteomics; Russian Federation; selective sweep; single nucleotide polymorphism; taxonomy; transcriptomics; whole exome sequencing; whole genome sequencing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110972837

Correlating the capacities and biodiversity of the microbial communities in marine sediments remains challenging. We therefore investigated the geochemical constituents and the capabilities and diversity of microbial communities in sediments at different depths in two cores from the Shenhu area in the northern South China Sea, which is characterized by underlying gas hydrates. The geochemical features, sulfate concentration decreased linearly and the acid volatile sulfur accumulated from 4 m below the seafloor (mbsf) to the bottom, indicating significant sulfate reduction. However, the methane concentration was relatively low and showed irregular trends, indicating that our study cores did not reach the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). Nevertheless, incubation experiments showed that the microbial groups in sediments performed AOM and methanogenesis in the region where sulfate decreased linearly above the SMTZ. We mapped the diversity and abundance of microbial communities in sediments with depth using high-throughput sequencing. A small proportion of known methanogens (<0.3%) may have been responsible for the methanogenesis during incubation. No classical archaeal anaerobic methanotroph (ANME) sequences were detected across all samples; only a small amount of SEEP-SRB1 were detected, and their abundance did not increase with increasing depth. Thus, unknown or unconventional phylotypes may have participated in AOM during the incubation, and the dominant phylum Bathyarchaeota or the small number of detected methanogens are the most likely performers of AOM. © 2021 The Authors","16S rRNA; Anaerobic oxidation of methane; Geochemistry; Methanogenesis; Microbial community; South China Sea","Biodiversity; Gas hydrates; Geochemistry; Methane; Methanogens; Sediments; Submarine geology; Sulfur compounds; 16S rRNA; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Geochemical features; Geochemicals; Marine sediments; Methanogenesis; Microbial communities; Northern South China Sea; South China sea; Sulphate methane transition zones; RNA; methane; RNA 16S; sulfate; RNA 16S; biodiversity; concentration (composition); gene expression; marine sediment; methanogenesis; oxidation; RNA; transition zone; anaerobic oxidation of methane; archaeon; Article; bacterium; Bathyarchaeota; geochemistry; high throughput sequencing; marine environment; methanogen; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; sediment; South China Sea; water depth; biodiversity; China; genetics; microflora; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; Pacific Ocean; Shenhu; South China Sea; Archaea; Archaea; Biodiversity; China; Geologic Sediments; Methane; Microbiota; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102966194

Marine resources, particularly mangroves and corals, are vulnerable to coastal developments, including coastal reclamation, and human settlements that discharge large quantities of wastes into the seas. Climate change impacts, such as increased salt intrusion and sea level rise, may additionally induce regime shifts detrimental to these delicate ecosystems. And the warmer climate has increased the frequency, duration and intensity of catastrophic coastal disturbances, implicating profound uncertainty to the sustainability of coastal infrastructures and resources essential for human populations.

Low availability of P in soil is mainly caused by high content of Fe2O3 in the clay fraction that binds to P making it unavailable. Beneficial microbes, such as P solubilizing microorganisms can increase the available P in soil and improve plant growth and productivity. In this study, we evaluated the effects of environmental conditions (climate, soil parameters), plant genotype, and level of plant association (rhizosphere or endophytic root organism) on the abundance and diversity of phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms in a Salix production system. We hypothesized that a lower number of endophytic fungi may possess the ability to solubilize P compared to the number of rhizosphere fungi with the same ability. We also expect that the plant genotype and the experimental site with its environmental conditions will influence fungal diversity. Two Salix genotypes grown in pure and mixed cultures were investigated for their fungal microbiome community and diversity in the rhizosphere and endosphere during two growing seasons. We found that the rhizosphere fungal community was more diverse. A general dominance of Ascomycota (Dothideomycetes) and Basidiomycota (Tremellomycetes) was observed. The classes Agaricomycetes and Pezizomycetes were more frequent in the endosphere, while Tremellomycetes and Mortierellomycetes were more abundant in the rhizosphere. Plot-specific soil properties (pH, total organic carbon, and nitrogen) significantly influenced the fungal community structure. Among the culturable fungal diversities, 10 strains of phosphate solubilizing fungi (PSFs) from roots and 12 strains from rhizosphere soil were identified using selective media supplemented with di-calcium and tri-calcium phosphates. The fungal density and the number of PSF were much higher in the rhizosphere than in the endosphere. Penicillium was the dominant genus of PSF isolated from both sites; other less frequent genera of PSFs were Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Clonostachys. Overall the main factors controlling the fungal communities (endophytic vs. rhizosphere fungi) were the soil properties and level of plant association, while no significant influence of growing season was observed. Differences between Salix genotypes were observed for culturable fungal diversity, while in metagenomic data analysis, only the class Dothideomycetes showed a significant effect from the plant genotype. © Copyright © 2021 Koczorski, Furtado, Gołębiewski, Hulisz, Baum, Weih and Hrynkiewicz.","diversity; fungal endophytes; phosphate solubilization; rhizosphere fungi; short rotation cropping; willow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110932210

Although non-native tree species may provide sustainable ecosystem services, as a potentially invasive species they may be a threat to local ecosystems as well. In Europe, black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) a non-native species, seems to meet the condition of acclimation as a multi-generational process. The acclimatization, however, may have consequences not only for growth performance but also for the species' invasive potential. This study investigates the spatiotemporal pattern of secondary growth and climate sensitivity among six black locust stands along continentality gradient in Eastern Europe with the respect to bioclimatic conditions of the species distribution in Europe. Despite comparable bioclimatic conditions, climate sensitivity of black locust stands is highly variable, both temporally and spatially. The winter and spring temperatures are a key climatic driver of the growth pattern in southern and western Poland. Growth response to previous winter and current summer precipitation distinguished stands in western and eastern Poland. A significant increase in the mean annual temperature during the last 70 years likely triggered temporal instability of the black locusts’ climate signal. In general, drought conditions were found to be the main limiting factor at the edge sites within the black locust gradient. Thus, the climate sensitivity of black locust stands reflects rather site-specific microclimatic conditions then bioclimatically-based clustering pattern. Despite climate-related limiting factors, black locust seems to be characterized by high potential for acclimatization to Eastern European climatic conditions, suggesting high invasive potential. Thus, the replacement of native species by black locust or the conversion of local habitats into monocultures for biomass production should not be recommended, while species management should follow proactive measures to reduce the risk of uncontrolled spread of the species. Divergent growth reaction of black locust stands implies high plasticity of secondary growth and thus high probability of acclimatization to future climate. Given the expected range expansion to the East in Europe, we call for expanding dendroclimatic studies to the areas of future species expansion in order to test its climatic and edaphic limitations. This seems to be crucial for formulating non-native species management strategies in line with sustainable forestry, preventing the uncontrolled expansion of the species that threatens vulnerable habitats. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alien species; Bioclimatic clustering; Black locust; Climate-growth relationships; Growth reaction; Invasive species management","Ecosystems; Forestry; Population distribution; Risk assessment; Acclimatisation; Alien species; Bioclimatic clustering; Black locust; Climate sensitivity; Climate-growth relationship; Condition; Growth reactions; Invasive species management; Native tree species; Expansion; acclimation; climate conditions; dendroclimatology; dicotyledon; drought; ecosystem service; environmental factor; forest management; future prospect; growth rate; precipitation (climatology); spatiotemporal analysis; stand structure; strategic approach; street children; sustainable forestry; tree; Eastern Europe; Ecosystems; Expansion; Forestry; Risk Assessment; Robinia; Secondary Growth; Eastern Europe; Poland [Central Europe]; Robinia pseudoacacia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104415070

Apart from alternative routes for green feedstock production, such as hydrogen via electrolysis and nitrogen via solar thermochemical methods, alternatives are explored to replace the Haber-Bosch process. The present article reviews four promising mild condition ammonia production methods: solid state synthesis, molten salt synthesis, thermochemical looping and photocatalytic routes. Contrary to the Haber-Bosch method, which requires high pressures of 200–400 bar, they operate at low-pressures, furthermore such routes open the possibility for direct ammonia production from H2O and N2 without the intermediate hydrogen production step. These advantages allow easier renewable energy integration; however, R&amp;D activities are needed for scaling-up.

The country experiences yearly displacement of approximately one million people and losses of about 1% of its gross domestic product due to cyclones, floods, and riverbank erosion. This study examines how the Bangladesh government has managed climate-in-duced displacement with a particular focus on socioeconomic development policies. We analyzed the country’s 1984 Land Reform Ordinance, the 2009 climate change strategy and action plan, the 1997 agricultural khasland settlement policy, perspective plan for 2010–2021, poverty reduction strategy paper, and five-year plans to understand governance changes for displaced communities. We found that, overall, the central government implemented four main strategies. In the first strategy, Bangladesh resettled displaced people in cluster villages on public lands. Then, it provided life skills training (e.g., leadership, disaster preparedness, income generation) to rehabilitate the residents. The third strategy was to align resettlement efforts with local-level climate change adaptation and poverty reduction activities. Here, the central government and its seventeen departments collabo-rated with local councils to support resettled households under the social safety program. The fourth strategy was to diversify financial resources by obtaining more fund from donors and establishing its own financial mechanism. However, we also found that the decision-making and implementation process remained top-down without need assessment and community participation.

Yet making agricultural regions locally carbon neutral will involve an economic cost, with existing patterns of greenhouse gas emissions and spatial costs of abatement affecting that cost of achieving regional carbon neutrality. This study examines the economic cost of locally achieving carbon neutrality, using the illustration of Western Australia’s agricultural region. The cost to the region of achieving carbon neutrality via reforestation is estimated, as is the spatial allocation of farmland for sequestration. Social and political pressures that likely constrain how much farmland can be reforested are explicitly considered. Findings are subject to a sensitivity analysis and several caveats. The annual cost of regional carbon neutrality via proscribed regional reforestation, under current carbon offset prices, is estimated to range from AUD216 million to AUD250 million (i.e. under 3 per cent of the region’s gross value of agricultural production) which might suggest the challenge to be carbon neutral is within commercial reach. However, without other financial incentives, it likely involves farm business profits being reduced by around 15 per cent. © 2021 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","agriculture; greenhouse gas emissions; reforestation; sequestration; spatial analysis","annual variation; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; greenhouse gas; reforestation; sensitivity analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108613303

Companies consider various types of remote work environments to contain the spread of the virus. Among them, a satellite office is a type of remote work environment where a number of employees are allocated to their nearest office. The benefits from satellite offices are twofold: The significant reduction of travel distance also reduces the amount of carbon emission and fuel consumption. In addition, dividing employees into smaller groups significantly reduces the potential risks of infection in the office. This paper addresses a satellite office allocation problem that considers social and environmental sustainability and infection control at work. In order to evaluate the effect of different satellite office allocation, quantitative measures are developed for the following three criteria: carbon emission, fuel consumption, and the probability of infection occurrence at work. Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate different scenarios of regional infection rate and modes of transportation. The results show that adopting satellite offices not only reduces carbon emission and fuel consumption, but also mitigates business disruption in the pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there has been no decreasing trend during the 2000s. Despite the very low ambient SO2 concentrations, high SO42− concentration episodes frequently occur in Seoul; however, the reasons for this remain poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to determine the major factors that enhance sulfur oxidation in Seoul by analyzing measurement data from an intensive air quality monitoring station in the Seoul metropolitan area acquired in 2015. Additionally, we aimed to distinguish the contributions of local sources and long-range transport to the elevated SO42− concentrations in PM2.5 in Seoul. In some cases in March and October 2015, the molar ratio of SO42− to SO2, which reflects sulfur partitioning between the particle and gas phases, showed an exponential increase with an increase of relative humidity (RH). However, despite the fact that the RH was high during August 2015, no statistically significant relationship was observed between RH and the molar ratio of SO42− to SO2 during this month. In August 2015, the molar ratio of SO42− to SO2 showed an exponential increase with increasing O3 concentration. Therefore, under sufficient RH, the concentrations of radical oxidants might be the most important factor that underlies the increase in ambient SO42− concentrations. No significant relationship was observed between the molar ratio of SO42− to SO2 and O3 in October. Furthermore, using Potential Source Density Function (PSDF) and backward trajectory analysis, the high SO42− concentrations in March 2015 were found to be caused by the transportation of air pollutants from China and local sources around Seoul. The high SO42− concentrations in August 2015 are concluded to have been greatly affected by these power plant emissions in the Taean area on the west coast of Korea. The high SO42− concentrations in October 2015 appear to have been caused by the transportation of air pollutants from North Korea. In summary, the high SO42− concentration in Seoul is affected by long-range transport from China and by the emissions from around the Seoul metropolitan area, such as Taean or North Korea. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Backward trajectories; O3; PM2.5; RH; SO42−, PSDF","acid sulfate soil; air quality; metropolitan area; oxidation; particulate matter; power plant; relative humidity; sulfate; sulfur; China; North Korea; Seoul [South Korea]; South Chungcheong; South Korea; Taean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102304479

At present, the mechanisms related to Aβ and tau pathogenesis leading to cognitive decline in older adults remain largely unknown. Here, we examined graph theory-based positron emission tomography (PET) analytical approaches, within and between tau and Aβ PET modalities, and tested the effects on cognitive changes in cognitively normal older adults (CN). Particularly, we focused on the network interdigitations of Aβ and tau deposits, along with cognitive test scores in CN at both baseline and 2-year follow-up (FU). We found highly significant Aβ-tau network integrations in AD vulnerable areas, as well as significant associations between those Aβ-tau interdigitations and general cognitive impairment in CN at baseline and FU. Our findings suggest a distinctive contribution of interlinking network relationships between Aβ and tau deposits in heteromodal areas of the human brain. They support a network-based interaction between Aβ and tau accumulations as a key factor for cognitive deterioration in CN prior to dementia. © 2021 The Authors.

In Iraq, these species are considered threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) RED List (2020). Apart from their important role in forest ecosystems stability and integrity, they are useful indicators for ecosystems functions. These species occur only in the mountain forests of the northeast, the Kurdistan region of Iraq (KRI), and information on their distributions is limited and poorly understood. Using the maximum entropy modeling and geospatial techniques, we aimed to: (i) map current distributions of the two species, and predict potential habitat distributions; (ii) model impact of the future climate change on their distributions; (iii) map overlapping habitat range for the species; and (iv) determine the main environmental variables shaping their distributions. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.62070 and RCP8.5 2070 climate change scenarios, the overall expansion magnitude of the habitat for the species would be smaller than the contraction magnitude. For S. infraimmaculata and N. derjugini, the habitat would contract by 1751.58 km2 (3.42%) and 2127.22 km2 (4.16%), whereas expand only 226.77 km2 (0.44%) and 1877.49 km2 (3.67%), respectively. Climate change would significantly reduce the habitat ranges of the two species in Iraq. Habitat reduction for S. infraimmaculata would be more than N. derjugini. The potential distribution of the species would be toward the mountain forests of the east mainly and southeast of the KRI. Conservation actions should concentrate on the mountain forests (mixed oak) by establishing national parks, protected areas, and developing forest management policy. Current emphasis for conservation priority should focus specifically on areas where the species overlap by 1583.71 km2 (3.09%).

We review the crop improvement processes starting with crop choice, moving through to breeding objectives, production of potential new varieties, selection, and finally adoption by farmers. The importance of multidisciplinary teams working towards common objectives is stressed as a key factor to success. The role of the distinct disciplines, actors, and their interactions throughout the process from crop choice through to adoption by farmers is discussed and illustrated. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

There are some concerns that high density may be a risk factor that makes it challenging to contain the pandemic. This study aims to investigate the link between density and pandemic spread through a case study of Tehran that has been the epicenter of the pandemic in Iran. Based on data obtained from an online platform and analyzed using structural equation modeling, we found that density alone cannot be considered a risk factor for the spread of COVID-19. In fact, density alone did not explain the geographic distribution pattern of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths across the 22 municipal districts of Tehran. We, therefore, argue that efforts should be made to minimize concerns about living in dense urban environments. Indeed, residents of high-density districts can live safely when an outbreak occurs, provided they make some changes in lifestyle and follow public health instructions. Based on the findings, and considering other benefits of compact cities (e.g., climate change mitigation) planners and policy makers are encouraged to continue promoting compact urban forms. They can also use the results of this study in their efforts towards developing appropriate mechanisms and guidelines for effective management of future pandemics in cities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Compact city; COVID-19; Density; Risk factors; Tehran","Climate change; Geographical distribution; Case-studies; Compact city; COVID-19; Density; Epicentre; Online platforms; Risk factors; Structural equation models; Tehran; Urban development; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104644021

The goal of this study is to identify the zone of pollution sources impact and the specific features in accumulation of pollutants in soil–plant systems with different levels of load. The distribution and migration of marker compounds—14 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (polyarenes, or PAHs)—are analyzed in the southwest of Moscow (the campus of the RUDN University and the adjacent area of the Southwest Forest Park) in functional zones differing by the volumes of technogenic loads. The soils of the examined territory according to WRB belong to Albic Retisols (Ochric). The spatial distribution of polyarenes in the system “surface soil layer–rhizosphere–aboveground part of plants” is modeled using data analysis procedures and visualized with the help of the ArcGIS software (Topo-to-Raster tool). The effects of aerial mass transfer of polyarenes into the soil–plant system as the main pathway for the entry of pollutants are evaluated. The prevalent polyarenes and the factors determining the volumes of their accumulation in the functional zones of the studied area are identified. The genesis of polyarenes is assessed according to the abundance ratios of their groups. The differences in the conditions and dynamics of PAH accumulation in soil and plant components are shown. The results are particularly useful to formulate the requirements to soil monitoring in the studied area, to analyze the dynamics of the state of urban territory, and to justify the measures for protection of urban areas under a traffic load. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Albic Retisols (Ochric); motor vehicles; PAH; pollution indicators; soil monitoring","herb; PAH; phytomass; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; rhizosphere; soil pollution; spatial distribution; traffic emission; urban area; Moscow [(ADS) Russian Federation]; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111534706

Today's regulatory context highly incentivizes CS infrastructure investments that are expected to have a significant impact on reducing air pollution, cutting emissions and promoting environmentally sustainable cities. The Sizing problem of a CS typically concerns the minimization of the investment cost for charging facilities, subject to the CS being able to fulfill a certain level of charging requests. Several studies have shown the potential of Smart Charging technologies, towards controlling the charging profiles of EVs, so as to achieve a lower operational cost or a lower peak to average power consumption ratio for the CS, by shifting the charging of some EVs. By making more efficient use of charging facilities, Smart Charging can also help reducing the amount of chargers required in order to achieve a certain Quality of Service (QoS) for the CS's clients. In this paper we solve the CS's sizing problem (i.e. decisions on number and types of installed chargers) through an optimization framework that minimizes the investment cost of CS operators, subject to achieving a certain QoS for their clients (EV owners). In particular, we extend the existing CS sizing models by taking into account also the smart charging capabilities during operation. We present a novel formulation for the QoS level of the CS using chance-constraints and propose some relaxations that constitute the problem solvable. Finally, we present a methodology that enhances the scalability of the optimal sizing algorithm. The proposed methodology is able to offer valuable services to CS operators in competitive environments. © 2021 The Author(s)","Charging stations; Electric vehicles; Flexibility; Sizing; Smart charging","Charging (batteries); Costs; Energy efficiency; Investments; Problem solving; Quality of service; Charging facilities; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Flexibility; Investment costs; Quality-of-service; Sizing; Sizing problems; Smart charging; Station operators; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103974593

We exploit the unprecedented drop in urban activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and use high-resolution, remotely sensed NO2 observations to investigate disparities in NO2 levels across different demographic subgroups in the United States. We show that, prior to the pandemic, satellite-observed NO2 levels in the least White census tracts of the United States were nearly triple the NO2 levels in the most White tracts. During the pandemic, the largest lockdown-related NO2 reductions occurred in urban neighborhoods that have 2.0 times more non-White residents and 2.1 times more Hispanic residents than neighborhoods with the smallest reductions. NO2 reductions were likely driven by the greater density of highways and interstates in these racially and ethnically diverse areas. Although the largest reductions occurred in marginalized areas, the effect of lockdowns on racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic NO2 disparities was mixed and, for many cities, nonsignificant. For example, the least White tracts still experienced ∼1.5 times higher NO2 levels during the lockdowns than the most White tracts experienced prior to the pandemic. Future policies aimed at eliminating pollution disparities will need to look beyond reducing emissions from only passenger traffic and also consider other collocated sources of emissions such as heavy-duty vehicles. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The region also possesses some of the greatest hydrocarbon reserves on earth. Such a unique combination of physical characteristics has-at least historically-contributed to a somewhat ambivalent attitude to the evolution of climate change law and regulation in the region. Regulatory support for key enabling technologies, such as renewable energy, has fluctuated over time and between jurisdictions. The oil price crash of 2014 was instrumental in prompting Middle Eastern economies to re-evaluate their historic reliance on this commodity as a source of energy and export revenue. Since that time, renewable energy project financing has seen dramatic changes in the region. There has been a reduction in financing due to perceived risks and barriers, but also an increase in financing through the adoption of innovative public-private partnership (PPP) models. Such models have supported increasingly ambitious renewable energy targets and decarbonization objectives. Countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (which have traditionally, and almost exclusively, relied on the production and export of globally significant hydrocarbon reserves to finance large power projects) are, for the first time, implementing significant regulatory and legislative reforms. These reforms will deliver ambitious decarbonization policy objectives, involving significant private sector expertise and financing through adoption of best practice PPP models. Medium term projections for oil demand and export revenue in the Middle East remain mixed. In such circumstances, the delivery of renewable energy PPP projects, through private sector capital assisting cash constrained governments, will assume even greater importance, especially as the region attempts to chart a sustainably based recovery from the economic downturn wrought by the global coronavirus pandemic. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

Within the framework of the DACCIWA project, we have developed an African regional anthropogenic emission inventory including the main African polluting sources (wood and charcoal burning, charcoal making, trucks, cars, buses and two-wheeled vehicles, open waste burning, and flaring). To this end, a database on fuel consumption and emission factors specific to Africa was established using the most recent measurements. New spatial proxies (road network, power plant geographical coordinates) were used to convert national emissions into gridded inventories at a 0.1g g×g0.1g spatial resolution. This inventory includes carbonaceous particles (black and organic carbon) and gaseous species (CO, NOx, SO2 and NMVOCs) for the period 1990-2015 with a yearly temporal resolution. We show that all pollutant emissions are globally increasing in Africa during the period 1990-2015 with a growth rate of 95g%, 86g%, 113g%, 112g%, 97g% and 130g% for BC, OC, NOx, CO, SO2 and NMVOCs, respectively. We also show that Western Africa is the highest emitting region of BC, OC, CO and NMVOCs, followed by Eastern Africa, largely due to domestic fire and traffic activities, while Southern Africa and Northern Africa are the highest emitting regions of SO2 and NOx due to industrial and power plant sources. Emissions from this inventory are compared to other regional and global inventories, and the emissions uncertainties are quantified by a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, this inventory highlights key pollutant emission sectors in which mitigation scenarios should focus on. The DACCIWA inventory (10.25326/56, Keita et al., 2020) including the annual gridded emission inventory for Africa for the period 1990-2015 is distributed by the Emissions of atmospheric Compounds and Compilation of Ancillary Data (ECCAD) system (https://eccad.aeris-data.fr/, last access: 19 July 2021g g g g g g g ).

At approximately monthly intervals, measurements of the primary production of particulate C (PC) using the 14C method, and the export of PC and particulate nitrogen (PN) using surface-tethered sediment traps deployed at 150 m have been made along with a host of complementary physical, biological, and biogeochemical measurements. Euphotic zone depth-integrated (0–200 m) primary production ranged from 220.2 (standard deviation, SD, 10.8) mg C m−2 d−1 in Feb 2018 to 1136.5 (SD = 17.1) mg C m−2 d−1 in Jun 2000, with a 30-yr (1989–2018) mean of 536.8 (SD = 135.0) mg C m−2 d−1 (n = 271). Although the monthly primary production climatology was fairly well constrained, we observed substantial sub-decadal variability and a significant 0–125 m depth-integrated increasing trend of 4.0 (p &lt; 0.01; 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.1–5.9) (mg C m−2 d−1) yr−1 since 1989, displaying a large relative increase of 37% (CI = 18–55%) in the lower portion (75–125 m) of the euphotic zone. Chlorophyll (Chl) a and suspended PC and PN concentrations also displayed significant (p &lt; 0.01) increases in the 75–125 m region of the euphotic zone. PC export at 150 m exhibited both short-term (monthly) and longer-scale variability with a 30-yr mean of 27.9 (SD = 9.7, n = 265) mg C m−2 d−1. PC and PN export exhibited extended, multi-year periods of significantly lower or higher values compared to the 30-yr mean. These multi-year periods of anomalously low and high particle export, in the absence of contemporaneous variations in primary production, probably reflect periodic changes in remineralization efficiencies. The PC export ratio (e-ratio; PC export at 150 m ÷ 0–150 m depth-integrated 14C-based primary production) was low, with a 30-yr mean of 0.054 (SD = 0.021, n = 248), and exhibited a significant (p &lt; 0.01) long-term decreasing trend over the 30-yr observation period. The 30-yr long-term increases in primary production (~37%), Chl a, and suspended PC and PN concentrations (~17%, 8%, and 8%, respectively) in the 75–125 m portion of the water column are hypothesized to result from an enhanced supply of nutrients to the lower portion of the water column over the past three decades. © 2021 The Authors","Biogeochemistry; Biological carbon pump; North Pacific Subtropical Gyre; Nutrient cycling; Phytoplankton; Primary production; Station ALOHA","Aquatic ecosystems; Oceanography; Confidence interval; Decadal variability; Multi-year periods; Observation Period; Oligotrophic oceans; Particulate Matter; Primary production; Standard deviation; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105569370

The region, home to almost 4% of the world's population, is under serious threat from climatic disasters. The volume underscores the urgency of addressing cataclysmic events related to climate change and their ramifications on the economy, agriculture and livelihoods of the region. The book discusses the reasons causing climate change as well as highlights normative and ethical considerations involved in the battle against climate change. With case studies from India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it explores issues such as extreme climatic events; energy use, fossil fuels, non-renewable resources and carbon dioxide emission in South Asia; internal migration and climate refugees; the ethical dilemma of sustainable development; technological advancements for extreme weather forecast; and responses to climate change in South Asia. Highlighting the need for striking a balance between developmental imperatives and environmental sustainability, the chapters also show the North-South divide in the research agenda and policies on climate change and the global politics that underlie climate policies. The volume juxtaposes a scientific analysis of factors responsible for climate change with an analysis of the human cost of climate change from the perspective of social sciences. It discusses the challenges faced by developing countries while also offering recommendations and solutions. This book will be of interest to scholars and researchers of climate studies, geography, public policy and governance, sustainable development, development studies, environmental studies, political studies, international relations, political economy, economics and sociology. It will also be useful to practitioners, thinktanks, policymakers and civil society organisations working on environmental management. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Mausumi Kar, Jayita Mukhopadhyay and Manisha Deb Sarkar.

This paper is part of a bigger project realized in collaboration with Arriva, the largest regional railway undertaking in the Netherlands, to identify optimal solutions in improving trains’ energy and environmental performance. A significant problem in vehicle hybridization is determining the optimal size for the energy storage system, while incorporating an energy management strategy as well as technical and operational requirements. With the primary requirement imposed by the railway undertaking to achieve emission-free and noise-free operation within railway stations, we formalize this as a bi-level multi-objective optimization problem, including vehicle performance, the trade-off between fuel savings and hybridization cost, influence of the energy management strategy, and other constraints. By deriving a Li-ion battery parameters at the cell level, a nested coordination framework is employed, where a brute force search finds the optimal battery size using dynamic programming for full controller optimization for each feasible solution. In this way, the global minimum for fuel consumption for each battery configuration is achieved. The results from a Dutch case study demonstrated fuel savings and CO2 emission reduction of more than 34% compared to a standard vehicle. Additionally, benefits in terms of local pollutants (NOx and PM) emissions are observed. Using an alternative sub-optimal rule-based control demonstrated a significant impact of the energy management on the results, reflected in higher fuel consumption and increased battery size together with corresponding costs. © 2021 The Author(s)","Battery sizing; Bi-level optimization; Energy management strategy; Fuel consumption; Hybrid diesel multiple units; Hybridization cost","Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Dynamic programming; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy storage; Environmental management; Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Fuels; Global optimization; Lithium-ion batteries; Multiobjective optimization; Railroads; Vehicle performance; Battery size; Battery sizing; Bi-level optimization; Energy; Fuel savings; Hybrid diesel multiple unit; Hybridisation; Hybridization cost; Management strategies; Storage systems; Energy management; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; diesel; energy management; energy storage; equipment component; fuel cell; fuel consumption; hybridization; optimization; parameterization; performance assessment; railway; reduction; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105292054

We examined the responses of 11 leaf traits (including leaf morphology, stomatal structure and chemical properties) to eight common climate factors for 340 eastern Qinghai-Tibetan woody species. We showed temperature as the strongest predictor of leaf size and shape, stomatal size and form, and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, implying the important role of local heat quantity in determining the variation in the cell- or organ-level leaf morphology and leaf biochemical properties. The effects of moisture-related climate factors (including precipitation and humidity) on leaf growth were mainly through variability in leaf traits (e.g., specific leaf area and stomatal density) related to plant water-use physiological processes. In contrast, sunshine hours affected mainly cell- and organ-level leaf size and shape, with plants developing small/narrow leaves and stomata to decrease leaf damage and water loss under prolonged solar radiation. Moreover, two sets of significant leaf trait-climate relationships, i.e., the leaf/stomata size traits co-varying with temperature, and the water use-related leaf traits co-varying with precipitation, were obtained when analyzing multi-trait relationships, suggesting these traits as good indicators of climate gradients. Our findings contributed evidence to enhance understanding of the regional patterns in leaf trait variation and its environmental determinants. © Copyright © 2021 Kang, Li, Zhou, Zhang, Li, Wang, Liu and Qi.","climate; functional tradeoff; leaf morphology; leaf stoichiometry pattern; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; specific leaf area; stomatal density; stomatal pore area index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112411164

The Carbstone technology is based on the reaction of calcium-and magnesium-containing minerals with CO2 to form carbonate binders. Mixes of carbon steel slag and stainless-steel slag, with tailored particle size distributions, were compacted with a vibro-press and subsequently carbonated in an autoclave to produce carbonated steel slag pavers. The carbonated materials sequester 100–150 g CO2/kg slag. Compressive and tensile splitting strength of the resulting pavers were determined, and the ratio was found to be comparable to that of concrete. The environmental performance of the Carbstone pavers, with an average tensile splitting strength of 3.6 MPa, was found to be in compliance with Belgian and Dutch leaching limit values for construction materials. In addition, leaching results for a concrete mix made with aggregates of crushed Carbstone pavers (simulating the so-called “second life” of pavers) demonstrate that the pavers can be recycled as aggregates in cement-bound products after their product lifetime. © 2021 by the authors.

The high-resolution wave dataset enabled the quantitative analysis in both nearshore and offshore, and the quantitative analysis was performed in two phases: First, using two different approaches. i.e., “Climate-dependent Sustainability Index” and “Wave Exploitability Index”, the wave power and its short and long-term changes were considered to prioritize the candidate stations for further assessment.

In the presence of triethanolamine, the Re catalyst unit efficiently takes up CO2to form a carbonate ester complex, and then direct photocatalytic reduction of a low concentration of CO2,e.g., 10% CO2, can be achieved using this type of supramolecular photocatalyst. In this work, the mechanism of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2was investigated applying such a supramolecular photocatalyst,RuC2Rewith a carbonate ester ligand, using time-resolved visible and infrared spectroscopies and electrochemical methods. Using time-resolved spectroscopic measurements, the kinetics of the photochemical formation processes of the one-electron-reduced speciesRuC2(Re)−, which is an essential intermediate in the photocatalytic reaction, were clarified in detail and its electronic structure was elucidated.

This energy–water interaction is especially peculiar in the Gulf Cooperation Council, where there are limited water resources, but extremely high use rates. Qatar provides a unique case in terms of extreme water scarcity and excessive water use. To understand the intricate network, this paper establishes an up-dated and comprehensive qualitative model of the water system in the country with the help of a water balance and system dynamics (causal loop diagram) methodology. Regression estimates are then used to estimate future water and energy consumption in addition to carbon dioxide emissions until the year 2050. Finally, system dynamics (stock and flow diagram) is used to determine the supply impacts of efficiency policies including limiting of groundwater abstraction to only 50 million m3, reduction of water consumption in the household, commercial and industrial sector by 10%, and gradual increase in the share of reverse osmosis (RO)-produced desalinated water to 50% in order to assess the supply volume, electricity consumption and CO2 emissions. The efficient use of water in different sectors of the economy results in a combined saving of 1222 GWh (8.1%) or 594,000 tons CO2. Furthermore, by moving to membrane-based desalination technology energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced by 3672 GWh (24.3%) and 1.8 million tons CO2, respectively.

Crucially for energy transition efforts, neither energy, environment nor climate is mentioned in the Australian Constitution. Australia has a tradition of creative cooperative federalism solutions for responding to problems of national importance. In the energy sector this has resulted in an intricate national framework for energy markets, which relies on mirror legislation passed by participating states, with oversight by state and federal executive governments. Independently of these frameworks, both federal and state governments have passed climate change legislation, which crucially includes renewable energy support mechanisms. At a time when a rapid transition to a decarbonized energy system is essential, legal frameworks struggle to respond in a timely fashion. The political discourse around energy has become increasingly toxic – reflecting a dysfunctional state–federal relationship in energy and climate law. Australia needs to consider whether its cooperative federalism solutions are sufficient to support the energy transition and how climate law at the state and federal levels interacts with energy market legal frameworks. © The Author(s), 2021.

It is grown in marginal arid and semi-arid agro-ecosystems with wide yield fluctuations due to spatial variability of rainfall and soil. Climate change, which is predicted to increase the intra- and inter-annual rainfall variability will further constrain the groundnut economy in India besides the global and domestic economic, social and policy changes. Through this study we aim to examine the biophysical and social economic impacts of climate change on groundnut production and prices to provide a comprehensive analysis of how agriculture and the food system will be affected. Using projected climate data for India, we estimated the biophysical impacts of climate change on groundnut during mid-century using representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) scenario. We examined the impacts of changes in population and income besides environmental factors on groundnut productivity. This is to highlight the importance of holistic assessment of biophysical and socioeconomic factors to better understand climate change impacts. Modelled projections show that by 2050, climate change under an optimistic scenario will result in −2.3 to 43.2% change in groundnut yields across various regions in India when climate alone was factored in. But the change in groundnut yields ranged from −0.9% to 16.2% when economic (population and income) and market variables (elasticities, trade, etc.) were also considered. Similarly, under pessimistic climate change scenario, the percent change in groundnut yields would be −33.7 to 3.4 with only the climate factored in and −11.2 to 4.3 with the additional economic and market variables included. This indicates the sensitivity of climate change impacts to differences in socioeconomic factors. This study highlights the need to take into account market effects to gain a holistic understanding of how economic and environmental factors impact agricultural food systems and economies. © 2021 The Authors","Adaptation; Climate change; DSSAT; Groundnut; Spatial modeling","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biophysics; Commerce; Economic analysis; Oils and fats; Rain; Adaptation strategies; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Comprehensive analysis; Environmental factors; Socio-economic factor; Spatial variability; Yield fluctuations; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); environmental factor; groundnut; rainfall; agriculture; article; climate change; elasticity; environmental factor; human; India; nonhuman; peanut; price; productivity; socioeconomics; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101882937

In our previous study, we assessed the geomorphological effects of freeze-thaw fluctuations occurring within the cliff of Jeziorsko Reservoir (central Poland). Based on those findings, we have now determined the number of freeze-thaw cycles to assess their historical impact on the studied cliff. We have also traced the directions and the pace of changes in freeze-thaw processes in Poland. The results reveal a gradually decreasing role of freeze-thaw action in the process of the recession of the cliff of Jeziorsko Reservoir throughout its existence. The same is true nearly across Poland, although with some regional variation. Within 1951–2018, the impact of freeze-thaw action declined most significantly in north-western and central Poland, i.e. the area with the smallest annual number of freeze-thaw cycles. Consequently, this is also where the impact of geomorphological results of freeze-thaw cycles will be the least pronounced. It was only in the north-eastern edges of the country, which are under the dominant influence of continental air masses, where no significant changes in the impact of freeze-thaw processes were identified. The obtained results strongly legitimise the conclusion that global warming in the mid-latitude zone of the temperate climate has reduced the role of freeze-thaw processes in the geomorphological transformation of cliffs developed within river banks and lake or water reservoir shores. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cliff recession rate; Freeze-thaw action; Geomorphological processes; Global climate change; Multi-year trends","cliff; climate change; freeze-thaw cycle; geomorphology; global warming; midlatitude environment; temperate environment; Jeziorsko Reservoir; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102986857

However, it can be difficult to provide stable power to end-users while minimizing environmental pollution by replacing coal-fired systems with combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP) systems that use natural gas, because CCHP systems have various power output vulnerabilities. Therefore, purchasing power from external electric grids is essential in areas where CCHP systems are built; hence, optimal CCHP controls should also consider energy purchased from external grids. This study proposes a two-stage algorithm to optimally control CCHP systems. In Stage One, the optimal energy mix using the Lagrange multiplier method for state-wide grids from which CCHP systems purchase deficient electricity was calculated. In Stage Two, the purchased volumes from these grids were used as inputs to the proposed optimization algorithm to optimize CCHP systems suitable for metropolitan areas. We used case studies to identify the accurate energy efficiency, costs, and minimal emissions. We chose the Atlanta area to analyze the CCHP system’s impact on energy efficiency, cost variation, and emission savings. Then, we calculated an energy mix suitable for the region for each simulation period. The case study results confirm that deploying an optimized CCHP system can reduce purchased volumes from the grid while reducing total emissions. We also analyzed the impact of the CCHP system on emissions and cost savings. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, the relationship between urban morphology and air quality (wind speed, CO, and PM2.5) in residential neighborhoods at the meso-microscale was investigated. The changes in the microclimate and pollutant diffusion distribution in the neighborhood under diverse weather conditions were simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This study identified five key urban morphological parameters (Building Density, Average Building Height, Standard Deviation of Building Height, Mean Building Volume, and Degree of Enclosure) which significantly impacted the diffusion and distribution of pollutants in the neighborhood. The findings of this study suggested that three specific strategies (e.g. volume of a single building should be reduced, DE should be increased) and one comprehensive strategy (the width and height of the single building should be reduced while the number of single buildings should be increased) could be illustrated as an optimized approach of urban planning to relief the air pollution.

To clarify the impact of precipitation and snow cover on flowering phenology, we conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of the temporal change in flowering phenology and its responses to precipitation and snow cover changes using regression models built on the largest collection of ground phenological observation data on the QTP. We found that first flowering date (FFD) for the early-flowering time series significantly advanced at the rate of −0.371 ± 0.149 days/year (p < 0.001), whereas FFD mid-to-late-flowering time series showed no trend at the rate of 0.158 ± 0.193 days/year (p = 0.108). Cumulative pre-season precipitation regressed with FFD posi-tively for early-flowering time series, with the explained variation ranging from 11.7 to 49.4% over different pre-season periods. The negative impact of precipitation on flowering phenology is unex-pected, because an increase in precipitation should not hamper plant growth in the semi-arid and arid environments on the QTP. However, precipitation was found to be inversely correlated with temperature. Thus, it is likely that temperature, and not precipitation, regulated flowering phenol-ogy over the study period. No relationship was found between FFD and snow-cover melt date or duration. This result indicated that snow cover may not affect flowering phenology significantly, which may be because plant flowering time was much later than the snow-cover melt date on the QTP. These findings contrast the results of controlled experiments on the QTP, which showed that precipitation regulated flowering phenology, and with other studies that showed that snow-cover melting time determined flowering dates of early-flowering species in high latitude and Arctic zones in Europe and North America, where the low-temperature environment is similar to the QTP. These findings can improve flowering phenology models, assist in the prediction of phenological responses of herbaceous plants to climate change, and forecast changes in the structure and function of the grassland ecosystem on the QTP. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a simulation-based regional irrigation water optimization model (SRIOP) was developed for watershed-scale optimal spatial allocation based on dynamic responses of agro-hydrological process and its spatial differences. The SRIOP model tightly linked a field-scale agro-hydrological model (SWAP-EPIC) with an optimization algorithm (NSGA-II) in a regional multi-level optimization framework. It performed at three levels that sequentially dealt with optimal irrigation water allocation on field, irrigation district and irrigated watershed scales, with two objectives of maximizing yield/benefit and minimizing irrigation water. The model was tested with a case study in the major irrigation system (MIS) of middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwest China. The optimal spatial distribution of irrigation water showed a decreased variation coefficient (0.17) and increased irrigation benefit (9.8% higher) as compared with that of the present year, and better reflected the effects of multi-level collaboration and crop-soil field distribution. The impacts of climate condition changes on optimized results and resulting uncertainty were also quantified and evaluated through optimizations in different climate years. The case study indicated that the model is a computationally efficient and feasible approach for process-based optimization on large scales with considering impacts of climate condition changes. © 2021","Agro-hydrological process; Multi-level framework; Multiple objectives; Optimal spatial allocation; Simulation-optimization","Climate change; Climate models; Optimization; Water supply; Watersheds; Agro-hydrological process; Irrigation water use; Irrigation waters; Multi-level framework; Multiple-objectives; Optimal spatial allocation; Optimisations; Optimization models; Process-based; Simulation optimization; Irrigation; climate change; climate effect; irrigation system; optimization; river basin; simulation; spatial distribution; watershed; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105787619

Elevated CO2 concentration significantly increased the grain number and starch concentration, while decreased the grain protein concentration. Multi-generational exposure to elevated CO2 concentration also led to significant changes in grain amino acid concentration. In response to the elevated CO2 concentration, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Ralstonia, and Klebsiella were the dominant bacterial genera, while Penicillium, Cutaneotrichosporon, Fusarium, Sarocladium, Acremonium and Aspergillus were the dominant fungal genera in wheat grain. A significantly positive correlation was found between Pseudomonas, Penicillium and ratio of starch to protein concentration, implying that the multi-generational CO2 elevation induced modifications in grain quality might be associated with the changes in grain microbial diversity. The results of this study suggest that the endophytic microbes may play an important role in modulating the grain nutritional quality in wheat under multi-generational e[CO2] exposure, through regulating starch and N metabolism and production of secondary metabolites. © 2021","Elevated CO2; Grain quality; Microbial diversity; Transgenerational effect; Triticum aestivum","Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Metabolites; Proteins; Starch; Acid concentrations; CO2 concentration; Microbial diversity; Nutritional qualities; Positive correlations; Protein concentrations; Secondary metabolites; Starch concentration; Grain (agricultural product); carbon dioxide; cysteic acid; cysteine; methionine sulfone; nitrogen; plant protein; starch; carbon dioxide; amino acid; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); endophyte; microbial community; microorganism; protein; secondary metabolite; species diversity; starch; wheat; Acremonium; agricultural parameters; Article; Aspergillus; controlled study; correlation analysis; Cutaneotrichosporon; endophyte; food grain; Fusarium; grain yield; Klebsiella; microbial diversity; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; nutritional value; Penicillium; plant parameters; Pseudomonas; Ralstonia; Rhodococcus; Sarocladium; Trichosporon; Triticum aestivum; wheat; chemistry; Fusarium; nutritional value; Aspergillus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fusarium; Klebsiella; Penicillium; Pseudomonas; Ralstonia; Rhodococcus; Sarocladium; Triticum aestivum; Carbon Dioxide; Edible Grain; Fusarium; Nutritive Value; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101629876

However, the unsatisfactory solar light absorption, low surface area and the rapid recombination of photogenerated charges severely restrict the photocatalytic activity of bulk g-C3N4. Especially, g-C3N4 with a bandgap of 2.7 eV means an absorption threshold at about 450 nm that is still insufficient for efficient visible light capturing and leaves the near-infrared (NIR) light spectrum unexploited. In order to facilitate future material design for efficient g-C3N4 photocatalysts under solar light (UV ~5%, visible light ~43%, NIR light ~52%), we reviewed the recent progress of NIR-driven g-C3N4 based photocatalysts. Many strategies, including combination of narrow optical gap materials, bandgap engineering, upconversion materials, plasmonic materials, and photosensitizers, have been summarized to broaden the light absorption of g-C3N4 to NIR light region. Besides, the diverse photocatalytic applications of NIR driven g-C3N4 photocatalysts have been summarized, including water purification, water splitting, N2 photofixation, CO2 reduction, NO removal, H2O2 production, bacteria disinfection, photodynamic therapy and organic synthesis, etc. The mechanism and the roles of various strategies in the NIR photocatalytic process were highlighted in details.

Using a panel data set of 275 Chinese cities at the prefecture level and above from 2003 to 2014, this study is the first to adopt a continuous spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) model to investigate the effect and its mechanism of HSR service intensity on CO2 emissions. A series of robustness tests are performed, including the placebo test and using the propensity score matching method combined with the SDID (PSM-SDID) model. We also conduct a heterogeneity analysis using a spatial difference-in-difference-in-differences (SDDD) model. The results show that an increase in HSR service intensity significantly reduces urban CO2 emissions, resulting from the effects of transportation substitution, market integration, industrial structure, and technological innovation. Meanwhile, such an increase inhibits CO2 emissions in neighboring cities with a spatial attenuation boundary of 1000 km. On average, for every addition of 100 HSR trains in a city, the total CO2 emissions can be reduced by 0.14%. Moreover, the CO2 emission reduction effect of HSR is more significant in eastern China, large cities, and resource-based cities. However, higher levels of HSR service intensity in large cities and resource-based cities are not conducive to reducing CO2 emissions in neighboring cities. These findings can help to accurately evaluate the social benefits of expanding HSR networks and provide an important decision-making reference for climate governance during the era of HSR. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","China; High-speed rail; Service intensity; Spatial difference-in-differences model; Spatial spillover effect; Urban CO2 emissions","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Railroad transportation; Regional planning; Urban transportation; China; CO$-2$/ emission; Difference-in-differences models; High speed rail; High-speed rail services; Service intensity; Spatial difference-in-difference model; Spatial differences; Spatial spillover effect; Urban CO2 emission; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; environmental economics; environmental impact; high-speed train; railway transport; regional economy; spatial analysis; spillover effect; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104394897

Forage quality also influences herbivore distributions, but less is known about the effects of climate change on plant biochemical properties. Remote sensing could enable landscape-scale estimations of forage quality, which is of interest to wildlife managers. Despite the importance of integrated forage quality metrics like digestible protein (DP) and digestible dry matter (DDM), few studies investigate remote sensing approaches to estimate these characteristics. We evaluated how well DP and DDM could be estimated using hyperspectral remote sensing and assessed whether incorporating shrub structural metrics affected by browsing would improve our ability to predict DP and DDM. We collected canopy-level spectra, destructive-vegetation samples, and flew unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) in willow (Salix spp.) dominated areas in north central Alaska in July 2019. We derived vegetation canopy structural metrics from 3D point cloud data obtained from UAV imagery using structure-from-motion photogrammetry. The best performing model for DP included a spectral vegetation index (SVI) that used a red-edge and shortwave infrared band, and shrub height variability (hvar; Nagelkerke R 2 = 0.81, root mean square error RMSE = 1.42%, cross validation ρ = 0.88). DDM's best model included a SVI with a blue and a red band, the normalized difference red-edge index, and hvar (adjusted R 2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.16%, cross validation ρ = 0.80). Results from our study demonstrate that integrated forage quality metrics may be successfully quantified using hyperspectral remote sensing data, and that models based on those data may be improved by incorporating additional shrub structural metrics such as height variability. Modern airborne sensor platforms such as Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral & Thermal Imager provide opportunities to fuse data streams from both structural and optical data, which may enhance our ability to estimate and scale important foliar properties. © 2021 The Author(s).

A comprehensive understanding of climate risks and their impacts is a pre-requisite for developing suitable adaptation strategies toward sustainable development. This paper assessed the socio-economic vulnerability based on sustainable development goals (SDG) in the state of Tamil Nadu in the context of climate risks to comprehend the links between climate risks and the physical setting of Tamil Nadu, along with its capability to adapt. An indicator-based methodology of vulnerability assessment as per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was adopted to understand the links between the sensitivity of the state and its ability to cope and adapt. The climate extremities, which cause risks, were determined based on India Meteorological Department (IMD) norms. The indicators which directly or indirectly label specific/integrated goals of SDG were used as sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators. Data from each district for all identified indicators were collected from authentic sources and categorized into four components: natural, social, economic, and infrastructure. The indicators were analyzed and weights were assigned to the indicators using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The district-wise vulnerability indices were calculated and categorized as natural vulnerability index (NVI), social vulnerability index (SVI), economic vulnerability index (EVI), infrastructure vulnerability index (IVI), and overall cumulative vulnerability index (CVI). The study revealed the significant contributing indicators of risk and the vulnerable districts of Tamil Nadu. Ariyalur was identified as the most vulnerable district due to its high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity to climate risks.

This can be achievedviathe usage of a gas diffusion electrode. It allows for electrochemical reactions at the three-phase boundary between gaseous CO2, liquid electrolyte and electrocatalyst. Thus, current densities in commercially relevant magnitudes of 200 mA cm−2and beyond can be reached. However, when increasing the current density one faces a new set of challenges, unknown from low current experiments. Here, we address the issue of gas evolution causing a local increase in resistance and the impact on the operation of flow cells with gas diffusion electrodes. We set up a simple simulation model and compared the results with experiments on a real setup. As a result, the gas evolution's strong impact on current-, potential- and resistance-distributions along the flow axis can be described. Main consequence is that the positioning of the reference electrode has a significant effect on the locally measured IR-drop and thus on the measured or applied potential. Therefore, data from different setups must be compared with great care, especially with respect to the potentials, on which the cell is operated. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Carbon dioxide; Current density; Diffusion in gases; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytes; Gases; Applied potentials; Electrochemical flow cells; Electrochemical reactions; Gas diffusion electrodes; Liquid electrolytes; Reference electrodes; Resistance distribution; Three phase boundary; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114747295

The building is designed for the maximum use of daylight and natural ventilation. This is the result of its shallow plan depth and the inner light wells/ventilation stacks, which also serve the inner circulation space. The light wells/ventilation stacks are created as a result of the organic shape of the internal partitions. The building is constructed from a steel frame and hemp-lime bio-composite material (hempcrete), which smooths out the fluctuations of internal air temperature and relative humidity. The south facing façade is fitted with the Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) photovoltaic array that covers 90% of the opaque surface area of the façade. The design was based on nature-inspired computation, with sustainability principles as guiding constraints. The main findings are that the building achieves −227 tonnes of negative embodied carbon due to se-questration of CO2 in the hemp plant from which the material was harvested, and a net-zero oper-ation. The main conclusions are that in the context of climate emergency, nature inspired design leads to energy efficient buildings with a high level of thermal comfort, which are buildable and sustainable. © 2021 by the authors.

Germany, Finland, United Kingdom, Portugal and Greece were the first European countries to introduce and develop own minerals policy (2010–2012). Each of Member State prioritized own targets, but sustainability, waste management and climate were also underlined. In 2015 the 17 Sustainable Development Goals were established and adopted in the EU policy framework to monitor and measure the social, economic and environmental aspects. Next Paris Agreement targets and climate neutral has been introduced. They have significant impact also on mining industry. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to discuss the relationship between mineral policy in chosen countries and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and EU climate policy target. Due to limited data for mining sector the impact of mineral policy on sustainable mineral supply and CO2 emissions have been analyzed to identify the specific challenges, trends and successful factors of transition. It was shown that well developed mineral policy - in case of Finland - allow increase over 20% of production with over 20% decrease of CO2 emission. Moreover productivity in the sector in almost all analyzed country has been increased, what can show some correlation between mineral policy and SDG 12. However more detailed indicators for monitoring and assess the mineral policy on EU level and in individual country is needed, especially in contest of impact on sustainable development. It can help to provide acceptance of local society for new investment. It is a long term process which required not only significant financial capital, new technological solutions, but also trust and transparency in monitoring in implementing environmental and social aspects. © 2021, The Author(s).","EU mineral policy; low carbon economy; mining; raw materials supply; resource productivity; sustainable development goals","comparative study; European Union; mineral; mining industry; Sustainable Development Goal; Finland; Germany; Greece; Portugal; United Kingdom; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101176601

Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria may play a key role in denitrification in aquifers depleted in organic carbon. Under anoxic and circumneutral pH conditions, iron(II) was hypothesized to serve as an electron donor for microbially mediated nitrate reduction by Fe(II)-oxidizing (NRFeOx) microorganisms. However, lithoautotrophic NRFeOx cultures have never been enriched from any aquifer, and as such, there are no model cultures available to study the physiology and geochemistry of this potentially environmentally relevant process. Using iron(II) as an electron donor, we enriched a lithoautotrophic NRFeOx culture from nitrate-containing groundwater of a pyrite-rich limestone aquifer. In the enriched NRFeOx culture that does not require additional organic cosubstrates for growth, within 7 to 11 days, 3 2 20.3 to 0.5 mM nitrate was reduced and 1.3 to 2 mM iron(II) was oxidized, leading to a stoichiometric NO 2/Fe(II) ratio of 0.2, with N and N O identified as the main nitrate reduction products. Short-range ordered Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides were the product of iron(II) oxidation. Microorganisms were observed to be closely associated with formed minerals, but only few cells were encrusted, suggesting that most of the bacteria were able to avoid mineral precipitation at their surface. Analysis of the microbial community by long-read 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the culture is dominated by members of the Gallionellaceae family that are known as autotrophic, neutrophilic, and microaerophilic iron(II) oxidizers. In summary, our study suggests that NRFeOx mediated by lithoautotrophic bacteria can lead to nitrate removal in anthropogenically affected aquifers. IMPORTANCE Removal of nitrate by microbial denitrification in groundwater is often limited by low concentrations of organic carbon. In these carbon-poor ecosystems, nitrate-reducing bacteria that can use inorganic compounds such as Fe(II) (NRFeOx) as electron donors could play a major role in nitrate removal. However, no lithoautotrophic NRFeOx culture has been successfully isolated or enriched from this type of environment, and as such, there are no model cultures available to study the rate-limiting factors of this potentially important process. Here, we present the physiology and microbial community composition of a novel lithoautotrophic NRFeOx culture enriched from a fractured aquifer in southern Germany. The culture is dominated by a putative Fe(II) oxidizer affiliated with the Gallionellaceae family and performs nitrate reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation leading to N2O and N2 formation without the addition of organic substrates. Our analyses demonstrate that lithoautotrophic NRFeOx can potentially lead to nitrate removal in nitrate-contaminated aquifers. © 2021. American Society for Microbiology.

The aim of this study was to examine (i) the state of SOC in topsoil and subsoil of vineyards compared to the nearest forest, (ii) the influence of soil management on SOC, (iii) the variation in SOC content with topographic position, (iv) the intensity of soil erosion in order to estimate the leaching of SOC from upper to lower topographic positions, and (v) the significance of SOC for the reduction of soil’s susceptibility to compaction. The study area was the vineyard region of Niš, which represents a medium-sized vineyard region in Serbia. About 32% of the total land area is affected, to some degree, by soil erosion. However, according to the mean annual soil loss rate, the total area is classified as having tolerable erosion risk. Land use was shown to be an important factor that controls SOC content. The vineyards contained less SOC than forest land. The SOC content was affected by topographic position. The interactive effect of topographic position and land use on SOC was significant. The SOC of forest land was significantly higher at the upper position than at the middle and lower positions. Spatial distribution of organic carbon in vineyards was not influenced by altitude, but occurred as a consequence of different soil management practices. The deep tillage at 60–80 cm, along with application of organic amendments, showed the potential to preserve SOC in the subsoil and prevent carbon loss from the surface layer. Penetrometric resistance values indicated optimum soil compaction in the surface layer of the soil, while low permeability was observed in deeper layers. Increases in SOC content reduce soil compaction and thus the risk of erosion and landslides. Knowledge of soil carbon distribution as a function of topographic position, land use and soil management is important for sustainable production and climate change mitigation. © 2021 by the authors.

Silica aerogel's thermal conductivity is lowest at intermediate densities (ρ ≈ 0.11 g/cm3) and, because of the strong, power-law dependence of the E modulus on density, this rather low density so far led to low E moduli. Even with polymer reinforcement, increasing stiffness is only possible at higher density, thus higher conductivity. This paper explores the synthesis of silica aerogel granules using ambient pressure drying to provide enhanced mechanical stiffness whilst maintaining thermal conductivities well below 20 mW m−1 K−1. The aging and drying conditions affect the interplay between mechanical and thermal properties, and are varied to optimize the physical properties. The dense (ρ≤0.29 g/cm3), but superinsulating (λ≈15 mW m−1 K−1) silica aerogels presented in this paper challenge the community's understanding of heat transport in aerogels, and do not rely on polymer reinforcement. The underlying microscopic structural parameters affecting the mechanical and thermal transport properties are investigated by modelling and simulation of the aerogel back-bone. Short aging times reduce the cross-section of, and heat transport through, inter-particle necks, leading to an overall decrease in thermal conductivity through the solid skeleton (λs). In addition, short-aged gels undergo a partial pore collapse during ambient pressure drying of the pore fluid due to less aged, hence weaker network structures. The resulting denser structure contains additional point contacts that increase stiffness, by up to an order of magnitude. However, heat transport through these newly formed point-contacts is limited and the gas phase conduction (λs) is further suppressed due to the even smaller pore sizes. Strong and superinsulating particles are ideal fillers for aerogel composites, concrete and renders. The optimized APD aerogels, available as granules, are finally compiled in a composite thermal insulation board with an effective thermal conductivity down to 20 mW m−1 K−1 with improved strength: a 2-fold increase for E, compared to a board produced from classical silica aerogel granulate. The possibility to improve mechanical properties of pure silica aerogels can help aerogels to break into new high-strength, superinsulating structural applications needed to reduce carbon emissions of the built environment. © 2021 The Author(s)","Evaporative drying; Shrinkage; Silica aerogel; Thermal conductivity; Uniaxial compression","Drying; Granulation; Heat transfer; Point contacts; Pore size; Reinforcement; Silica; Silica gel; Stiffness; Structural properties; Thermal conductivity of solids; Thermal insulation; Ambient pressure drying; Effective thermal conductivity; Low thermal conductivity; Mechanical and thermal properties; Modelling and simulations; Structural applications; Thermal insulation boards; Thermal transport properties; Aerogels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106364021

Day after day, more residents are becoming aware of the benefits of using RE-based microgrid networks to provide electricity to disengaged areas. Bangladesh, a densely populated country of the world, is still facing acute load shedding problems in its different regions, and aRE-based microgrid can be an efficient means to solve such kinds of problem. To set up a microgrid system, optimization is required for cost and reliability analysis. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of the most trending optimization techniques. Considering energy crisis of Bangladesh, in this paper, a RE-based microgrid is designed, and optimized using a novel genetic algorithm for ensuring minimum cost and greenhouse gas emissions. Here., GA optimization technique is implemented in Matlab 2015a environment, and optimal equipment capacity and operation planning is obtained. The optimization results show that the proposed microgrid system reduces the cost considerably, and reduces the emission of CO299.56% with respect to the conventional fossil fuel-based system. Therefore, the proposed microgrid can be an effective energy solution for the rural areas of Bangladesh. © 2021 IEEE.","Bangladesh; Distributed generation system; Energy crisis; evolutionary algorithms; Genetic Algorithm; Greenhouse Gas; Microgrid; Optimization; Renewable Energy","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Electric load shedding; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Microgrids; Reliability analysis; Effective energy; Equipment capacities; GA optimization; Micro-grid systems; Novel genetic algorithm; Operation planning; Optimization techniques; Renewable energy technologies; Genetic algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113724701

While existing studies attempted to create an exhaustive list of barriers by focusing on “what” is occurring, we continue to have a meager understanding of “how” or “why” barriers emerge in the governance process. Selecting Bangladesh as a case study area, we identify the mechanisms that cause the emergence of barriers in the climate change adaptation governance process. We particularly focus on the barriers that emerge through interactions among actors. We base our research on data from key-informant interviews and a systematic literature review. Our analysis reveals that there are at least five mechanisms that are involved in the emergence of barriers: enclosure and exclusion, boundary control, organizational inertia, belief formation, and frame polarization. Our identification of common mechanisms provides insights on actors' roles and activities in adaptation governance and elucidates the processes through which actors' interactions lead to barriers. This mechanism-based analysis of barriers will help to address and navigate through the barriers more effectively to ensure successful adaptation. As climate change is becoming mainstreamed in development plans and policies in our study area, identifying the mechanisms of adaptation barriers can elucidate how development and climate adaptation strategies are affected by identified barriers. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; Bangladesh; barriers; governance; mechanisms","adaptive management; climate change; development strategy; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental research; governance approach; literature review; policy approach; research work; strategic approach; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096697509

Herein, a new method was reported to produce mangosteen peels activated carbons (MPACs). This strategy is based on the thermal aging of Mangosteen peels with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under hydrothermal conditions, followed by activation of KOH solid-state and carbonization under 800 °C for 1 hour. Various techniques such as the transmission electron microscope, field emission scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to confirm the successful preparation of MPACs. The findings indicated that well-structured micro/mesoporous structures make the prepared MPACs with well-defined amorphous shapes. After optimizing KOH as an activator with a different mass ratio, we found that the prepared MPAC-1 (1:1 mass ratio) holds an excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 274.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g and a maximum capacitance retention rate of 94.5% after 10.000 cycles. More importantly, the symmetric device exhibits a high specific capacitance of 44.6 F/g at 1 A/g in 6 M KOH aqueous solution and demonstrated high specific energy of 12.14 Wh/kg specific power of 349.6 W/kg. The high electrochemical performance of MPACs was attributed to their large surface area (1078.92 m2/g) which shortens the ion diffusion paths and rapid migration of electrons. Our experimental results demonstrated that due to the simplicity of this newly introduced method and cost-effectiveness, MPACs have promising future applications in green energy production. © 2021","Activated carbon; Environmental friendly; Green energy; Mangosteen peels; Supercapacitor","Capacitance; Carbonization; Cost effectiveness; Energy policy; Potassium hydroxide; Scanning electron microscopy; Supercapacitor; Thermal aging; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemicals; Energy storage materials; Environmental-friendly; Green energy; Hydrothermal process; Mangosteen peel; Mass ratio; Performance; Property; Activated carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105001210

However, both the APOE ε2 and the APOE ε4 alleles are genetic risk factors for lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. The reasons for the high prevalence of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage and the low prevalence of Alzheimer's disease with the APOE ε2 allele remains unknown. Here, we describe the case of a 79-year-old Japanese female with Alzheimer's disease, homozygous for the APOE ε2 allele. This patient presented with recurrent lobar hemorrhages and multiple cortical superficial siderosis. The findings on the 11C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography (PET) were characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. 18F-THK5351 PET revealed that the accumulation of 18F-THK 5351 in the right pyramidal tract at the pontine level, the cerebral peduncle of the midbrain, and the internal capsule, reflecting the lesions of the previous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe. Moreover, 18F-THK5351 accumulated in the bilateral globus pallidum, amygdala, caudate nuclei, and the substantia nigra of the midbrain, which were probably off-target reaction, by binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). 18F-THK5351 were also detected in the periphery of prior lobar hemorrhages and a cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as in some, but not all, areas affected by cortical siderosis. Besides, 18F-THK5351 retentions were observed in the bilateral medial temporal cortices and several cortical areas without cerebral amyloid angiopathy or prior hemorrhages, possibly where tau might accumulate. This is the first report of a patient with Alzheimer's disease, carrying homozygous APOE ε2 allele and presenting with recurrent lobar hemorrhages, multiple cortical superficial siderosis, and immunohistochemically vascular amyloid β. The 18F-THK5351 PET findings suggested MAO-B concentrated regions, astroglial activation, Waller degeneration of the pyramidal tract, neuroinflammation due to CAA related hemorrhages, and possible tau accumulation. © Copyright © 2021 Ikeda, Okamoto, Suzuki, Takai, Kasahara, Furuta, Furuta, Tashiro, Shimizu, Takatama, Naito, Sato, Sakai, Takahashi, Amari, Takatama, Higuchi, Tsushima, Yokoo, Kurabayashi, Ishibashi, Ishii and Ikeda.","11C-PiB PET; 18F-THK5351 PET; Alzheimer's disease; apolipoprotein ϵ allele; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; cortical superficial siderosis; hypobetalipoproteinemia; recurrent lobar brain hemorrhages",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111019305

We compute the ToEI using probabilistic climate change projections and impact functions from three integrated assessment models of climate change: DICE, RICE and CLIMRISK. Our results demonstrate that, in terms of the business-as-usual carbon emissions scenario, the global economy could reach its ToEI by 2095. Regional results highlight areas that are likely to reach the ToEI sooner, namely Western Europe by 2075, India by 2083, and Africa by 2085. We also explore local-scale variations in the ToEI demonstrating that, for example, Paris already reached the ToEI around 2020, while Shanghai will reach it around 2080. We conclude that the ToEI methodology can be applied to impact models of varying scales when sufficient historical impact data are available. Moreover, unprecedented impacts of climate change in the 21st century may be experienced even in economically developed regions in the US and Europe. Finally, moderate to stringent climate change mitigation policies could delay the extreme economic impacts of climate change by three decades in Latin America, the Middle East, and Japan, by two decades in India, Western Europe, and the US, and by one decade in Africa. Our results can be used by policymakers interested in implementing timely climate policies to prevent potentially large economic shocks due to climate change. © 2021 The Author(s).

As MENA countries develop laws, policies, and instruments aimed at addressing climate change, a closer analysis of the origin and nature of the Waqf system can help frame such environmental responses and action, and could contribute further impetus to international and regional efforts to finance and implement climate action. This chapter examines the potential roles of Waqf endowments in climate change action in the MENA Region by first explaining the meaning, nature, and elements of the Waqf. It demonstrates how MENA countries can harness Islamic principles of Waqf to promote the development of environmental funds and instruments to advance climate action. Drawing from the historical civilizations and cultures of MENA countries can provide adequate solutions to the global climate change conundrum. Secondly, it situates the underlying notion of Waqfs within the comparative law of the public trust doctrine (PTD), as well as the emerging Spiritual Ecology movement (Eco-Islam). It demonstrates how scholarship on the PTD, and eco-Islam can shed light on the nature, scope, and importance of Waqfs in addressing climate change. Third, it analyzes the challenges and barriers that hamper the revival of the environmental Waqf and then suggests law and policy roadmaps for addressing such challenges. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

Moreover, a red shift (toward longer wavelength) is observed in the absorption edges of the ZnSe1-xTex solid solutions, which enables them to effectively utilize visible light for the photocatalytic applications. The Te doping into ZnSe can increase the n-type conductivity of the obtained solid solutions. Effective mass of photogenerated charge carriers at all Te concentrations is less than 1.5m0, implying the high mobility of charge carriers in the ZnSe1-xTex solid solutions.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are excellent platforms to generate different nanocomposites comprising metals, oxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, or carbides embedded in porous carbon matrix. These MOF derived nanocomposites offer symbiosis of properties like high crystallinities, inherited morphologies, controllable dimensions, and tunable textural properties. Particularly, adjustable energy band positions achieved by in situ tailored self/external doping and controllable surface functionalities make these nanocomposites promising photocatalysts. Despite some progress in this field, fundamental questions remain to be addressed to further understand the relationship between the structures, properties, and photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites. In this review, different synthesis approaches including self-template and external-template methods to produce MOF derived nanocomposites with various dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, or 3D), morphologies, chemical compositions, energy bandgaps, and surface functionalities are comprehensively summarized and analyzed. The state-of-the-art progress in the applications of MOF derived nanocomposites in photocatalytic water splitting for H2 generation, photodegradation of organic pollutants, and photocatalytic CO2 reduction are systemically reviewed. The relationships between the nanocomposite properties and their photocatalytic performance are highlighted, and the perspectives of MOF derived nanocomposites for photocatalytic applications are also discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

Urban environments (cities) are responsible for the creation of a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions which are the source of climate change. Cities have been increasingly the focus of action to address climate change, yet emissions are not significantly reducing. Additionally, there a lack of integration between adaptation and mitigation. This prevents responses adequate to limit global warming to 1.5OC, and to be well adapted to anticipated changes. This paper critically analyses existing definitions and typologies of climate change actions. A definition of ‘climate change transformation’ is proposed which includes the integration of adaptation and mitigation goals to enable a new regime in which global warming is limited to 1.5OC. A new three-part typology: ‘coping, malaction and transformation,’ is presented for categorising climate change actions by the extent to which they integrate adaptation and mitigation, and define a new regime. The typology is accompanied by illustrations to demonstrate the relationship between adaptation and mitigation. The definition, typology and illustration serve to guide effective climate change decision making, and provides principles to guide application in urban environments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change transformation; Coping; Malaction; Mitigation; New regime; Urban environments","Decision making; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Adaptation; Climate change transformation; Coping; Decisions makings; Greenhouse gas emissions; Malaction; Mitigation; New regime; Urban environments; Urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104058598

CO2 reduction reactions powered by renewable electricity offer a possible route to transform our incumbent linear consumption economic model by tapping into the over 10 gigatonnes of carbon emitted globally each year in the form of CO2. However, many critical questions for CO2 reduction remain unanswered across the varied pathway-product combinations such as (1) what is the near-term economic viability? (2) what opportunities exist for transformational R&D to reduce cost? (3) what is the impact of CO2 price? (4) how does renewable electricity intermittency affect the production costs? Herein we perform a comprehensive economic assessment of CO2 reduction across five major electricity-driven technologies using a scale basis of a 200 million gallon per year bioethanol facility (ca. 600 kilotonnes CO2 per year) as the CO2 source. From this framework we address these key issues and report the outlook for the near-, mid-, and long-term production of 11 promising carbonaceous products while providing guidance to the research community on key cost drivers and R&D needs. Our analysis shows that with modest technical advancements and an accompanying reduction in electricity price to $0.03 kW h-1 and CO2 price to $20 per tonne, 8 out of 11 CO2-derived products have the potential to reach production costs at parity with, or even lower than, current market prices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Economics; Mathematical transformations; Carbonaceous products; Economic assessments; Economic viability; Long term production; Product combinations; Renewable electricity; Research communities; Technical advancement; Cost benefit analysis; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic activity; electricity; electron; emission control; environmental impact assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110856480

They serve as the precatalysts, and are reduced to In nanocrystals while largely inherit the original size feature during electrochemical CO2 reduction.

However, this issue is often overlooked in city planning. This paper reviews the mechanisms controlling vehicle emission dispersion in urban street canyons and the strategies for managing roadside air pollution. Studies have shown that air pollution hotspots are not all attributed to heavy traffic and proper urban design can mitigate air pollution. The key factors include traffic conditions, canyon geometry, weather conditions and chemical reactions. Two categories of mitigation strategies are identified, namely traffic interventions and city planning. Popular traffic interventions for street canyons include low emission zones and congestion charges which can moderately improve roadside air quality. In comparison, city planning in terms of building geometry can significantly promote pollutant dispersion in street canyons. General design guidelines, such as lower canyon aspect ratio, alignment between streets and prevailing winds, non-uniform building heights and ground-level building porosity, may be encompassed in new development. Concurrently, in-street barriers are widely applicable to rectify the poor roadside air quality in existing street canyons. They are broadly classified into porous (e.g. trees and hedges) and solid (e.g. kerbside parked cars, noise fences and viaducts) barriers that utilize their aerodynamic advantages to ease roadside air pollution. Post-evaluations are needed to review these strategies by real-world field experiments and more detailed modelling in the practical perspective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Control measures; Roadside air quality; Urban planning; Urban street canyons; Vehicle emission dispersion","Air quality; Aspect ratio; Health risks; Quality control; Roadsides; Tall buildings; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Control measures; Controlling vehicles; Emission dispersion; High rise building; Hot spot; Roadside air quality; Street canyon; Urban street canyon; Vehicle emission; Vehicle emission dispersion; Urban planning; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dispersion; health risk; street canyon; traffic emission; urban planning; air pollution; air quality; chemical reaction; city planning; field experiment; geometry; noise; pollutant; porosity; practice guideline; review; weather; air pollutant; city; exhaust gas; prevention and control; theoretical model; tree; wind; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Models, Theoretical; Trees; Vehicle Emissions; Wind",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103099472

The temperature difference between cities and suburbs has gradually increased. In addition, there are unreasonable places in urban planning. This has also led to urban production and life. The waste heat generated cannot be quickly dissipated, causing urban climate problems. In order to alleviate a series of problems in the urban climate, meteorological experts have conducted in-depth research and analysis. The construction industry is looking for ways to strengthen the natural ventilation of buildings in terms of building structure and engineering; the ecological zone strengthens the creation of ecological corridors, the research and development of ecological landscape, and ecological safety models. From the perspective of urban designers, this article uses GIS image recognition technology to conduct a scientific and professional assessment of the climate of coastal cities. This assessment method is expected to scientifically guide the development of urban architectural media art, and ultimately promote smooth ventilation and speed up urban air circulation, to reduce urban air pollution and improve urban climate development. With the changes in coastal climate characteristics, urban media art also changes, emphasizing the history, culture, climate characteristics, and overall strength of the city. High-quality urban media art has increasingly become the city’s intangible assets and rich wealth. Coastal climate characteristics also have a certain impact on the development of urban media art. The artistic image of urban media is related to the different dimensions of coastal climate characteristics. Geographical and cultural characteristic overlay can track the actual development of the city, the changes in climatic and geographical features, and the history and cultural spirit of the city, and guide the direction of urban development. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Climate characteristics; Coastline; GIS image recognition; Urban media research","assessment method; atmospheric pollution; construction industry; data quality; GIS; recognition; research work; urban development; urban pollution; ventilation",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110374423

The daytime surface O3 responses to the DA can largely be explained by the temperature-driven changes in biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds and soil nitric oxide, chemical reaction rates, and dry deposition velocities. On a near-biweekly timescale, the DA modified the mean daytime and daily maximum 8gh average surface O3 by up to 2-3gppbv, with the maximum impacts occurring in areas where daytime surface air temperature most strongly (i.e., by g1/42gK) responded to the DA. The DA impacted WRF-Chem upper tropospheric O3 (e.g., for its daytime-mean, by up to 1-1.5gppbv) partially via altering the transport of O3 and its precursors from other places as well as in situ chemical production of O3 from lightning and other emissions. Case studies during airborne field campaigns suggest that the DA improved the model treatment of convective transport and/or lightning production. In the cases that the DA improved the modeled SM, weather fields, and some O3-related processes, its influences on the model's O3 performance at various altitudes are not always as desirable. This is in part due to the uncertainty in the model's key chemical inputs, such as anthropogenic emissions, and the model representation of stratosphere-troposphere exchanges. This can also be attributable to shortcomings in model parameterizations (e.g., chemical mechanism, natural emission, photolysis and deposition schemes), including those related to representing water availability impacts. This study also shows that the WRF-Chem upper tropospheric O3 response to the DA has comparable magnitudes with its response to the estimated US anthropogenic emission changes within 2 years. As reductions in anthropogenic emissions in North America would benefit the mitigation of O3 pollution in its downwind regions, this analysis highlights the important role of SM in quantifying air pollutants' source-receptor relationships between the US and its downwind areas. It also emphasizes that using up-to-date anthropogenic emissions is necessary for accurately assessing the DA impacts on the model performance of O3 and other pollutants over a broad region. This work will be followed by a Noah-Multiparameterization (with dynamic vegetation)-based study over the southeastern US, in which selected processes including photosynthesis and O3 dry deposition will be the foci. © 2021 Min Huang et al.",,"anthropogenic effect; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; data assimilation; ozone; parameterization; satellite data; soil moisture; weather; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111105506

A bottom-up approach, which is a typical emission inventory estimation method, requires a lot of human labor and material resources, whereas a top-down approach focuses on individual pollutants that can be measured directly as well as relying heavily on traditional numerical modeling. Lately, the deep neural network approach has achieved rapid development due to its high efficiency and nonlinear expression ability. In this study, we proposed a novel method to model the dual relationship between an emission inventory and pollution concentrations for emission inventory estimation. Specifically, we utilized a neural-network-based comprehensive chemical transport model (NN-CTM) to explore the complex correlation between emission and air pollution. We further updated the emission inventory based on back-propagating the gradient of the loss function measuring the deviation between NN-CTM and observations from surface monitors. We first mimicked the CTM model with neural networks (NNs) and achieved a relatively good representation of the CTM, with similarity reaching 95%. To reduce the gap between the CTM and observations, the NN model suggests updated emissions of NOx, NH3, SO2, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and primary PM2.5 changing, on average, by -1.34%, -2.65%, -11.66%, -19.19% and 3.51%, respectively, in China for 2015. Such ratios of NOx and PM2.5 are even higher (ĝ1/410%) in regions that suffer from large uncertainties in original emissions, such as Northwest China. The updated emission inventory can improve model performance and make it closer to observations. The mean absolute error for NO2, SO2, O3 and PM2.5 concentrations are reduced significantly (by about 10%-20%), indicating the high feasibility of NN-CTM in terms of significantly improving both the accuracy of the emission inventory and the performance of the air quality model. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Firstly, the influence of the angle and thickness of the dome reinforcement part on the stress distribution of the dome section is studied by finite element analysis. Secondly, the weight reduction of carbon fiber composite layer is studied based on the dome reinforcement model. The strain-based Hashin progressive damage model is used to predict the burst pressure and burst mode with user-defined material subroutine (UMAT) of ABAQUS. Finally, the dome reinforcement technology is further verified in comparison with non-dome reinforcement by burst tests. The results show that the progressive damage model can effectively represent matrix cracking and fiber fracture, and the predicted burst pressure and mode is consistent with the test results. The fiber stress near the equator of the dome section affects the burst mode, and the smaller the angle of dome reinforcement parts, the better the reinforcing effect, and the dome reinforcement technology can help to improve the fiber damage state at the dome, transfer the maximum stress to the cylinder section of the vessel, and ensure the burst mode to be a safe mode.

Facilitating sustainable water stewardship in industrial parks is pragmatically essential for water-efficient industry. This study proposes an integrated method to synthesize a water stewardship index (WSI) from the perspective of water utilization, wastewater emission, and water reuse. The WSI is then employed for 219 national-level industrial parks (NIPs), which account for about 12% of China's gross domestic product. Water use, efficiency, and conservation potential can be quantified by employing the index. The key findings are as follows. Freshwater consumption (5,476 Mt/a) and wastewater emission (2,559 Mt/a) accounted for 4.2% and 13% of the total from secondary industry in China respectively. The average water consumption intensity of the NIPs was 1,462 t/mCNY, only one-third of the national average (4,586 t/mCNY). However, the discrepancy in the intensity among NIPs is remarkable: the top 50% of NIPs have an average of 443.4 t/mCNY, which is 17% of the average of the bottom 50% (2,605 t/mCNY). Improving the water recycling rate, reducing conventional pollutant emissions, and developing unconventional water resources, such as reclaimed water, rainwater, and desalinated water, are promising ways to improve the WSI. After accessing the benefits of facilitating water stewardship by benchmarking eco-industrial parks, the average WSI improvement could reach 14.2%; the water conservation and GHG emission mitigation potentials associated could reach 4,164 Mt/a and 4.11 Mt/CO2-eq, respectively, accounting for 57% and 44% of the baseline scenario. Five key measures are proposed to improve the WSI and overall environmental efficiency of the NIPs. © 2021","Industrial park; Integrated assessment; Sustainable water management; Water resource conservation; Water stewardship index","Desalination; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Parks; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Water filtration; Water management; Water pollution; Water recycling; Water supply; Environmental benefits; Industrial parks; Integrated assessment; National level; Resource conservation; Sustainable water; Sustainable water management; Wastewater emissions; Water stewardship index; Waters resources; Water conservation; fresh water; rain; environmental impact assessment; industrial district; nature conservation; recycling; sustainability; wastewater treatment; water management; Article; China; controlled study; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental management; fluid intake; greenhouse gas; gross national product; industrial waste; industrialization; recreational park; waste water recycling; wastewater; water availability; water conservation; water pollution; water quality; water stewardship index; water supply; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103758392

This research was to investigate the changes in soil carbon fractions of Phaeozem derived from loess and laterite PM with corn straw incorporation and quantify the influence of the key factors on soil carbon accumulation in order to improve the soil carbon stabilization efficiency. A simulative laboratory incubation experiment was conducted over 12 months using Phaeozem derived from loess and laterite PM and eight corn straw doses. Results showed that the clay mineral of Phaeozem was dominated by a mixed-mineral illite-smectite layer, illite, vermiculite, kaolinite, and smaller amounts of montmorillonite. Clay mineral species of topsoil were identical with its PM. The LOC and HOC of six soils increase with increase in straw incorporation level. The promoting effectiveness of straw incorporation on C accumulation declined when the C inputs reached a certain level. At 15% straw incorporation levels, the LOC and HOC of six soil increased by 1.86–3.01 g kg−1 and 1.33–2.22 g kg−1 than CK, respectively. The increment of LOC and HOC of six soils followed the trend of LHAp &gt; LLAp &gt; RHAp &gt; RLAp &gt; LC &gt; RC. At 15% straw incorporation levels, the RLOC of RC (419%) and LC (296%) was greater than topsoil (103–254%) and the RHOC of RC (90%) and LC (61%) was much greater than topsoil (9–26%). Further analysis suggested that C input, TSOC, and clay content were the most influential variables on carbon sequestration efficiency. They accounted for about 73% of the variations of RLOC and RHOC. The relative contributions of 2:1 clay to RLOC and RHOC were about 10% and 15%, respectively and that of 1:1 clay were about 4.4% and 3.5%, respectively.

However, quantifying this impact is difficult as meteorological conditions may mask the real effect of changes in emissions on the observed concentrations of pollutants. Based on the air quality and meteorological data at 35 sites in Beijing from 2015 to 2020, a machine learning technique was applied to decouple the impacts of meteorology and emissions on the concentrations of air pollutants. The results showed that the real (“deweathered”) concentrations of air pollutants (expect for O3) dropped significantly due to lockdown measures. Compared with the scenario without lockdowns (predicted concentrations), the observed values of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO during lockdowns decreased by 39.4%, 50.1%, 51.8%, 43.1%, and 35.1%, respectively. In addition, a significant decline for NO2 and CO was found at the background sites (51% and 37.8%) rather than the traffic sites (37.1% and 35.5%), which is different from the common belief. While the primary emissions reduced during the lockdown period, episodic haze events still occurred due to unfavorable meteorological conditions. Thus, developing an optimized strategy to tackle air pollution in Beijing is essential in the future. 摘要 基于2015–2020年北京35个环境空气站和20个气象站观测资料, 应用机器学习方法 (随机森林算法) 分离了气象条件和源排放对大气污染物浓度的影响. 结果发现, 为应对疫情采取的隔离措施使北京2020年春节期间大气污染物浓度降低了35.1%–51.8%; 其中, 背景站氮氧化物和一氧化碳浓度的降幅最大, 超过了以往报道较多的交通站点. 同时, 2020年春节期间的气象条件不利于污染物扩散, 导致多次霾污染事件发生.为进一步改善北京空气质量, 未来需要优化减排策略. © 2021","Air pollutants; COVID-19; COVID-19 ; Emission control strategy; Meteorological normalization; Random forest model; 关键词:; 减排策略 ; 去气象化 ; 大气污染 ; 机器学习 ","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease control; emission control; emission inventory; future prospect; haze; machine learning; particulate matter; policy approach; quantitative analysis; urban area; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105793273

Regarding the joining up of green spaces into green networks, it can have major positive impacts on the environment, societies and economies, and ecology. This study proposes a value model for investing in urban green infrastructure, with impact factors including land use value, energy conservation value, carbon reduction, and disaster prevention value. It establishes that through the interaction between all four of these factors, urban green infrastructure investment increases net operating income. Additionally, as disaster prevention value increases, urban disaster risk declines, and this has an important positive effect on overall value. Our modeling also indicates that in the face of climatic extremes, the construction of urban green infrastructure is increasingly important, particularly in terms of energy value and disaster prevention value. Specific incentives and catalysts for promoting investment in urban green infrastructure are proposed. © 2021 by the authors.

However, this strategy causes an increased susceptibility to self-excited instability, which manifests as fluctuations in heat release rate, flow velocity, and combustor acoustics that oscillate in-phase in a feedback loop. This study considers the effect of the level of premixedness on the self-excited instability in a single-nozzle combustor. In this system, the fuel can be injected inside the nozzle to create a partiallypremixed mixture or far upstream to create a fully-premixed mixture, varying the level of premixedness of the fuel and air entering the combustor. When global equivalence ratio is held constant, the cases with higher levels of premixing have higher instability amplitudes. High-speed CH∗ chemiluminescence imaging shows that the flame for these cases is more compact and the distribution of the heat release rate oscillations is more concentrated near the corner of the combustor in the outer recirculation zones. Rayleigh index images, which are a metric for the relative phase of pressure and heat release rate oscillations, suggest that vortex rollup in the corner region is primarily responsible for determining instability characteristics when premixedness is varied. This finding is further supported through analysis of local flame edge dynamics.

The research analyzing the relationship between human activities and the climate is considerable, with particular focus on intra-system feedback effects: Environmental tipping points, and climate-triggered social tipping points, like migration, to a lesser extent (Kopp et al., 2016; van Ginkel et al., 2018). Due to their cross-disciplinary nature (Guerrero et al., 2018), two-way interactions between the environment and society, whereby movement in either system can trigger inter-system feedbacks (Lade et al., 2013; Yletyinen et al., 2019) as humans respond to a changing environment thereby further changing the environment, have only recently received attention by a growing inter-disciplinary research community. With the aim of improving climate policy and its tools, such as the social cost of carbon, we describe these social-ecological system (SES) feedbacks and place them in the existing taxonomy for tipping points applied by mainstream climate-economy models. Drawing lessons from SES research and related interdisciplinary literature, we discuss the value of and method by which to modify social-cost integrated assessment models (SC-IAMs), like Nordhaus' Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy. As it is critical that climate policy include these risks to the stability of the climate-economy system, we conclude with a research agenda for the identification, quantification, and integration of climate-society feedbacks into SC-IAMs. © 2021 P.

This method is useful because it involves the quantitative analysis of large amounts of literature, using mathematical and statistical method. The results showed that the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and China were the countries with the most published papers in the field. The US plays a key role in the cooperation between international institutions. An assessment conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) created the standard scientific reference for the research on climate change and its consequences. From 2006 to 2016, a large number of co-cited papers laid a solid foundation for research in the field. During this period, the research focused on the impact of climate change on the ecological environment, began to propose different countermeasures, and formed a set of mature research methods. From 2017 to 2019, there was an acceleration in the growth rate of the number of published articles. Strategies to address climate change, including renewable energy and energy transition, were the focus during this phase. Future studies are expected to focus on climate change mitigation strategies and energy policies.

However, the trade-offs and synergies of landscape services have regional heterogeneity, and their influencing factors are largely unknown in polar ecosystem. The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau is a unique but fragile ecosystem, and its landscape services are vital components to the sustainability in this specific polar region. Objectives: This study sought to understand the landscape service relationships, their dynamics and influencing factors, and achieve a sustainable landscape management in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Methods: In this work, we evaluated the spatiotemporal distribution and relationships of multiple landscape services including soil retention (SR), water yield (WY), habitat quality (HQ), crop supply (CS) and livestock supply (LS). We further identified temperature, elevation, population size, land use and land cover (LULC) as influencing factors on landscape services relationships within specific landscape gradients. Results: Our results show that: (1) SR, WY and HQ decreased significantly from the southeast to the northwest. (2) Regulating services-supporting services are mainly identified as synergies, and CS–HQ and CS–LS are manifested as trade-offs. (3) Geophysical factors (temperature, altitude) have impact on the distribution of CS and the trade-off and synergistic dynamics of WY–HQ, increased population size enhances CS–HQ trade-offs, while between supporting and regulating services show trade-offs in high-coverage grassland and unused land.

Methods: A total of 39,569 IgE test results and demographic characteristics were obtained in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between August 2012 and September 2019. Ninety-nine specific allergens were tested according to clinical diagnosis. The logistic regression was used to assess the effects of CO, NO2 and PM2.5 exposure on the risk of sensitization to specific inhalant/food allergens. Generalized additive models with multivariate adjustments were utilized to model the exposure-response relationship. Stratified analyses were performed to estimate the reliability of correlations in various subgroups. Findings: Single-pollutant models indicate that the 3-day moving average (lag2–4) of CO, PM2.5 or NO2 is associated with the increased risk for allergic diseases related to specific inhaled allergens. In multi-pollutant models, the adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 95% (Confidence Interval, CI) increases by 8% (95% CI, 2%–15%) for per increment of 0.2 mg/m3 in CO levels, and rises by 8% (95% CI, 2%–13%) for each increase of 16.3 μg/m3 in PM2.5 concentration. The associations are stronger in youngsters (&lt;18, years) but not significantly different by gender. Particularly, a significantly stronger association between PM2.5 exposure and hospital visits for inhaled allergy is observed in patients who are exposed to lower concentration of SO2 (&lt;10.333 μg/m3) and higher levels of NO2 (≥42.0 μg/m3), as well as patients enrolled after 2017. Interpretation: The short-term exposure to CO/PM2.5 increases the number of hospital visits for IgE-mediated allergy, especially for the sensitization to specific inhalant allergens. Therefore, to prevent inhaled allergies, the public policy for controlling air pollution needs to be considered seriously.

As a large consumer of energy-intensive building material, the construction activities provoke large direct carbon emissions in upstream industrial sectors (i.e. embodied carbon emissions). This paper aims to explore how construction-related climate policies could contribute to future national carbon emission mitigation efforts by employing a demand-side input-output model and scenario analysis. First, a hypothetical extraction approach is used to estimate the overall carbon emissions induced by the construction sector in the base year. Then scenario analysis is conducted to quantify the sector's technical potential for carbon mitigation in 2030 and 2050. We find that implementing construction-related climate measures in China could mitigate 2.5 Gt construction-induced CO2 in 2030, and 6.4 Gt in 2050 — more than Europe's annual total carbon emissions in 2015. More efficient electricity use could make a substantial contribution in the short-term. However, material-related initiatives, especially those focused on metal recycling, could yield significant carbon mitigation from 2030 onwards. Our findings suggest China to optimize the relationship between urbanization and construction to comply with the country's climate commitments better. Mechanisms to reform supply-side incentives, such as mandatory carbon labelling for construction material throughout the supply chain, could offer immediate benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Energy efficiency; Energy-related carbon emissions; Input-output model; Material efficiency; Mitigation potential","Building materials; Climate models; Construction industry; Industrial emissions; Supply chains; Carbon mitigation; Construction activities; Construction sectors; Industrial sector; Infrastructure project; Input output model; Scenario analysis; Technical potential; Carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; construction material; environmental economics; input-output analysis; scenario analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; suburbanization; urbanization; China; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105542791

The effect of national macro-level factors on energy intensity has been basically confirmed, but the effect of regional low-carbon policy remains to be investigated. Based on this, our analysis exploits China’s “low-carbon city pilot” policy as a quasi-natural experiment and conducts the difference-in-difference resign. We collect the panel data of 271 cities in China from 2006 to 2016. The empirical results show that: first, the low-carbon city pilot policy can effectively reduce the energy intensity. Second, there exist heterogeneous effects on energy intensity among different cities, and the inhibition effects in eastern cities, high economic development cites, and non-old industrial-base cities are more significant. Third, the policy mainly affects regional energy intensity through technological innovation rather than industrial structure optimization mechanism. © Copyright © 2021 Hong, Chen and Zhang.","China; cities; difference-in-difference; energy intensity; the low-carbon city pilot policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111062223

The boosted activity resulted from the tight contact between W18O49 and g-C3N4 and the formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction. The local surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) of W5+ also contributed to the realization of efficient photocatalysis under near-infrared light.

Furthermore, the utilization of renewable energy sources has been demonstrated as a significant contribution to reducing pollutant emissions and enhancing the quality of the living environment. Therefore, designing the energy systems based on clean and renewable criteria is considered a sustainable solution for smart cities. Indeed, the deep and rapid penetration of renewable energy-based technologies have been believed to very well fit into a smart city under various scales, this could supply a secure basis for a modern society with a low-carbon economy. In this review paper, the main components and roles of renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, and biofuels) for the smart city were fully introduced. Besides, integrating the renewable sources form into the energy systems of smart cities was thoroughly analyzed on the basis of technical and economic criteria. Finally, existing challenges and future scenarios were also discussed in detail to clarify the progress and perspective of smart renewable energy systems for the smart city. In general, the integration of renewables into energy systems of the smart city is a sagacious perspective and solution aiming to achieve cleaner process and more sustainable development. However, the optimization issues of the energy system for integrating of renewable components, ensuring good stability, maximizing the operating range, and minimizing the investment costs should be critically evaluated in the future works. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 reduction; Integrated energy system; Low-carbon economy; Renewable energy; Smart city; Smart energy system","Economics; Geothermal energy; Investments; Sustainable development; Clean process; CO$-2$/ reduction; Energy systems; Integrated energy systems; Low carbon economy; Renewable energies; Renewable sources; Smart energy systems; Sustainable process; Urban life; Smart city",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105696468

The regulations are mainly focused on reducing vehicle emissions in the Seoul metropolitan region by conforming to the European emissions standards, replacing diesel buses with compressed natural gas buses, incentives for installing diesel exhaust after-treatment systems and buying eco-friendly vehicles. There was a 20% reduction in 2010s compared to the 2000s in terms of the mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with mean aerodynamic diameters of ≤10 μm (PM10) and 2.5 μm (PM2.5) during cold seasons (October through following February) although the decrease may not be entirely attributable to the regulations. The influences of other external factors such as transboundary transport of air pollutants and regional meteorological conditions cannot be neglected. This study analyzes the change in the diurnal variations—two maxima at around 11 and 22 local time (LT) and two minima at around 6 and 16 LT—of air pollutant concentrations that may be closely related to the regulatory action in reducing local vehicle emissions. A reduction of over 40% for the amplitude of two PM concentrations at 11 LT was revealed when values from the 2010s were compared to those from the 2000s. There was a similar reduction for other vehicle exhaust gases including nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. Additional analysis of the long-term trend in mixed layer height and surface wind speed showed that the change in environmental conditions in the diurnal time scale was either negligible or unfavorable for conditions which reduce PM concentrations. This study suggests that the mean concentration estimation may underestimate the regulatory effects, but the approach based on the diurnal variation may be a more accurate indicator. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollutant; PM10; PM2.5; Special clean air act; Vehicle emission",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108005770

This requires drastic changes in all emissions-generating sectors. In the building sector, all new buildings are required to be nearly zero energy buildings. However, 79 % of buildings in Finland were built before 2000, meaning that they lack heat recovery and suffer from badly insulated facades. This study presents four large-scale building energy retrofit scenarios, showing the emission reduction potential in the whole Finnish building stock. Six basic building types with several age categories and heating systems were used to model the energy demand in the building stock. Retrofitted building configurations were chosen using simulation-based multi-objective optimisation and combined according to a novel building stock model. After large-scale building retrofits, the national district heating demand was reduced by 25–63 % compared to the business as usual development scenario. Despite a large increase in the number of heat pumps in the system, retrofits in buildings with direct electric heating can prevent the rise of national electricity consumption.

A novel N-doped graphene oxide enfolded reduced titania (NGO-RT) composite was demonstrated for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into CH4. Later, a small amount of Pt NPs was deposited on NGO-RT that increases the catalytic performance towards CH4 formation. The optimized Pt1.0%-NGO-RT catalyst displayed a selective visible-light CO2 reduction into CH4 using a flow reactor system with ≈12 and ≈2 times higher activity than pristine RT and NGO-RT, respectively. The catalyst demonstrated long-term stability over 35 h. The photo-induced CO2 reduction mechanism was first validated through the electron transfer process, where charge trapping by Ti3+ states near the conduction band of RT plays a vital role in the selective CH4 evolution. These trapped electrons transfer from RT to the closely connected interface of N-doped graphene oxide and Pt NPs to restrict the recombination of electron/hole pair. The improved catalytic performance can be attributed to RT's downward band bending at the NGO-RT interface, where electron transfer from RT to NGO decreases the charge recombination. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 reduction; Flow-reactor system; N-doped GO; Photocatalysis; Reduced titania","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Charge transfer; Charge trapping; Doping (additives); Electron transitions; Electron transport properties; Fossil fuels; Platinum; Platinum compounds; Solar energy; Titanium dioxide; Catalytic performance; Charge recombinations; Electron transfer; Electron transfer process; Flow reactor systems; Interfacial charge transfer; Long term stability; Trapped electrons; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098554429

To maintain the ecosystem functions of carbon sequestration and timber supply in tropical production forests over a long term, forest management must be sustainable under changing climate conditions. Individual-based forest models are useful tools to enhance our understanding about the long-term effects of harvest and climate change on forest dynamics because they link empirical field data with simulations of ecological processes. The objective of this study is to analyze the combined effects of selective logging and climate change on biomass stocks and timber harvest in a tropical forest in French Guiana. By applying a forest model, we simulated natural forest dynamics under the baseline scenario of current climate conditions and compared the results with scenarios of selective logging under climate change. The analyses revealed how substantially forest dynamics are altered under different scenarios of climate change. (1) Repeated logging within recovery times decreased biomass and timber harvest, irrespective of the intensity of climate change. (2) With moderate climate change as envisaged by the 5th IPCC Assessment Report (representative concentration pathway 2.6), the average biomass remained the same as in the baseline scenario (−1%), but with intensive climate change (RCP 8.5), the average biomass decreased by 12%. (3) The combination of selective logging and climate change increased the likelihood of changes in forest dynamics, driven mainly by rising temperatures. Under RCP 8.5, the average timber harvest was almost halved, regardless of the logging cycle applied. An application-oriented use of forest models will help to identify opportunities to reduce the effects of unwanted ecosystem changes in a changing environment. To ensure that ecosystem functions in production forests are maintained under climate change conditions, appropriate management strategies will help to maintain biomass and harvest in production forests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aboveground biomass; Climate change mitigation; Forest degradation; Forest management; French Guiana; Individual-based forest modeling; Paracou; Timber harvest; Tropical forestry","Biomass; Carbon; Climate models; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Logging (forestry); Timber; Tropics; Above ground biomass; Climate change mitigation; Forest degradation; Forest dynamics; Forest models; French Guiana; Individual-based forest modeling; Paracou; Timber harvests; Tropical forestry; Climate change; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate classification; climate conditions; forest dynamics; forest management; Neotropical Region; selective logging; timber; tropical forest; Biomass; Carbon; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Tropics; French Guiana; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104466535

In this work we report on the development, implementation and application of a data-driven, statistical method for mapping SOC stocks in space and time, using Argentina as a pilot. We used quantile regression forest machine learning to predict annual SOC stock at 0–30 cm depth at 250 m resolution for Argentina between 1982 and 2017. The model was calibrated using over 5,000 SOC stock values from the 36-year time period and 35 environmental covariates. We preprocessed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dynamic covariates using a temporal low-pass filter to allow the SOC stock for a given year to depend on the NDVI of the current as well as preceding years. Predictions had modest temporal variation, with an average decrease for the entire country from 2.55 to 2.48 kg C m−2 over the 36-year period (equivalent to a decline of 211 Gg C, 3.0% of the total 0–30 cm SOC stock in Argentina). The Pampa region had a larger estimated SOC stock decrease from 4.62 to 4.34 kg C m−2 (5.9%) during the same period. For the 2001–2015 period, predicted temporal variation was seven-fold larger than that obtained using the Tier 1 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Prediction uncertainties turned out to be substantial, mainly due to the limited number and poor spatial and temporal distribution of the calibration data, and the limited explanatory power of the covariates. Cross-validation confirmed that SOC stock prediction accuracy was limited, with a mean error of 0.03 kg C m−2 and a root mean squared error of 2.04 kg C m−2. In spite of the large uncertainties, this work showed that machine learning methods can be used for space–time SOC mapping and may yield valuable information to land managers and policymakers, provided that SOC observation density in space and time is sufficiently large. Highlights: We tested the use of machine learning for space–time mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. Predictions for Argentina from 1982 to 2017 showed a 3% decrease of the topsoil SOC stock over time. The machine learning model predicted a greater temporal variation than the IPCC Tier 1 approach. Accurate machine learning SOC stock prediction requires dense soil sampling in space and time. © 2020 The Authors.

We found that in case of carbon as the Lewis acid (LA) the reaction is controlled by frontier molecular orbital interactions between the H2 and LA-LB fragments at shorter distances. The steric effects can be reduced by electrophilic substitutions on the carbonyl carbon. Synergic combination between stronger orbital interactions and reduced steric effects can lower the barrier of the H2 splitting below 10 kcal/mol. With the B(C6F5)3, the H2 splitting is controlled by electrostatic interactions, which cause to form an early transition state. An advantage of employing Lewis acidity of the activated carbonyl carbon for hydrogenation is that the hydride-type attack and hydrogenation of the C=O bond occur in a single step throughout H2 splitting. Hence, stronger Lewis acidity of the C(C=O) reinforces hydrogenation without prohibition of the hydride delivery. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","DFT calculations; EDA; FLP catalysis; Lewis acid; Metal-free hydrogenation","Catalysis; Hydrides; Hydrogenation; Molecular orbitals; Carbonyl carbon; Carbonyl groups; DFT calculation; Electrophilic substitutions; Frontier molecular orbitals; Metal-free catalysis; Orbital interaction; Transition state; Carbonyl compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107657040

One of the welfare problems is heat stress, which is gaining importance even in temperate regions. While improving animal welfare may reduce emissions, the mitigation potential depends on the environmental costs associated with specific intervention measures. Taking abatement of heat stress as an example, the aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of implementing mechanical ventilation devices on the contribution potential of milk production to global warming (GWP), terrestrial acidification (TAP) and freshwater eutrophication (FEP). Environmental impacts of two modelled production systems located in alpine and lowland production areas of Austria were estimated before and after the implementation of basket fans, using life cycle assessment. Region-specific climate data were retrieved to determine the number of days with heat stress and to evaluate heat stress-induced productivity shortfalls in the baseline scenario (Sbasic). In the intervention scenario with increased ventilation (Svent), this decline was assumed to be eliminated due to the convective cooling effect of fans. For Sbasic, mean GWP, TAP and FEP impacts were estimated at 1.2 ± 0.09 kg CO2-, 21.1 ± 1.44 g SO2- and 0.1 ± 0.04 g P-equivalents per kg milk, respectively. Independent from the production system, in Svent, implementation of fans did not result in significant environmental impact changes, except for FEP of the alpine system (+5.9%). The latter reflects the comparatively high environmental costs of additional cooling regarding FEP (+2.3%) in contrast to GWP (+0.4%) and TAP (+0.1%). In conclusion, the estimated overall effects of mechanical ventilation on GWP, TAP and FEP of milk production were minor and the model calculations point to the potential of heat stress abatement to at least outweigh the environmental costs associated with fan production and operation. To confirm this trend, further assessments are needed, which should be based on primary data regarding the effectiveness of fan cooling to improve cow productivity, and on emission calculation schemes that are sensitive to environmental factors such as wind speed and temperature. © 2021 The Authors","Acidification; Eutrophication; Global warming; Heat stress abatement; Mechanical ventilation","agricultural land; animal; Austria; bovine; cattle disease; dairying; female; heat injury; milk; veterinary medicine; Animals; Austria; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Dairying; Farms; Female; Heat Stress Disorders; Milk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108688071

Substituting energy- and carbon-intensive synthetic N fertilizers with N derived from biological fixation by WC has been highlighted as a promising environmental mitigation strategy through the omission of emissions, pollutants, and energy usage during the production and application of synthetic fertilizer. Therefore, the objective was to investigate the effect of the inclusion of WC in perennial ryegrass (PRG) swards on the environmental impact of pasture-based dairy systems. Cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment of 3 pasture-based dairy systems were conducted: (1) a PRG–WC sward receiving 150 kg of N/ha per year (CL150), (2) a PRG–WC sward receiving 250 kg of N/ha per year (CL250), and (3) a PRG-only sward receiving 250 kg of N/ha per year (GR250). A dairy environmental model was updated with country-specific N excretion equations and recently developed N2O, NH3, and NO3− emission factors. The environmental impact categories assessed were global warming potential, nonrenewable energy, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential (marine and freshwater). Impact categories were expressed using 2 functional units: per hectare and per metric tonne of fat- and protein-corrected milk. The GR250 system had the lowest milk production and highest global warming potential, nonrenewable energy, and acidification potential per tonne of fat- and protein-corrected milk for all systems. The CL250 system produced the most milk and had the highest environmental impact across all categories when expressed on an area basis. It also had the highest marine eutrophication potential for both functional units. The impact category freshwater eutrophication potential did not differ across the 3 systems. The CL150 system had the lowest environmental impact across all categories and functional units. This life cycle assessment study demonstrates that the substitution of synthetic N fertilizer with atmospheric N fixed by WC has potential to reduce the environmental impact of intensive pasture-based dairy systems in temperate regions, not only through improvement in animal performance but also through the reduction in total emissions and pollutants contributing to the environmental indicators assessed. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association","dairy; life cycle assessment; milk production; perennial ryegrass; white clover","animal; animal food; dairying; diet; environment; female; lactation; Medicago; milk; Animal Feed; Animals; Dairying; Diet; Environment; Female; Lactation; Medicago; Milk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103579460

Indonesia is included in it and has committed to adapt and mitigate this issue, and specifically set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 29% from business as usual levels. One of the priority areas for climate change adaptation and mitigation is Jambi Province. Floods and droughts are a few examples of the impacts of climate change. In addition, waste management and inaccurate waste are one of the factors that trigger climate change and public health problems. As an adaptation and mitigation effort on these problems, it is necessary to strengthen and disseminate community resilience to face climate change. Furthermore, community knowledge and skills capacity building for climate change adaptation and mitigation is carried out. Activities are carried out in efforts to adapt and mitigate climate change by holding several activities. These activities include socialization of strengthening community resilience to climate change, strengthening village policies in the context of climate change mitigation, mentoring and training in rainwater harvesting and water saving, tree planting and urban farming, and strengthening the concept of ""zero waste""in waste or solid waste management. The purpose of these activities is to provide assistance and training to communities in Tangkit Village, Sungai Gelam District, Muaro Jambi Regency, Jambi Province to increase the capacity of knowledge and skills in adaptation and mitigation efforts to create a green village. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Reforestation; Rural areas; Waste management; Water conservation; Business-as-usual; Capacity building; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Community resiliences; Rain water harvesting; Tree plantings; Water - savings; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112643375

Chemical transport models (CTMs) remain the most complete representation of atmospheric processes but are limited in applications that require large numbers of runs, such as those that evaluate individual impacts from large numbers of sources. This limitation motivates comparisons between modern CTM-derived techniques and intentionally simpler alternatives. We model population-weighted PM2.5 source impacts from each of greater than 1100 coal power plants operating in the United States in 2006 and 2011 using three approaches: (1) adjoint PM2.5 sensitivities calculated by the GEOS-Chem CTM; (2) a wind field-based Lagrangian model called HyADS; and (3) a simple calculation based on emissions and inverse source-receptor distance. Annual individual power plants’ nationwide population-weighted PM2.5 source impacts calculated by HyADS and the inverse distance approach have normalized mean errors between 20 and 28% and root mean square error ranges between 0.0003 and 0.0005 µg m−3 compared with adjoint sensitivities. Reduced complexity approaches are most similar to the GEOS-Chem adjoint sensitivities nearby and downwind of sources, with degrading performance farther from and upwind of sources particularly when wind fields are not accounted for. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","air pollution modeling; exposure modeling; HyADS; PM2.5; reduced complexity modeling","air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; particulate matter; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; United States; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082840595

Also, it causes a considerable energy cost reduction. In addition, the use of alternative fuel has a positive impact on environment as a result of reduction of solid waste disposal. Therefore, the aim of this work is to investigate the effect of residual ashes produced from using RDF solid waste as biofuel in Portland cement manufacture on its properties. The solid waste used in this study is refuse derived fuel (RDF) mainly from municipal waste. The effect of adding different ratios of the ash, produced after burning such solid waste, to Portland cement on its hydration characteristics was investigated. This is done through the determination of standard water of consistency, initial and final setting times, compressive strength, chemically combined water content as well as the phase composition of the hydration products via the XRD examination. The ratios of ash used were: 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0% by weight of Portland cement.

At present, the knowledge about whether and how climate-sensitive stand biomass models could reduce the uncertainty of forest biomass/carbon estimation is lacking. Hence, the aim of this study is to develop climate-sensitive stand biomass models and quantify their differences. Data containing 539 sample plots of larch plantations in northern and northeastern China were utilized to develop two basic and the corresponding climate-sensitive stand biomass models. Owing to the uncertainty from predictors, the forecast combination method was used to combine the two basic models (FCMs) and the two climate-sensitive models (CS-FCMs) and to quantify the difference in biomass estimations at the plot and regional scales. Results showed that the adjusted R2 values of the stand biomass models were greater than 0.85 and the relative root mean square errors ranged from 5.51% to 22.62%. The CS-FCMs produced more accurate biomass estimates than the FCMs. The difference in biomass estimations derived from biomass models with and without climatic variables was 411,549 tons or 0.27% at the regional scale, but the carbon value difference amounted to about $8.3 million.

In recent years, solar-driven water evaporation (SDWE) systems have attracted increasing attention for their specialty in no consume conventional energy, pollution-free, and the high purity of fresh water. In particular, carbon-based photothermal conversion materials are preferred light-absorbing material for SDWE systems because of their wide range of spectrum absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency based on super-conjugate effect. Until now, many carbon-based SDWE systems have been reported, and various structures emerged and were designed to enhance light absorption, optimize heat management, and improve the efficient water transport path. In this review, we attempt to give a comprehensive summary and discussions of structure progress of the carbon-based SDWE systems and their working mechanisms, including carbon nanoparticles systems, single-layer photothermal membrane systems, bi-layer structural photothermal systems, porous carbon-based materials systems, and three dimensional (3D) systems. In these systems, the latest 3D systems can expand the light path by allowing light to be reflected multiple times in the microcavity to increase the light absorption rate, and its large heat exchange area can prompt more water to evaporate, which makes them the promising application foreground. We hope our review can spark the probing of underlying principles and inspiring design strategies of these carbon-based SDWE systems, and further guide device optimizations, eventually promoting in extensive practical applications in the future. © 2021 Science China Press","Carbon-based evaporator; Desalination; Photothermal conversion; Solar-driven; Structure development","Absorption spectroscopy; Carbon; Evaporation; Light absorption; Porous materials; Water; Water absorption; Water pollution; 3d systems; Carbon-based; Carbon-based evaporator; Evaporation systems; Fresh Water; Photo-thermal conversions; Pressung; Solar-driven; Structure development; Water evaporation; Desalination",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105263390

Temporal and spatial variations in topsoil (0–0.20 m) SOC were analyzed using 43,743 soil samples in China’s croplands. The soil database in our study was collected from the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) China Program. The results showed an increasing trend in SOC density (SOCD) for both grain and cash crops from 1991 to 2012. The average SOCD increased by 16.8, 17.4, 11.8 and 8.7% in the north central, northwest, southeast and southwest regions, respectively, whereas average SOCD decreased by 1.3% for the northeast region between the 1991–2001 and 2002–2012 periods. For both grain and cash crops, the SOCD frequency distribution (%) increased in the ranges of 10–20, 20–30 and 30–40 Mg C ha−1 from the 1991–2001 to the 2002–2012, but decreased in the ranges of 0–10 and 50–60 Mg C ha−1. Additionally, SOCD increased in most major soil types across China’s cropland regions, except in phaeozems, chernozems and umbrisols, where it decreased by 8.6–18.7% mainly due to water runoff, soil erosion, and low C input. The overall SOC stock (SOCS) in China’s cropland increased by 260 Tg C (23.7 Tg C yr−1) from 1991–2001 to 2002–2012, which was partially due to the increased crop residue return, improved fertilization and adopted conservation tillage over the period. This SOC increase represents a potential offset in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that could help reduce the overall net CO2 emissions in China. © 2021 by the authors.

By controlling the phase-delay and ellipticity of the bi-chromatic laser fields, the third harmonic generation is experimentally and theoretically investigated for elucidating the mechanism of the low-order harmonics. The third harmonic generation is found to be strongly suppressed in the counter-rotating bi-chromatic laser field due to the selection rule for harmonic emissions. The continuum-continuum transition in the strong field approximation is extended to explain the third harmonic generation as a function of the phase delay and ellipticity of the bi-chromatic laser fields. Compared with the semi-classical photocurrent model, the continuum-continuum transition on the basis of quantum-mechanical treatment achieves better agreement with the experimental observations.

We applied a microbial explicit model—CLM-Microbe—to evaluate the impacts of microbial seasonality on soil C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. The CLM-Microbe model was validated in simulating belowground respiratory fluxes, that is, microbial respiration, root respiration, and soil respiration at the site level. On average, the CLM-Microbe model explained 72% (n = 19, p < 0.0001), 65% (n = 19, p < 0.0001), and 71% (n = 18, p < 0.0001) of the variation in microbial respiration, root respiration, and soil respiration, respectively. We then compared the model simulations of soil respiratory fluxes and soil organic C content in top 1 m between the CLM-Microbe model with (CLM-Microbe) and without (CLM-Microbe_wos) seasonal dynamics of soil microbial biomass in natural biomes. Removing soil microbial seasonality reduced model performance in simulating microbial respiration and soil respiration, but led to slight differences in simulating root respiration. Compared with the CLM-Microbe, the CLM-Microbe_wos underestimated the annual flux of microbial respiration by 0.6%–32% and annual flux of soil respiration by 0.4%–29% in natural biomes. Correspondingly, the CLM-Microbe_wos estimated higher soil organic C content in top 1 m (0.2%–7%) except for the sites in Arctic and boreal regions. Our findings suggest that soil microbial seasonality enhances soil respiratory C emissions, leading to a decline in SOC storage. An explicit representation of soil microbial seasonality represents a critical improvement for projecting soil C decomposition and reducing the uncertainties in global C cycle projection under the changing climate. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","microbial respiration; microbial seasonality; root respiration; soil respiration","carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon storage; modeling; root; seasonality; soil carbon; soil respiration; carbon; biomass; ecosystem; microbiology; soil; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105346929

Methods: Using cross-sectional data from 210 women collected in 2009 across 28 agro-pastoralist villages in Kaokoveld Namibia, we conducted principal-component (PC) analysis of resource variables and constructed profiles of resource strategies from the major PCs. Next, we explored associations between key resource strategies and demographic measures and fitness proxies. Results: The first two PCs accounted for 43% of women's overall resource variation. PC1 reflects women's ability to access market resources via livestock trading, while PC2 captured women's direct food access. We found that market strategies were more common among married women and less common among women who have experienced child mortality. Women with higher subsistence security were more likely to be from the OvaHimba tribe and had a higher risk of gonorrhea exposure. We also qualitatively explored drought-induced pressure on women's livestock. Finally, we show that sexual networks were attenuated during drought, indicating strain on social support. Conclusions: Our results highlight how agro-pastoralist women manage critical resources in unpredictable environments, and how resource strategies distribute among the women in our study. Goats as a commodity to obtain critical resources suggests that some women have flexibility during drought when gardens fail and cattle die. However, increased aridity and drought may eventually overwhelm husbandry practices in this region. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110144922

However, there is a paucity of literature on its sustainability implications. To help fill this void we provide a first indicative assessment of the potential sustainability implications for the sharing of three product groups in Sweden, namely cars, small electrical tools and offices. A quantitative assessment of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, resource use and waste based on case studies, is used as a basis to develop scenarios of upscaling sharing at national level. This is combined with a qualitative scoring framework to assess the socio-economic impacts. Office sharing was found to have a significant potential to reduce GHG emissions by 164–243 KtCO2e/yr. Car sharing has a larger potential but has a wide range of uncertainty with potential reductions of 0.5–3.7 MtCO2e (if 80% of cars in Sweden were sharing cars), depending on how many owned cars are replaced by a shared vehicle. However, 80% ownership of battery electric vehicles offer a greater potential benefit with a saving of up to 8.2 MtCO2e. In terms of the reduction in material use, there are potential savings of 232,000 t/yr and 24.4-34.4Mt/yr for cars and offices, respectively. However, the tool sharing case does not demonstrate such large potential for national reductions. The qualitative analysis on socio-economic implications showed largely positive results across the indicators. However, further research is needed to assess the impacts on jobs and the local economy for the shared product groups, and to more fully understand how shared offices effect health and well-being of users. Finally, to avoid potential rebound effects additional support is needed to promote electric cars to avoid fleets of fossil fuel cars with high emissions, a flexible stock of desks without large empty office spaces, and proximity of tool sharing to minimise transport. © 2021","Car sharing; Mitigation potentials; Office sharing; Sharing economy; Sustainability assessment; Tool sharing","Battery electric vehicles; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Office buildings; % reductions; Car sharing; Greenhouse gas emissions; Mitigation potential; Office sharing; Product groups; Quantitative assessments; Sharing economy; Sustainability assessment; Tool sharing; Sustainable development; accessibility; assessment method; car use; electric vehicle; sustainable development; Article; car; car sharing; carbon footprint; combustion; cost control; economic aspect; electric tool sharing; environmental impact assessment; pollution control; population research; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; social aspects and related phenomena; Sweden; waste; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103792227

Ultimately, the grand challenge to be met by agriculture is to sustainably provide acceβ to sufficient, nutritious and diverse food to a worldwide growing population, and to support the circular bio-based economy. Future-proofing our crops is an urgent iβue and a challenging goal, involving a diversity of crop species in differing agricultural regimes and under multiple environmental drivers, providing versatile crop-breeding solutions within wider socio-economic-ecological systems. This goal can only be realized by a large-scale, international research cooperation.

In order to evaluate those deleterious effects on human health more accurately, and to propose proper measures to reduce health risks of air pollution, the conduction of a source-specific health risk assessment is necessary. Based on daily collected PM2.5 samples at different functional sites during winter 2019 in a megacity Chongqing, China, combining source apportionment results from PMF and health risk assessment from the U.S. EPA, the source-specific health risks from PM2.5-bound heavy metals were given. Six types of PM2.5 sources have been identified, coal burning (25.5%), motor vehicles (22.8%), industrial emissions (20.5%), biomass burning (15.9%), dust (7.8%), and ship emissions (7.5%). Results showed that the total hazard quotient (HQ) was 0.32 and the total carcinogenic risks (CR) were 2.09 × 10−6 for children and 8.36 × 10−6 for adults, implying certain risks for local residents. Industrial emissions related with Cr posed both the highest carcinogenic risk and noncarcinogenic risk (contributing 25% CR and 36% HQ). Coal combustion (associated with Cr, As, and Mn) contributed 15.46% CR and 20.64% HQ, while biomass burning and motor vehicles shared 19.99% and 19.05% of the total CR, respectively. This work indicated that health risks of air pollution sources were the combined effects of the source contribution and chemical components. In order to control the health risks of PM2.5 to the local residents, the priority of tar-geted emission sources should be adopted for industrial emissions, biomass burning, vehicle emis-sions, and coal combustion sources. © 2021 by the authors.

With the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, the urban fringe has become the primary space for urban expan-sion, and the intense human activities create a high risk of potentially toxic element (PTE) pollution in the soil. In this study, 138 surface soil samples were collected from a region undergoing rapid urbanization and construction—Weinan, China. Concentrations of As, Pb, Cr, Cu, and Ni (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, ICP-MS) and Hg (Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry, AFS) were measured. The Kriging interpolation method was used to create a visualization of the spatial distribution characteristics and to analyze the pollution sources of PTEs in the soil. The pollution status of PTEs in the soil was evaluated using the national environmental quality standards for soils in different types of land use. The results show that the content range of As fluctuated a small amount and the coefficient of variation is small and mainly comes from natural soil formation. The content of Cr, Cu, and Ni around the automobile repair factory, the prefabrication factory, and the building material factory increased due to the deposition of wear particles in the soil. A total of 13.99% of the land in the study area had Hg pollution, which was mainly distributed on category 1 development land and farmland. Chemical plants were the main pollution sources. The study area should strictly control the industrial pollution emissions, regulate the agricultural production, adjust the land use planning, and reduce the impact of pollution on human beings. Furthermore, we make targeted remediation suggestions for each specific land use type. These results are of theoretical significance, will be of practical value for the control of PTEs in soil, and will provide ecological environmental protection in the urban fringe throughout the urbanization process. © 2021 by the authors.

The main findings are yielded as follows. (1) The labor market distortion and capital market distortion are widespread in China. The high wages caused by the insufficient supply of labor and the low marginal output of labor due to the shortage of human capital stock are the main reason for the positive labor market distortion. The capital market distortion can be put down to the excessive interventions of the government on the allocation of capital. (2) The labor market distortion can enhance CO2 emissions, that is, promoting market-oriented reform in the labor market can curb CO2 emissions. (3) The connection between capital market distortion and CO2 emissions can be described as a U-shaped curve. The complete marketization of the capital market and excessive government intervention in the allocation of capital can both cause an increase in CO2 emissions. (4) Improving the marketization of the labor market is effective for reducing CO2 emissions in almost all provinces. In the central region, the capital market distortion can exacerbate CO2 emissions. However, in the western region, the governmental intervention on the allocation of capital can enable limited funds to more effectively move to environmentally friendly enterprises, and avoid these provinces becoming a pollution refuge. Based on these findings, this article goes into more detail on the policy implications. © 2021","capital market distortion; China; CO2 emissions; labor market distortion; market-oriented reform; U-shaped curve","Carbon dioxide; Employment; Financial markets; Global warming; Public policy; Carbon dioxide emissions; Factor markets; Government intervention; Governmental intervention; Human capitals; Market oriented reforms; Policy implications; Spatial panel data models; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103691964

Using facility-level data on the manufacturing sector, the causal relationship between implementation of the program and investment in high-efficiency equipment is estimated. The results show that the TSET Program promoted the adoption of high-efficiency machines and devices for the first three years of the second compliance period, whereas the program did not spur investments in high-efficiency equipment during the first compliance period. These results suggest that the manufacturing facilities may have adopted relatively cheaper emissions reduction plans in the first compliance period such as improvements to equipment they already owned, whereas in the second compliance period, when the emissions targets became stricter, they allocated money and resources to introduce high-efficiency equipment. These findings indicate that the TSET Program succeeded in encouraging emissions reduction efforts by facilities in the manufacturing sector covered by the scheme, even though the program lacks penalties for noncompliance. © 2020, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Emissions trading; Low-carbon technology; Technology diffusion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081567981

Analyses of their chemical profiles are important for receptor models to accurately estimate the contributions from different sources. We have developed chemical source profiles for five important pollutant sources - construction (CON), paved road dust (PRD), roadside biomass burning (RBB), solid waste burning (SWB), and crop residue burning (CPB) - during three intensive campaigns (winter, summer and post-monsoon) in and around Delhi. We obtained chemical characterisations of source profiles incorporating carbonaceous material such as organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble ions (F−, Cl−, NO2−, NO3−, SO42−, PO43−, Na+ and NH4+), and elements (Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Ba, and Pb). CON was dominated by the most abundant elements, K, Si, Fe, Al, and Ca. PRD was also dominated by crustal elements, accounting for 91% of the total analysed elements. RBB, SWB and CPB profiles were dominated by organic matter, which accounted for 94%, 86.2% and 86% of the total PM2.5, respectively. The database of PM emission profiles developed from the sources investigated can be used to assist source apportionment studies for accurate quantification of the causes of air pollution and hence assist governmental bodies in formulating relevant countermeasures. © 2021 The Author(s)","Chemical composition; Megacity Delhi; PM2.5 emission; Receptor modelling; Source marker; Source profiles","Agricultural wastes; Air pollution; Barium compounds; Chemical analysis; Crops; Lead compounds; Manganese removal (water treatment); Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Roadsides; Silicon; Strontium compounds; Waste incineration; Accurate quantifications; Atmospheric concentration; Carbonaceous materials; Chemical profiles; Crop residue burning; Fine particulate matter; Source apportionment; Water-soluble ions; Municipal solid waste; aluminum; ammonia; arsenic; barium; bromine; calcium; chlorine; chromium; cobalt; copper; fluorine; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; nickel; nitrate; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; phosphate; phosphorus; rubidium; silicon; sodium ion; strontium; sulfate; sulfur; titanium; vanadium; zinc; aerosol; concentration (composition); dust; particulate matter; pollutant source; source apportionment; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; autumn; biomass; city; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; crop; data base; exhaust gas; India; measurement accuracy; mineral dust; municipal solid waste; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; plant residue; solid waste; summer; winter; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; season; Delhi; India; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; India; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101142262

Examples of such activities include mining, impoundment of water, stimulation of geothermal fields, extraction of hydrocarbons and water, and the injection of water, CO2 and methane into subsurface reservoirs1. In the absence of sufficient information to understand and control the processes that trigger earthquakes, authorities have set up empirical regulatory monitoring-based frameworks with varying degrees of success2,3. Field experiments in the early 1970s at the Rangely, Colorado (USA) oil field4 suggested that seismicity might be turned on or off by cycling subsurface fluid pressure above or below a threshold. Here we report the development, testing and implementation of a multidisciplinary methodology for managing triggered seismicity using comprehensive and detailed information about the subsurface to calibrate geomechanical and earthquake source physics models. We then validate these models by comparing their predictions to subsequent observations made after calibration. We use our approach in the Val d’Agri oil field in seismically active southern Italy, demonstrating the successful management of triggered seismicity using a process-based method applied to a producing hydrocarbon field. Applying our approach elsewhere could help to manage and mitigate triggered seismicity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"earthquake trigger; fault; fluid pressure; geothermal system; human activity; reservoir impoundment; seismicity; Article; earthquake; environmental monitoring; environmental stress; forecasting; geographic and geological phenomena; seismicity; simulation; Colorado; Italy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111608261

Methods: We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of annual dengue incidence in Nepal from 2010 to 2019, and the impacts of seasonal meteorological conditions (mean maximum, minimum temperature and precipitation) and elevation on those patterns. Results: More than 25 000 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases were reported from 2010 to 2019. Epidemiological trends suggest that dengue epidemics are cyclical with major outbreaks occurring at 2- to 3-y intervals. A significant negative relationship between dengue incidence and increasing elevation (metres above sea level) driven by temperature was observed (p<0.05) with dengue risk being greatest below 500 m. Risk was moderate between 500 and 1500 m and decreased substantially above 1500 m. Over the last decade, increased nightly temperatures during the monsoon months correlated with increased transmission (p<0.05). No other significant relationship was observed between annual dengue cases or incidence and climatological factors. Conclusions: The spatial analysis and interpretation of dengue incidence over the last decade in Nepal confirms that dengue is now a well-established public health threat of increasing importance, particularly in low elevation zones and urbanised areas with a tropical or subtropical climate. Seasonal variations in temperature during the monsoon months are associated with increased transmission. © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

It is used to obtain scenario predictions of the change in the climatic values of plant water availability (the index of water availability averaged over the climatic period of ~30 years), as well as the changes in the variability in the annual values of the water availability of vegetation upon a possible climate change in the 21st century, for several large river basins of the world that are characterized by different natural conditions. In this respect, the ratio of actual to potential annual transpiration serves as an indicator of the water availability in the territory. The objects of geographical study include 11 river basins; they are explored within the framework of the ISI-MIP international project and are located on different continents and in different environments: the Rhine, Tagus, Ganges, Lena, Upper Yellow, Upper Yangtze, Niger, Mackenzie, Upper Mississippi, Upper Amazon, and Darling. The meteorological characteristics obtained with the use of five atmosphere-ocean general circulation models for four RCP scenarios of climate change are used as forcing data in calculations with the SWAP model. It is shown that only five of the 11 selected river basins are characterized by a lack of moisture: the basins of the Tagus, Ganges, Niger, Upper Mississippi, and Darling. The basin territories of the other rivers have a humid or semihumid character of moistening that will persist, even with climate change, until the end of the 21st century. For the five indicated basins, the change in their water availability due to possible climate change is analyzed in more detail. The changes in both the average (climatic) value of their annual water availability and the degree of water availability variation for certain years are studied based on the construction of an integral function of the water availability distribution for the climatic periods considered in this work (a historical period and prognostic periods). It is shown for the studied arid and semiarid basins that a small degree of their water availability either will stay at the present level or will decrease even more by the end of the 21st century. Thus, the tendency of possible climate changes in the 21st century in arid and semiarid regions will further aggravate a serious problem of food security, which involves the agricultural industry and the related water industry. This problem will require an accelerated transition of the interaction of humans with Nature to the principles of green farming, which is based on nature-based technologies for the use of natural resources that rationalize the consumption of water, soil, energy, and other resources of our planet. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","arid territories; evapotranspiration; hydrological and climate modeling; RCP climate change scenarios; river basin; water availability for vegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112436803

This study investigated the potential of biochar, prepared by pyrolysis of locally generated waste peanut shells, to improve workability, hydration, early age strength and shrinkage of cement mortar and cement-fly ash mortar. Experimental observations suggest that addition of biochar slightly reduced workability, reflected in the increase in yield stress and reduction in flow. The biochar used in this study enhanced the degree of hydration by 13–23% and accelerated rate of final setting by 1–1.5 h depending on mix composition. The presence of contaminants including salt and phosphorus in the biochar influences hydration kinetics and setting of cement pastes. The fine particle size of the biochar improved the compactness of cementitious matrix which contributed to increase in early age strength (up to 7 days) of normal and fly ash mortar by 18% and 22%, respectively. The results show that biochar addition can accelerate strength development in fly ash-cement, which is promising for the development of high early-strength concrete with reduced cement demand.

Respiration from plant cells and microorganisms enables CO2 to be produced during ensiling, a method of moist forage preservation applied worldwide. However, limited information is available regarding CO2 emissions and mitigation during ensiling. Pyroligneous acid, a by-product of plant biomass pyrolysis, has a strong antibacterial capacity. To investigate CO2 production and the influence of pyroligneous acid, fresh stylo, and rice straw were ensiled with or without 1% or 2% pyroligneous acid. Dynamics of the fermentation characteristics, CO2 production, and bacterial communities during ensiling were analyzed. Pyroligneous acid increased the lactic acid content and decreased the weight losses, pH, ammonia-N content, butyric acid content, and coliform bacterial numbers (all P &lt; 0.05). It also increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and decreased the relative abundances of harmful bacteria such as Enterobacter and Lachnoclostridium. Adding pyrolytic acids reduced the gas production, especially of CO2. It also increased the relative abundances of CO2-producing bacterial genera and of genera with the potential for CO2 fixation. In conclusion, adding pyroligneous acid improved the fermentation quality of the two silages. During ensiling, CO2 production was correlated with bacterial community alterations. Using pyroligneous acid altered the bacterial community to reduce CO2 production during ensiling. Given the large production and demand for silage worldwide, application of pyroligneous acid may be an effective method of mitigating global warming via CO2 emissions. © Copyright © 2021 Guo, Zheng, Zou, Chen and Zhang.","bacterial community; fermentation quality; greenhouse gas; rice straw; stylo",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111026115

The biodegradation of coal slimes and its influence on the utilization characteristics were analyzed using biogas production simulations, drying dehydration and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results showed that the organic matter in various coal slimes could be converted to biomethane. In addition, the main methanogenic pathway was the reduction of CO2. Moreover, lower the metamorphic degree of coal slimes and higher the ash content, more conducive were they to the dehydration of coal slimes. After biodegradation, the temperatures of four coal slimes during the stages of release of moisture, volatile combustion, residual coke combustion and burnout advanced to varying degrees. Moreover, the combustion performance improved.

Herein, we report the production of pure acetate (aside from H2) from a CO2RR with a novel polymeric Cu-ligand (pyridinic N and carbonyl group) complex (p-CuL) core-shell microsphere synthesized by a facile thermal-polymerization of urea and a Cu-urea complex. The highly selective reduction of CO2to acetate, without any detectable gas products besides H2, is enabled by the unique co-coordination of pyridinic N and C=O with copper whose chemical state is between +1 and +2 and the porous 3D core that is kinetically favorable for the acetate product. The maximal faradaic efficiency of acetate of ∼64% is attained at −0.37 Vvs.RHE in a 0.5 M KHCO3electrolyte, and H2evolution is much suppressed. In the process of the CO2RR to acetate, the Cu(ii)-carbonyl coordination remains while Cuδ+-ligand active sites are reduced to Cu(i). In addition, the highly selective acetate production is favored by the p-CuL core-shell microsphere for the adsorption of some important intermediates of CO2reduction and their dimerization and further e−/h+reduction, as seen from the distinctly increased C=O and -OH groups in the O K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) of p-CuL after the CO2RR. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Catalyst selectivity; Ligands; Metabolism; Microspheres; Selective catalytic reduction; Shells (structures); Urea; Volatile fatty acids; X ray absorption; Carbonyl coordination; Carbonyl groups; Copper-based catalysts; Core-shell microspheres; Electrocatalytic; Faradaic efficiencies; Selective reduction; Thermal polymerizations; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111302523

However, the type of vegetation (native or exotic) in a given area can directly influence the ability of UGAs to provide these services. Arid zones are characterized by water scarcity, so making efficient use of water in UGAs is relevant, especially in a climate change scenario. In order to understand the influence of xerophilous native and exotic vegetation on the hydrological and carbon cycles of UGAs in arid zones, we used two approaches: field observations in UGAs and greenhouse experimentation to simulate drought in mesocosms with the native and exotic vegetation of arid zones. We determine plant water use to maintain the aesthetical appearance (amount of irrigation, evapotranspiration rate, and water efficiency), for climate regulation influence, measure the carbon released to the atmosphere (soil respiration: RS), and the soil carbon storage as an indicator of support service. The results show that in arid zones, the UGAs with xerophilous native vegetation use water more efficiently and their soil carbon release is lower, even in periods of drought, mainly due to their adaptation to climate conditions. The results of this study can be used by decision-makers who should encourage the use of native species in the UGAs in arid zones since they offer more environmental services than exotic species do. © 2021","Carbon storage; Soil respiration; Urban green areas; Water use efficiency","arid environment; climate change; climate conditions; decision making; ecosystem service; greenspace; urban ecosystem; vegetation type; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104363892

Objective: To confirm these improved asthma outcomes during COVID-19 and evaluate potential contributing factors. Methods: In 18,912 pediatric patients with asthma treated in the Children's Hospital of Orange County network from 2017 to 2020, monthly asthma-related encounters and medication summaries were extracted from electronic health records, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) air pollution from the California Air Resources Board, and influenza-like illness from Illness Surveillance Network for the first 6 months of each year. Changes in outcomes between January to March and April to June (post–COVID-19 shutdown in 2020) were compared with historical data using generalized estimating equations analyses for patient outcomes and generalized linear models for pollution exceedance, influenza-positive, and telehealth visit rates. Results: During COVID-19, we found 78%, 90%, 68% reductions in hospitalization, emergency department visits, and exacerbations, respectively, compared with pre–COVID-19 2020, with significantly greater changes than the same time period of 2017 to 2019 and significant reductions in albuterol and inhaled corticosteroid use (P &lt;.05). Emergency department visit reduction was not seen for African Americans. The PM2.5 and influenza rates were also significantly reduced during COVID-19 (P &lt;.05). Increased rates in telehealth visits were greater in the publicly insured group when compared with commercially insured. Conclusion: Our data confirm reduced health care utilization and suggest better asthma control during COVID-19, except for African Americans.

This study focuses on this concept and proposes a novel approach for modelling and experimentally validating the distribution of suitable habitats for the recruitment of invasive plants under the current and future climate. The biological invasion of the Peruvian peppertree (Schinus molle) in Mexico is used as practical example. The values of eight bioclimatic variables associated to sites in which young, naturally established seedlings and saplings were detected were used to model the current distribution of recruitment habitats. A machine-learning algorithm of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) was used to calibrate the model and its output indicated the distribution of occurrence probabilities of young peppertrees in Mexico under the current climate. This model was projected on climate change scenarios predicted for the middle of this century, which indicated that the cover of suitable recruitment habitats for this invasive species will shrink. To validate these predictions, field experiments were performed at three sites where the model predicted reduced occurrence probabilities of young peppertrees. In these experiments, emergence and survival rates of peppertree seedlings were assessed under the current climate and under simulated climate change conditions.

Since 2018, over 75% of local authorities have declared climate emergencies committing to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents the findings of a review of official public records published by 308 local authorities, City Regions and Combined Authorities declaring climate emergencies. Significant variability and ambiguity were found in their scope of commitment, delivery planning arrangements and funding plans. Few local authorities have embraced the concept of Citizens’ Climate Assemblies as a way of engaging civil society. A follow-up review showed that although there is near uniformity of political desire to tackle climate change, action planning is very much work in progress with tight delivery timelines for the majority, significant divergence in approaches, and an unclear role for the citizen. The research concludes that without a local-authority specific Net Zero duty and well-designed and financed delivery models, local authorities will choose their own routes and finishing lines shaped by a complex ecosystem of internal and external factors. A governance framework is proposed based on the concept of local area climate contracts to bring together national and local Net Zero ambitions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","citizen engagement; Climate emergency; local government","Carbon; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Central government; Citizen engagements; Climate agreement; Climate emergency; Global temperatures; Greenhouse gas emissions; Local authorities; Local government; United kingdom; Zero carbons; Gas emissions; action plan; carbon emission; civil society; climate change; conceptual framework; emission control; governance approach; international agreement; local government; local participation; planning process; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104609552

However, due to the complexity of the oxidation states on catalyst surfaces, the active sites of Cu-based catalysts for CO2RR are still unclear. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the active sites for CO2RR reduction into CH3OH on Cu (111) and CuO (111) surface. The most favored adsorption sites and reaction energetics involved in CO2 activation and sequent CO hydrogenation steps for CH3OH formation were determined. It has been found that, for CO2 reduction, the CO2→COOH*→CO* pathway prefers to occur on both Cu (111) and CuO (111) surfaces. More importantly, the analysis reveals that, compared with Cu (111) and clean CuO (111), sequent CO hydrogenation into CH3OH is promoted by the H pre-covered CuO (111), on which the surface H is set on Cu site (HCu). That is, in CO2RR, the catalytic active sites for CH3OH production are the H-covered Cu sites on CuO (111) surface. These new insights on the catalytic active sites for CH3OH production on Cu-based catalyst would potentially guide the design of efficient CO2RR catalysts. © 2021","CO2 reduction; Cu (111); CuO (111); Density functional theory; Methanol","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Copper oxides; Design for testability; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Active site; Catalytic active sites; CO$-2$/ reduction; Cu (111); Cu(1 1 1); Cu-based catalyst; CuO (111); Density-functional-theory; OH production; ]+ catalyst; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111024904

This requires conventional diesel combustion to be compliant using costly and sophisticated aftertreatment systems. Preferably, diesel–methanol dual-fuel is one of the suitable alternative combustion modes as it can potentially reduce the formation of nitrogen oxide and soot emissions which characterised the diesel mixing-controlled combustion. This is primarily due to the high latent heat of vaporisation and oxygen content of the methanol fuel. At high engine loads, however, the potential of diesel–methanol dual-fuel operation is constrained by the excessive combustion pressure rise rate and peak in-cylinder pressure, which limits both the engine efficiency and the percentage of methanol that can be used. For the first time, experimental studies were conducted to explore advanced combustion control strategies such as Miller cycle, exhaust gas recirculation, and intake air cooling for improving upon high load diesel–methanol dual-fuel combustion. Experiments were carried out at 1200 r/min and 18 bar indicated mean effective pressure on a single-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine, which equipped with a high pressure common rail diesel injection, a methanol port fuel injection, and a variable valve actuation system on the intake camshaft. Results showed that the methanol energy fraction of a conventional diesel–methanol dual-fuel operation with a baseline intake valve closing timing was limited to 28%. This was due to the high combustion temperature at a high load which advanced the ignition timing of the premixed charge, resulting in high levels of pressure rise rate. The application of lower effective compression ratio and intake air temperature (Tint) effectively decreased the compression temperature, which successfully delayed the ignition timing of the premixed charge. This allowed for a more advanced diesel injection timing to achieve improvement in the thermal efficiency and potentially enabled a higher methanol substitution ratio. Although the introduction of exhaust gas recirculation demonstrated very slight impact on the ignition timing of the premixed charge, a higher net indicated efficiency was observed due to a relatively lower local combustion temperature which reduced heat transfer loss. Moreover, the optimised diesel–methanol dual-fuel operation allowed a higher methanol energy fraction of 40% to be used at an effective compression ratio of 14.3 and Tint of 305 K and achieved the highest net indicated efficiency of 47.4%, improving by 3.7% and 2.6%, respectively, when compared to the optimised conventional diesel combustion (45.7%) and conventional diesel–methanol dual-fuel (46.2%). This improvement was accompanied with a reduction of 37% in nitrogen oxide emissions and little impact on soot emissions in comparison with the conventional diesel combustion. © IMechE 2020.","dual-fuel; exhaust gas recirculation; Heavy-duty diesel engine; intake air cooling; methanol; Miller cycle","Air intakes; Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Energy efficiency; Engine cylinders; Gases; Heat transfer; Ignition; Intake valves; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Combustion control strategies; Formation of nitrogen oxides; High pressure common rail; Indicated mean effective pressure; Mixing controlled combustions; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Peak in-cylinder pressures; Variable valve actuation; Exhaust gas recirculation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086332185

A recent emphasis on routes of ENM uptake has established key physicochemical properties which direct certain mechanisms, yet relatively few studies have identified their effect on intracellular trafficking processes past entry and initial subcellular localization. Here, we developed and applied an approach where single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) play a dual role - that of an ENM undergoing intracellular processing, in addition to functioning as the signal transduction element reporting these events in individual cells with single organelle resolution. We used the exceptional optical properties exhibited by noncovalent hybrids of single-stranded DNA and SWCNTs (DNA-SWCNTs) to report the progression of intracellular processing events via two orthogonal hyperspectral imaging approaches of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and resonance Raman scattering. A positive correlation between fluorescence and G-band intensities was uncovered within single cells, while exciton energy transfer and eventual aggregation of DNA-SWCNTs were observed to scale with increasing time after internalization. An analysis pipeline was developed to colocalize and deconvolute the fluorescence and Raman spectra of subcellular regions of interest (ROIs), allowing for single-chirality component spectra to be obtained with submicron spatial resolution. This approach uncovered correlations between DNA-SWCNT concentration, dielectric modulation, and irreversible aggregation within single intracellular vesicles. An immunofluorescence assay was designed to directly observe the DNA-SWCNTs in labeled endosomal vesicles, revealing a distinct relationship between the physical state of organelle-bound DNA-SWCNTs and the dynamic luminal conditions during endosomal maturation processes. Finally, we trained a machine learning algorithm to predict endosome type using the Raman spectra of the vesicle-bound DNA-SWCNTs, enabling major components in the endocytic pathway to be simultaneously visualized using a single intracellular reporter. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","confocal Raman microscopy; endosomal maturation; hyperspectral imaging; immunofluorescence colocalization; intracellular trafficking; machine learning; near-infrared fluorescence","Cell proliferation; DNA; Endothelial cells; Energy transfer; Fluorescence; Hyperspectral imaging; Infrared devices; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optical properties; Physicochemical properties; Raman scattering; Signal transduction; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Spectroscopy; Turing machines; Immunofluorescence assay; Intracellular trafficking; Irreversible aggregation; Near-infrared fluorescence; Resonance Raman scattering; Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs); Subcellular localizations; Submicron spatial resolution; Bioinformatics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110398774

Here we quantify the impacts of five divergent future land-use scenarios on aboveground forest carbon stocks and fluxes throughout New England. These scenarios, four co-designed with stakeholders from throughout the region and the fifth a continuation of recent trends in land use, were simulated by coupling a land-cover change model with a mechanistic forest growth model to produce estimates of aboveground carbon over 50 years. We tracked the fate of forest carbon removed through harvesting and development using a standard carbon accounting methodology, modified to fit our modeling framework. Of the simulated changes in land use, changes in harvesting had the most profound and immediate impacts on carbon stocks and fluxes. In one land-use scenario that included a rapid expansion of harvesting for biomass energy, New England's forests stopped serving as a net carbon sink and became a net carbon source by 2060. In an alternative scenario, relatively small reductions in harvest intensities (i.e., ~10% less biomass removed), coupled with an increased percent of wood going into longer-term storage, led to substantial reductions in net carbon emissions (909 MMtCO2eq) as compared to a continuation of recent trends in land use. However, these projected gains in carbon storage and reduction in emissions from less intense harvesting regimes can only be realized if they are paired with a reduction in the consumption of the timber products, and their replacements, that otherwise would result in additional emissions from leakage and substitution. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon accounting; Land use; LANDIS-II; PnET; Scenario planning","carbon budget; carbon fixation; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; growth modeling; land use change; New England; United States; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108290574

India also strictly implemented a countrywide lockdown, starting from 24 March to 12 May 2020. This measure resulted in the reduction of the sources of air pollution in general: industrial, commercial, and vehicular pollution in particular, with visible improvement in ambient air quality. In this study, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the ambient concentration of air pollutants over the city of Bangalore (India) is assessed using Continuous Ambient Air Quality Measurement (CAAQM) data from 10 monitoring stations spread across the city. The data was obtained from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The analysis of the relative changes in the ambient concentration of six major air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOX, PM2.5, O3, and SO2) has been carried out for two periods: March–May 2020 (COVID-19 lockdown) and the corresponding period of 2019 during when there was no lockdown. The analysis revealed significant reduction in the concentration of ambient air pollutants at both daily and monthly intervals. This can be attributed to the reduction in sources of emission; vehicular traffic, industrial, and other activities. The average reduction in the concentration of NO, NO2, NOX, PM2.5, and O3 between 01 March and 12 May 2020 was found to be 63%, 48%, 48%, 18%, and 23% respectively when compared to the same period in 2019. Similarly, the comparative analysis of pollutant concentrations between pre-lockdown (01–23 March 2020) and lockdown (24 March–12 May 2020) periods has shown a huge reduction in the ambient concentration of air pollutants, 47.3% (NO), 49% (NO2), 49% (NOX), 10% (SO2), 37.7% (PM2.5), and 15.6% (O3), resulting in improved air quality over Bangalore during the COVID-19 lockdown period. It is shown that the strict lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in the pollution levels. Such lockdowns may be useful as emergency intervention strategies to control air pollution in megacities when ambient air quality deteriorates dangerously. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollutants; COVID-19 pandemic; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate matter; Sulphur dioxide","Air quality; Disease control; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Reduction; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollution in megacities; Ambient concentrations; Central pollution control boards; Comparative analysis; Intervention strategy; Monitoring stations; Pollutant concentration; Vehicular pollutions; Air pollution control; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; epidemic; nitrogen oxides; pandemic; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; India; lockdown; pandemic; particulate matter 2.5; reduction (chemistry); air pollutant; city; communicable disease control; human; particulate matter; Bengaluru; India; Karnataka; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107522243

Bio-based construction is particularly promising since the plant's sequestered carbon offsets the building's carbon emissions. However, the required land to cultivate suitable biomass and the feasibility of environmentally sustainable materials for resilient cities should be understood. This study analyzes timber, straw, hemp and cork construction and renovation in Europe. A prediction-based model, tuned-up on four systems (built environment, natural environment, carbon balance, industrial processing), converts construction activities until 2050 into required material, embodied land and carbon storage. A novel material-land nexus concept analyzes the required land for bio-based construction. Land transformation is not analyzed. The aim is to evaluate the biomass supply considering the current cross-sectoral use of land in Europe. The results indicate that current forests and wheat plantations are more than sufficient for supplying construction materials. Straw seems better than timber, in terms of resource availability and carbon storage potential. Cork is only favorable locally in southern dry countries.

The oxygen in natural water enhances the mobility of uranium by the complexing action of carbonates and bicarbonates with oxidized uranyl ions. The uranium and its decay products (i.e., radium group) can be used as good tracers for pinpointing uranium mineralization. The basement complex in the south of Cuddapah basin comprises granite, gneiss-migmatites and patches of greenstone belts. There are different generation of fractures and mafic dykes trending E–W, N–S, NW-SE and NE–SW directions. The NNE–SSW to NE–SW trending fractures are youngest and often show higher uranium values in water along the same trend indicating possible mineralization. The fractures are often intruded by younger basic intrusive rocks and quartz reefs which often show high uranium content. Several NE–SW to NNE–SSW trending fracture zones with uranium mineralization are observed in the areas around Shivaramapuram-Nutankalva, Kamaguttapalle and T. Sundupalle villages. These sympathetic fracture zones are important for further sub-surface exploration. The present focus is given on a NE-SW fracture zone along Sivaramapuram–Nutanakalva tract extends over a strike length of ~15 km with a plan width of ~1 to 1.5 km. The tract is mostly soil covered and rock outcrops are scanty. Radioactive anomalies are located at small outcrops in fractured basic dyke, fractured and altered granite, deformed quartz vein, sludge samples collected from private village drilling sites, Pincha river channel sands and soils (U3O8 values up to 0.19% (β/γ); n = 44;). Hydrogeochemical exploration along this fracture zone has indicated anomalous concentration of uranium in water samples ranging from 100 to 19,434 ppb U (n = 110). Selective borewells have been monitored for 8 months to check the seasonal variation. The data remain persistent and indicated encouraging outcome. This NE–SW fracture zone has affected the Nagari quartzite of Cuddapah Supergroup, thus indicate Post Nallamalai Mesoproterozoic Grenville orogeny, which is metallogenically favourable epoch for fracture controlled uranium mineralization. The surface anomalies vis-a-vis the hydro uranium anomalies and suitable geochemical condition along the NE-SW trending fracture make this zone a potential target for further sub-surface exploration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Andhra Pradesh; Basement granitoid; Cuddapah basin; Fracture; Uranium mineralization","Buildings; Fracture; Geochemistry; Granite; Mineralogy; Quartz; Rural areas; Geochemical conditions; Geochemical exploration; Geochemical properties; Potential targets; Seasonal variation; Surface anomalies; Uranium contents; Uranium mineralization; Uranium compounds; fracture zone; geochemistry; gneiss; granite; granitoid; migmatite; mineral exploration; mineralization; uranium; Andhra Pradesh; Cuddapah Basin; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101709024

Though it took a huge amount of human breathes as well as increases unemployment, it puts a positive impression on the environment. To stop the speedy extend of this disease, the maximum Government has imposed a strict lockdown on their citizens which creates a constructive impact on the atmosphere. Air pollutant concentration has been investigated in this study to analyze the impact of lockdown on the environment. Based on the air pollutant concentration, Air Quality Index (AQI) is deliberated. The Air Quality Index indicates the most and least polluted cities in the world. A higher value of AQI represents the higher polluted city and a lesser value of Air Quality Index represents a less polluted city. The impact of lockdown on air quality has been studied in this work and it is observed that the air pollutant concentration has reduced in every city of the world during the lockdown period. It has been also detected that the PM2.5 and PM10 are the most affecting air concentrator which controls the air quality of all the selected places during and after lockdown.

Migratory birds are thought to help plants to track climate change through long-distance seed dispersal3,4. However, seeds may be consistently dispersed towards cooler or warmer latitudes depending on whether the fruiting period of a plant species coincides with northward or southward migrations. Here we assess the potential of plant communities to keep pace with climate change through long-distance seed dispersal by migratory birds. To do so, we combine phenological and migration information with data on 949 seed-dispersal interactions between 46 bird and 81 plant species from 13 woodland communities across Europe. Most of the plant species (86%) in these communities are dispersed by birds migrating south, whereas only 35% are dispersed by birds migrating north; the latter subset is phylogenetically clustered in lineages that have fruiting periods that overlap with the spring migration. Moreover, the majority of this critical dispersal service northwards is provided by only a few Palaearctic migrant species. The potential of migratory birds to assist a small, non-random sample of plants to track climate change latitudinally is expected to strongly influence the formation of novel plant communities, and thus affect their ecosystem functions and community assembly at higher trophic levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"bird; climate change; ecosystem function; latitude; phenology; plant community; seed dispersal; trophic level; woodland; article; climate change; Europe; forest; fruiting; latitude; migrant bird; nonhuman; plant community; seed dispersal; spring; trophic level; acclimatization; animal; bird; cold; ecosystem; flying; greenhouse effect; Mediterranean Sea; physiology; plant; population migration; seed dispersal; Europe; Acclimatization; Animal Migration; Animals; Birds; Cold Temperature; Ecosystem; Europe; Flight, Animal; Global Warming; Mediterranean Sea; Plants; Seed Dispersal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108359016

In this work, we estimated the financial profitability (Soil Expectation Value, SEV) of a set of radiata pine plantations in the northwest of Spain under climate change. We optimized silvicultural interventions using a differentiable approach and projected future productivity using a machine learning model basing on the climatic predictions of 11 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The forecasted mean SEV for future climate was lower than current SEV (∼22% lower for RCP 4.5 and ∼29% for RCP 6.0, with interest rate = 3%). The dispersion of the future SEV distribution was very high, alternatively forecasting increases and decreases in profitability under climate change depending on the chosen GCM. Silvicultural optimization considering future productivity projections effectively mitigated the potential economic losses due to climate change; however, its ability to perform this mitigation was strongly dependent on interest rates. We conclude that the financial profitability of radiata pine plantations in this region might be significantly reduced under climate change, though further research is necessary for clearing the uncertainties regarding the high dispersion of profitability projections. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, the spatial distribution and sediment record of PTS in urban lake sediments in the middle Yangtze River Basin were investigated to indicate its response to anthropogenic emission and pollution reduction actions. Spatial distribution of typical PTSs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) included) showed that pollutants were concentrated in the southeast and center of the urban lake due to riverine inputs suffering from both petrochemical and municipal wastewaters. The sedimentary record of PAH concentrations indicated an increase from the 1960s to a peak level in the 2000s, which was induced mainly by increased PAH emissions, with PAH levels decreasing subsequently due to craft improvement of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Source apportionment results revealed that historical PAH emissions transferred from petrogenic sources to a mixture of energy combustion and petrochemical industry. Furthermore, OCP and PCB pollutions reached peak levels in 1980s, which is consistent with their historical usage for agricultural and industrial production. From the synthetic sediment quality index (SeQI) analysis, sediment quality in nearly half of sites was poor, while the sediment record suggested that sediment quality had turned better since 2000s maybe due to the WWTP improvement. Furthermore, significant correlations (p < 0.05) between PTS levels and the ratio of PAH emissions to the number of WWTPs documented the PTS levels in response to the surrounding anthropogenic pollution and WWTPs in urban lakes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Persistent toxic substances; Sediment quality index; Source emissions; Spatial and historical variations; Urban lake; Wastewater treatment","Agricultural robots; Lakes; Organic pollutants; Petrochemicals; Pollution control; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; River pollution; Sedimentology; Sediments; Sewage treatment plants; Spatial distribution; Wastewater treatment; Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic pollution; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent toxic substances; Petrochemical industry; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Wastewater treatment plants; Lake pollution; organochlorine pesticide; persistent toxic substance; petrochemical agent; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; toxic substance; unclassified drug; emission control; human activity; lacustrine deposit; PAH; PCB; sediment pollution; source apportionment; spatial distribution; spatial variation; toxic substance; wastewater treatment; Article; China; combustion; controlled study; ecotoxicity; environmental parameters; human activities; industrial waste; lake sediment; municipal wastewater; petrochemical industry; pollution and pollution related phenomena; positive matrix factorization; principal component analysis; river basin; sampling; sea pollution; sediment quality index; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; traffic pollution; urban area; waste water management; waste water treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101829445

During recent decades, this region has experienced severe regional haze and photochemical smog pollution problems. In this study, we used a source-oriented chemical transport model to quantitatively estimate the effects of inter-city transport on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) among the 41 cities in the YRD urban agglomeration during the EXPLORE-YRD (EXPeriment on the eLucidation of the atmospheric Oxidation capacity and aerosol foRmation, and their Effects in the Yangtze River Delta) campaign (May 17 to June 17, 2018). The results show that inter-city transport is very significant in the YRD region. On average, the emissions from the local city, the other YRD cities, and the regions outside of the YRD contribute 25.3%, 49.9%, and 24.8% to the PM2.5, respectively, and they contribute 33.7%, 46.8%, and 19.5% of the non-background O3, respectively. On PM2.5 or O3 pollution days, the transport contribution from the non-local YRD cities becomes much more important, while the local emissions and the transport from non-YRD emissions become less important. The results also suggest that the cities within a distance of 184 km and 94 km contribute 60% of the PM2.5 and O3, respectively. Therefore, we recommend that regional cooperative control programs in the YRD consider emission controls over cities within these ranges.

However, it is still controversial whether mixed-species plantations (MP) were more conducive to the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks than monoculture plantations (PP). Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis based on 21 publications to assess the effects of different afforestation modes as well as controlling factors of SOC stocks on the Loess Plateau of China. Results: Compared with monoculture plantations, mixed-species plantations could significantly increase the response size of SOC stocks by 28%. For different species combinations, tree-shrub mixtures were more conducive to increasing the SOC stocks. In climate-limited regions (MAT <8 °C, MAP <500 mm), the response size of SOC stocks of mixed-species plantations was 34% higher than that of monoculture plantations. Furthermore, significant differences were found in the response size of SOC stocks at young (< 10 yr) and mature stages (> 20 yr). Compared with abandoned land, afforestation on cropland, especially mixed-species plantations, could increase the SOC stocks by 10%. Additionally, compared with monoculture plantations, a stronger coupling relationship was observed between the soil total nitrogen (STN) and SOC stocks in mixed-species plantations. Conclusion: Our results suggest that for the Loess Plateau of China, planting mixed-species plantations containing nitrogen-fixing plants is a more effective approach to enhancing the SOC stocks than monoculture plantations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Afforestation modes; Climate change; Meta-analysis; Soil organic carbon; Species combinations","afforestation; carbon sequestration; climate change; monocrotophos; monoculture; soil carbon; soil nutrient; China; Loess Plateau; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085901622

In addition, recent droughts reduced the amount of available water behind the hydropower dams to provide the water head needed to run the turbines in hydropower plants. A more sustainable alternative, instead of developing new infrastructure, is to enhance the daily operation of reservoirs to support hydropower generation. This study suggests a new optimal operation policy for Folsom Reservoir in California and hydropower plants, which maximizes hydropower generation and reduces flood risk. This study demonstrates the application of the cellular automata (CeA) approach to optimize the daily hydropower operation of Folsom Reservoir. The reservoir operation is a nonlinear problem, where the hydropower generation and elevation-area-storage functions are the main nonlinearity to accurately represent the daily operation of the system. Moreover, the performance of the CeA approach under two extreme climate conditions, wet and dry, was evaluated and compared to the operation during normal conditions. Results showed that the CeA approach provides more efficient solutions in comparison to the commonly used evolutionary optimization algorithms. For the size of the non-linear optimization problem designed in this study, CeA outperformed genetic algorithm for finding optimal solutions for different climate conditions. Results of CeA showed that although the annual average in-flow to the reservoir during the dry period was about 30% less than the normal condition, CeA offered about a 20% reduction in average hydropower generation. The new operation policy offered by CeA can partly compensate for the loss of the snowpack in California’s Sierra Nevada under a warming climate. The approach and its outcomes support an informed decision-making process and provide practical reservoir operational guideline to remediate the adverse effects of hydroclimatic changes in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

It is therefore useful to understand the factors that influence the relevant empirical trends so that policies can be better tailored to address the climate challenges. Given the high reliance on fossil fuels, this paper has focused on the energy consumption from international shipping, by examining 6 factors across product types and shipping routes. This is based on comprehensive microdata of almost all vessels in the world over 2014–2017. The study finds that improvements in energy intensity is consistent across product types and shipping routes, reinforcing the importance of energy efficiency as a key climate mitigation measure. However, shifts in freight transport activity across different regions have offset gains in energy efficiency and was the most dominant factor contributing to an increase in energy consumption. Monitoring of the transport structure effect is critical for progress tracking and the potential of this effect to alter energy consumption should also be factored into emission projections. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emission reduction; Energy efficiency; Index decomposition analysis; International shipping; LMDI","Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Freight transportation; Ships; Climate mitigations; Emission reduction; Energy; Energy-consumption; Index decomposition analyses (IDA); International shippings; LMDI; Microdata; Mitigation measures; Product types; Energy efficiency; decomposition analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental policy; fossil fuel; freight transport; vessel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104086264

This study moves beyond these approaches by exploring factors that influence adoption as well as those that influence the content of a policy or policy goal intensity. Through the exploration of the first “wave” of state GHG reduction targets during the early 2000s, we create an innovative policy commitment variable that standardizes state emissions targets and explores the specific factors influencing these mitigation goals. Our results suggest that internal political factors (Democratic control of the legislature), lower state carbon dioxide emissions and dependency on coal production increases the likelihood of target adoption. However, the degree of GHG reduction commitments (content) are dependent on both internal and external factors, such as neighboring states adoption, carbon dioxide emission levels, citizen ideology, environmental interest groups, natural gas production and solar energy potential. These results support the growing literature on differentiating adoption and the content of a policy when analyzing the spread of policy ideas.

Participants identified many similarities between the issues, indicating that both are harmful to public health, politically polarizing, have global impacts, and have solutions.

The simulation results were analyzed and reported in the form of Empirical Kinetics Modeling Approach (EKMA) diagrams and further confirmed through additional Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT) simulations available in CAMx. While the results are observed to be highly depending on the monitor station, they have indicated that the control of elevated point emissions is slightly more effective in ozone reduction than that of on-road emissions. Averagely, a sole reduction of 48.3% from the elevated point source, or a sole reduction of 61.0% from the on-road source, or a combined reduction of 30.0% each from the two sources are required to meet a potential future 8-h ozone NAAQS of 65 ppb.

Using the Burrell Schmidt telescope, we target the brightest emission lines of star-forming regions, Hα, Hβ, and [O iii], to detect potential outlying star-forming regions. Our survey covers ∼6 deg2 around M101, and we detect objects in emission down to an Hα flux level of 5.7 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 (equivalent to a limiting star formation rate of 1.7 10-6 M o˙ yr-1 at the distance of M101). After careful removal of background contaminants and foreground M stars, we detect 19 objects in emission in all three bands and 8 objects in emission in Hα and [O iii]. We compare the structural and photometric properties of the detected sources to Local Group dwarf galaxies and star-forming galaxies in the 11HUGS and SINGG surveys. We find no large population of outlying H ii regions or undiscovered star-forming dwarfs in the M101 Group, as most sources (93%) are consistent with being M101 outer-disk H ii regions. Only two sources were associated with other galaxies: a faint star-forming satellite of the background galaxy NGC 5486 and a faint outlying H ii region near the M101 companion NGC 5474. We also find no narrowband emission associated with recently discovered ultradiffuse galaxies and starless H i clouds near M101. The lack of any hidden population of low-luminosity star-forming dwarfs around M101 suggests a rather shallow faint-end slope (as flat as α ∼ -1.0) for the star-forming luminosity function in the M101 Group.

We present a theory of the transition from indirect to direct rule, focusing on the strategic interaction between a ruler and local potentates who provide civil order in exchange for a share of tax revenue. When the threat of rebellion from below falls and elites become less crucial intermediaries, the ruler is able to centralize power, replacing local potentates with direct agents of the state and investing in a fiscal bureaucracy for future state development. We assess the theory using subnational data from sixteenth-and seventeenth-century Mexico around the time of a dramatic demographic collapse, which undermined the threat of domestic conflict. Using a difference-in-differences approach and an instrumental variables empirical strategy based on the climate shocks associated with a virulent series of epidemics, we show that state centralization occurred faster in areas experiencing a more dramatic decline in population. © 2021 by the Southern Political Science Association.

In this Perspective, we argue that, despite the mechanistic uncertainty underlying these losses, there is confidence that a strong, positive land carbon–climate feedback can be expected. Two major lines of evidence support net global SOC losses with warming via increases in soil microbial metabolic activity: the increase in soil respiration with temperature and the accumulation of SOC in low mean annual temperature regions. Warming-induced SOC losses are likely to be of a magnitude relevant for emission negotiations and necessitate more aggressive emission reduction targets to limit climate change to 1.5 °C by 2100. We suggest that microbial community–temperature interactions, and how they are influenced by substrate availability, are promising research areas to improve the accuracy and precision of the magnitude estimates of projected SOC losses. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108405222

We include exposures to outdoor air pollutants that are monitored and regulated through air quality standards, and air pollutants that are not routinely monitored or directly regulated, including wildfires, indoor biomass and coal burning, gas and wood stove use, and volatile organic compounds. Included is a more systematic review of the recent literature on long-term air pollution and child lung function because this is an indicator of future adult respiratory health and exposure assessment tools have improved dramatically in recent years. We present “summary observations” and “knowledge gaps.” We end by discussing what is known about what can be done at the individual/household, local/regional, and national levels to overcome structural impediments, reduce air pollution exposures, and improve child lung function. We found a large literature on adverse air pollution effects on children's lung function level and growth; however, many questions remain. Important areas needing further research include whether early-life effects are fixed or reversible; and what are windows of increased susceptibility, long-term effects of repeated wildfire events, and effects of air quality interventions. © 2021 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","air pollution; biomass; Children; FEV1; FVC; gas stoves; lung function; wildfire","adult; air pollution; air quality; biomass; child; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; household; human; lung function; male; review; systematic review; wildfire; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; animal; environmental exposure; lung; particulate matter; physiology; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animals; Child; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Lung; Particulate Matter",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108593082

It assesses the viability of using REDD+ on indigenous lands in the Brazilian Amazon by examining three key aspects of REDD+—the legal, technical and market requirements—in light of recent policy developments in Brazil and under the UNFCCC. REDD+ as a market-based mechanism in the VCM currently faces significant barriers as a useful tool for forest protection in the Amazon, due to the lack of an international carbon market under the UNFCCC, the highly complex technical requirements, and the low market demand for REDD+ credits in the VCM. Moreover, we suggest that, although legally possible under Brazilian law, REDD+ projects in the VCM may not be a suitable market-based option for indigenous communities in the Amazon due to the current national and international climate policy context. © 2021 The Authors.

The building sector represents a key area for curbing the consumption trend and reducing energy-related emissions by adopting energy efficiency strategies. Building age acts as a proxy for building insulation properties and is an important parameter for energy models that facilitate decision making. The present study explores the potential of predicting residential building age at a large geographical scale from open spatial data sources in eight municipalities in the German federal state of North-Rhine Westphalia. The proposed framework combines building attributes with street and block metrics as classification features in a Random Forest model. Results show that the addition of urban fabric metrics improves the accuracy of building age prediction in specific training scenarios. Furthermore, the findings highlight the way in which the spatial disposition of training and test samples influences classification accuracy. Additionally, the paper investigates the impact of age misclassification on residential building heat demand estimation. The age classification model leads to reasonable errors in energy estimates, in various scenarios of training, which suggests that the proposed method is a promising addition to the urban energy modelling toolkit. © 2021 The Authors","Open data; Random forest; Residential building age; Residential heat demand; Spatial autocorrelation; Urban morphology","Decision making; Decision trees; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Housing; Building insulations; Classification accuracy; Classification features; Energy-efficiency strategies; Energy-related emissions; Random forest modeling; Residential building; Urban energy consumption; Energy efficiency; age structure; consumption behavior; energy planning; energy use; error analysis; heat balance; modeling; prediction; residential energy; spatial analysis; urban morphology; urbanization; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104689453

Although the changes in BC concentrations in response to emission reduction measures have been well documented, the influence of emission reductions on the light absorption properties of BC and its influence on BC-boundary-layer interactions has been less explored. In this study, we used the online coupled WRF-Chem model to examine how emission control measures during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit affect the mixing state and light absorption of BC, and the associated implications for BC-PBL interactions. We found that both the mass concentration of BC and the BC coating materials declined during the APEC week, which reduced the light absorption and light absorption enhancement (Eab) of BC. The reduced absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) during APEC was caused by both the decline in the mass concentration of BC itself (52.0ĝ€¯%), and the lensing effect of BC (48.0ĝ€¯%). The reduction in coating materials (39.4ĝ€¯%) contributed the most to the influence of the lensing effect, and the reduced light absorption capability (Eab) contributed 3.2ĝ€¯% to the total reduction in AAOD. Reduced light absorption of BC due to emission control during APEC enhanced planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) by 8.2ĝ€¯m. PM2.5 and O3 were found to have different responses to the changes in the light absorption of BC. Reduced light absorption of BC due to emission reductions decreased near-surface PM2.5 concentrations but near-surface O3 concentrations were enhanced in the North China Plain. These results suggest that current measures to control SO2, NOx, etc. would be effective in reducing the absorption enhancement of BC and in inhibiting the feedback of BC on the boundary layer. However, enhanced ground O3 might be a side effect of current emission control strategies. How to control emissions to offset this side effect of current emission control measures on O3 should be an area of further focus. © Copyright:",,"aerosol composition; black carbon; concentration (composition); particulate matter; radiative forcing; source apportionment; weather forecasting; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111734952

However, few studies have been conducted on VOC emission factors and characteristics from indoor decorating adhesives. In this study, the VOC emission factors were obtained by measurement of VOCs in 210 adhesives. The results showed that the VOC emission factors were 41.23 g/L for wall and ground solidify, 33.49 g/L for tile adhesive, 76.88 g/L for white glue, 52.36 g/L for wallcovering adhesive, 132.28 g/L for sealant glue, 49.33 g/kg for foaming adhesive, 654.23 g/L for all-purpose adhesive, 251.93 g/L for free nails adhesive, 152.01 g/L for marble glue, and 136.79 g/L for beautiful sealant. Methodology for calculating activity data of decorating adhesive consumptions was developed and a VOC emission inventory from adhesive application in indoor decoration was developed using a bottom-up estimation methodology. The VOC emissions from 2012 to 2017 in China were 235,987.76, 246,230.47, 250,981.62, 249,849.48, 227,150.33 and 212, 433.07 t, respectively. The beautiful sealant, wall and ground solidify, sealant glue and all-purpose adhesive contributed the most of the total emissions, collectively accounting for 78.14%. Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Guangdong ranked as the top five provinces for VOC emissions, together contributing 39.10% to the national total emissions. Shandong and Jiangsu reached up to 17,057.95 t/year and 15,207.92 t/year, respectively. Priority should be given to four types of adhesives with pretty high VOC contents for designing effective VOC control measures, including solvent-based all-purpose adhesive, solvent-based free nails adhesive, solvent-based sealant glue, and solvent-based beautiful sealant.

In a local context, the University of Oldenburg (Germany) suspended all in-person lectures and business trips in March 2020, affecting the energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the com-munity. This paper presents the evaluation of emissions resulting from mobility associated with the University of Oldenburg before and after the COVID-19 restrictions, including commuting and business trips. Moreover, five scenarios targeting a reduction in emissions related to mobility are proposed and analyzed. The GHG emissions were calculated using specific emissions factors for each mode of transport, distance data obtained via a survey, and official university data. Overall, the results have revealed a substantial decrease in emissions in the summer semester 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated GHG emissions reduction relative to the average emissions of the prior two semesters (pre-COVID-19) is 79% for commuting (equivalent to 1934 tCO2e), and 69% for business trips (equivalent to 888.6 tCO2e). Furthermore, the commuting emissions are 1.9 times higher than business trip emissions in summer and winter 2019, and 1.3 times higher in summer 2020. With respect to proposals for reductions, the most effective scenario for reducing GHG emissions considers a hybrid semester assuming one day a week without commuting, which is estimated to achieve a 15% emissions reduction relative to the baseline emissions. The paper thus shows the importance of commuting-related GHG emissions in a university higher education context as well as first approaches to reduce them. This study may be useful as a guidance for the University of Oldenburg in its efforts to reduce GHG emissions by providing a quantitative basis and scenarios for prioritizing and reducing mobility emissions. Beyond that, it provides comparative metrics for other institutions with similar characteristics. © 2021 by the authors.

The automobile as a socially constructed artifact is subject to social-cultural as well as technical constraints. The four main routes to decarbonization are reductions in horsepower, reductions in vehicle weight, technical efficiency improvements, and switching to zero-carbon-emission vehicles. The last two of these face technical constraints, and the first two are constrained by deeply entrenched social-cultural attitudes and practices. This paper offers an in-depth analysis of technical possibilities available to five major automakers (Ford, General Motors, Kia, BMW/Mini and Nissan) to progressively decarbonize their US light vehicle fleets by 2020 under these technical and social-cultural constraints. It utilizes fine-grained laboratory-standard vehicle test data on all these automakers’ vehicle models for 2011–2021 and in more depth for 2019 weighted by each model's sales. Using the results of regression analyses it models two possible pathways for each automaker, which meet Biden's stated objectives with the least possible offence to social-cultural sensibilities. However, there appear to be no ideal pathways that would achieve credible decarbonization trajectories without substantial changes to the social construction of the automobile. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biden energy policy; CAFE vehicle emission standards; Decarbonizing road vehicles; Social construction of the automobile",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110555669

This is the case for construction materials, which are able to sequester an enormous amount of carbon dioxide in the form of usable products, providing a long-term capacity for storage of CO2. In a recent approach, a solid carbonate, MgCO3·3H2O (nesquehonite) was discovered to have cementitious behaviour, similar to gypsum plaster, in its phase transitions in dehydration-rehydration cycles, or during direct conversion to other carbonates. This solid can be obtained by reacting, in alkaline environments, CO2 from industrial gas streams and magnesium from desalination brines. This study aims the life cycle and eco-efficiency of such material using a standardised approach. The geographical scope is the State of Qatar, where desalination and power generation are located in the same facility for heat integration, and where the current market conditions of construction material imports provide an excellent framework for a competitive case study. The results show that the production of a plasterboard-like construction material based on the hardening of magnesium carbonate trihydrate is associated with less CO2 emissions than conventional gypsum-plasterboard production. For such achievement, the production system should introduce renewable energy as the source of electricity in the manufacture of the alkali used for the CO2 absorption in the carbon capture process. Also, process optimisation towards less demand of energy resources and the substitution of plaster and plasterboard products in real-life applications are essential to improve the eco-efficiency of the product. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and utilization; Carbon dioxide; Eco-efficiency; Life-cycle assessment; Plasterboard","Carbon capture; Carbonation; Desalination; Energy resources; Gypsum; Life cycle; Manufacture; Optimization; Carbon capture and utilization; Cementitious; Dehydration-rehydration; Direct conversion; Eco-efficiency; Environmental profile; Nesquehonite; Novel construction; Plasterboard; Product and services; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104605220

Here we describe the distribution of DMS and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) across the Baffin Bay receding ice edge in early summer 2016. Overall, DMS and total DMSP (DMSPt) increased towards warmer waters of Atlantic origin concurrently with more advanced ice-melt and bloom stages. Relatively high DMS and DMSPt (medians of 6.3 and 70 nM, respectively) were observed in the surface layer (0–9 m depth), and very high values (reaching 74 and 524 nM, respectively) at the subsurface biomass maximum (15–30 m depth). Microscopic and pigment analyses indicated that subsurface DMS and DMSPt peaks were associated with Phaeocystis pouchetii, which bloomed in Atlantic-influenced waters and reached unprecedented biomass levels in Baffin Bay. In surface waters, DMS concentrations and DMS:DMSPt ratios were higher in the MIZ (medians of 12 nM and 0.15, respectively) than in fully ice-covered or ice-free conditions, potentially associated with enhanced phytoplanktonic DMSP release and bacterial DMSP cleavage (high dddP:dmdA gene ratios). Mean sea–air DMS fluxes (mmol m–2 d–1) increased from 0.3 in ice-covered waters to 10 in open waters (maximum of 26) owing to concurrent trends in near-surface DMS concentrations and physical drivers of gas exchange. Using remotely sensed sea-ice coverage and a compilation of sea–air DMS flux data, we estimated that the pan-Arctic DMS emission from the MIZ (EDMS, MIZ) was 5–13 Gg S yr–1. North of 80N, EDMS, MIZ might have increased by around 10 + 4% yr–1 between 2003 and 2014, likely exceeding open-water emissions in June and July. We conclude that EDMS, MIZ must be taken into account to evaluate plankton-climate feedbacks in the Arctic. © 2021 University of California Press.

This issue has been politicized and is now highly partisan. Because the military is the most trusted public institution in the United States, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the government agency with primary oversight of climate policy, we test whether source cues from these entities, as well as threat frames centered on either national security or the economy, influence the willingness of people to believe climate change is human-caused. Methods: We conduct a post-test controlled experiment to test the comparative effects of varying both source cue and frame. Results: We find that the U.S. Military source cue generally produced a weaker belief that climate change is human-caused, for both Democrats and Republicans, while the EPA had a more positive influence. Conclusion: The results suggest the limitations of national security framing and point to the importance of neutral, non-partisan source cues, especially in appeals directed at Republicans. © 2021 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112848880

This study examines farmers’ continuance intention of crop residue retention, using the expectation confirmation model (ECM) and survey data from 542 rice farmers in Hubei Province, P.R. The results show that farmers’ perceived usefulness, confirmation, perceived ease of use, and satisfaction significantly have direct or indirect positive impacts on their continuance intention on adopting crop residue retention. In particular, perceived ease of use contributes the most. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use act as intermediaries in the relationship between confirmation and farmers’ continuance intention to residue retention.

Currently, most of the studies are focused on the capacity of plants and other biological media to adsorb PM, whereas few works explore the functional damage due to PM on urban vegetation. The present study, considering Quercus ilex L. as target species for its wide distribution in the Mediterranean urban and natural areas, pointed out that PM accumulation, inferred from magnetic and chemical properties, has almost no effects on structural morpho-functional traits as Relative Water Content or Specific Leaf Area but can impair processes related to the first photochemical reactions suggesting shading effect on leaves. PSI functionality and thus, carbon assimilation related processes, are impaired to a lesser extent by the oxidative potential of PM. Our results showed that, although several oxidative stressors can simultaneously affect morpho-functional traits, the interdisciplinary approach tested here can be a key tool to enlarge the spatial scale of biomonitoring activities as much as possible, and highlight a functional indicator of PM injury.

Inversed emission rates of two stacks of the coal-fired power plant for CO2 showed relatively good agreement with those estimated by a bottom-up inventory—the Regional Emission inventory in ASia (REAS) v3.1—within −7% to 40% because the plume shapes were well identified due to constraint by NO2 measurements.

Subsequently, with the assistance of wireless communication, there has been a qualitative leap in platooning performance, but then some drawbacks also emerge. First of all, for the drawback of packet loss and delay, this article proposes a prediction-assisted platooning mechanism, in which each vehicle establishes its local platoon model to predict the motion of other vehicles, thereby reducing information latency. Then for the malicious data on communication, a detection algorithm based on several indicators is carried out. Finally, the advantages of the proposed platooning mechanism and detection algorithm are verified on a joint simulation platform that combines communication and traffic control. Furthermore, the verification results are more authentic and reliable due to the consideration of imperfections of realistic perception and interaction. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Signal detection; Simulation platform; Traffic control; Carbon emissions; Detection algorithm; Information latency; Joint simulation; Packet delay; Performance; Road capacity; Simulation platform; Verification results; Wireless communications; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119339484

The importance of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) associated with fine and coarse root growth also changes but remains the dominant component of overall productivity in these important blue carbon wetlands. Appropriate BNPP assessment techniques to use in various tidal wetlands are not well-defined, and could make a difference in BNPP estimation. We hypothesized that different BNPP techniques applied among tidal wetlands differ in estimation of BNPP and possibly also correlate differently with porewater nutrient concentrations. We compare 6-month and 12-month root ingrowth, serial soil coring techniques utilizing two different calculations, and a mass balance approach (TBCA, Total Belowground Carbon Allocation) among four tidal wetland types along each of two river systems transitioning from freshwater forest to marsh. Median values of BNPP were 266 to 2946 g/m2/ year among all techniques used, with lower BNPP estimation from root ingrowth cores and TBCA (266-416 g/m2/year), and higher BNPP estimation from serial coring of standing crop root biomass (using Smalley and Max-Min calculation methods) (2336-2946 g/m2/year). Root turnover (or longevity) to a soil depth of 30 cm was 2.2/year (1.3 years), 2.7/year (1.1 years), 4.5/year (0.9 years), and 1.2/year (2.6 years), respectively, for Upper Forest, Middle Forest, Lower Forest, and Marsh. Marsh had greater root biomass and BNPP, with slower root turnover (greater root longevity) versus forested wetlands. Soil porewater concentrations of NH3and reactive phosphorus stimulated BNPP in the marsh when assessed with short-deployment BNPP techniques, indicating that pulses of mineralized nutrients may stimulate BNPP to facilitate marsh replacement of forested wetlands. Overall, ingrowth techniques appeared to represent forested wetland BNPP adequately, while serial coring may be necessary to represent herbaceous plant BNPP from rhizomes as marshes replace forested wetlands.

Even though this topic has gained considerable attention from the international scientific community, most studies do not focus on LSP in emerging economies. Therefore, this exploratory study collected data from the largest LSP companies in Brazil using a semi-structured questionnaire. The software NVivo10 was used to conduct a content analysis with coding data from the questionnaires, as well as to search for patterns in the respondents’ answers. The findings point out that the surveyed companies have carried out several initiatives, such as energy efficiency, costumer recognition and CO2 emissions reduction. In addition, most of sustainable initiatives are intra-organizational, when compared to inter-organizational ones. The majority of surveyed LSPs had plans to implement sustainable programs involving more intra-organizational actions. However, actions towards customer collaboration were rarely mentioned. The main difficulties related to the implementation of sustainable initiatives are: high cost, compliance with legislation when required, difficulty in involving customers in sustainable projects and management of outlying branches due to extensive territory. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental initiatives; Green initiatives; Green logistics; Sustainable development; Third-party logistics","Developing countries; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Logistics; Surveys; Emerging economies; Environmental initiatives; Environmental sustainability; Green initiative; Green logistics; Logistics service provider; Organisational; Scientific community; Sustainable project; Third-party logistics; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105333561

These are believed to be key enablers for reducing buildings’ carbon footprint by allowing for a wider diffusion of on-site renewable energy generation and by maximizing renewable energy self-consumption. In this study, the benefits of the energy community are assessed through simulations of average Italian buildings of various sizes, different energy efficiency levels, equipped with a photovoltaic system and a heat pump-driven heating system, and located in heating-dominated climates. The work focuses on energy communities both at the apartment scale—i.e., in a multi-family building—and at the building scale—i.e., in a neighborhood. The net energy consumption, the self-consumption, and the self-sufficiency of all the possible energy communities obtainable by combining the different buildings are compared to the baseline case that is represented by the absence of energy sharing between independent building units. The energy community alone at both the building-scale and the neighborhood-scale increases self-consumption by up to 5% and reduces net energy consumption by up to 10%. However, when the energy community is combined with other maximization strategies such as demand-side management and rule-based control, self-consumption can be raised by 15%. These results quantify the lower bound of the achievable self-consumption in energy communities, which, in the rush towards climate neutrality, and in light of these results, could be considered among the solutions for rationalizing the energy consumption of buildings. © 2021 by the authors.","Energy community; Heat pump; PV; Self-consumption","Buildings; Carbon footprint; Demand side management; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Energy sharings; European union; Heating system; Net energy consumption; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Rule-based control; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111139969

However, we report improvements in chlorophyll a in surface waters and dissolved oxygen in bottom waters at one of three estuarine stations in the Choptank tributary of Chesapeake Bay. We updated a previous nutrient budget for the estuary constructed for reference year 1998 using rates of atmospheric deposition, inputs of watershed diffuse sources (primarily agriculture), and discharges of point sources (primarily human waste) for reference year 2017. Parallel trends suggest that improvements in water quality at the one station were likely due to 20% reductions in direct atmospheric deposition on the estuary’s surface and 78–95% reductions in wastewater N and P due to installation of tertiary treatment. The agricultural sector, the dominant source of N and P, appeared to provide little contribution to improved water quality during this period. Although efforts to reduce nutrient losses from agriculture are common throughout the Choptank basin, widespread reductions from agricultural diffuse sources could make large contributions to improved water quality at all stations in the estuary. The response in the Choptank is similar to those observed elsewhere in the USA, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand due to improved wastewater treatment. Similar to our findings, the upper Potomac River of Chesapeake Bay saw improvements driven by reductions in atmospheric deposition. Unfortunately, few studies elsewhere have shown improvements in water quality due to agricultural management. The data presented here indicate that public and industrial investments in reductions of atmospheric emissions and upgrades to wastewater treatment plants have improved estuarine water quality in the Choptank. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Atmospheric deposition; Chesapeake Bay; Choptank; Wastewater treatment; Water quality","anthropogenic source; atmospheric deposition; bottom water; chlorophyll a; diffusion; dissolved oxygen; installation; nutrient enrichment; surface water; wastewater treatment; water quality; watershed; Australia; Chesapeake Bay; Choptank Estuary; Europe; Maryland; New Zealand; Potomac River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099410568

Therefore, implementing accurate and comprehensive feasibility studies in countries with a high level of consumption of traditional energy resources is vital; an approach encouraged and supported by green funds and climate change action. It is also crucial to helping spur economic and sustainable growth of these countries. In this regard, this study aims at accurate evaluation of onshore wind energy potential in seven coastal cities in the south of Iran. Six Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) were examined over representative stations. It was deduced that theWeibull function, which is the most used PDF in similar studies, was only applicable to one station. Here, Gamma distribution offered the best fit for three stations and for the other ones, Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) performed better. Considering the ranking of six examined PDFs and the simplicity of Gamma, it was identified as the effective function in the southern coasts of Iran bearing in mind the geographic distribution of stations. Moreover, six wind energy converter power curve functions contributed to investigating the capacity factor. It is found that, using only one function could cause under- or over-estimation. Then, stations were classified based on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory system. Last but not least, examining a range of wind energy converters enabled scholars to extend this study into practice and prioritize the development of stations considering budget limits. © 2021 by the authors.

Differently from metal nanoparticle electrocatalysts, the use of organometallic molecular complexes affords more efficient metal utilization, limits poisoning phenomena and allows the tuning of selectivity by varying the electronic and coordination properties of the metal center. Herein the organometallic complex (fac-Mn(apbpy)(CO)3Br) (apbpy = 4-(4-aminophenyl)-2,2′-bipyridine) was covalently anchored on a gas diffusion layer which was further employed as cathode in an aqueous gas–liquid interface complete electrolysis flow cell microreactor. The decorated gas diffusion layer electrode was able to convert CO2 into CO and HCOOH with faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 76% and 10% with a CO-productivity close to 70 Nl min−1 gMn−1 reaching CO2RR turnover numbers up to 1.6·105.

This work addresses the possibility of realization ofing such green buildings under the climatic conditions of the Saharan cities of Algeria by highlighting the need for gray water irrigation in order to overcome the water problem in these arid regions. A collection of different native and non-native plants that can be planted in hot arid climate by carrying out bibliographic research on their applications in other regions and climates is presented. Carpobrotus acinaciformis is the most recommended, among the succulent species plants, for its great success in the study area. Regarding herbaceous plants, the basil, rosemaryand canna are best adapted to the harsh climatic conditions. A chemical analysis of grey-water was conducted to examine the feasibility of reusing generated water from domestic activities. The results show that slaked lime can be added to purify water, and filtration on sand is recommended. Furthermore, simulations were carried out using TRNSYS to analyze the cooling effect of green roofs and facades compared to conventional roofs.

The experiments were carried out with a flow reactor of original design at a pressure of 25 MPa, temperature gradient along the vertical axis (from top to bottom: 390–600°C), and variation in the flow rate of the sludge-lignin (with the addition of NaOH, 1.6 wt %), oxygen, and methane. The experiments yielded data on the content of phenols in the water and the composition of the gaseous products collected at the outlet of the reactor versus the oxygen excess ratio. From these data, as well as the time dependences of the reactor wall temperature and the power of the ohmic heaters, it follows that using distributed supply of methane to compensate for the energy for heating of the reagents is preferable as compared with local inlet of methane to the upper part of the reactor. It has been shown that the addition of methane makes it possible to reduce the oxygen excess required for complete oxidation of the organic components of sludge-lignin. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Lignin; Methane; Oxygen; Paper and pulp mills; Papermaking machinery; Pulp; Pulp manufacture; Sludge disposal; Sodium hydroxide; Toxic materials; Complete oxidation; Empirical formulas; Gaseous products; Organic components; Original design; Pulp and paper mill; Supercritical water; Time dependence; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115199868

It is thus extremely important to assess how well its projections are aligned with sustainable development goals as well as closely tracking observed, historical values. In this work we analyzed thirteen sets of World Energy Outlook projections from the last 25 years. Different scenarios were considered for the following regions and countries: world, OECD, OECD Europe, OECD North America, China, India, Russia, and Africa. The maximum variation between the projections for 2030 CO2 emissions from the energy sector, made between 2006 and 2018 for OECD, Europe and North America were found to be comparable with the gap between the Paris Agreement goals and the voluntary (unconditional) nationally determined contributions to remain below a 2◦C global temperature increase. For the same period, projections for the percentage of renewable electricity exhibited maximum variations between 51% and 96%, signaling a huge underestimation. We discuss the significance of overestimating energy demand and underestimating the rate of renewable energy implementation in the context of 2030 climate and energy policy targets, as well as desirablemethodological changes to energy modeling under aggressive climate mitigation policies. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this study, therefore, is to account for economic complexity index (ECI), Brexit and other crisis episodes in the growth-energy-emissions nexus. Theoretically, the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model is assessed by adopting a One-step System Generalized Method of Moment (Sys GMM) on data for 26 EU member states over the period from 1995 to 2018. For the first time, an EU-macro regional analysis is conducted with and without the UK. Empirical results reveal that an increase in tourism, real GDP per capita, and energy use across the four EU macro regions leads to increase in carbon emission. In some regions, it was observed that tourism, ECI, Brexit, and the Greece bailout have no significant impact on carbon emission. This suggests that the increase in international travel, complexity of the economy, and financial crisis do not accelerate environmental crisis in such regions. However, where such factors are statistically significant, Brexit and the Greece bailout crisis both heighten emissions. Particularly, when the UK is excluded, Brexit and the Greece bailout crisis increase and reduce emissions, respectively. The EKC hypothesis, however, holds in either scenario. Based on these empirical findings, vital policy directions are suggested for a post-Brexit EU-UK energy and environmental relations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Brexit; Carbon-reduction; CO2 emissions; Economic complexity index; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Environmental sustainability; Greece Bailout crisis","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Industrial economics; Method of moments; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Brexit; Carbon reduction; CO$-2$/ emission; Economic complexity index; Economic growths; Energy-consumption; Environmental sustainability; European union; Greece bailout crisis; Tourism industry; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105286980

Water use in paddy fields accounts for about 70% of agricultural water worldwide. 9%-19% of CH4 in the atmosphere comes from rice season around global. As the largest rice producer, China's rice planting area and production account for more than 23% and 30% of the world total respectively. Reducing irrigation water and methane emissions from paddy fields can effectively alleviate pressure on water shortage and climate change. Therefore, the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation regime is currently used in rice cultivation. It has been widely promoted in major rice-producing countries in Asia. Compared with continuous flooding (CF), AWD saves water by alternate flood and drainage in different rice growth stages. However, the current research experiment only has conducted at several specific sites and them show that AWD can mitigate CH4 emissions while reducing water consumption in paddy fields. More importantly, there is no significant change in rice yield under moderate AWD. Our study intends to quantify the reduction potential of irrigation water and CH4 at the regional level by coupling model. DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer), DNDC (Denitrification Decomposition) and AEZ (Agro-ecological Zone) are widely used agricultural models at different research scales. The corresponding parameters transferring between them can reduce the uncertainty of the simulation process. The inputs of model included rice observation, climate data and soil information. After integrating the basic data, we calibrated rice genetic parameters by DSSAT and simulated rice yield, irrigation water and CH4 emissions by DNDC at 24 agro-meteorological observation sites in China. Based on the AEZ ecological zone division, the site scale results are upscaled to the spatial scale under AWD and CF irrigation scenarios. Due to differences in environmental conditions, we divided the study region into two parts, the northeast and south. The simulation results show that compared with CF, the water-saving ratio in the northeast rice area is 23%-34%, and that in the southern rice area is 18%-50% The emission reduction ratio of CH4 in Northeast is 60% -71%, and it in South is 34% -65%. In general, the CH4 emission mitigation effect in the northeast rice area and the water-saving effect in the southern rice area are better. It is mainly caused by the different texture of the paddy soil. At the same time, the simulation results of rice yield are consistent with the experimental results, without significant changes. This study can provide references for water-saving rice cultivation in China. © 2021 IEEE.","agricultural model coupling; methane emissions; paddy rice; water-saving irrigation","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Climate models; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Emission control; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Methane; Textures; Water resources; Water supply; Wetting; Agro-ecological zones; Agrotechnology transfer; Emission mitigation; Emission reduction; Environmental conditions; Genetic parameters; Meteorological observation; Reduction potential; Water conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115739242

Wettability mechanisms demonstrate that superhydrophilicity of the as-prepared carbon is mainly attributed to pyridinic N-oxide from the thermolysis of the NTf2 anion, whereas superoleophilicity of the carbon is provided by the elements C and F. Furthermore, superamphiphilic carbon can greatly eliminate the diffusion resistance thereby enhancing the reaction efficiencies in liquid-liquid systems by rapid enrichment of reactants around catalysts and increasing phase interfacial areas. This work provides a general route to construct superamphiphilic carbon that can greatly enhance the reaction efficiencies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","biomass; ionic liquid; liquid-liquid catalysis; Pickering emulsion; SDG11: Sustainable cities and communities; superamphiphilic carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105007345

However, the impacts of coastal seascape pattern change, on the provision of ecosystem goods and services (e.g. carbon flows) have not been understood fully in the face of rapid human-induced changes. Objectives: We aim to reveal the dynamics of integrated landscape and seascape (land-sea-scape) carbon flows under the natural and anthropogenic changes, inform coastal spatial planning and restoration, and optimize coastal land-sea-scape pattern. Methods: A spatial carbon flow network model of land-sea integration was developed to quantify coastal carbon flows under rapid urbanization. We chose a typical coastal city of Xiamen in China as an example to analyze the dynamics of carbon flows and ecological security pattern during 2000–2015. Results: We found that the total carbon flows between sea and land was 12.78TgCO2 during 2000–2015, and carbon losses due to seascape conversion were 9.76TgCO2. These flows and losses signified the reduction of ecosystem services (carbon sequestration) resilience to further perturbations. Carbon deficit pattern was gradually increased and sprawled out to the forest-farmland landscape and coastal tidal flat seascape, which represent decline of coastal ecosystem security. Conclusions: Our findings indicated total coastal carbon flows were 4 times greater than terrestrial carbon flows, and carbon deficit was mainly distributed along the coastline in Xiamen. These can provide a reference for better governance of sustainable land-sea-scape pattern to enhance seascape ecology and coastal sustainability. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon footprint; Coastal land-sea-scape pattern; Flows; Network; Sustainability","anthropogenic effect; carbon sequestration; coastal zone; global change; landscape ecology; restoration ecology; spatial planning; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Fujian; Xiamen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095444256

Energy poverty limits their ability to take autonomous actions to improve air circulation and the cooling of their homes. It is therefore important that electricity-access planners explicitly evaluate the current and future air circulation and cooling needs of energy-poor households, in addition to other basic energy needs. To address this issue, we combine climate, socio-economic, demographic and satellite data with scenario analysis to model spatially explicit estimates of potential cooling demand from households that currently lack access to electricity. We link these demand factors into a bottom-up electrification model for sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the world's highest concentration of energy poverty. Accounting for cooling needs on top of baseline household demand implies that the average electrification investment requirements grow robustly (a scenario mean of 65.5% more than when considering baseline household demand only), mostly due to the larger generation capacity needed. Future climate change could increase the investment requirements by an additional scenario mean of 4%. Moreover, the share of decentralised systems as the lowest-cost electrification option falls by a scenario mean 4.5 percentage points of all new connections. The crucial determinants for efficient investment pathways are the adoption and use of cooling appliances, the extent of climate change, and the baseline electricity demand. Our results call for a more explicit consideration of climate-adaptative energy needs by infrastructure planners in developing countries. © 2021","Air circulation and cooling; Climate change adaptation; Energy access; Energy poverty","Air; Climate models; Developing countries; Economics; Electric utilities; Investments; Planning; 'current; Air circulation; Air cooling; Autonomous action; Climate change adaptation; Electricity access; Energy access; Energy needs; Energy poverties; Sub-saharan africa; Climate change; air conditioning; climate change; climate effect; demand-side management; energy management; energy planning; household energy; indoor air; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105268877

Lockdown measures imposed to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial reductions in observed Asian aerosol loadings. Here, we use bottom-up estimates of anthropogenic emissions based on national mobility data from Google and Apple, along with simulations from the ECHAM6-HAMMOZ state-of-the-art aerosol-chemistry-climate model to investigate the impact of the reduced aerosol and gases pollution loadings on the ISM. We show that the decrease in anthropogenic emissions led to a 4 W m-2 increase in surface solar radiation over parts of South Asia, which resulted in a strengthening of the ISM. Simultaneously, while natural emission parameterizations are kept the same in all our simulations, the anthropogenic emission reduction led to changes in the atmospheric circulation, causing accumulation of dust over the Tibetan plateau (TP) during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. This accumulated dust has intensified the warm core over the TP that reinforced the intensification of the Hadley circulation. The associated cross-equatorial moisture influx over the Indian landmass led to an enhanced amount of rainfall by 4% (0.2 mm d-1) over the Indian landmass and 5%-15% (0.8-3 mm d-1) over central India. These estimates may vary under the influence of large-scale coupled atmosphere-ocean oscillations (e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole). Our study indicates that the reduced anthropogenic emissions caused by the unprecedented COVID-19 restrictions had a favourable effect on the hydrological cycle over South Asia, which has been facing water scarcity during the past decades. This emphasizes the need for stringent measures to limit future anthropogenic emissions in South Asia for protecting one of the world's most densely populated regions. © 2021 The Author(s).

In a cap and trade system, the government sets emission limits for emission entities, who must abide by the set limits. Emission entities that exceed their emission limits may buy from those under-utilizing their emission quotas. On the other hand, carbon tax is tax paid on the emission of carbon (CO2) into the atmosphere. Countries use carbon taxes to address a wide range of issues, including waste disposal, water pollution, and carbon emissions. The advantages of increased public revenue and reduced carbon emissions, attributable to carbon tax, lead to environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency, and attract its use by countries. Carbon tax, therefore, offers a ""double dividend""-revenue generation and behavioural change-which ultimately addresses climate change. Notwithstanding its potential benefits, several resource-based states, especially developing countries, are yet to introduce a carbon tax regime in their tax laws and practices. This chapter evaluates the utility, desirability, and potential of achieving sustainable development in resource-based states through carbon taxation. Following a discussion of the motivations for considering a carbon tax system, the chapter evaluates the potential impacts of a carbon tax system for Middle East and North African (MENA) economies, particularly on poor and vulnerable states who despite contributing less to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may bear the disproportionate burden of combating climate change. It then evaluates the potential legal and logistical barriers that a carbon taxation system might face and proposes legal frameworks for addressing these barriers. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

Using high-throughput amplicon and metagenome sequencing, combined with X-ray computed tomography, we investigated how water availability and substrate architecture modulated the taxonomic and functional composition of gypsum endolithic communities in the Atacama Desert, Chile. We found that communities inhabiting gypsum rocks with a more fragmented substrate architecture had higher taxonomic and functional diversity, despite having less water available. This effect was tightly linked with community connectedness and likely the result of niche differentiation. Gypsum communities were functionally similar, yet adapted to their unique micro-habitats by modulating their carbon and energy acquisition strategies and their growth modalities. Reconstructed population genomes showed that these endolithic microbial populations encoded potential pathways for anoxygenic phototrophy and atmospheric hydrogen oxidation as supplemental energy sources. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"calcium sulfate; water; extreme environment; genetics; microflora; phototrophy; Calcium Sulfate; Extreme Environments; Microbiota; Phototrophic Processes; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096934341

Here, we resolve microbial community profiles in hydrothermal sediment cores of Guaymas Basin on a scale of 2 millimeters, using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) to visualize the rapid downcore changes among dominant bacteria and archaea. DGGE analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons identified free-living and syntrophic deltaproteobacterial sulfate-reducing bacteria, fermentative Cytophagales, members of the Chloroflexi (Thermoflexia), Aminicenantes, and uncultured sediment clades. The DGGE pattern indicates a gradually changing downcore community structure where small changes on a 2-millimeter scale accumulate to significantly changing populations within the top 4 cm sediment layer. Functional gene DGGE analyses identified anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) based on methyl-coenzyme M reductase genes, and members of the Betaproteobacteria and Thaumarchaeota based on bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase genes, respectively. The co-existence and overlapping habitat range of aerobic, nitrifying, sulfate-reducing and fermentative bacteria and archaea, including thermophiles, in the surficial sediments is consistent with dynamic redox and thermal gradients that sustain highly complex microbial communities in the hydrothermal sediments of Guaymas Basin. © Copyright © 2021 Engelen, Nguyen, Heyerhoff, Kalenborn, Sydow, Tabai, Peterson, Wegener and Teske.","16S rRNA gene; amoA gene; DGGE (Denaturating Gradient Gel Electrophoresis); Guaymas basin; hydrothermal sediment; mcrA (methyl-coenzyme M reductase A)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111576559

This is particularly challenging in developing countries with high levels of air pollution, mostly due to sparse monitoring networks with a lack of consistent data. Methods: We evaluated the performance of six different machine learning algorithms in predicting fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia using data between 2010 and 2018. We found that the algorithms produce robust results based on performance metrics. Results: Random forest (RF) and gradient boosting models performed the best with leave-one-location-out cross-validated R2 of 0.82 for when using data from the entire study period. After applying tuned models on the hold-out test set, R2 increased to 0.96 for the RF and 0.90 for the gradient boosting model. We also predicted PM2.5 concentrations for each administrative area (khoroo) of the city using RF and maps of predictions show spatiotemporal variations that are in line with the location of the high-emission area (ger district), city center, and population density. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence of the advantage and feasibility of machine learning approaches in predicting ambient PM2.5 levels in a setting with limited resources and extreme air pollution levels. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Exposure Modeling; Particulate Matter","air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; human; machine learning; Mongolia; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Machine Learning; Mongolia; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088865980

This study was designed to investigate the impact of various PECs on earthworm community patterns (species composition, numbers, biomass, α-diversity, life-form categories) at a landscape scale in Western Germany. The PECs investigated were cup plant (CP), tall wheatgrass (TW) and giant knotweed (GK). In total, 4 field replicates of each perennial crop were investigated at 9 study sites with the exception of CP, for which only 3 replicate sites were available. PECs were compared with silage maize as an annual bioenergy crop (AEC) and permanent grasslands (PGL). The earthworm community of the study area consisted of 13 species in total. Mean species number ranged from 2.7 (AEC) &lt; 2.8 (GK) &lt; 3.8 (TW) &lt; 3.9 (PGL) &lt; 4.2 (CP). Overall, PECs took an intermediate position between AEC and PGL concerning earthworm population data including α-diversity and community structure as indicated by Shannon-Weaver index (H’), species number and Evenness (E). There was a clear and close to significant (p &lt; 0.1) increase in the mean total earthworm number in the range AEC (43.3 ind. m−2) – PECs (86.7 ind. m−2) – PGL (114.4 ind. m−2). Fresh earthworm biomass varied from 21.1 g m−2 (AEC) to 35.7 g m−2 (PGL) to 40.1 g m−2 (PECs), however, this difference was only significant for mean biomass of juveniles. Endogeic species were highly dominant in soils cultivated with PECs. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that soil pH, amounts of soil organic carbon and plant available soil water content were partly significant environmental driving variables for the improvement of the earthworm community in soils cultivated with PECs. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Community structure; Earthworm community; GLM models; Land-use change; Perennial energy crops; α-diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107973379

Such a light source would significantly enhance the ability to experimentally investigate electron dynamics on ultrafast timescales, having a broad-ranging impact across multiple scientific fields. Rather than starting from noise as in typical XFELs, the x-ray emission in this approach is driven by coherent radiation from a pre-bunched, high peak current electron beam of attosecond duration. This relaxes the restrictive tolerances that have hindered progress toward utilizing plasma accelerators as coherent x-ray drivers thus far, presenting a new paradigm for advanced accelerator light source applications. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Electron beams; Electrons; Free electron lasers; Magnetohydrodynamics; Plasma accelerators; Plasma stability; X ray lasers; X rays; Accelerator technology; Coherent radiation; High-peak currents; Plasma wake-field accelerators; Scientific fields; Ultra high brightness; Ultrafast timescales; X-ray free electron lasers; Acceleration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111675845

A capacity expansion model, which simultaneously considers generation and transmission builds covering a planning horizon up to 2040, was created. The simulated scenarios, which entailed retiring liquid fuels from the Saudi power sector and accounted for different gas prices, consider the following candidate build technologies: nuclear, gas, solar photovoltaics, wind, concentrated solar power with storage, and battery storage. Renewables can reduce carbon emissions by 66 million tons to 114 million tons (25–41 %) by 2040 depending on the gas price. The abatement costs were estimated to range between 20 $/ton and 50 $/ton of carbon dioxide. Within Saudi Arabia, renewable deployment can also defer national gas supply expansion plans but not investments in expanding domestic gas transport capacities.

This study is part of assessment of various persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in human milk in four cities of eastern and central Saudi Arabia, namely, Riyadh, Al-Kharj, Al-Jobail and Al-Dammam. Milk samples were collected from 50 donors according to the WHO/UNEP protocol for monitoring human milk for POPs. The OCPs in each of the 50 milk samples were analyzed using as triple quadrupole gas chromatography mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry detection (GC–MS/MS). Quality assurance included the analysis of blank, spiked and reference samples. Sixteen different OCPs were identified namely: aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, hexachlorobenzene, alpha, beta, gamma and delta hexachlorocycohexame, pp’-,op’-DDT, pp’-DDE, pp’-DDD, alpha and gamma chlordane, heptachlor, mirex and methoxychlor. The results of the analysis OCPs in human milk samples indicated that the tested positive samples for one or more pesticide at the limits of determination used in this study. As required by the Stockholm Convention on POPs, the levels of certain POPs in human milk will serve as an indicator of the effectiveness of the treaty in eliminating or reducing emissions of selected POPs.

We show that formal education level is the most important factor affecting vegetarianism interest, and it creates a sharper difference in low-income countries. Gender is a strong distinguishing factor, followed by national gross domestic product per capita and age. These findings enable upscaling local empirical studies to a global level with confidence for integrated assessments of low-carbon lifestyles.

One proposed policy tool to halt deforestation is community forest management. Even though communities manage an increasing proportion of the world’s forests, we lack good evidence of successful approaches to community forest management. Prior studies suggest that successful approaches require a number of “design conditions” to be met. However, causal evidence on the effectiveness of individual design conditions is scarce. This study isolates one design condition, community-led monitoring of the forest, and provides causal evidence on its potential to reduce forest use. The study employs a randomized controlled trial to investigate the impact of community monitoring on forest use in 110 villages in Uganda. We explore the impact of community monitoring in both monitored and unmonitored areas of the forest, using exceptionally detailed data from on-the-ground measurements and satellite imagery. Estimates indicate that community monitoring does not affect our main outcome of interest, a forest-use index. However, treatment villages see a relative increase in forest loss outside of monitored forest areas compared to control villages. This increase is seen both in nonmonitored areas adjacent to treatment villages and in nonmonitored areas adjacent to neighboring villages not included in the study. We tentatively conclude that at least part of the increase in forest loss in nonmonitored areas is due to displacement of forest use by members of treatment villages due to fear of sanctions.

In Australia, over recent decades substantial development of savanna burning emissions accounting methods has been undertaken to incentivise more conservative savanna fire management and reduce the extent and severity of late dry season wildfires. Since inception of Australia's formal regulated savanna burning market in 2012, today 25% of the 1.2M km2 fire-prone northern savanna region is managed under such arrangements. Although savanna burning projects generate significant emissions reductions and associated financial benefits especially for Indigenous landowners, various biodiversity conservation considerations, including fine-scale management requirements for conservation of fire-vulnerable taxa, remain contentious. For the entire savanna burning region, here we compare outcomes achieved at ‘with-project’ vs ‘non-project’ sites over the period 2000–19, with respect to explicit ecologically defined fire regime metrics, and assembled fire history and spatial mapping coverages. We find that there has been little significant fire regime change at non-project sites, whereas, at with-project sites under all land uses, from 2013 there has been significant reduction in late season wildfire, increase in prescribed early season mitigation burning and patchiness metrics, and seasonally variable changes in extent of unburnt (&gt;2, &gt;5 years) habitat. Despite these achievements, it is acknowledged that savanna burning projects do not provide a fire management panacea for a variety of key regional conservation, production, and cultural management issues. Rather, savanna burning projects can provide an effective operational funded framework to assist with delivering various landscape-scale management objectives. With these caveats in mind, significant potential exists for implementing incentivised fire management approaches in other fire-prone international savanna settings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity conservation; Carbon market; Fire regimes; Woody thickening","biodiversity; burning; emission control; fire history; fire management; implementation process; mapping method; patchiness; project management; savanna; vulnerability; Article; Australia; biomass; carbon footprint; conservation biology; environmental management; funding; government; landscape; remote sensing; savanna; season; wildfire; biodiversity; ecosystem; fire; grassland; Australia; Australia; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Fires; Grassland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104288810

In this field, a significant impact is caused by road transportation emissions. Among the possibilities of alternative transportation, hybrid electric vehicles are a reliable and easy-to-implement solution, combining the high efficiency of pure electric propulsion systems and driving range provided by internal combustion engines. Therefore, this research aims to assess a conventional vehicle converted into a mild hybrid electric vehicle with a single-shaft hybrid series powertrain architecture, where an electric motor is directly coupled to the engine drive belt. A gear shifting control and a fuzzy logic power-split are applied and optimized by an adaptive-weight genetic algorithm, considering the potential impact on battery degradation, charging time, electric powertrain size and life cycle costs. The simulation is based on a realistic driving cycle of Campinas city, one of the largest cities in Brazil. The result is an optimized single-shaft hybrid series powertrain configuration, able to enhance overall vehicle energy efficiency, decreasing the travel cost by 15.18% without compromising its battery lifetime, reducing air pollutant emissions in 16.71% CO, 22.77% HC and 44.36% NOx. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Fuel economy; Fuzzy logic control; Genetic algorithm; Single-shaft hybrid series powertrain; Vehicle emissions","Air pollution; Charging (batteries); Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Life cycle; Powertrains; Propulsion; Secondary batteries; Battery aging; Emission energies; Energy; Energy-consumption; Fuzzy logic control; Gear shifting; Hybrid series; Shifting controls; Single-shaft hybrid series powertrain; Vehicle emission; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111046396

In Bogotá, Colombia, a metropolitan area with over 10 million inhabitants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels regularly exceed air quality guidelines, leading to detrimental effects on health. Although there is public interest to improve the city's air quality, the main sources of PM2.5 pollution have not been clearly identified and the use of modeling for policy development in Bogotá has been limited. Here, we apply a modeling framework based on the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) to conduct seasonal simulations of air pollution in Bogotá and reveal the emissions sectors with the largest contributions to PM2.5. Based on these results, we project and compare the air quality benefits of potential pollution mitigation strategies focused on these sources. The analysis finds that resuspended dust from unpaved roads is the largest local source of PM2.5 and can contribute over 30% of seasonally-averaged concentration across the city. Vehicles, industrial activity, and unpaved road dust combined are responsible for over 60% of PM2.5 pollution in Bogotá. A scenario analysis shows that paving roads can lead to PM2.5 decreases of nearly 10 μg/m3 by 2030 in some areas of the city, but air quality will deteriorate significantly over others in the absence of additional emissions control measures. Mitigation strategies designed to target the sectors with the largest contributions to PM2.5, including road cleaning systems, controls for industrial point sources, cleaner transportation fuels, and updated vehicle fleets, can largely avert projected increases in concentrations, although the impacts of different approaches vary throughout the city. This study is the first to use a comprehensive model to determine sector contributions to air pollution and inform potential emissions control policies in Bogotá, demonstrating an approach to guide pollution management in developing cities facing comparable challenges. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality modeling; Scenario analysis; Source apportionment; Urban air pollution","Air quality; Cleaning; Developing countries; Dust; Quality control; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Air quality modeling; Community multi-scale air quality models; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Industrial activities; Low and middle income countries; Pollution management; Pollution mitigation; Potential pollutions; Air pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); megacity; particulate matter; scenario analysis; source apportionment; urban area; air quality; article; city; cleaning; particulate matter 2.5; simulation; Bogota; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101412299

Knowing how the CCD has varied over time is important for understanding and predicting the distribution of seafloor sediments and assessing their role in the global carbon cycle. We focus on the South Atlantic Ocean where the most recent CCD curve is based on Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 73 sites drilled in 1980 in the South Atlantic Ocean. We compute the South and central South Atlantic CCD from the Late Cretaceous to the present day using updated age models from 45 DSDP and Ocean Drilling Program sites and backtracking with lithology-specific decompaction, eustasy, and dynamic topography. Our models extend further back in time and show more fluctuations than previous reconstructions, with the CCD varying by hundreds of meters during a span of 2–3 m.y. The addition of eustasy and dynamic topography deepens the CCD by as much as 500 m between 74 Ma and 45 Ma, and by ~200 m during the Cenozoic. The central South Atlantic CCD diverges from the average South Atlantic CCD during the Eocene and Miocene, when it was ~1 km shallower. These regional deviations may be due to changes in primary productivity and/or carbonate dissolution leading to reduced carbonate accumulation rates. Our CCD curves highlight the importance of regional processes in carbonate deposition across the South Atlantic and provide improved constraints for the modeling of geochemical cycles. © 2021 Geological Society of America.

This study used structural equation modelling (SEM) and a 24-year multifaceted monitoring data series collected at Zackenberg, North-East Greenland, to untangle the network of climatic and local abiotic and biotic drivers, determining their direct and indirect effects on two herbivores: musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) and collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus). Snow conditions were determined to be the central driver within the system, mediating the effects of climate on herbivore abundance. Under current climate change projections, snow is expected to decrease in the region. Snow had an indirect negative effect on musk ox, as decreased snow depth led to an earlier start to the Arctic willow growing season, shown to increase fecundity and decrease mortality. Musk ox are therefore expected to be more successful under future conditions, within a certain threshold. Snow had both positive and negative effects on lemming, with lemming expected to ultimately be less successful under climate change, as reduction in snow increases their vulnerability to predation. Through their capacity to determine effects of climatic and local drivers within a hierarchy, and the relative strength and direction of these effects, SEMs were demonstrated to have the potential to be valuable in guiding population management. © 2021, The Author(s).","Arctic; Arctic oscillation; Climate change; Sea ice; Snow cover; Structural equation model; Trophic interactions","abundance; analytical hierarchy process; climate change; fecundity; herbivore; learning; mortality; rodent; snow; Arctic; Greenland; Zackenberg; Dicrostonyx; Dicrostonyx groenlandicus; Ovibos moschatus; Salix arctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105931673

We evaluated forest sector carbon trends and potential mitigation scenarios in Vermont using a systems-based modeling framework that accounts for net emissions from all forest sector components. These components comprise (1) the forest ecosystem, including land-use change, (2) harvested wood products (HWP), and (3) substitution effects associated with using renewable wood-based products and fuels in place of more emission-intensive materials and fossil fuel-based energy. We assessed baseline carbon trends from 1995 through 2050 using a business as usual (BAU) scenario. Emission reductions associated with different forest management and HWP scenarios were evaluated relative to the BAU scenario from 2020 to 2050. We estimated uncertainty for each forest sector component and used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the distribution of cumulative total mitigation for each scenario relative to baseline. Our analysis indicates that the strength of the forest sector carbon sink in Vermont has been declining and will continue to decline over coming decades under the BAU scenario. However, several scenarios evaluated here could be effective in reducing emissions and enhancing carbon uptake. Shifting HWP to longer-lived commodities resulted in a 14% reduction in net cumulative emissions by 2050, the largest reduction of all scenarios. A scenario that combined extending harvest rotations, utilizing additional harvest residues for bioenergy, and increasing forest productivity resulted in a 12% reduction in net cumulative emissions. Shifting commodities from pulp and paper to bioenergy showed a 7.3% reduction in emissions. In contrast, shortening rotations to increase harvests for bioenergy use resulted in a 5.5% increase in emissions. In summary, model simulations suggest that net emissions could be reduced by up to 14% relative to BAU, depending on the management and HWP-use scenario. Combining multiple scenarios could further enhance reductions. However, realizing the full climate mitigation potential of these forests may be challenging due to socioeconomic barriers to implementation, as well as alternative management objectives that must be considered along with carbon sequestration. © 2021 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Ecological Applications © 2021 Ecological Society of America.

However, the understanding of deep soil excavation due to the vertical expansion of impervious surface remains limited. According to the average soil excavation depth, we divided impervious surface into pavement (IS20 ), low-rise building (IS100 ) and high-rise building (IS300 ). Based on remote-sensing images and published SOC density data, we estimated the SOC storage and its response to the impervious surface expansion in the 0–300 cm soil depth in Guangzhou city, China. The results showed that the total SOC storage of the study area was 8.31 Tg, of which the top 100 cm layer contributed 44%. The impervious surface expansion to date (539.87 km2 ) resulted in 4.16 Tg SOC loss, of which the IS20, IS100 and IS300 contributed 26%, 58% and 16%, respectively. The excavation-induced SOC loss (kg/m2 ) of IS300 was 1.8 times that of IS100 . However, at the residential scale, renovating an IS100 plot into an IS300 plot can substantially reduce SOC loss compared with farmland urbanization. The gains of organic carbon accumulation in more greenspace coverage may be offset by the loss in deep soil excavation for the construction of underground parking lots, suggesting a need to control the exploitation intensity of underground space and promote residential greening. © 2021 by the authors.

To date, however, the interrelationship of bacteria and archaea involved in these processes remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated the dynamics of microorganisms participating in these processes. Anaerobic fixed-bed reactors were operated with swine manure and sludge to produce methane stably, and then, sulfate (reactor C), sulfate and Hg(II) (reactor H), and sulfate and MeHg (reactor M) were added, and the reactors were operated for 120 d, divided equally into four periods, P1–P4. The bacterial compositions changed nonsignificantly, whereas Methanosaeta in reactors H and M decreased significantly, revealing that it was irrelevant for Hg transformation. The abundances of Syntrophomonadaceae, Methanoculleus, Candidatus Methanogranum and Candidatus Methanoplasma increased continuously with time; these species probably functioned in these processes, but further evidence is needed. Desulfocella and Desulfobacterium dominated first but eventually almost vanished, while the dominant archaeal genera Methanogenium, Methanoculleus and Methanocorpusculum were closely related to ANME–1 and ANME–2. PLS-DA results indicated that both bacteria and archaea in different periods in the three reactors were clustered separately, implying that the microbial compositions in the same periods were similar and changed markedly with time. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Archaea; Bacteria; Mercury methylation; Methane oxidation; Methylmercury demethylation; Sulfate reduction","Alkylation; Bacteria; Chemical reactors; Fertilizers; Methane; Methylation; Sulfur compounds; Anaerobic fixed-bed reactors; Bacterial composition; Mercuries (Hg); Mercury methylation; Methane oxidation; Methylmercury; Microbial composition; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Mercury compounds; mercury; methane; methylmercury; sulfate; methane; sulfate; anoxic conditions; bacterium; bioreactor; mercury (element); methane; methylation; oxidation; prokaryote; sulfate-reducing bacterium; anaerobic metabolism; Article; Candidatus methanogranum; Candidatus methanoplasma; controlled study; demethylation; Desulfobacterium; Desulfocella; Methanocorpusculum; Methanoculleus; methanogen; Methanogenium; Methanosaeta; methanotrophic archaeon; methylation; microbial community; microbial population dynamics; nonhuman; oxidation; sludge; sulfate reducing bacterium; swine manure; Syntrophomonadaceae; anaerobic growth; animal; archaeon; bacterium; genetics; methylation; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; pig; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Desulfobacterium; Desulfocella; Methanocorpusculum; Methanoculleus; Methanogenium; Methanosaeta; Syntrophomonadaceae; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Archaea; Bacteria; Mercury; Methane; Methylation; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; Sulfates; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101043391

Thus, our study associates the evaluation of mesofauna and SOC quantification to generate relevant information on the influencing level of these organisms on organic matter dynamics in aggregates. It is even more important investigating these indicators in places where decomposition processes are more intense, such as forest systems under tropical soils, where little is known about the interaction between these variables. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate: (1) the influence of homogeneous Pterogyne nitens and Pinus caribaea plantations on the edaphic mesofauna community and on SOC stocks and carbon in soil aggregate classes using a native forest as a reference; and (2) the interaction between edaphic mesofauna, SOC and aggregate carbon. This study was performed on Oxisol soil areas located in the municipality of Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil. The edaphic mesofauna was evaluated using the modified Berlese-Tullgren funnel method. Physical soil fractionation was carried out by wet sieving. The organic carbon contents of the soil and aggregates were determined by wet oxidation. Implantation of homogeneous Pterogyne nitens and Pinus caribaea stands causes a reduction in the edaphic mesofauna (abundance and average richness) and in the amount of soil macroaggregates. The differences between the forest systems are largely explained by the abundance of fauna, SOC and carbon of the macroaggregates, microaggregates and silt + clay. The edaphic mesofauna has a direct and positive influence on the SOC, which highlights its important role in regulating the soil carbon dynamics in the soil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregate classes; Soil organic matter; Soil organisms; Soil size fractions","aggregate stability; community structure; coniferous tree; decomposition analysis; fractionation; microaggregate; organic carbon; oxidation; plantation forestry; soil aggregate; soil fauna; soil organic matter; Bahia; Brazil; Matthiola; Pinus caribaea; Pterogyne nitens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110533817

In these archaea-Fe interactions, Fe(III) serves as terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration by a variety of archaea, while Fe(II) serves as electron donor and/or energy sources for archaeal growth. As no Fe is incorporated into the archaeal cells, these redox reactions are referred to as dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction and Fe(II) oxidation, respectively. Dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing archaea (FeRA) and Fe(II)-oxidizing archaea (FeOA) are widespread on Earth where they play crucial roles in biogeochemical cycling of not only Fe, but also carbon and sulfur. To reduce extracellular Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides, some FeRA transfer electrons directly to the Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides most likely via multiheme c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts). These multiheme c-Cyts may form the pathways similar to those found in bacteria for transferring electrons from the quinone/quinol pool in the cytoplasmic membrane to the Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides external to the archaeal cells. Use of multiheme c-Cyts for extracellular Fe(III) reduction by both Domains of Archaea and Bacteria emphasizes an ancient mechanism of extracellular electron transfer, which is well conserved. Other FeRA, however, reduce Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides indirectly via electron shuttles. Similarly, it is proposed that FeOA use pathways to oxidize Fe(II) on the surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and then to transfer the released electrons across the cytoplasmic membrane inward to the O2 and NAD+ in the cytoplasm. In this review, we focus on the latest understandings of the molecular mechanisms used by FeRA and FeOA for Fe(III) reduction and Fe(II) oxidation, respectively. © Copyright © 2021 Dong, Shan, Xia and Shi.","dissimilatory Fe(II)-oxidizing archaea; dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing archaea; electron transfer; molecular mechanisms; redox proteins","cytochrome c; cytochrome c oxidase; ferric ion; ferrous ion; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; oxygen; archaeon; biogeochemical cycling; bioremediation; electron transport; energy conservation; hyperthermophilic archaeon; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; oxidation reduction reaction; Review; thermophilic archaeon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110289115

Their cycling processes and interactions have a key impact on the plants productivity, potential carbon sequestration and stability of the terrestrial ecosystem. In this study, soil profile samples (0–100 cm) were collected from 906 plots of typical subtropical forest in Zhejiang Province, southeastern China. Moran's I, geostatistics and geographic information system (GIS) techniques were used to study the vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of SOC, STN and C:N ratio. The results indicated that the contents of SOC and STN clearly decreased with the soil depth increasing (from 0 to 10 cm layer to 60–100 cm layer). The spatial distributions of SOC and STN were consistent with the topography, showing a decreasing trend from southwest to northeast of Zhejiang Province. The results of ANOVA and correlation analyses indicated that the dominant tree species, elevation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the key factors affecting SOC and STN contents. For the total 0–100 cm soil layer, the mean densities of SOC and STN were 108.53 Mg ha−1 and 0.08 Mg ha−1, respectively. The total stocks of SOC and STN were 877.19 Tg and 84.42 Tg. Approximately 65% SOC and 45% STN were belonged to the upper 30 cm soil layer, which was strongly related to the actual soil thickness. The results could provide critical information for forestry and environmental management related to C and N accumulations in subtropical forests of China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon and nitrogen density; Environmental variables; Forest soils; GIS; Spatial variation","carbon; nitrogen; organic carbon; carbon; nitrogen; carbon sequestration; environmental management; forest ecosystem; inorganic carbon; NDVI; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil depth; soil nitrogen; soil profile; soil quality; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; subtropical region; analysis of variance; Article; carbon nitrogen ratio; China; climate; environmental factor; environmental management; forest soil; geographic information system; geostatistical analysis; laboratory test; sampling; soil analysis; soil depth; soil quality; topography; vegetation; ecosystem; forest; soil; China; Zhejiang; Matthiola; Carbon; China; Ecosystem; Forests; Nitrogen; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105006147

Drawing on Turkey's experiences, this chapter discusses progress made, and challenges that remain, in terms of implementing a cross-sectoral and integrated approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation responses in the MENA Region. The scope and content of the WEF nexus approach are introduced. The chapter then discusses progress made in Turkey especially regarding increased investments in renewable energy. Several challenges arise, including the prioritization of energy production, and the lack of transparency in environmental impact assessments. The chapter suggests some innovative policy approaches for addressing those challenges, including the establishment of a dedicated agency with more transparent mechanisms for coordinating the WEF nexus in policy and practice. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

Variation in community structure is driven by both biotic and abiotic factors, reflecting adaptation strategies of plant communities to various environments. Although much is known about the response of individual perennial plants to drier climates, empirical evidence of the community-level responses to increasing dryness is limited. Location: Eastern Australia; 1500 km gradient. Taxon: Perennial plants. Methods: We measured the abundance and size distribution (median, skewness and variance) of perennial plant communities from different growth forms (trees, shrubs and grasses), the spatial arrangement of trees in the overstorey and both biotic (competition) and abiotic (climate, soil properties) factors at 150 sites along an extensive aridity gradient from humid to arid areas. We used regression analyses and linear models to explore variation in community structure with increasing aridity and key driving factors for different perennial plant communities. Results: Variation in community structure differed with growth form. As aridity increased, trees had wider canopies and were spatially aggregated, shrubs became miniaturised, but highly variable in size, and grasses comprised more larger individuals. Biotic and abiotic factors exerted different effects on different growth forms, with trees and shrubs consistently affected by competition and aridity, respectively, whereas grasses were weakly affected by aridity, summer rainfall and soil texture. Main conclusions: Our study highlights the idiosyncratic adaptation strategies used by trees, shrubs and grasses in response to drying climates at the community level through their effect on the size distribution or spatial aggregation. The structure of different perennial growth forms was influenced by different effects from either biotic (competition) or abiotic (climate, soil) factors. Under forecasted drier climates, canopy expansion and greater aggregation of trees might enhance resource sinks and shelter for diverse biota, potentially shielding plant communities against predicted aridification. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; plant community; resource competition; size distribution; skewness; soil texture; vegetation pattern","abundance; aridity; community structure; environmental factor; grass; growth form; perennial plant; plant community; size distribution; Australia; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103374154

The rapid urbanization rate has led to congestion and pollution, as well as declining competitiveness of some of the region's cities and economies. At the same time, the region remains very diverse and heterogeneous in terms of economic and social development, and largely underdeveloped when it comes to regional integration. Addressing economic and social development, as well as regional integration, may create further sources of pollution that will have to be mitigated. Policy makers in the region stand thus at a critical juncture in terms of the legal and policy choices that need to be made to address both the developmental and climate protection concerns. Since the 19th century, public policies and the law have been largely based on an assumption of human behaviour: that individuals are rational. More recently, and thanks to seminal studies by Nobel Prize in Economics winner, Richard Thaler, among others, public policy makers are using different paradigms of human behaviour for the development of public policies. There are, accordingly, three major regulatory tools to help transition towards more sustainable development policy choices: command-and-control, market-based approaches, and nudges. As MENA countries increasingly develop legal and policy frameworks to address climate change, innovative regulatory approaches will be required. This chapter analyzes the use of regulatory policies to address climate change concerns in the MENA Region, and assesses their effectiveness in the background of the complex socio-economic conditions of the region. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

Respiration chambers enable researchers to obtain highly accurate enteric CH4 measurements from controlled environments, whereas SF6 and GreenFeed systems present opportunities for measuring emissions in open-air environments. Several resources are available to aid researchers in method selection, depending upon the intended application. Currently, 3-NOP appears to be a promising inhibitor for enteric CH4 production, with seaweed garnering additional interest. Evaluation of the practicality, feasibility, long-term mitigation potential, and long-term effects on productivity, reproduction, and animal health of feed additives is critical to identifying commercially relevant CH4 mitigation options. As plant phytochemicals have potential animal health and ecological co-benefits in addition to being potential CH4 mitigators, they should be studied from interdisciplinary, system approaches.

Our results show that the signing of the Paris Agreement had a large negative impact for the Oil and Gas sector (CAAR −8.4%), with Exploration and Production (CAAR −12.2%) and Drilling (CAAR −10.5%) most severely affected. This is further supported by an increase in implied volatility and by a structural break in option trader sentiment around the signing of the agreement. In general, the Paris Agreement had a much stronger impact on firms that had primarily U.S.-focused operations. Contrary to expectations, the election of Donald Trump and the announced withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement negatively affected some sub-sectors (integrated and transport) and the sector overall. We attribute this to (1) Trump's policies supporting domestic production (benefitting unlisted independent producers at the expense of listed competitors with import and international assets), and (2) on “We Are Still In” efforts by U.S. states, cities and companies to continue to meet Paris Agreement goals.

The success of this mode is also due to new urban mobility strategies and plans, such as the European Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, which relies on non-pollutant modes. To display the range of effects that can be achieved in urban mobility through the proper implementation of shared e-scooter systems, a systematic literature review and a case study were performed. It was found that this shared system can help cities with environmental issues, such as reducing air pollution, reducing inequality in access to transport, promoting money-saving, and improving mobility resilience. During the Covid-19 pandemic, shared e-scooters became a great asset in many cities worldwide, because they promote social distancing and help cities not to rely only on private cars to replace public transport rides, especially for short-distance trips. In the case study of Braga, it was found that the city still relies on shared e-scooter modes as a mobility option after the pandemic, also promoting special fares for people to start using the service. © 2021 by the authors.

Kisumu County is one such setting with an estimated 500 t of waste generated per day and with less than half of it regularly collected. The open burning and natural decay of solid waste is an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and atmospheric pollutants with adverse health consequences. In this paper, we use system dynamics modelling to investigate the expected impact on GHG and PM2.5 emissions of (i) a waste-to-biogas initiative and (ii) a regulatory ban on the open burning of waste in landfill. We use life tables to estimate the impact on mortality of the reduction in PM2.5 exposure. Our results indicate that combining these two interventions can generate over 1.1 million tonnes of cumulative savings in GHG emissions by 2035, of which the largest contribution (42%) results from the biogas produced replacing unclean fuels in household cooking. Combining the two interventions is expected to reduce PM2.5 emissions from the waste and residential sectors by over 30% compared to our baseline scenario by 2035, resulting in at least around 1150 cumulative life years saved over 2021–2035. The contribution and novelty of this study lies in the quantification of a potential waste-to-biogas scenario and its environmental and health impact in Kisumu for the first time. © 2021 The Authors","GHG accounting; Greenhouse gas emissions; Health impact assessment; Kisumu; Municipal solid waste management; System dynamics","Biogas; Gas emissions; Health; Housing; Municipal solid waste; System theory; Waste management; Greenhouse gas accountings; Greenhouse gas emissions; Health impact assessment; Kisumu; Municipal solid waste management; Open burning; PM$-2.5$; Scenarios analysis; Solid waste management; System Dynamics; Greenhouse gases; biogas; biogas; carbon emission; domestic waste; greenhouse gas; health impact; particulate matter; solid waste; waste management; Article; atmospheric dispersion; carbon footprint; cooking; dynamics; environmental impact; government regulation; health hazard; household; human; Kenya; landfill; mortality; particulate matter 2.5; PM2.5 exposure; priority journal; residential area; solid waste management; waste burning; Kenya; Kisumu [Kenya]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102025025

The research activity has been performed following a theoretical-numerical technique based on the finite volume method and adopting the well-known ANSYS CFX CFD code. The PFCs cooling circuit thermal-hydraulic performances under nominal steady-state conditions, assessed mainly in terms of coolant total pressure drop, coolant axial flow speed and margin against Critical Heat Flux (CHF) distributions among the plasma-facing channels, have been evaluated with a CFD analysis to check their compliance with the corresponding limits. Results have highlighted serious critical issues, such as an intolerable total pressure drop (significantly higher than 1.4 MPa) as well as an insufficient margin against CHF onset (lower than 1.4) within all the PFU channels. Therefore, an optimization study has been performed to investigate the potential improvements of the PFCs cooling circuit thermal-hydraulic performances due to proper changes of its geometric configuration, focussing the attention on the inlet manifold branch. The study has allowed selecting the most effective cooling circuit configuration, that fulfils the maximum pressure drop requirement (Δp<1.4 MPa) while raising the minimum CHF margin within the PFU channels. Moreover, it would allow reducing the ex-vessel total pressure drop, while decreasing the average coolant flow velocity up to values lower than 10 m/s.

Retarded combustion is an effective way in achieving rapid light-up of the three-way catalyst and can be facilitated by stratified charge using late fuel injection. This, however, provides insufficient time for fuel entrainment with air, resulting in locally fuel-rich diffusion combustion. Employing a split injection strategy can help tackle these issues. The effects of a split injection strategy, using a high-pressure Solenoid injector, on the in-cylinder charge formation are investigated in the current study. The studies are performed inside an optical Gasoline engine using high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) in the central tumble and Omega tumble planes, by means of a high-speed laser and camera operating at a repetition rate of 10 kHz. The engine's operating conditions were representative of a low-load operation. The results revealed that a small split ratio of 1:3, with both injections in the intake stroke, was effective at generating a flow field with high turbulence levels close to the spark plug when compared to the 3:1 split ratio. The injection coupled with intake valve opening (IVO) generated strong tumble charge motion, which was preserved throughout the compression stroke. This provides favorable conditions for fast flame propagation. The fuel injection timings that maximized interactions with the piston's surface were detrimental for mixture formation due to heavy surface impingement. The findings from the study helped determine the optimum split injection properties that can generate a turbulent flow field towards the end of the compression stroke. ©","DI; Laser diagnostics; Low-load operations; Optical engine; PIV; Solenoid injector","Air entrainment; Catalysts; Combustion; Engines; Flow fields; Flow visualization; Fuel injection; High pressure effects; Intake valves; Turbulent flow; Velocimeters; Velocity measurement; Compression stroke; Diffusion combustion; Favorable conditions; Fuel injection timing; High-speed particles; Operating condition; Split injection strategy; Three way catalysts; Gasoline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111746870

Due to advancements in technology such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS), there is a wider possibility of studying, monitoring, and reporting of essential biodiversity variances. The aim of the present study is to assess and quantify the extend and pattern of forest fragmentation over the time series of 2013 and 2017 in the traditional landscape area of Senapati district of Manipur, Northeast India using multi-temporal Landsat data. The Landscape Fragmentation tool has been used to categorize the forest area into four categories: patch, edge, perforated, and core forest by assigning an edge width of 100 m. The result of the study shows that area covered by patch forest has increased by 5.54%, whereas the total core forest area has decreased by 318.5 km2. The change matrix analysis showed the conversion of one category of the forest to another with the overall maximum changes is associated with degradation in the forest area. With the identification of such change using RS technology and GIS data, we could suggest immediate measures for reclamation and restoration of degraded forest areas to regain its original ecosystem integrity in terms of carbon storage, soil retention, water conservation, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Forest fragmentation; GIS; Remote sensing; Traditional landscape","agricultural land; assessment method; biodiversity; environmental degradation; forest ecosystem; GIS; habitat fragmentation; identification method; Landsat; patch size; remote sensing; technological development; time series analysis; India; Manipur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094856663

The study of water-land-energy-emission systems can provide an important basis for reducing agricultural GHG emissions. Based on calculations of agricultural CO2e emissions in the 30 provinces of China from 2006 to 2017, this study explores the contribution of the integrated patterns of water and land resources (IPWL), agricultural carbon emission intensity, and economic output per unit water resources to agricultural CO2e emissions per unit sown area using a spatiotemporal index decomposition approach. The conclusions are as follows. (1) In 2006–2017, the IPWL in China fluctuates, increasing from 1.19 × 106 m3/km2 to 1.35 × 106 m3/km2 and is generally distributed as “high in the south and low in the north.” (2) In the temporal domain, a comparison between the periods 2006–2011 and 2006–2017 shows that, with the increase in IPWL, fewer provinces inhibit the IPWL to agricultural CO2e emissions per unit sown area; furthermore, this effect has been weakened in seven provinces. (3) In the spatial domain, the higher the IPWL is in most areas in China, the higher the contribution rate of IPWL is to agricultural CO2e emissions per unit sown area. Finally, several suggestions are offered for mitigating agricultural GHG emissions in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural GHG emissions; China; Spatial decomposition; Temporal decomposition; Water-land-energy-emissions nexus","Agriculture; Gas emissions; Water resources; Agricultural greenhouse gas emission; China; Greenhouse gas emissions; Integrated pattern; Land resources; Per unit; Spatial decompositions; Temporal decomposition; Water-land-energy-emission nexus; Waters resources; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105588134

Reduction in bee pollination efficiency under adverse montane weather conditions was proposed to drive these shifts. Although pollinator shifts are central to the evolution and diversification of angiosperms, we lack experimental evidence of the ecological processes underlying such shifts. Here, we combine phylogenetic and distributional data for 138 species of the Neotropical plant tribe Merianieae (Melastomataceae) with pollinator observations of 11 and field pollination experiments of six species to test whether the mountain environment may indeed drive such shifts. We demonstrate that shifts from bee to vertebrate pollination coincided with occurrence at high elevations. We show that vertebrates were highly efficient pollinators even under the harsh environmental conditions of tropical mountains, whereas bee pollination efficiency was lowered significantly through reductions in flower visitation rates. Furthermore, we show that pollinator shifts in Merianieae coincided with the final phases of the Andean uplift and were contingent on adaptive floral trait changes to alternative rewards and mechanisms facilitating pollen dispersal. Our results provide evidence that abiotic environmental conditions (i.e. mountain climate) may indeed reduce the efficiency of a plant clade’s ancestral pollinator group and correlate with shifts to more efficient new pollinators. © 2021 The Authors New Phytologist © 2021 New Phytologist Foundation","altitudinal gradient; floral evolution; pollen dosing; pollination efficiency; tropical Andes","angiosperm; bee; floral trait; flower visiting; mountain environment; Neotropical Region; pollination; pollinator; tropical environment; Andes; Magnoliophyta; Melastomataceae; Vertebrata; animal; bee; flower; phylogeny; pollen; pollination; vertebrate; Animals; Bees; Flowers; Phylogeny; Pollen; Pollination; Vertebrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105934699

Several regulatory efforts and different actions have been taken in the last decades by authorities. Air quality trend analysis represents a valid tool in assessing the impact of these actions taken both at national and local levels. This paper presents for the first time the capability of the Italian national chemical transport model, AMS-MINNI, in capturing the observed concentration trends of three air pollutants - NO2, inhalable particles having diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), and O3 - in Italy over the period 2003-2010. We firstly analyse the model performance finding it in line with the state of the art of regional air quality modelling. The modelled trends result in a general significant downward trend for the three pollutants and, in comparison with observations, the values of the simulated trends were of a similar magnitude for NO2 (in the range -3.0 to -0.5 μg m-3 yr-1), while a smaller range of trends was found than those observed for PM10 (-1.5 to -0.5 μg m-3 yr-1) and O3 maximum daily 8 h average concentration (-2.0 to -0.5 μg m-3 yr-1). As a general result, we find good agreement between modelled and observed trends; moreover, the model provides a greater spatial coverage and statistical significance of pollutant concentration trends with respect to observations, in particular for NO2. We also conduct a qualitative attempt to correlate the temporal concentration trends to meteorological and emission variability. Since no clear tendency in yearly meteorological anomalies (temperature, precipitation, geopotential height) was observed for the period investigated, we focus the discussion of concentration trends on emission variations. We point out that, due to the complex links between precursor emissions and air pollutant concentrations, emission reductions do not always result in a corresponding decrease in atmospheric concentrations, especially for those pollutants that are formed in the atmosphere such as O3 and the major fraction of PM10. These complex phenomena are still uncertain and their understanding is of the utmost importance in planning future policies for reducing air pollution and its impacts on health and ecosystems. © Copyright:",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); numerical model; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110644014

This is an important oversight because policy and technology are often developed in isolation of each other and not in conjunction. Therefore, they have limited synergistic effects when aimed at solving global issues. To examine this aspect, we conducted a systematic literature review and synthesised 97 articles to create a conceptual structuring of the topic. We identified the following categories: (a) evidence base for policymaking including timescale analysis, effective policymaking instruments as well as decision support and scenario planning; (b) policy responses including landscape and urban form, green and blue area ratio, albedo enhancement policies, transport modal split as well as public health and participation; (c) passive technologies including green building envelopes and development of cool surfaces; and (d) active technologies including sustainable transport as well as energy consumption, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and waste heat. Based on the findings, we present a framework to guide future research in analysing UHI policy and technology responses more effectively in conjunction with each other. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Sustainable development; Urban heat island; Urban planning; Urban policymaking; Urban technology","Air conditioning; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Decision support systems; Energy utilization; Sustainable development; Thermal pollution; Urban transportation; Waste heat; Climate change mitigation; Futures researches; Global issues; Increased temperature; Literature reviews; Policy making; Synergistic effect; Urban heat island; Urban policymaking; Urban technology; Urban planning",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103695223

To develop a simple, low-cost methodology to quantify these globally important methane sources, this study focuses on mobile measurements of methane (CH4) and its isotopic composition in Paris. Data collected between September 2018 to March 2019 resulted in 17 days of measurements, which provided spatial distribution of street-level methane mixing ratios, source type identification, and emission quantification. Consequently, 90 potential leaks were detected in Paris sorted into three leak categories: natural gas distribution network emissions (63%), sewage network emissions (33%), and emissions from heating furnaces of buildings (4%). The latter category has not previously been reported in urban methane studies. Accounting for the detectable emissions from the ground, the total estimated CH4emission rate of Paris was 5000 L/min (190 t/yr), with the largest contribution from gas leaks (56%). This ranks Paris as a city with medium CH4emissions. Two areas of clusters were found, where 22% and 56% of the total potential emissions of Paris were observed. Our findings suggest that the natural gas distribution network, the sewage system, and furnaces of buildings are ideal targets for street-level CH4emission reduction efforts for Paris. © 2021 The Authors.

The activation of small molecules such as O2, H+, and CO2 in a cost—and energy-efficient way has become one of the key topics of catalysis research. The main issue concerning the activation of these molecules is the kinetic barrier that has to be overcome in order for the catalyzed reaction to take place. Nature has already provided many pathways in which small molecules are being activated and changed into compounds with higher energy levels. One of the most famous examples would be photosynthesis in which CO2 is transformed into glucose and O2 through sunlight, thus turning solar energy into chemical energy. For these transformations nature mostly uses enzymes that function as catalysts among which porphyrin and porphyrin-like structures can be found. Therefore, the research focus lies on the design of novel porphyrinoid systems (e.g. corroles, porphyrins and phthalocyanines) whose metal complexes can be used for the direct electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to valuable chemicals like carbon monoxide, formate, methanol, ethanol, methane, ethylene, or acetate. For example the cobalt(III)triphenylphosphine corrole complex has been used as a catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol and methanol. The overall goal and emphasis of this research area is to develop a method for industrial use, raising the question of whether and how to incorporate the catalyst onto supportive materials. Graphene oxide, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, carbon black, and activated carbon, to name a few examples, have become researched options. These materials also have a beneficial effect on the catalysis through for instance preventing rival reactions such as the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) during CO2 reduction. It is very apparent that the topic of small molecule activation offers many solutions for our current energy as well as environmental crises and is becoming a thoroughly investigated research objective. This review article aims to give an overview over recently gained knowledge and should provide a glimpse into upcoming challenges relating to this subject matter. © Copyright © 2021 Dedić, Dorniak, Rinner and Schöfberger.","carbon dioxide reduction; catalysis; corroles; electrocatalysis; metal complexes; phthalocyanines; porphyrins",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111570820

This facilitates progress in multiple global efforts to ensure a synergistic contribution of forests and the forest sector to sustainability goals. In recent years, societal demands and expectations associated with forests and the forest sector have changed profoundly. Forests have traditionally been a key resource that contributes to people’s livelihoods; however, this has only been fully embraced among forest professionals within the past 30 years as one of the responsibilities of the sector’s role in society. Forests are the largest repository of carbon stocks and have been assigned a major role in global efforts related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The changing role of the forest sector is resulting in changes in forestry higher education programs and curricula; however, these changes are occurring unevenly in different regions of the world. One major effort to ensure that forestry professionals have the requisite training and skills, and the ability to implement technical management, public administration, and knowledge creation, are post-graduate training and higher education programs for early career forestry professionals. These programs aim to update a professional’s knowledge and skills to adjust to the changing societal demands on forests, and to address deficiencies in professionals’ undergraduate education. This paper reviews and compares five programs that aim to update and improve knowledge and skills among forest professionals, with a special focus on the Asia Pacific region. After reviewing and comparing several programs, the paper reflects on trends and their possible implications. © 2021 by the authors.

The experimental setup closely mimics natural processes (e.g. precipitation driven by CO2 degassing, low ionic strength solution, thin solution film) but within a laboratory setting that allows for controlled growth conditions (temperature, pCO2, drip rate, carbonate saturation index and the composition of the initial solution). For the main batch of calcite growth experiments our average 1000lnαcalcite-solution is -8.5±2(2σ). This low sensitivity of 1000lnα to in-cave growth conditions is encouraging for weathering intensity reconstruction using speleothem samples. At each temperature, growth rate was varied independently with calcite saturation indices ranging between 0.1 and 0.6, with no significant impact on either D(Li) or 1000lnα. For the full range of growth conditions (considering all temperatures and calcite saturation indices) we observe a small but significant decrease in 1000lnα, which we do not attribute to temperature. Based on an inter-study comparison we define LogDLi = 0.09(±0.04)×GR-3.2(±0.2), where GR is growth rate in units of 10-8mmolcm-2s-1. This is similar to the previously defined relationship over a reduced range of growth rates. Over this study's full range of growth rates, 1000lnα = -0.13(±0.04)×GR-7.1(±0.3) is significant at the ρ=0.018 level, consistent with a surface entrapment control. Future experiments should test factors such as growth rate and pH, independently of other variables, to further assess their role in defining 1000lnα. A subset of 20 °C experiments, with increasing [Mg]solution, provides 1000lnα for calcite, high-magnesian calcite (HMC) and aragonite. Our values of 1000lnα for these three mineralogies range between -7.3 and -10.7. For HMC and aragonite in particular there is close agreement with other published values of 1000lnα for CaCO3 grown in laboratory and in natural settings. In agreement with measurements in bulk carbonates, benthic foraminifera and brachiopods, this suggests that differences in 1000lnα between carbonate mineralogies may not always be as large as suggested by some earlier studies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cave-analogue experiments; Inorganic calcite lithium partitioning; Lithium isotopes; Lithium partition coefficient; Localised weathering; Speleothem; Stalagmite; Weathering intensity","calcite; carbonate rock; chemical weathering; experimental study; isotopic analysis; lithium; partitioning; reconstruction; speleothem; stalagmite; Brachiopoda; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105604351

The aim of this study was to identify the effect of microstructure and strain rate on the tensile deformation behavior of a high-pressure die-cast Silafont®-36 alloy, with special attention to strain hardening behavior and deformation mechanisms. The alloy consisted of randomly oriented primary α-Al phase and Al–Si eutectic structure in a form of heterogeneous microstructures, with Sr-modified Si particles exhibiting a coral-like fibrous network. The local misorientations in most primary α-Al grains was below 1°, suggesting strain-free grains along with some extent of near-boundary residual strains due to the thermal mismatch between aluminum and silicon. A superior strength-ductility combination was achieved, along with enhanced Young's modulus and quality index owing to the unique heterogeneous microstructures.

Partly, this gap is due to the inability to resolve different impact channels, such as changes in time allocation (labour supply) and slowdown of work (labour productivity). Explicitly resolving those in a multi-model inter-comparison framework can help to improve estimates of the effects of climate change on labour effectiveness. Methods: In this empirical, multi-model study, we used a large collection of micro-survey data aggregated to subnational regions across the world to estimate new, robust global and regional temperature and wet-bulb globe temperature exposure-response functions (ERFs) for labour supply. We then assessed the uncertainty in existing labour productivity response functions and derived an augmented mean function. Finally, we combined these two dimensions of labour into a single compound metric (effective labour effects). This combined measure allowed us to estimate the effect of future climate change on both the number of hours worked and on the productivity of workers during their working hours under 1·5°C, 2·0°C, and 3·0°C of global warming. We separately analysed low-exposure (indoors or outdoors in the shade) and high-exposure (outdoor in the sun) sectors. Findings: We found differentiated empirical regional and sectoral ERF's for labour supply. Current climate conditions already negatively affect labour effectiveness, particularly in tropical countries. Future climate change will reduce global total labour in the low-exposure sectors by 18 percentage points (range −48·8 to 5·3) under a scenario of 3·0°C warming (24·8 percentage points in the high-exposure sectors). The reductions will be 25·9 percentage points (–48·8 to 2·7) in Africa, 18·6 percentage points (–33·6 to 5·3) in Asia, and 10·4 percentage points (–35·0 to 2·6) in the Americas in the low-exposure sectors. These regional effects are projected to be substantially higher for labour outdoors in full sunlight compared with indoors (or outdoors in the shade) with the average reductions in total labour projected to be 32·8 percentage points (–66·3 to 1·6) in Africa, 25·0 percentage points (–66·3 to 7·0) in Asia, and 16·7 percentage points (–45·5 to 4·4) in the Americas. Interpretation: Both labour supply and productivity are projected to decrease under future climate change in most parts of the world, and particularly in tropical regions. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and southeast Asia are at highest risk under future warming scenarios. The heterogeneous regional response functions suggest that it is necessary to move away from one-size-fits-all response functions to investigate the climate effect on labour. Our findings imply income and distributional consequences in terms of increased inequality and poverty, especially in low-income countries, where the labour effects are projected to be high.

Following the economic recession in Greece over recent years, homeowners have been forced to adapt their practices by shortening heating hours, lowering the indoor thermostat settings, isolating spaces that are not heated or even turning off their central heating system and using alternative local heating systems. This paper presents the results from over 100 occupant surveys using questionnaires and walk-through energy audits in Hellenic households that documented how occupants operated the heating systems in their dwellings and the resulting indoor thermal comfort conditions and actual energy use. The results indicate that the perceived winter thermal comfort conditions were satisfactory in only half of the dwellings, since the actual operating space heating periods averaged only 5 h (compared with the assumed 18 h in standard conditions), while less than half heated their entire dwellings and only a fifth maintained an indoor setpoint temperature of 20 °C, corresponding to standard comfort conditions. Mainstream energy conservation measures include system maintenance, switching to more efficient systems, reducing heat losses and installing controls. This information is then used to derive empirical adaptation factors for bridging the gap between the calculated and actual energy use, making more realistic estimates of the expected energy savings following building renovations, setting prudent targets for energy efficiency and developing effective plans toward a decarbonized building stock. © 2021 by the authors.

An imbalance in the pattern of green spaces leads to an inequality of the benefits of such spaces. Given the current situation of environmental problems and the basic geographical conditions of Xi’an City, this study evaluated and mapped four kinds of ecosystem services from the perspective of equity: biodiversity, carbon sequestration, air purification, and climate regulation. Regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning (REDCAP) was used to obtain the partition groups of ecosystem services. The results indicate that first, the complexity of the urban green space community is low, and the level of biodiversity needs to be improved. The dry deposition flux of particulate matter (PM2.5) decreases from north to south, and green spaces enhance the adsorption of PM2.5. Carbon sequestration in the south and east is higher than that in the north and west, respectively. The average surface temperature in green spaces is lower than that in other urban areas. Second, urban green space resources in the study area are unevenly distributed. Therefore, ecosystem services in different areas are inequitable. Finally, based on the regionalization of integrated ecosystem services, an ecosystem services cluster was developed. This included 913 grid spaces, 12 partitions, and 5 clusters, which can provide a reference for distinct levels of ecosystem services management. This can assist urban managers who can use these indicators of ecosystem service levels for planning and guiding the overall development pattern of green spaces. The benefits would be a maximization of the ecological functions of green spaces, an improvement of the sustainable development of the city, and an improvement of people’s well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

The state of the art in transformer thermal limits are Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR). DTR can be based on two temperature limits: either a design temperature or maximal-permissible temperature. However, many papers estimate DTR with the design temperature only. Therefore, the true DTR is still underestimated since temperature limit is ignored as well as current limits (in some papers). Moreover, many papers rely on the conservative assumption of typical historical load profile or net load profile (considering the distributed generation, storage, electric vehicles). However, modern DSO can control the shape of (net) load profile. This can make a DTR estimation, assuming some typical (net) load profile, valuable only for a particular shape of (net) load profile but not for its modifications. This paper suggests a DTR feasible region which is constructed from current and temperature limitations and does not rely on typical load profiles. As a case study, we investigate DTR in cold and warm climates: one case in Russia with a continental climate and another in France with a temperate climate. In these climates, we assess DTR for the most common combinations of current and temperature limitations, used in standards and literature. As a result, DTR can ensure an additional capacity up to 45%. DTR, based on temperature limits, are 100% of time higher than nominal rating. Moreover, the limiting factors of DTR are quantified based on analysis of 34-year ambient temperature data. Finally, comprehensive recommendations for transformer overloading are formulated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity; Current limit; Dynamic thermal rating; Limiting factor; Temperature limit; Transformer","Digital instruments; Digital storage; Continental climate; Design temperature; Dynamic thermal ratings (DTR); Temperature limitation; Temperature limits; Transformer overloading; Transformer ratings; Typical load profile; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101235827

More specifically, long-living anticyclonic Loop Current eddies (LCEs) are shed episodically from the Loop Current and propagate westward. This study addresses the biogeochemical response of the LCEs to seasonal forcing and show their role in driving phytoplankton biomass distribution in the GoM. Using an eddy resolving (1/12g)interannual regional simulation, it is shown that the LCEs foster a large biomass increase in winter in the upper ocean. It is based on the coupled physical-biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES (Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean and Pelagic Interaction Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies) that yields a realistic representation of the surface chlorophyll distribution. The primary production in the LCEs is larger than the average rate in the surrounding open waters of the GoM. This behavior cannot be directly identified from surface chlorophyll distribution alone since LCEs are associated with a negative surface chlorophyll anomaly all year long. This anomalous biomass increase in the LCEs is explained by the mixed-layer response to winter convective mixing that reaches deeper and nutrient-richer waters. © 2021 Pierre Damien et al.",,"chlorophyll; convection; mesoscale eddy; numerical model; oligotrophic environment; satellite imagery; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111108994

This paper describes a mixed methods evaluation of a large quality improvement (QI) programme that provides skills training and facilitated support to staff in 29 care homes across two localities in the West Midlands, UK. The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) is used to assess changes to care home safety climate between baseline and programme end at 24 months. We use routinely collected data to assess pre-and post-programme avoidable harms and hospital attendance/admission rates. Semi-structured interviews with programme managers (n = 18), and staff (n = 49) in four case study homes are also used to assess perspectives on programme implementation. Our results show that safety climate scores increase by 1.4 points. There are significant reductions in falls (p = 0.0006), severe pressure ulcers (p = 0.014), UTIs (p = 0.001) and ‘any’ events (p = 0.0003). Emergency hospital attendances reduced, but admissions increased. Interview participants report improvements to teamwork, working practices, information sharing, knowledge and skills. Upskilling care home staff can improve working practices and attitudes towards resident safety and care quality, which may be associated with significant reductions in avoidable harms rates. Care staff turnover rates are high, which may impact the potential for longer-term sustainability of the changes observed. © 2021 by the authors.

These calculations must be simple and, consequently, the effects of management practices and environmental conditions are only crudely represented in the calculations. The intention of this review is to develop a detailed understanding necessary for developing accurate models for calculating CH4 emission from liquid manure, with particular focus on the microbiological conversion of organic matter to CH4. Themes discussed are (a) the liquid manure environment; (b) methane production processes from a modeling perspective; (c) development and adaptation of methanogenic communities; (d) mass and electron conservation; (e) steps limiting CH4 production; (f) inhibition of methanogens; (g) temperature effects on CH4 production; and (h) limits of existing estimation approaches. We conclude that a model must include calculation of microbial response to variations in manure temperature, substrate availability and age, and management system, because these variables substantially affect CH4 production. Methane production can be reduced by manipulating key variables through management procedures, and the effects may be taken into account by including a microbial component in the model. When developing new calculation procedures, it is important to include reasonably accurate algorithms of microbial adaptation. This review presents concepts for these calculations and ideas for how these may be carried out. A need for better quantification of hydrolysis kinetics is identified, and the importance of short- and long-term microbial adaptation is highlighted. © 2021 The Authors.

Climate change threatens to exacerbate these through further disruption of the physical environment, and a transition away from the fossil fuels on which many of the region's economies depend. Through their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement, all SSA countries committed to the increased utilisation of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES) to tackle the twin challenges of energy poverty - which limits economic development - and climate change. There is a dearth of analysis on the nature of sustainable energy transition(s) necessary to deliver these NDCs, especially given the limited financial and technical resources of SSA. Using Nigeria as a case study, this study seeks to address this gap by determining the power system transitions required to deliver NDCs alongside universal energy access in SSA by 2050; their financial and policy implications; and the barriers and opportunities that they present to sustainable development efforts. We find that Nigeria can deliver its NDCs with no added cost implications, thereby debunking the prevalent view that climate change mitigation is too costly to pursue in SSA. Furthermore, we find that the higher availability and dispatchability of fossil fuel generation makes it critical for the rapid scale-up of energy supply; thus, entirely leapfrogging carbon-intensive development will prove costly to SSA. Finally, owing to the limited cost reductions that IRES have experienced in SSA, delivering NDCs through the deployment of decentralised IRES systems proves more expensive than using conventional generation. The distributed nature of IRES however means that they can democratise energy investment and job creation, thus facilitating the equitable sharing of economic resources which is crucial to conflict prevention in the fragile socio-political landscapes that pervade the region. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Cost reduction; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Investments; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Climate variability; Conflict prevention; Conventional generation; Low-carbon electricities; Physical environments; Renewable energy source; Technical resources; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; commodity price; COVID-19; economic development; electricity; emission control; energy resource; environmental economics; fossil fuel; international agreement; livelihood; natural resource; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110791920

In a climate change scenario, the Mediterranean region is facing more frequent water scarcity periods, and urban water reuse can be a solution, at least for supplying some non-potable water uses. In this context, the performance of urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is of utter importance, to produce environmentally safe treated water while reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions (CE). Activated sludge is the biological process most widely used in wastewater treatment and requires aeration systems in order to promote the oxidation of organic matter and ammonia. It is known that the energy consumed in the aeration processes is of major importance for the global WWTP CE. This study was carried out in a WWTP in southern Portugal, wherein an aeration control system that responds in real time to ammonia and nitrate concentrations was tested. The system is set to optimize the duration of the aerated and non-aerated periods, for nitrification and denitrification. During the experimental period, BOD, COD, Escherichia coli, TN and TP were monitored in the treated effluent, in order to verify the quality standards that allow its reuse. The aeration control system contributed to a decrease of about 13% of the specific energy consumption, when compared with the corresponding period in previous years, representing a CE reduction of about 1.2 t CO2 eq, during the experimental period. The treated effluent maintained its high quality standards and can be used, for example, in agricultural irrigation of local crops. Aeration control systems reacting in real time can have an important role to decrease CE of urban WWTPs; however, further research is needed, including more WWTPs and analyzing seasonal variations in energy consumption over the year. © 2021 WIT Press.","Aeration control; Carbon emissions; Energy; Urban wastewater treatment; Water reuse",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112195386

Sensitivity tests are conducted to analyze ozone sensitivity to its precursors, and to develop emission reduction measures. The results suggest that the model can accurately simulate the compound pollution process of photochemistry and haze. When VOCs and NOx were reduced by the same proportion, the effect of O3 reduction at peak time was more obvious, and the effect during daytime was more significant than at night. The degree of change in ozone was peak time &gt; daytime average. When reducing or increasing the ratio of precursors by 25% at the same time, the effect of reducing 25% VOCs on the average ozone concentration reduction was most significant. The degree of change in ozone decreased with increasing altitude, the location of the ozone maximum change shifted westward, and its range narrowed. As the altitude increases, the VOCs-limited zone decreases, VOCs sensitivity decreases, NOx sensitivity increases. The controlled area changed from near-surface VOCs-limited to high-altitude NOx-limited. Upon examining the EKMA curve, we have found that suburban and urban are sensitive to VOCs. The sensitivity tests indicate that when VOCs in suburban are reduced about 60%, the O3-1h concentration could reach the standard, and when VOCs of the urban decreased by about 50%, the O3-1h concentration could reach the standard. Thus, these findings could provide references for the control of compound air pollution in Beijing. © 2021, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beijing; EKMA; Ozone (O3); Sensitivity of ozone to its precursors; WRF-Chem model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105552249

To date, European institutions have promulgated a series of environmental regulations and directives aimed at promoting and imposing adoption by member states of internal regulations. This paper is focused on Western Europe, and it explores, for each state under analysis, energy policies adopted, the results achieved and recommendations for the future growth of renewable energy. The results show that in countries where energy policy is not fragmented, the yield in renewable energies has been higher, and also in the states where more and various forms of subsidies are foreseen, growth seems to be greater. Finally, the paper provides useful recommendations and future policy implications for states that have not met the 2020 targets. © 2021 by the authors.

O3 is a secondary pollutant with adverse effects on population health and ecosystems and with negative impacts on climate, acting as greenhouse gas. Most of these studies focused on spring 2020 (i.e. March-May) and on observations in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), mostly in the vicinity of urban agglomerates. Here, we analyzed the variability of O3 above the PBL of northern Italy in 2020 by using continuous observations carried out at a high mountain WMO/GAW global station in Italy (Mt. Cimone-CMN; 44°12′ N, 10°42′ E, 2165 m a.s.l.). Low O3 monthly anomalies were observed during spring (MAM) and summer (JJA), when periods of low O3 intertwined with periods with higher O3, within climatological ranges. A similar variability was observed for O3 precursors like NO2 and 15 anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic carbons, but the systematic O3 anomalies were not reflected in these variables. The analysis of meteorological variables and diel O3 cycles did not suggest major changes in the vertical transport related to the thermal circulation system in the mountain area. The analysis of five days back-trajectories suggested that the observed O3 anomalies cannot be explained by differences in the synoptic-scale circulation with respect to the previous years alone. On the other hand, the characterization of two transport patterns (i.e. air masses from the regional PBL or from the free troposphere) and the analysis of back-trajectories suggested an important contribution of transport from the continental PBL during the periods with the lowest O3 at CMN. When proxies of air mass transport from the regional PBL are considered, a lower NO x content was pointed out with respect to the previous years, suggesting a lower O3 production in a NO x -limited atmosphere. Our study suggested for the first time that, during MAM and JJA 2020, the reduced anthropogenic emissions related to the COVID-19 restrictions lowered the amount of this short-lived climate forcer/pollutant at remote locations above the PBL over northern Italy. This work suggests the importance of limiting anthropogenic precursor emissions for decreasing the O3 amount at remote locations and in upper atmospheric layers. © 2021 The Author(s).

To aid the understanding of how urbanisation has influenced anthropogenic CO2 and air pollutant emissions across all world regions, we make use of the latest developments of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. In this study, we systematically analyse over 5 decades of emissions from different types of human settlements (from urban centres to rural areas) for different sectors in all countries. Our analysis shows that by 2015, urban centres were the source of a third of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases and most of the air pollutant emissions. The high levels of both population and emissions in urban centres therefore call for focused urban mitigation efforts. Moreover, despite the overall increase in urban emissions, megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants in high-income countries have been reducing their emissions, while emissions in developing regions are still growing. We further discuss per capita emissions to compare different types of urban centres at the global level. © 2021 The Author(s).

Here, we report a novel approach to responsive luminescent Tb(iii) probes that involves direct modulation of the antenna excited triplet state energy. If the triplet energy lies too close to the5D4Tb(iii) excited state (20 500 cm−1), energy transfer to5D4competes with back energy transfer processes and limits lanthanide-based emission. To validate this approach, a series of pyridyl-functionalized, macrocyclic lanthanide complexes were designed, and the corresponding lowest energy triplet states were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). Subsequently, three novel constructsL3(nitro-pyridyl),L4(amino-pyridyl) andL5(fluoro-pyridyl) were synthesized.

Building on the success of STARE2, we will search for fast radio bursts emitted from Galactic magnetars as well as bursts from nearby galaxies. GReX will search down to ∼ ten microseconds time resolution, allowing us to find new super giant radio pulses from Milky Way pulsars and study their broadband emission. The proposed instrument will employ ultra-wide band (0.7–2 GHz) feeds coupled to a high-performance (receiver temperature <10 K) low noise amplifier originally developed for the DSA-110 and DSA-2000 projects. In GReX Phase I (GReX-I), unit systems will be deployed at Owens Valley Radio Observatory and Big Smoky Valley, Nevada. Phase II will expand the array, placing feeds in India, Australia, and elsewhere in order to build up to continuous coverage of nearly 4π steradians and to increase our exposure to the Galactic plane. We model the local magnetar population to forecast for GReX, finding the improved sensitivity and increased exposure to the Galactic plane could lead to dozens of FRB-like bursts per year. © 2021.

However, LIB performance at low temperature (LT) extremes of EV operation (typically −40 to 0 °C) suffers from a reduced output and diminished cycle life. LT cycling increases cell impedance, diminishing Li ion diffusion through the cell, exacerbating electrode polarisation, and hindering interfacial Li+desolvation. Herein, we present a comprehensive review of (i) the factors that influence LT Li-ion performance, (ii) outline the shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art and (iii) discuss recent findings in the field, focusing on alternative anode materials with particular emphasis on high-capacity, fast charging alternatives to the archetypal carbon (graphite) anode. Different approaches to improve LT LIB performance are outlined in an in-depth analysis of recent improvements from the anode perspective.

Small and distributed power generators are preferred to the classical centralized and sizeable ones. Accordingly, this fact led to a new way to think and design distributions grids. One of the challenges is to handle bidirectional power flow at the distribution substations transformer from and to the national transportation grid. The aim of this paper is to review and analyze the different mathematical methods to design the architecture of a distribution grid and the state of the art of the technologies used to produce and eventually store or convert, in different energy carriers, electricity produced by renewable energy sources, coping with the aleatory of these sources. © 2021 by the authors.

This is necessary for providing policy-makers and other stakeholders with reliable atmospheric projections as well as information about changes in chemical species as a consequence of climate change. The regional climate model (RCM), RegCM4 is a community model which contains only one gas-phase mechanism module (CBM-Z) that includes the formation, deposition, and transport of a number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this paper, the CB6-C, a new gas-phase mechanism module, is combined with RegCM4 to produce a larger suite of VOCs and chemical mechanisms for important anthropogenic and biogenic species, most notably benzene, terpenes, acetylene and their corresponding oxidation products. In order to evaluate this new module, climatologies of the CB6-C and CBM-Z simulations are compared to gridded and station data. The results reveal the two schemes to be similar with some improvement of surface carbon monoxide and tropospheric ozone in the CB6-C. However, organic products were found to be under-predicted for both schemes, suggesting the need of more development in the implementation of atmospheric chemistry in RegCM4. Despite its limitations, the input conditions (emissions and boundary conditions) are easy to modify, making the new gas-phase scheme an important advancement in the modelling of atmospheric chemistry within a RCM, as it provides a pathway for new research that may eventually help health studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CB6-C; Gas-phase; RegCM4; Regional climate modelling","atmospheric chemistry; climate modeling; gas phase reaction; policy making; regional climate; volatile organic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102963472

Mounting evidence from attribution research suggests that such extremes become more frequent and intense in a warming climate. Although most studies consider extreme events in specific months or seasons, here we investigate for the first time how extremes of the wettest day of the year may be influenced by anthropogenic forcings. Data from large multimodel ensembles indicate that the moderate historical trend towards wetter conditions will emerge more strongly in coming decades, while a notable anthropogenic influence on the variability of the wettest day may be identified as early as the 1900s. Experiments with different forcings are employed to estimate the changing probability of extremes due to anthropogenic climate change in a risk-based attribution framework. We introduce a new methodology of estimating probabilities of extremes in the present and future that calibrates data from long simulations of the preindustrial climate to the mean state and variability of the reference climatic period. The new approach utilises larger samples of rainfall data than alternative methods, which is a major advantage when analysing extremely rare events. The record rainfall of the wettest day in year 2020 is estimated to have become about 2.5 times more likely because of human influence, while its return time, currently about 100 years, will decrease to only about 30 years by 2100. Compared to a hypothetical natural climate, we estimate a 10-fold increase in the chances of such extreme rainfall events in the United Kingdom by the end of this century, which underlines the need for effective adaptation planning. © 2021 Crown copyright.

The goal of the analysis is to forecast potential (2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100 AC) rainfall and land use and land cover (LULC) with the aid of the CSIRO-MK3.6.0 General circulation models (GCMs) climatic model and the dynamic conversion of land use and its effects (Dyna-CLUE) model. The purpose of this work is to produce landslide susceptibility map (LSM) of potential cycles correlated with expected rainfall and LULC data utilizing the binary logistic regression (BLR) models in the Upper Rangit River basin of eastern Himalayan region, India. Including rainfall and LULC total nineteen factors have been incorporated, these are mainly topographical, hydrological, geological, and environmental factors. A total 671 landslide locations have been mapped which divided randomly as training (70%) and validation (30%) datasets of LSM. Current (2018) LSM was validated by 30% of landslide inventory location and the result of area under curve of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) indicated that the LSM has 92.4% and 89.6% of the success and prediction rate respectively. To demonstrate the accuracy of the BLR landslide susceptibility (LS) model, this model was used to generated future LSMs based on projected of rainfall and LULC. The result of projected representative concentration pathway (RCP)-based rainfall depicted that the increasing trend of rainfall in the future period and the moderate to very high LS zones has also increased from 2040 to 2100. This study will be used to further study of landslide hazard (LH) studies with climatic approaches, and will also contribute to regional planning and development of current and future Upper Rangit River basin. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","BLR;; Climate change; Dyna-CLUE;; GCM;; Landslide;","Forecasting; Land use; Logistic regression; Rain; Regional planning; Watersheds; Binary logistic regression; Environmental factors; General circulation model; Land use and land cover; Landslide susceptibility; Landslide susceptibility assessments; Planning and development; Receiver operating characteristics; Landslides; climate change; general circulation model; hazard assessment; land use; landslide; prediction; rainfall; Himalayas; India; Rangit River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105407934

This study examines trends in PM10 (i.e., a particulate matter with the aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 μm) mass concentrations for South Korea with respect to the East Asian atmospheric variability due to climate warming. The PM10 mass concentrations were used by the nationwide monitoring network of the Korean Ministry of Environment (KME) over the two-decade period of 1999–2018. Annual PM10 in South Korea was found to decrease to −0.61±0.08 μg m−3 yr−1 over the two decades of 1999–2018. Such an overall decrease was more associated with a decreasing trend during spring and summer than during other seasons. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of wind speed at 850 hPa accounted for the spatial structure wherein the decrease of wind speeds in Mongolia and China was consistent with those in South Korea during the spring season. Furthermore, the next highest PM10 reduction rate during the stagnant and humid summer period was caused by a warmer air mass over the northwest Pacific Ocean. In eastern China, the annual aerosol optical depth (AOD) reflected by primary and secondary particulate matters showed high values and increased to 0.01 (r2=0.60) for the period of 2000–2013. However, annual AOD values increased negligibly in the Yellow Sea and the Korean Peninsula due more likely to decreasing wind speeds from eastern China. The policy limiting emissions in China since 2014 as well as continuous efforts to reduce air pollution in South Korea affected the AOD decreasing trend. Therefore, the reduced transport and local emissions most likely explain the sharp decreasing trends of PM10 in South Korea during the recent 5-year period of 2014–2018. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Atmospheric variability; Empirical orthogonal function; Energy supply and emission; PM10 trend; Warming in East Asia","aerosol; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; wind velocity; China; Korea; Mongolia; Pacific Ocean; South Korea; Yellow Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101741360

Here, a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations is performed for thin films of 1) the neat 4CzIPN TADF emitter and 2) the (guest–host) 4CzIPN:mCBP system, in order to determine how guest–guest and guest–host interactions influence the morphological, electronic, and luminescence properties of the TADF emitters. The red-shift in emission recently observed experimentally upon increasing the concentration in TADF emitters is attributed to the formation of guest–guest, i.e., dimer, intermolecular charge-transfer states. It is found that the radiative and reverse intersystem crossing rates associated with these dimer states are similar to those of monomers. Thus, the contributions from both the dimer and monomer states need to be considered to describe TADF within the emissive layer.

In fact, ensuring energy security in the western kingdom is placing a heavy burden on economic balances, while generating many environmental impacts and social discrepancies. The local government has been striving to reduce its GHG emissions coming mainly from activities related to the field of energy harvesting. The current research work aims to evaluate technical, economic, social, and environmental impacts of the ongoing transition toward renewable energy (RE) deployment in Morocco. We used the system dynamics approach in order to study different interactions of the components of the Moroccan electricity sector and their behaviors on this complex system under various scenarios. The results showed that 35 MtCO2 of avoided emissions can be ensured up to 2030 if renewable installed capacity reaches 15.72 GW by the same year. On the other hand, demand is estimated to be reduced by almost 30 TWh if robust measures were taken turning the country into an electricity exporter of up to 8.67 TWh by 2030. Finally, while research and development activities are expected to decrease RE plants construction costs by almost 700 million USD, nearly 448.986 renewable jobs can be created by 2030. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","electricity sector; energy transition; GHG emissions; Morocco; renewable energy; system dynamics","Electric industry; Energy harvesting; Energy policy; Energy security; Greenhouse gases; System theory; Avoided emissions; Construction costs; Electricity exporters; Electricity sector; Installed capacity; Renewable energies; Research and development; System dynamics approach; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097881938

An anoxic/aerobic (AO) process, AO coupled with anaerobic SR and AO coupled with alternating aerobic/anaerobic side-stream reactor (AO-OASR) were operated to investigate enhancing effects of alternative aerobic and anaerobic condition (AltOA) in SR on sludge reduction and pollutants removal performance. The AltOA was firstly proposed into SR with a low HRT during the long-term continuous operation. The results showed that AO-OASR presented a lower effluent COD concentration (29.6%) with no adverse effect on nitrogen removal, compared to AO, owing to the intensified refractory carbon reuse in the mainstream aerobic tank. The sludge yield in AO-OASR (0.240 g SS/g COD) was 39.7% lower than that in AO. The OASR accelerated sludge lysis and particle organic matter hydrolysis due to the weakened network strength of flocs, leading to an enhanced increase (17.3 mg/L) of dissolved organic matter (DOM), especially for the fraction of molecular weight (MW) < 25 kDa. The OASR reduced the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content for heterotrophic anabolism in the mainstream reactor by 42.9%, compared to the ASR. MW < 25 kDa of DOM caused the disturbance of oxidative phosphorylation with a decreasing ATP synthase activity under high-level electronic transport system, leading to ATP dissipation. The cooperation interaction of predator (norank_Chitinophagales), hydrolytic/fermentative bacteria (unclassified_Bacteroidia and Delftia), and slow grower (Trichococcus) played a key role in improving the sludge reduction and carbon reuse in AO-OASR. The results provided an efficient and cost-saving technology for sludge reduction with modified SR under low HRT, which is meaningful to overcome the present bottleneck of deficient reduction efficiency for application in wastewater treatment plants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated sludge; Alternating aerobic/anaerobic side-stream reactor; in-situ sludge reduction; Microbial community; Molecular weight","Activated sludge process; Adenosinetriphosphate; Anoxic water; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Efficiency; Effluents; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater treatment; Activated sludge; Adenosine triphosphate; Alternating aerobic/anerobic side-stream reactor; Anoxic-aerobic process; Hydraulic retention; In-situ sludge reduction; Microbial communities; Retention time; Side streams; Sludge reduction; Molecular weight; adenosine triphosphate; dissolved organic matter; particulate organic matter; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; nitrogen; activated sludge; anoxic conditions; bioreactor; microbial activity; oxic conditions; performance assessment; reduction; Article; bacterium; Bacteroidia; biosynthesis; carbon source; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; Delftia; effluent; enzyme activity; heterotrophic anabolism; hydrolysis; in situ sludge reduction; lysis; microbial community; molecular weight; nonhuman; organismal interaction; oxidative phosphorylation; predator; sludge; sludge reduction; sludge yield; taxonomy; Trichococcus; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; sewage; Delftia; Trichococcus; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Nitrogen; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101987988

This study explores the “weak” version of the Porter hypothesis while focusing on listed companies in 31 provinces (municipalities or autonomous regions) from 1990 to 2018. In this study, we provided preliminary evidence on the influence of China's carbon emission trading scheme pilot policy on green innovation based on green patent data. Results show that the “weak” Porter hypothesis has not been realized in the current carbon trading market of China. Moreover, the pilot policy has significantly decreased the proportion of green patents by approximately 9.26%. Then, we find that the pilot policy has an evident lagging effect on restraining the green innovation of enterprises. Furthermore, inhibition is more pronounced among the samples of small-scale, manufacturing, and non-state-owned companies, including companies in the eastern and central regions. Most importantly, companies mainly choose to reduce output rather than increase green technological innovation to achieve their emission reduction targets. Moreover, companies reduce their investment in research and development because of the reduction in cash flow and expected income, which is not conducive to green innovation. © 2021","Carbon emission mitigation; China's ETS pilot policy; Difference-in-difference-in-differences; Green innovation; Green patent for listed companies","Carbon; Climate change; Patents and inventions; Carbon emission mitigation; Carbon emission trading; China ETS pilot policy; Climate change mitigation; Difference-in-difference-in-difference; Emission trading systems; Emissions Trading Scheme; Green innovations; Green patent for listed company; Porter hypothesis; Emission control; emissions trading; entrepreneur; environmental economics; innovation; intellectual property rights; pollution policy; research and development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102902198

But the late rice is damaged frequently by 'Cold Dew Wind' (CDW) chilling damage, which is caused by the low temperature in late rice's heading and flowering stage. At this time, once the temperature is below the low limits of the optimal temperature of paddy rice, it will cause empty shells and crusts, leading to yield reduction. This paper proposed a novel integrated framework to map the damage extent of CDW in Jiangxi Province, China to late rice from 2005 to 2018. Firstly, the daily mean air temperatures were estimated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) products, the altitude information from Digital Elevation Model (DEM), MODIS Land Cover products and air temperature measurements at meteorological stations located in the Jiangxi Province from 2005 to 2018. Then all-weather and fully covered daily average temperature time series were constructed by employing multi-platform merging and temporal fusion. Meanwhile, late rice planting areas were identified based on the seasonal profiles of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and map errors from 2005 to 2016 at provincial scales were no more than 7.50%. Paddy rice growth characteristics were combined with EVI and LSWI to identify heading and flowering stages. Finally, the time series of daily mean air temperatures, paddy rice phenology information and planting area were used to estimate the rice crop area damaged by the CDW for late rice. The results show that from 2005 to 2018, the two years most affected by CDW were 2006 and 2011. The damaged areas in the study area were 89,691.99 hectares and 36,614.23 hectares, respectively, accounting for 6.38% and 2.34% of the total planted area of late rice. According to the duration of CDW, the disaster degree is divided into three levels: mild, moderate and severe. The range of disasters was the widest in 2006, but the area of mild disaster accounted for 93.12% of the total disaster area. The area affected in 2011 was second only to 2006, but the severely affected area accounted for 70.26% of the total affected area. These results indicate this paper realized the estimation of the late rice area affected by CDW, the assessment of the disaster level, and the spatial distribution map production of the damaged area and disaster level in the study area. © 2021 IEEE.","Cold Dew Wind; daily mean air temperature; Jiangxi; late paddy rice; MODIS","Atmospheric temperature; Charge density waves; Cold heading; Disasters; Forestry; Radiometers; Spectrometers; Surface measurement; Surface waters; Surveying; Temperature measurement; Time series; Air temperature measurement; Digital elevation model; Enhanced vegetation index; Land surface water index; Meteorological station; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Spatial distribution map; Land surface temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115787486

However, NOx controls resulted in shift of O3 chemical regimes over NCP and YRD, with turning points between NOx- and volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regimes around 2019, while model simulations suggest transitional or NOx-limited regimes over the rest of China. The impacts of high fine particles (PM2.5) on O3 formation has declined because of the reduction of PM2.5 concentrations.

Diatoms are an important group of ubiquitous and diverse algae in peatlands. Until now, the responses of diatom communities to climate variability have rarely been explored in peatlands, especially in subtropical regions. In this study, monitoring and paleolimnological datasets were combined to decipher environmental changes of a subtropical montane peatland (central China) over the last two centuries. Seasonal monitoring data revealed that diatom communities were closely correlated with precipitation, depth to the water table, conductivity, nitrate and temperature. Sedimentary records revealed that temporal changes in diatom assemblages and geochemical elements displayed similar trends in two peat cores after the 1950s. The first gradient in diatom composition represented a shift from Pinnularia species to taxa preferring less-acidic habitats, which was closely linked to climate warming and the enrichment of inorganic elements (e.g. sodium and calcium) since the early 20th century. Meanwhile, changes in diatom communities were further related to precipitation variability, atmospheric deposition and local hydrogeomophic setting. Taken together, the succession of diatom communities was closely linked to climate-regulated availability of nutrients and moisture in this subtropical peatland over the last two centuries. In order to achieve sustainable management of these scarce peatlands, further biological monitoring and paleoecological studies are needed to improve our knowledge of peatland ecosystem evolution in response to future climate change. © The Author(s) 2021.","central China; climate warming; diatom; late-Holocene; paleoecology; subtropical peatland","carbon cycle; climate change; climate variation; community response; diatom; environmental change; historical record; mountain environment; paleoecology; paleolimnology; peatland; subtropical region; China; Bacillariophyta; Pinnularia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103200308

However, most of current China's ammonia emissions inventories are annual emissions, lack of spatial and temporal information, which is a gap for governments to make effective and practical policies in terms of controlling road traffic pollution. In this study, based on the built MOVES-Beijing Model, the ammonia emission factors of eight types of vehicle in Beijing, including passenger car (PC), TAXI, middle-duty vehicle (MDV), heavy-duty vehicle (HDV), light-duty truck (LDT), middle-duty gasoline truck (MDGT); middle-duty diesel truck (MDDT) and heavy-duty truck (HDT), were obtained. And through the modified local speed-flow model, the traffic flow was obtained acquisitively with the average speed data of the main roads in Beijing. The road length data were obtained according to the ranging function in the Gaode map and the status of Beijing. Then the high spatial and temporal ammonia emission inventory in Beijing was achieved. The results showed the order of ammonia emission factors (EFs) for different types of vehicles was MDGT &gt; HDV &gt; MDDT &gt; HDT &gt; LDT &gt; TAXI &gt; MDV &gt; PC, and ammonia EFs were the lowest when the vehicle speed was around 48 km/h. Total ammonia emissions on weekdays were slightly higher than on weekends, but were not significant, although there are restrictions during the week. And ammonia emissions from ordinary roads were the highest among the three types of roads, including highways and urban expressways. Due to heavy traffic, ammonia emissions were highest during peak 1 periods. PC's ammonia emissions were 68% due to its larger population. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia emissions; Beijing; High temporal and spatial resolution; Vehicles","Air pollution; Roads and streets; Taxicabs; Trucks; Ammonia emissions; Beijing; Duty vehicles; Emission factors; Emission inventories; High spatial resolution; High temporal resolution; Road traffic; Temporal and spatial; Traffic pollution; Ammonia; ammonia; aerodynamics; ammonia; emission inventory; particle size; particulate matter; road; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; urban pollution; Article; China; exhaust gas; government; highway; mathematical model; motor vehicle; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; public policy; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; time factor; traffic; traffic pollution; uncertainty; urban area; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106232407

As the vulnerability to global warming is regionally dependent, this study assesses the effects of 0.5 °C less global warming on climate extremes in the United States. Eight climate extreme indices are calculated based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—phase 5 (CMIP5), and North American—Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiments (NA-CORDEX) with and without bias correction. We evaluate the projected changes in temperature and precipitation extremes, and examine their differences between the 1.5 and 2 °C warming targets. Under a warming climate, both CMIP5 and NA-CORDEX show intensified heat extremes and reduced cold extremes across the country, intensified and more frequent heavy precipitation in large areas of the North, prolonged dry spells in some regions of the West, South, and Midwest, and more frequent drought events in the West. Results suggest that the 0.5 °C less global warming would avoid the intensification of climate extremes by 32–46% (35–42%) for heat extremes intensity (frequency) across the country and, by 23–41% for heavy precipitation intensity in the North, South, and Southeast. The changes in annual heavy precipitation intensity are mainly contributed by winter and spring. However, impacts of the limited warming on the frequency of heavy precipitation, dry spell, and drought frequency are only evident in a few regions. Although uncertainties are found among the climate models and emission scenarios, our results highlight the benefits of limiting warming at 1.5 °C in order to reduce the risks of climate extremes associated with global warming. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"air temperature; drought; extreme event; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; precipitation (climatology); Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102880455

In this study, we utilized machine learning approaches to model International Toxic Equivalent Quality (I-TEQ) values of PCDD/Fs through chlorobenzene (CBz). Sampled data from a MSWI with a grate furnace and three MSWIs with fluidized bed furnaces were randomly divided into the training and test set. A two-step data preprocessing consists of Box-Cox transformation and standardization was applied to improve the model performances. The models including artificial neural network (ANN) and decision tree (DT). With the help of bagging, ANN and DT were stacked into bagging-based ensemble neural networks (BGNN) and random forest (RF) to improve the accuracy and robustness. BGNN was proved to be the best model with the relatively good perfomance in the test set. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method was employed to improve the interpretability of BGNN. The results show that 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (TrCBz), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (DiCBz), 1,2,4-TrCBz, and 1,3-DiCBz make positive contributions to I-TEQ values. Employing machine learning models, particularly BGNN, can be an effective method to determine the emission of PCDD/Fs within a wide range of I-TEQ values and in multiple MSWIs with strong generalization ability. It is helpful to realize the on-line measurement and controlling of PCDD/Fs emission. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chlorobenzene (CBz); Data preprocessing; Machine learning; Model interpretation; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs)","Decision trees; Fluidized bed furnaces; Fluidized beds; Machine learning; Metadata; Metropolitan area networks; Neural networks; Organic pollutants; Particulate emissions; Refuse incinerators; Waste incineration; Ensemble learning approach; Ensemble neural network; Generalization ability; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Municipal solid waste incinerator; Polychlorinated dibenzo- p - dioxins; Polychlorinated dibenzofurans; Municipal solid waste; 1,2 dichlorobenzene; 1,2,3 trichlorobenzene; 1,4 dichlorobenzene; chlorobenzene; dioxin; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; benzofuran derivative; dibenzofuran; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; artificial neural network; chlorobenzene; ensemble forecasting; incineration; learning; machine learning; municipal solid waste; PCDD; PCDF; solid waste; standardization; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation neural network; carbon footprint; decision tree; feed forward neural network; furnace; incineration; machine learning; municipal solid waste; pollutant; random forest; solid waste management; standardization; task performance; temperature; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; machine learning; solid waste; Air Pollutants; Benzofurans; Dibenzofurans; Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated; Environmental Monitoring; Incineration; Machine Learning; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100373998

The addition of organic liquid wastes (domestic sewage and plant straw hydrolysation broth) stimulated biogenic sulfate reduction after 40 d of adaptation to effectively remove multiple heavy metals in the MIW. The microbial community compositions were prominently regulated by organic carbon, with desirable communities dominated by Cellulomonas and Desulfobulbus formed in the CWs for MIW biotreatment.

As one of the largest contributors to global CO2 emissions, the construction industry plays a significant role in combating global warming and achieving sustainable development. This study aimed to compare the CO2 emissions in the construction industry around the world and analyze the drivers of the differences in construction emission intensities between regions in 2009 using the multiregional input–output model and structural decomposition analysis model, respectively. The results show that China, India, the USA, Russia, and Japan were the largest five construction CO2 emitters. The above five regions, especially China and Russia, had much greater construction emission intensities than the UK, which had the smallest intensity. The findings also demonstrate that the production structure effect was the largest driver enlarging the intensity differences between China and the UK, between India and the UK, between Russia and the UK, and between Japan and the UK, contributing 93.1%, 96.6%, 65.6%, and 85.3% of the differences, respectively. The energy intensity effect dominated the emission intensity difference between the USA and the UK, representing 101.6% of the difference. The top three contributors to the above effects were domestic industries except the production structure effect on the difference between Japan and the UK. This study can help policymakers better understand the disparities of CO2 emissions in the construction industry around the world and thus formulate effective policies to mitigate the emissions. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","carbon emissions; construction industry; input–output analysis; international comparison; sustainable development","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; construction industry; global warming; input-output analysis; sustainable development; China; India; Japan; Russian Federation; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101428471

However, what if the agents are somewhat selfish and act more as entities in a market economy? Little work has been done to explore this question with systematic technology adoption models. This study explores this question by developing a systematic technology adoption model in which each agent intends to minimize its own total cost with the dynamic trading of technology and goods with others, and a Walrasian auction is performed at every time unit to achieve the dynamic trading equilibrium. By using this model, this paper investigates how the dynamic trading among heterogeneous agents affects the adoption of a new advanced technology as well as the corresponding total cost and carbon emissions of the entire system. The previous studies in this modeling stream rarely used applications with real social and economic backgrounds. This study makes a first step by using the model to analyze how the dynamic trading among different regions influences technology adoption, total system costs, and emissions worldwide. The main finding of the study is that dynamic trading among heterogeneous agents is a cost-effective way to accelerate the adoption of a new advanced technology, and to reduce total carbon emissions. Our study implies that global trading is not only related to the economy itself, but can also contribute to technology development and carbon reductions worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Equilibrium prices and trading volumes; Heterogeneous interacting agents; OR in societal problem analysis; Technology adoption","Carbon; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Pareto principle; Advanced technology; Carbon emissions; Equilibrium price and trading volume; Heterogeneous agents; Heterogeneous interacting agents; Interacting agents; OR in societal problem analysis; Pareto optimal solutions; Technology adoption; Technology adoption models; Costs; carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental economics; equilibrium; heterogeneity; price dynamics; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104680123

However, it remains challenging to regulate the luminescence behaviour of Bi because of the coexistence of multi-centers in the glasses. Here, we successfully regulated multi Bi NIR centers to obtain a flatter and ultra-broadband emission in nitridated germanate glasses. By varying the alkaline earth metal fluorides from MgF2 to BaF2, the glass structures were gradually depolymerized. A looser glass network, on one hand, promoted Bi in lower valences to be oxidized into Bi2+ and Bi3+, thus reducing the NIR emission intensity at ~1150 and ~1260 nm; on the other hand, it also enhanced the energy transfer from Bi+ to Bi0, which resulted in a relatively flatter emission band. In addition, the depolymerised glass structure could facilitate more nitride bonds, which are favorable for dispersing and stabilizing the new Bi NIR active centers related to germanate for ~930 and ~1490 nm emission.

The average mole ratios of VOCs at the three sites were 6.56, 21.33 and 19.62 ppb, respectively, which were lower than those (13.65, 27.72 and 21.38 ppb) after deregulation. The characteristics of the VOCs varied during the different control periods. Synoptic conditions and airmass transport played an important role in the transport and accumulation of VOCs and other pollutants, which affected the control effects. Using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) method in source apportionment, five factors were identified, namely, vehicle exhaust (19.66–31.47%), plants (5.59–17.07%), industrial emissions (13.14–33.82%), fuel vaporization (12.83–26.34%) and solvent usage (17.84–28.95%) for the ZH and YX sites. Factor 4 was identified as fuel vaporization + incomplete combustion (21.69–25.35%) at the DSL site. The Non-parametric Wind Regression (NWR) method showed that regional transport was the main factor influencing the VOC distribution. © 2021 by the authors.

The realization of a low-carbon economy requires improved resource utilization efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. The reasonable location of logistics nodes is of great significance in the optimization of a logistics network. This study formulates a double objective function optimization model of reverse logistics facility location considering the balance between the functional objectives of the carbon emissions and the benefits. A hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm that combines a gravitation algorithm and a particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this reverse logistics facility location model. The mobile phone recycling logistics network in Jilin Province is applied as the case study to verify the feasibility of the proposed reverse logistics facility location model and solution method. Analysis and discussion are conducted to monitor the robustness of the results.

It highlights the roles played in constructing this link by entrepreneurial states and the NGO community in building an ocean-climate bandwagon with the existing processes of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Contrarily to higher latitude EBUSs, there is no consensus yet on the response of upwelling-favorable winds to regional climate change in this region. Global climate models are not able to reproduce the nearshore surface winds, and only a few downscaling studies have been performed by using relatively coarse-grid atmospheric models forced by idealized climate change scenarios. In the present study, the impact of climate change on the PUS upwelling-favorable winds was assessed using a high resolution regional atmospheric model to dynamically downscale the multi-model mean projection of an ensemble of 31 CMIP5 global models under the RCP8.5 worst-case climate scenario. We performed a 10-year retrospective simulation (1994–2003) forced by NCEP2 reanalysis data and a 10-year climate change simulation forced by a climate change forcing (i.e. differences between monthly-mean climatologies for 2080–2100 and 1989–2009) from CMIP5 ensemble added to NCEP2 data. We found that changes in the mean upwelling-favorable winds are weak (less than 0.2 m s−1). Seasonally, summer winds weakly decrease (by 0–5%) whereas winter winds weakly increase (by 0–10%), thus slightly reinforcing the seasonal cycle. A momentum balance shows that the wind changes are mainly driven by the alongshore pressure gradient, except in a local area north of the Paracas peninsula, downstream the main upwelling center, where wind increase in winter is driven by the shoreward advection of offshore momentum. Sensitivity experiments show that the north–south sea surface temperature gradient plays an important role in the wind response along the north and central coasts, superimposed onto the South Pacific Anticyclone large-scale forcing. A reduction (increase) of the gradient induces a wind weakening (strengthening) up to 15% (25%) off the northern coast during summer. This local mechanism is not well represented in global climate models projections, which underlines the strong need for dynamical downscaling of coastal wind in order to study the impact of climate change on the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Ocean–atmosphere interactions; Peruvian upwelling system; Regional climate change; Upwelling-favorable wind","air-sea interaction; atmospheric modeling; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; downscaling; regional climate; upwelling; wind; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101273361

He is a climate analyst at CARBON BRIEF, a nonprofit temperature and climate analysis group. He also states that changes there can help give us an idea of what the rest of the world can expect if we do not reduce the emissions that pollute homes and factories. Because of the high temperatures in GCC countries, the effect of heat stress is very high there, which discourages shoppers and pedestrians from shopping in the open area due to the physical exertion and high risks faced by people and workers. Heat stress peaks in most Arab Gulf countries from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. during the summer season. Heat stress is increasingly an obstacle to economic efficiency in these countries. This work designs and develops a robot that tracks shoppers and provides a cool stream of air directly around them during shopping in open areas to reduce the effect of heat stress. The robot enables us to cool the temperature around customers in the market to increase comfort. In this project, a robot was designed and manufactured to track a specific person and cool the air around him through a cool stream of air generated by the air conditioner installed inside the robot. We used a Raspberry Pi camera sensor to detect the target person and interact with a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi 3) to accomplish this design and the prototype. Raspberry Pi controls the air-conditioning robot to follow the movement of the target person. We used image processing to discover the target shopper, the control system, and then guide the bot. In the meantime, the robot must also bypass any potential obstacles that could prevent its movement and cause a collision. We made a highly efficient design that can synchronize between the software algorithm and the mechanical platform of the robot. This work is merely the combination of a cool stream of air and a robot that follows a human. © 2021 by the authors.

In the last twenty years, the European Union has published a succession of energy performance of building directives to define and ensure the fulfilment of a series of objectives regarding greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, energy efficiency and energy generation from renewable sources in buildings. For its part, Spain is adapting its legal framework, transposing these directives with the aim of achieving greater energy efficiency and sustainability for buildings. Under this context, an energy, economic and environmental assessment is performed to analyze the impact of these regulatory changes on a single-family home including a photovoltaic installation for self-consumption with surpluses and/or a solar thermal installation for domestic hot water supply, located in each one of the eight thousand one hundred thirty-one municipalities that make up Spain. The energy behavior of the original house is compared with that obtained after it is updated with these new facilities. The transient system simulation tool is used for the energy study. The results show that the European objectives are far exceeded. The energy savings achieved range from 67% to 126%, carbon dioxide emissions decrease by 42% to 100% and energy bills are reduced in cost by 32% to 81%.

In this article, we propose a methodology based on the integrated use of regularized regression and clustering for generating predictive models of future heating load in DHNs. The methodology is tested on a real case study based on a dataset provided by AGSM, an Italian utility company that manages a DHN in the city of Verona, Italy.

Sulfate contributes the largest inorganic PM1 mass fraction during the pre-monsoon (24%) and monsoon (24%) periods, with nitrate contributing most during the post-monsoon period (8%). The organics dominate the mass fraction (54%-68%) throughout the three periods, and, using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) to perform source apportionment analysis of organic mass, two burning-related factors were found to contribute the most (35%) to the post-monsoon increase. The first PMF factor, semi-volatility biomass burning organic aerosol (SVBBOA), shows a high correlation with Earth observation fire counts in surrounding states, which links its origin to crop residue burning. The second is a solid fuel OA (SFOA) factor with links to local open burning due to its high composition of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and novel AMS-measured marker species for polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Two traffic factors were resolved: one hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) factor and another nitrogen-rich HOA (NHOA) factor. The N compounds within NHOA were mainly nitrile species which have not previously been identified within AMS measurements. Their PAH composition suggests that NHOA is linked to diesel and HOA to compressed natural gas and petrol. These factors combined make the largest relative contribution to primary PM1 mass during the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods while contributing the second highest in the post-monsoon period. A cooking OA (COA) factor shows strong links to the secondary factor, semi-volatility oxygenated OA (SVOOA). Correlations with co-located volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements and AMS-measured organic nitrogen oxides (OrgNO) suggest SVOOA is formed from aged COA. It is also found that a significant increase in chloride concentrations (522%) from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon correlates well with SVBBOA and SFOA, suggesting that crop residue burning and open waste burning are responsible. A reduction in traffic emissions would effectively reduce concentrations across most of the year. In order to reduce the post-monsoon peak, sources such as funeral pyres, solid waste burning and crop residue burning should be considered when developing new air quality policy. © 2021 James M.

However, this approach ignores cross-border climate change impacts that occur remotely from the location of their initial impact and that may severely disrupt societies and livelihoods. We propose a conceptual framework and accompanying nomenclature for describing and analysing such cross-border impacts. The conceptual framework distinguishes an initial impact that is caused by a climate trigger within a specific region. Downstream consequences of that impact propagate through an impact transmission system while adaptation responses to deal with the impact propagate through a response transmission system. A key to understanding cross-border impacts and responses is a recognition of different types of climate triggers, categories of cross-border impacts, the scales and dynamics of impact transmission, the targets and dynamics of responses and the socio-economic and environmental context that also encompasses factors and processes unrelated to climate change. These insights can then provide a basis for identifying relevant causal relationships. We apply the framework to the floods that affected industrial production in Thailand in 2011, and to projected Arctic sea ice decline, and demonstrate that the framework can usefully capture the complex system dynamics of cross-border climate impacts. It also provides a useful mechanism to identify and understand adaptation strategies and their potential consequences in the wider context of resilience planning. The cross-border dimensions of climate impacts could become increasingly important as climate changes intensify. We conclude that our framework will allow for these to be properly accounted for, help to identify new areas of empirical and model-based research and thereby support climate risk management. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Cascading impacts; Climate trigger; Complex system; Response; Risk propagation","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; complexity; conceptual framework; environmental factor; industrial production; nature-society relations; sea ice; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107753532

The development of optimization tools to upgrade the operation of smart energy systems should take into account all the relevant elements of these complex infrastructures. In this paper, a global optimization approach, applied to district heating, cooling and electricity networks interconnected to each other, is proposed. The suggested approach combines the optimization of the production side, useful to understand how it is convenient to produce heat, cold and electricity, with demand-side management for district heating customers. This is reached by using a bi-level optimization structure, exploiting the genetic algorithm and linear programming. A physical model of the district heating network is included in the procedure to accurately reproduce the effects of demand-side management. The tool can be applied to different objective functions. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization is carried out with two different objective functions: the operation cost and the carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that, by choosing an intermediate trade-off among the two goals, it would be possible to have a 12% reduction in the emissions at the expense of a 25% increase in the operating cost. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand-side management; District heating; Energy hub; Production optimization; Thermal network; Vector optimization","Carbon dioxide; Demand side management; District heating; Economic and social effects; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Global warming; Linear programming; Operating costs; % reductions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Demand-side; District heating networks; Energy hubs; Multi-objectives optimization; Objective functions; Production optimization; Thermal network; Vector optimizations; Multiobjective optimization; carbon dioxide; cooling; cost analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy planning; genetic algorithm; multiobjective programming; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103575541

As there were geographical gaps in previous datasets covering the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau, lake surface sediment samples (nCombining double low line117) were collected from the alpine meadow region on the Tibetan Plateau between elevations of 3720 and 5170gmga.s.l. Pollen identification and counting were based on standard approaches, and modern climate data were interpolated from a robust modern meteorological dataset. A series of numerical analyses revealed that precipitation is the main climatic determinant of pollen spatial distribution: Cyperaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, and Salix indicate wet climatic conditions, while Poaceae, Artemisia, and Chenopodiaceae represent drought. Model performance of both weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) and the random forest (RF) algorithm suggest that this modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating the past precipitation from pollen spectra from the eastern Tibetan Plateau. In addition, a comprehensive modern pollen dataset can be established by combining our modern pollen dataset with previous datasets, which will be essential for the reconstruction of vegetation and climatic signals for fossil pollen spectra on the Tibetan Plateau. Pollen datasets including both pollen counts and percentages for each sample, together with their site location and climatic data, are available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC; Cao et al., 2021; 10.11888/Paleoenv.tpdc.271191). © 2021 Xianyong Cao et al.",,,Data Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111093381

We adopt different methods to test the robustness of the basic results, and all tests show that basic results are extremely robust. Moreover, NEDC policy plays a more effective role in the growth of urban GTFP in the mid-western cities and resource-based cities. The industrial structure upgrading effect, unproductive costs reduction effect, and green innovation motivating effect are the key mechanisms for NEDC policy to affect urban GTFP.

This study aims to examine the association between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and obesity-related traits in Chinese adults. Thus, a cross-sectional study was conducted based on a nationally representative sample of 91, 121 adults from 31 provinces in China. Integrated the data from satellites, chemical transport model, and ground observations, annual average concentrations of PM2.5 was obtained at the township level using a machine learning method. The information on body weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were obtained from a questionnaire survey. The general obesity and abdominal obesity status were classified based on body mass index (BMI) and WC, respectively. Logistic and multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the association between PM2.5 and obesity-related traits, along with the examination of potential effect modifications. After adjustment for covariates, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with 8.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0%, 10.0%] and 10% (95% CI: 9.0%, 11.0%) increases in odds for general obesity and abdominal obesity, respectively. The odds ratios associated with per 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 increase were significantly greater in individuals of older age (≥60 years), of Han ethnicity, with lower socioeconomic status (SES), cooking without using a ventilation device, using unclean household fuels, having near-home pollution sources, and doing no physical exercise. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 increase obesity risk in Chinese adults. It has significant significance to reduce air pollution to reducing the burden of obesity, particularly for the susceptible populations. © 2021","Adults; China; Cross-sectional study; Obesity; PM2.5","Air pollution; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Surveys; Adult; Air pollution exposures; Ambients; China; Confidence interval; Cross-sectional study; Long term exposure; On-body; PM$-2.5$; Risk factors; Nutrition; fuel; adult; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); obesity; particulate matter; pollution exposure; risk assessment; risk factor; abdominal obesity; adult; age distribution; air pollution; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; China; Chinese; concentration (parameter); confidence interval; controlled study; cooking; cross-sectional study; demography; environmental factor; ethnicity; female; geographic distribution; Han Chinese; high risk population; household; human; indoor air pollution; lifestyle; linear regression analysis; logistic regression analysis; long term exposure; machine learning; major clinical study; male; obesity; odds ratio; physical inactivity; PM2.5 exposure; pollution transport; practice guideline; public policy; questionnaire; risk factor; risk reduction; rural area; satellite imagery; social status; waist circumference; adverse event; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; obesity; particulate matter; China; Satellites; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Obesity; Particulate Matter; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102279629

In this study, the regional coupled model AVIM-RIEMS2.0 with dynamic vegetation process is employed to examine the impacts of LULCC on regional climate over East Asia. The results show that regional climate and terrestrial surface processes exhibit significantly seasonal and interdecadal signals in East Asia. With the influences of LULCC, forest increased 33.3% and 20.3% from the 1980s to 1990s and from the 1990s to 2000s, respectively. Meanwhile, cropland decreased 17.8% in the 1990s (compared to the 1980s) and 24.8% in the 2000s (compared to the 1990s), respectively. These transitions of land surface processes are roughly coincident with the interdecadal variations in temperature and precipitation, which trigger generally opposite changes in the 1980s as compared to the 1990s, especially over eastern China. The seasonal variability of climatic components is more evident in winter than summer, except for the precipitation. The climate change is also somewhat remarkable under the non-LULCC conditions, combined with the changes in wind fields at the 850 hPa from the simulations during three decades; they together suggest that climate change is also modulated by other controlling factors, such as East Asian monsoon circulations in addition to LULCC conversions. These results highlight the importance of LULCC in regional modeling studies, which would have practical significance in climate mitigation and adaptation over East Asia. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","AVIM-RIEMS2.0; Climate change; Land use and land cover change; Regional climate simulation","climate change; climate modeling; land cover; land use change; regional climate; seasonal variation; vegetation dynamics; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105861371

Isoetes cangae J.B.S. Pereira, Salino & Stützel was first recognized in 2016 as an endemic species of a single lake in Serra dos Carajás, Brazil, in the southeastern Amazon region. The climate of Amazon is warm with a seasonal precipitation regime, which affects aquatic ecosystem properties and regulates plant phenology. Understanding how climatic and hydrological drivers affect I. cangae is fundamental for its conservation because the species is quite vulnerable due to its restricted distribution. In this study, we evaluated the effects of seasonal climatic variations and water level on the phenology of I. cangae over two years. The maximum leaf length, the number of sporophylls (fertile leaves), and the total number of leaves were assessed. Sporophylls were classified into mature and immature, megasporophylls and microsporophylls. The number of leaves, leaf length, and the number of sporophylls changed drastically among the hydrological seasons, but not the ratio between sporophylls and leaves, suggesting that reproductive effort is distributed accordingly over the years. All these factors also varied between years, indicating that inter-annual climatic variations affect the morphology and reproduction of I. cangae. Sporophylls are produced throughout the year, but their maturation and release increase in the rainy and early dry seasons, respectively. Megasporophylls predominate over microsporophylls throughout the year, and the peak of sporophyll maturation occurs during the rainy season, but lasts longer (till early dry season) for megasporophylls. The reproductive traits were associated with lake water level, suggesting that development is stimulated during the driest and hottest periods. Therefore, our results show that environmental factors play an important role in I. cangae phenology and must be considered in the management and conservation efforts to preserve this ancient Amazonian plant. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Conservation; Hydrology; Lake; Phenology; Quillwort; Seasonality","aquatic plant; conservation; endemic species; environmental factor; hydrology; lake water; new species; phenology; seasonality; submerged vegetation; Brazil; Isoetaceae; Isoetales; Isoetes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114063415

In particular, it presents three ways in which mainstream narratives are currently masking–if not exacerbating–the vulnerability of residents in New York City and Copenhagen. First, it explores how a technocratic orientation to community engagement is affecting local perceptions of participatory processes such as planning consultations and visioning exercises. Next, it investigates how the pursuit of an ‘infrastructure-first’ approach to interventions and a reputation for eco-innovation is creating tensions between institutional and local experiences of resilience. Lastly, it discusses some of the ways in which simplistic understandings of vulnerability are leading to adverse outcomes–such as eco-gentrification and displacement–that are making local communities more, not less, vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It concludes by arguing that the meaningful integration of diverse perspectives and values is integral to the process of giving rise to more critical and expansive narratives of resilience. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Community engagement; Neoliberalism; Resilience; Urban governance; Vulnerability","action plan; climate change; governance approach; local participation; neoliberalism; participatory approach; urban planning; vulnerability; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105550514

The present work aims at proposing a novel approach for energy and environmental issues, related to the high density of vehicular traffic for shopping centers by introducing photovoltaic panels and electric vehicles into the energy system. In order to achieve such goal a specific case study was developed for the main shopping centers located in the Campania Region, South of Italy. Two well-known simulation platforms, EnergyPLAN and TRNSYS, were purposely integrated. TRNSYS is used to develop a dynamic model of a shopping and the outputs were used as EnergyPLAN inputs to evaluate the role that this sustainable layout can play within the different sectors. Environmental, energy and economic analyses are performed for three different scenarios including the baseline one at 2019, 2030 and 2050. The proposed system can cover about 45.7 % of the shopping centre electric demand. At a regional scale, in the 2050 scenario the yearly reduction of CO2 and energy consumption are 42.0 kt and 160.0 GW h, respectively.

This study proposes a systematic sustainable feasibility assessment that concentrates on an energetic, economic, and environmental aspect based decision-making framework to identify the best strategy of FW and transportaion management. This study compares four types of GV operations using green fuel from FW: internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) using biomethane, ICEVs using bioethanol, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) using biohydrogen, and plug-in electric vehicles using bioelectricity. The impact of FW processing combined with operating GV focusing on the four countries, namely, China, India, the USA, and Brazil, having the highest FW generation and vehicle population was analyzed for the near future. FCVs operation is the most sustainably-feasible regarding high potential driving distance (220-254 miles per tonne of FW), low economic cost potential (0.09-0.10 USD per mile) and high greenhouse gas reduction potential (3.0-4.8 kg CO2 per mile). 7.24 million FCVs can be operated using 20% (0.38 Gt) of the FW generated in the four countries by 2030, resulting in a 12.2% decrease in GHG emissions (0.05 Gt) and 18.6% in energy use (0.10 EJ). © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bioethanol; Decision making; Electrophysiology; Food waste; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gases; Plug-in electric vehicles; Population statistics; Waste incineration; Decision-making frameworks; Environmental aspects; Feasibility assessment; Greenhouse gas reductions; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable society; Waste valorizations; Sustainable development; assessment method; decision making; electric vehicle; energy use; feasibility study; food waste; population growth; sustainability; transportation development; waste technology; Brazil; China; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109271437

The transformation of organic matter and seston composition of the Kama River was affected by the inflow of the largest tributary (the Vyatka River) and by the operating mode of the Nizhnekamsk hydroelectric power station. Three structural groups of plankton have been defined: the Kama River community (upstream the confluence with the Vyatka River), the Vyatka River community, and the transformed community downstream of the Vyatka River confluence. The waters of the Vyatka River were characterized by the highest plankton biomass, which affected the quantitative indicators of the Kama River community downstream the tributary inflow. The transformation of the planktonic community under the influence of the Vyatka River inflow was manifested in the change of one dominant group (heterotrophic bacteria) to another (diatoms). In general, despite the lower volume of Vyatka runoff compared to the Kama River, 81% of the total organic carbon of plankton on weekends, and 61% on working days, was formed due to runoff from Vyatka. On the contrary, detritus mainly came directly from the Kama River waters (more than 97%). The influence of the Vyatka River on the Kama River ecosystem in its lower course and further on the Volga River was large, increasing even more on weekends as the amount of runoff through the hydroelectric power station reduced. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ecosystems; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Organic carbon; Plankton; Runoff; Watersheds; Heterotrophic bacterias; Hydroelectric power station; Plankton communities; Planktonic community; Quantitative indicators; River confluence; Structural groups; Total Organic Carbon; Rivers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112628451

Vegetation demographic models (VDMs) allow investigation of the effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes on vegetation composition and fluxes. Such investigation requires that the models can accurately resolve these feedbacks to simulate realistic composition. Vegetation in VDMs is composed of plant functional types (PFTs), which are specified according to plant traits. Defining PFTs is challenging due to large variability in trait observations within and between plant types and a lack of understanding of model sensitivity to these traits. Here we present an approach for developing PFT parameterizations that are connected to the underlying ecological processes determining forest composition in the mixed-conifer forest of the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We constrain multiple relative trait values between PFTs, as opposed to randomly sampling within the range of observations. An ensemble of PFT parameterizations are then filtered based on emergent forest properties meeting observation-based ecological criteria under alternate disturbance scenarios. A small ensemble of alternate PFT parameterizations is identified that produces plausible forest composition and demonstrates variability in response to disturbance frequency and regional environmental variation. Retaining multiple PFT parameterizations allows us to quantify the uncertainty in forest responses due to variability in trait observations. Vegetation composition is a key emergent outcome from VDMs and our methodology provides a foundation for robust PFT parameterization across ecosystems. © Copyright:",,"capture method; community composition; community dynamics; demography; disturbance; ecological modeling; functional change; mixed forest; parameterization; vegetation dynamics; California; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112589315

Using active cultivation and anaerobic digestion, CAM plants can be grown and fermented to produce biogas or hydrolysed to extract valuable volatile fatty acids (VFAs) which can be applied to a range of uses: energy provision, protein and bioplastic production, carbon sequestration. However, an understanding of the spatial potential for CAM plants to be actively grown and harvested for bio-economic uses across Africa is unknown. A combined conservative assessment which incorporates three key dimensions is lacking from the literature: i) where can CAM plants physiologically grow? ii) where can CAM plants be cultivated without competing with existing land use? and iii) where lies the greatest energy demand? Answering these three questions and mapping the spatial variability between these aspects is essential to the future bioplastics/protein sector and opportunity to capitalise on generating sustainable energy which can connect off-grid rural and peri-urban communities whilst also achieving climate change mitigation targets. Using Opuntia ficus-indica as an example, this study compares two measures of land suitability estimation based on ecophysiological requirements and social, environmental and land-use masks.

One way to enhance SOC stocks is to increase carbon (C) inputs to the soil. In this study, we assessed the amount of organic C inputs that are necessary to reach a target of SOC stocks increase by 4‰yr-1 on average, for 30 years, at 14 long-term agricultural sites in Europe. We used the Century model to simulate SOC stocks and assessed the required level of additional C inputs to reach the 4 per 1000 target at these sites. Then, we analyzed how this would change under future scenarios of temperature increase. Initial stocks were simulated assuming steady state. We compared modeled C inputs to different treatments of additional C used on the experimental sites (exogenous organic matter addition and one treatment with different crop rotations). The model was calibrated to fit the control plots, i.e. conventional management without additional C inputs from exogenous organic matter or changes in crop rotations, and was able to reproduce the SOC stock dynamics. We found that, on average among the selected experimental sites, annual C inputs will have to increase by 43.15±5.05%, which is 0.66±0.23MgCha-1yr-1 (mean±standard error), with respect to the initial C inputs in the control treatment. The simulated amount of C input required to reach the 4‰ SOC increase was lower than or similar to the amount of C input actually used in the majority of the additional C input treatments of the long-term experiments. However, Century might be overestimating the effect of additional C inputs on SOC stocks. At the experimental sites, we found that treatments with additional C inputs were increasing by 0.25% on average. This means that the C inputs required to reach the 4 per 1000 target might actually be much higher. Furthermore, we estimated that annual C inputs will have to increase even more due to climate warming, that is 54% more and 120% more for a 1 and 5C warming, respectively. We showed that modeled C inputs required to reach the target depended linearly on the initial SOC stocks, raising concern on the feasibility of the 4 per 1000 objective in soils with a higher potential contribution to C sequestration, that is soils with high SOC stocks. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks at a large scale and in a future with a warmer climate. © Authors 2021",,"climate change; experimental design; feasibility study; simulation; Europe; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109155615

The growing social awareness of ecology and the enormous dam-age to the Earth’s ecosystem due to the production of energy from conventional sources have forced fundamental changes in the energy sector. Renewable energy is considered to be an opportunity for such changes. The current state of the art allows such changes to be made without restricting economic development. Therefore, activities related to the energy transition are being taken all over the world. The European Union has definitely managed to achieve the most tangible effects in this regard. This article presents the findings of the research aimed at presenting the current state of renewable energy in the European Union and analyzing the changes reported in this sector in the last decade. The research was carried out using a selected set of 11 indicators characterizing renewable energy in individual countries. These indicators were selected on the basis of literature review and own studies of the state of renewable energy and its development prospects. Based on these indica-tors, changes in the energy structure of individual European Union countries between 2008–2018 were determined. The study is divided into two main stages. The principal components analysis (PCA) was used for the first analysis. In turn, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was adopted to assess the level of renewable energy development in the European Union countries. Both these methods and the extended statistical analysis were applied to determine the state of renewable energy development in the European Union countries in the studied period and to divide the Member States into classes with different levels of development. The results of the study showed that the EU countries are characterized by significant differences in the development of RES during the period in question. The unquestionable leaders in this respect are Sweden, Austria, Finland, and Latvia. Based on the findings, it is possible to evaluate the effects of activities related to renewable energy development and to prepare assumptions for future activities. Additionally, both the research and its findings broaden the knowledge of the directions of renewable energy development in individual European Union countries. This is particularly important in the context of changes related to the need to reduce harmful substance emissions and the implementation of the European Green Deal idea. © 2021 by the authors.

Besides greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, such as nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions, has gained increasing attention in agglomerated areas with transport vehicles being one of the main sources thereof. Alternative fuels that fulfill the greenhouse gas reduction goals also offer the possibility of solving the challenge of rising urban pollution. This work focuses on the electric drive option for heavy and light duty vehicle freight transport. In this study, fuel cell-electric vehicles, battery-electric vehicles and overhead catenary line trucks were investigated, taking a closer look at their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and also considering the investment and operating costs of the required infrastructure. This work was conducted using a bottom-up transport model for the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. Two scenarios for reducing these emissions were analyzed at a spatial level. In the first of these, selected federal highways with the highest traffic volume were equipped with overhead catenary lines for the operation of diesel-hybrid overhead trucks on them. For the second spatial scenario, the representative urban area of the city of Cologne was investigated in terms of air pollution, shifting articulated trucks to diesel-hybrid overhead trucks and rigid trucks, trailer trucks and light duty vehicles to battery-electric or fuel cell-electric drives. For the economic analysis, the building up of a hydrogen infrastructure in the cases of articulated trucks and all heavy duty vehicles were also taken into account. The results showed that diesel-hybrid overhead trucks are only a cost-efficient solution for highways with high traffic volume, whereas battery overhead trucks have a high uncertainty in terms of costs and technical feasibility. In general, the broad range of costs for battery overhead trucks makes them competitive with fuel cell-electric trucks. Articulated trucks have the highest potential to be operated as overhead trucks. However, the results indicated that air pollution is only partially reduced by switching conventional articulated trucks to electric drive models. The overall results show that a comprehensive approach such as fuel cell-electric drives for all trucks would most likely be more beneficial. © 2021 The Author(s)","Air pollution; Alternative drive; CO2; Hydrogen; Spatial modelling; Transport emissions","Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Operating costs; Overhead lines; Trucks; Urban transportation; % reductions; Alternative drive; Global challenges; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heavy duty vehicles; Light duty vehicles; Particulate matter emissions; Spatial models; Traffic volumes; Transport emissions; Hydrogen; carbon dioxide; diesel fuel; hydrogen; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; electric vehicle; emission control; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; spatial analysis; traffic emission; transport vehicle; air pollution; Article; battery electric vehicle; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; diesel engine; economic evaluation; energy resource; fuel cell electric vehicle; Germany; highway; investment; motor vehicle; overhead catenary line truck; spatial analysis; traffic; traffic and transport; traffic pollution; urban area; air pollutant; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; motor vehicle; prevention and control; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Germany; Greenhouse Gases; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102111411

The goal of this study was to investigate the association between particulate air pollution and cause-specific respiratory mortality before, during and after the period of the Olympic Games. Further, we wanted to assess whether changes in pollutant concentrations were linked to changes in respiratory mortality. We obtained daily data on mortality due to respiratory diseases (coded as J00-J99 according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th revision [ICD10]) and pneumonia (ICD10: J12–18), meteorology, particulate matter less than 10 µm or 2.5 μm in diameter (PM10, PM2.5) and particle number size distribution from official monitoring networks and sites located on the Peking University campus between May 20 and December 1, 2008. We assessed the effects of particulate air pollution on daily respiratory mortality using confounder-adjusted Quasi-Poisson regression models. Furthermore, we estimated air pollution effects for three periods—before (May 20 to July 20, 2008), during (August 1 to September 20, 2008) and after (October 1 to December 1, 2008)—by including interaction terms in the models. We found associations between different particle metrics and respiratory and pneumonia mortality, with more pronounced effects in smaller particle size ranges. For example, an interquartile range increase of 7,958 particles/cm3 in ultrafine particles (particles &lt;100 nm in diameter) led to a 16.3% (95% confidence interval 4.3%; 26.5%) increase in respiratory mortality with a delay of seven days. When investigating the sub-periods, results indicate that a reduction in air pollution during the Olympics resulted in reduced (cause-specific) respiratory mortality. This reduction was especially pronounced for pneumonia mortality. The findings suggest that even a short-term reduction in pollution concentrations may lead to health benefits and that smaller particles in the ultrafine size range may be particularly important for respiratory health. © Copyright © 2021 Breitner, Su, Franck, Wiedensohler, Cyrys, Pan, Wichmann, Schneider and Peters.","accountability study; Beijing 2008 Olympic and Paralympic games; particulate air pollution; respiratory mortality; ultrafine particles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112632783

Most industrialized countries have formulated national adaptation strategies to meet this challenge. However, the implementation of on-the-ground measures is lagging. To analyze the implementation process and possible reasons for the implementation gap, we take a closer look at how the integration of adaptation goals into various sectoral policies—often called mainstreaming—has been handled on different administrative levels in Switzerland. Going beyond traditional compilations of barriers to climate change adaptation, we analyze the use of six different mainstreaming strategies across cases and levels and the reasons for their success or lack thereof. We find that different actors at all administrative levels have successfully employed programmatic mainstreaming in combination with inter-organizational mainstreaming to foster horizontal cooperation. We call this strategy cooperative mainstreaming. Some pioneers even managed to channel their successes into advances in regulatory mainstreaming. However, the lack of systematic regulatory and directed mainstreaming on the national and cantonal levels largely limits adaptation actions on lower levels to those cases where the major impetus derives from extreme events or proactive individuals on the ground. We conclude that the adaptation implementation gap in Switzerland largely stems from the lack of political commitment to promoting local adaptation at the national and cantonal levels. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment","climate change adaptation; climate policy; climate policy integration; environmental policy integration; implementation gap; mainstreaming","adaptation; climate variation; environmental management; environmental policy; strategic approach; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100998279

A 2002 review found only five analyses comparing the net economic benefits of conserving nature versus pursuing an alternative, more intensive human use. Here we revisit this crucial comparison, synthesizing recent data from 62 sites worldwide. In 24 cases with economic estimates of services, conservation or restoration benefits (for example, greenhouse gas regulation, flood protection) tend to outweigh those private benefits (for example, profits from agriculture or logging) driving change to the alternative state. Net benefits rise rapidly with increasing social cost of carbon. Qualitative data from all 62 sites suggest that monetization of additional services would further increase the difference. Although conservation and restoration did not universally provide greater net value than the alternative state, across a large, geographically and contextually diverse sample, our findings indicate that at current levels of habitat conversion, conserving and restoring sites typically benefits human prosperity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Flood control; Greenhouse gases; Restoration; Alternative state; Economic benefits; Economic consequences; Economic estimate; Greenhouse gas regulation; Qualitative data; Social cost of carbon; Value of ecosystem services; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102308021

New decentralized, polycentric structures allow for climate finance to more effectively reach the sub- and non-state actors most directly implementing climate change governance. However, the expansion of climate finance into market-inflected forms of blended finance, as well as debt-based financing, express a neoliberal logic that shifts power to market actors. This may challenge the efficacy of climate finance. We suggest that further research is needed on polycentric systems in climate finance, since an apparent expansion in the diversity of providers is also accompanied by a counter-intuitive concentration of decision-making power with financial fund managers. We join others in suggesting that the weight of scholarship advocates for a strong return to public authored finance and governance, under the auspices of Green New Deal programs and more widely.

Although numerous studies have examined the effects of L on biomass and plant growth, comprehensive evaluations of the effects of this practice on net CO2 assimilation, antioxidant enzyme activities and sucrose synthesis are lacking. Accordingly, this study examined the effects of long-term surface applications of L and PG on soil fertility and the resulting impacts on root growth, plant nutrition, photosynthesis, carbon and antioxidant metabolism, and grain yield (GY) of maize established in a dry winter region. At the study site, the last soil amendment occurred in 2016, with the following four treatments: control (no soil amendments), L (13 Mg ha–1), PG (10 Mg ha–1), and L and PG combined (LPG). The long-term effects of surface liming included reduced soil acidity and increased the availability of P, Ca2+, and Mg2+ throughout the soil profile. Combining L with PG strengthened these effects and also increased SO42–-S. Amendment with LPG increased root development at greater depths and improved maize plant nutrition. These combined effects increased the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange even under low water availability. Furthermore, the activities of Rubisco, sucrose synthase and antioxidative enzymes were improved, thereby reducing oxidative stress. These improvements in the physiological performance of maize plants led to higher GY. Overall, the findings support combining soil amendments as an important strategy to increase soil fertility and ensure crop yield in regions where periods of drought occur during the cultivation cycle. © Copyright © 2021 Bossolani, Crusciol, Garcia, Moretti, Portugal, Rodrigues, Fonseca, Calonego, Caires, Amado and Reis.","oxidative stress; root distribution; Rubisco; soil amendments; soil fertility; sucrose synthase",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111363271

Factors regulating spatial soil respiration are still unclear, and they may lead to an inaccurate estimation of soil respiration at the ecosystem level. The aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal changes in spatial variation of soil respiration in a dry evergreen forest of Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thailand. Soil respiration, temperature, and moisture were measured in 100 subplots of five 1-ha main plots for four times from November 2014 to August 2016. The average rate (± SD) of annual aboveground soil respiration was 6.57 ± 4.29 µmol CO2 m-2s-1. Soil respiration considerably varied with space and time. The mean ranges were from 2.66 to 11.72 µmol CO2 m-2s-1 with a maximum rate of 42.68 µmol CO2 m-2s-1. The wet season soil respiration rate (8.81 µmol CO2 m-2s-1) was two times higher (p &lt; 0.001) than in the dry season (4.33 µmol CO2 m-2s-1). The seasonal changes clearly affected the spatial variation of soil respiration. Wet season produced higher and more widespread soil respiration. Although soil respiration rates increase with increasing soil temperature and soil moisture content, the rate starts to drop at 27 °C soil temperature (p &lt; 0.001) and 21% soil moisture content (p &lt; 0.05). This study suggests more investigation of soil features and animal influences on CO2 emission hot spots in order to accurately estimate soil respiration in tropical forests. © 2021 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage.

An alternative to increase resilience and mitigate the effects of the climate context is urban forest planning to increase ecosystem services. This research constructed a forest cover sustainability index, based on 147 semi-structured interviews with residents of four residential areas of the city of Santo Domingo (Gazcue, Zona Colonial, Ciudad Nueva, and San Carlos), in which information was collected based on both benefit perception and tree management in their home and nearby public areas. The socioeconomic characteristics of the population and the information gathered from the measurements of the urban forest in both public and private areas of the city during the 2016–2019 period were considered, including these four residential areas, which established the ecosystem services provided by the urban forest. The results showed that Gazcue had a higher value in the forest cover sustainability index. The factors that influenced this result were: job stability, medium-high income, and property ownership. Likewise, the added value of the territory, whether in terms of tourism or the socioeconomic value of the population that inhabits it, is closely related to a greater attention to urban planning, prioritizing the conservation and landscape harmony that the arboreal component can provide. In conclusion, urban forest planning in cities should consider tree species, the design and structure of spatial arrangements, and a competent legal framework that can meet the challenges of territorial sustainability and contribute to the resilience and mitigation of climate change impacts. © 2021 by the authors.

The source-sink capacity of wetlands is governed by microbially-mediated biogeochemical processes, which are furthermore regulated by environmental conditions. With growing interest in nature-based climate solutions, policymakers and resource managers seek information on ways how wetlands can be managed to maximize carbon drawdown. Here, we explored how rehabilitation (i.e., fencing and grazing removal) influences greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil biogeochemistry (microbial communities and soil quality) from semi-arid, rain-filled freshwater wetlands in south-eastern Australia. Specifically, we investigated the carbon and microbes response under major local environmental factors, such as vegetation type (graminoids vs eucalyptus tree) and seasonal hydroperiod (spring vs autumn), across wetlands that are currently used for grazing or cropping and those that have been under fencing rehabilitation for up to 20 years. We found that rehabilitation did not reduce CO2 and CH4 emissions, rather CH4 flux rates were elevated when the wetlands were flooded (spring). Anaerobic conditions from spring waterlogged soils also increased microbial diversity by 2.6-fold, and influenced the relative abundance of putative methane oxidizers (Nitrososphaerales and Mixococcales) and methanogenic archaea (Methanomicrobia, Methanobacteria). Organic matter quality (measured as C:N ratio) was reduced by the removal of grazing pressure in eucalyptus-dominated sites only. Soil quality, influenced by vegetation type, also had a significant impact on relative abundance of putative nitrogen and carbon cyclers. Overall, our results suggest that fencing rehabilitation in semi-arid rain-filled wetlands had a minor impact on microbial dynamics and carbon processes, overshadowed by the influence of the water table and vegetation type. Focusing future research on spatial and temporal patterns of carbon and microbe rehabilitation responses will help managers devise the most effective rehabilitation practice within a particular geographical area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","16S amplicon sequencing; Freshwater wetlands; Land-use; Microbial ecology; Organic carbon; Wetland restoration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100576993

Scientists, policy makers, and practitioners often want to communicate to the public about the seriousness of the situation to encourage mitigation and adaptation. Many standard communication strategies that rely on fear and scientific authority alone—rather than comprehensive explanations that include solutions—can leave audiences feeling overwhelmed and disengaged, instead of hopeful and motivated to act. In this practice bridge, we showcase a social science research-based climate change communication “tool-kit” for the Gulf of Maine, using one example for each climate driver addressed at the Gulf of Maine 2050 Symposium (temperature and circulation: lobster fisheries; coastal and ocean acidification: seagrass restoration; sea-level rise: coastal development). Communication models that involve the head (understanding of climate change), heart (hope through agency and efficacy), and hands (intentions to participate in community action) further engagement in climate change conversations. We explain the research behind our communication framework, enabling practitioners to extend this case study to their own work. © 2015 Dares.

A single-fluid-model has been implemented by solving the algebraic form of compressible flow conservation equations, in conjunction with nucleation and droplet growth laws from gas-kinetic theory. The second method assumes the condensation shock problem as a flow discontinuity, the downstream state of the shock being defined as a weak-detonation, and determined from intersections on the Rayleigh and Hugoniot curves. Both approximations have been implemented with complex multi-parameter equations-of-state based on the Helmholtz free energy, taking into account the non-ideal gas flow behavior of steam and carbon dioxide. In order to reproduce operating conditions of engineering applications, where non-equilibrium condensation occurs such as steam turbines, injectors, supercritical carbon dioxide compressors and supersonic gas flow separators. Both gas-kinetic and flow discontinuity approaches have been tested for several nozzle geometries and results have been compared with low- and high-pressure experimental data of steam and carbon dioxide. The results show that both models are able to model properly the pressure recovery that occurs in supersonic condensing flows. It has been found a low deviation 4% from experimental data of steam, and deviations within 8 % were found for the carbon dioxide case. The average droplet radius size distribution obtained from the droplet growth model is in the same order of magnitude of that of reported by experimental data available in open literature. Finally both methods were implemented in a converging-diverging nozzle of a carbon dioxide ejector in order to explore the effects of the stagnation temperature and to determine conditions free of condensation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Condensation shocks; Real gas; Steam; Supersonic nozzle flows","Algebra; Compressibility of gases; Condensation; Drops; Ejectors (pumps); Free energy; High pressure effects; Steam; Steam condensers; Supercritical fluid extraction; Condensation shock; Droplet growth; Nozzle flow; Quasi-one-dimensional flow; Real gas; Semianalytical approach; Single fluid model; Steady state; Supersonic nozzle flow; Supersonic nozzles; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103423299

The aim of the work is to study low-carbon development aimed at reducing the amount of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, to stabilize climate change and prevent negative consequences. A comparative analysis of several countries has shown that renewable energy influences both the situation in the global energy market and the environmental situation of the country as a whole. The territorial study of sunshine in Russia has identified the regions where the transition to alternative energy sources for further energy supply is the most effective, and is able to ensure financial sustainability and tariff equalization, as well as an increase in the living standards of the population. Based on the results of the work done, the root causes of the lack of active implementation of renewable energy sources were identified and a profitable direction for the development of an alternative energy system for Russia was formed.

At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, most nations agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the increase in global surface temperature to 1.5 °C. Satellite remote sensing of CO2 and CH4 is now well established thanks to missions such as NASA’s OCO‐2 and the Japanese GOSAT missions, which have allowed us to build a long‐term record of atmospheric GHG concentrations from space. They also give us a first glimpse into CO2 and CH4 enhancements related to anthropogenic emission, which helps to pave the way towards the future missions aimed at a Monitoring & Verification Support (MVS) capacity for the global stock take of the Paris agreement. China plays an important role for the global carbon budget as the largest source of anthropogenic carbon emissions but also as a region of increased carbon sequestration as a result of several reforestation projects. Over the last 10 years, a series of projects on mitigation of carbon emission has been started in China, including the development of the first Chinese greenhouse gas monitoring satellite mission, TanSat, which was successfully launched on 22 December 2016. Here, we summarise the results of a collaborative project between European and Chinese teams under the framework of the Dragon‐4 programme of ESA and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to characterize and evaluate the datasets from the TanSat mission by retrieval intercomparisons and ground‐based validation and to apply model comparisons and surface flux inversion methods to TanSat and other CO2 missions, with a focus on China. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the local environment and climatic conditions promoting hominin activity in the area during the MIS12 glacial remain largely unknown. In order to reconstruct the paleo-environment including paleo-lake levels and governing paleo-climatic factors on a high temporal resolution, we analyzed a 6-meter-long sediment sequence from the archeological site MAR-1 and a Bayesian age model was computed for a better age constrain of the different sedimentary units. A multiproxy approach was applied using ostracods, sponge spicules, diatoms, grain sizes, total organic carbon, total inorganic carbon and conventional X-ray fluorescence analysis. The results from the site represent a protected region surrounded by high mountains under the constant influence of water, either as a shallow partly anoxic water body surrounded by reed belts (>463–457 ka, <434–427 ka), a riverine-lake deltaic system (∼457–448 ka), a floodplain (∼448–444 ka) or a seasonal freshwater pond (∼444–436 ka). The local changes of water levels resemble large trends and rhythms of regional records from the Mediterranean and appear to directly respond to sea surface temperature (SST) changes of the North Atlantic. In particular, when the SSTs are high, more moisture reaches the study area and vice versa. Additional water reaches MAR-1 through melting of the surrounding glaciers after brief warm phases during MIS12 in the Mediterranean realm, which leads to the formation of smaller fresh water ponds, where also the horizon of the excavated remains is placed. Such ponds, rich in ostracods and other microorganisms, provided mammals and humans valuable resources, such as potable water, a wide range of plant species and hunting opportunities. These deposits therefore bear a high archeological potential. The results from our study suggest that the Megalopolis Basin could have served as a refugium for hominins and other organisms due to its capacity to retain freshwater bodies during glacial and interglacial periods. © Copyright © 2021 Bludau, Papadopoulou, Iliopoulos, Weiss, Schnabel, Thompson, Tourloukis, Zachow, Kyrikou, Konidaris, Karkanas, Panagopoulou, Harvati and Junginger.","lignite; Mediterranean; Megalopolis; ostracods; paleo-lakes; XRF","Anoxic water; Fluorescence; Glacial geology; Mammals; Oceanography; Organic carbon; Potable water; Water levels; Climatic conditions; High temporal resolution; Interglacial periods; Multiproxy approach; Sea surface temperature (SST); Total inorganic carbon; Total Organic Carbon; X ray fluorescence analysis; Lakes; age determination; bone; hominid; lacustrine deposit; lignite; marine isotope stage; ostracod; paleoclimate; paleolimnology; Pleistocene; water level; X-ray fluorescence; Arcadia [Peloponnisos]; Greece; Megalopolis; Peloponnisos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110395392

However, the magnitude and repercussions of climatic changes driven by the eruption are strongly debated. High-resolution paleoclimate and archaeological records from Africa find little evidence for the disruption of climate or human activity in the wake of the eruption in contrast with a controversial link with a bottleneck in human evolution and climate model simulations predicting strong volcanic cooling for up to a decade after a Toba-scale eruption. Here, we use a large ensemble of high-resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM1.3) simulations to reconcile climate model predictions with paleoclimate records, accounting for uncertainties in the magnitude of Toba sulfur emissions with high and low emission scenarios. We find a near-zero probability of annual mean surface temperature anomalies exceeding 4 °C in most of Africa in contrast with near 100% probabilities of cooling this severe in Asia and North America for the high sulfur emission case. The likelihood of strong decreases in precipitation is low in most of Africa. Therefore, even Toba sulfur release at the upper range of plausible estimates remains consistent with the muted response in Africa indicated by paleoclimate proxies. Our results provide a probabilistic view of the uneven patterns of volcanic climate disruption during a crucial interval in human evolution, with implications for understanding the range of environmental impacts from past and future supereruptions. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

During the 1990s crisis, pollution declined in all countries and most regions, but more slowly than production due to the dirtiest industries being more resilient to the crisis. The most persistent was pollution in regions and countries with high volumes of emissions. During the period of economic growth, pollution increased, primarily in hydrocarbon production regions. Regional differences in emissions are mainly due to industrial output for Russia and Ukraine, with a high consistency of production and pollution trends. In Russia, gross emissions are geographically linked to GRP; in Ukraine, a decline in production in the eastern regions has led to a shift in pollution to areas with concentrated populations. In Kazakhstan, the territorial structure of emissions is determined by the volumes of electricity produced by coal generation and the location of energy-intensive industries. In the post-Soviet space, inherited development factors determine pollution from the energy sector, where the most obsolete funds and structure of the fuel balance have been preserved. At the same time large industrial regions in countries have a general tendency to stabilize the level of emissions, while small regions either reduce their emissions, or, conversely, increase them. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","atmospheric emissions; CIS countries; decoupling effect; EEU countries; industrial pollution; regression analysis","air quality; atmospheric pollution; Gross Domestic Product; industrial waste; pollution monitoring; regression analysis; Kazakhstan; Russian Federation; Ukraine; USSR",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116310180

However, our understanding of the temperature rise in the ground and of the geothermal potential of urban subsurface is still limited. This paper quantifies the geothermal potential for a 12 km2 densely populated borough in central London by considering the spatio-temporal temperature variation in the ground owing to continuous rejection of heat into the ground, coupled with the effect of geothermal extraction capacity. A large-scale transient semi-3D geothermal subsurface model of the site is developed, and the thermal interaction between underground heated spaces, geothermal energy extraction systems and the ground and groundwater are simulated. The concurrent heat rejection and extraction processes in the subsurface are computed so that the most influencing parameters of the subsurface on its geothermal potential are identified. Results show that up to 50% of the borough's total heat demand can be supplied via geothermal installations leading to around 33% reduction in CO2 emission. The geothermal extraction efficiency in sand and gravel primarily depends on the ground conditions such as the thickness of the permeable layer and the groundwater flow regime. In impermeable ground such as clay, however, the underground built environment such as heated spaces have shown to have a significant impact on improving the geothermal extraction efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Borehole heat exchangers; Geothermal potential; Large-scale numerical modelling; Subsurface temperature; Subsurface urban heat island; Underground climate change","Extraction; Geothermal energy; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Borehole heat exchangers; Energy; Extraction efficiencies; Geothermal potential; Heat rejection; Large-scale numerical modeling; Lesson learnt; Subsurface temperature; Subsurface urban heat island; Underground climate change; Climate change; ground water; borehole geophysics; climate change; computer simulation; geothermal energy; geothermal engineering; heat island; heat transfer; numerical model; urban area; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; England; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; environmental temperature; geothermal energy; mathematical computing; mathematical model; physical chemistry; physical parameters; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102262780

The diet supplement is a water soluble biopolymer (SB) obtained from urban gardening wastes. The paper reports the results of a case study in which 35 days old rabbits were fed a conventional diet as control and with a test diet made up of the conventional diet and 0.05–1% SB. Urine and faeces were collected, stored for 18 days at room temperature to simulate farm storage, and the resulting gaseous emissions were analysed. The manure from the animals fed the 0.25% SB diet produced significantly lowest emissions (p&lt;0.05): e.g., 30% less ammonia (NH3), 25% less methane (CH4), 9% less nitrous oxide (N2O), and 8% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than the control group. The SB feeding strategy can be applied on farms of any size and does not lead to any extra costs for the farm, except for the negligible cost of 0.003–0.007 € kg−1 for the SB supplement that has to be add to the normal animal diet. Full implementation of the SB strategy at a European Union level could lead to global yearly reductions of 1.1 Mt NH3, 0.06 Mt N2O, 2.2 Mt CH4, 0.92 Gt CO2-eq. emissions. The relevance of these results at a European Union level is discussed and the perspectives of previous work are accounted for to demonstrate that SBs can be used as chemical specialities in the chemical industry and in agriculture. The implementation of SB production and application at an industrial and commercial level could lead to important environmental and socio-economic benefits for several sectors of a biobased economy. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Biopolymers; Gaseous emissions; Livestock; Manure; Municipal bio-waste","Additives; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Ammonia; Animals; Biopolymers; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Industrial economics; Nitrogen oxides; Control groups; European union; Feed additives; Feeding strategies; GHG emission; Livestock production; Nitrous oxide; Socio-economic benefits; Chemical contamination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093646697

(R–W) is the most predominant cropping system and the lifeline for billions of people in South Asia. The cultivation of R–W system requires high amounts of water, nutrients and energy, resulting in increased production costs and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. There are also increasing concerns of yield stagnation or decline in the R–W system, with increasing environmental footprints. Hence, the sustainability of the R–W system in South Asia, particularly in the northwest Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs), has been questioned and heavily debated. Based on the findings from peer-reviewed literature, this review aims to identify unsustainability issues and research gaps in the R–W system and propose possible solutions to mitigate those issues and technological interventions to close the research gaps. Among the unsustainability issues that the review has identified are declining crop, water and land productivity, deterioration of soil health, emissions of greenhouse gases due to intensive tillage and residue burning, deepening of groundwater levels and shift in weed flora and development of herbicidal resistance in crops. Potential solutions or technological interventions to mitigate the unsustainability issues include resource conservation technologies (RCTs) such as rice residue management, reduced tillage, laser land leveling, soil matric potential based irrigation scheduling, delayed rice transplanting, cultivation on permanent raised beds, direct-seeded rice (DSR), mechanical transplanting of rice and crop diversification with legumes. These interventions have the potential to reduce energy, water and carbon (C) footprints from the R–W system. Rice residue retention with Happy Seeder and adoption of zero tillage (ZT) for wheat establishment have significantly lowered the environmental footprints, with increased soil C sequestration due to additions of large amounts of plant-mediated C input. Residue mulching has helped increase root length of wheat by ~25% and root length density by ~40% below 15 cm depth, compared to no mulching. The Happy Seeder saved ~30% of irrigation water due to reduction of soil evaporation by ~42–48 mm through residue mulching. Crop cultivation on permanent raised beds is less energy-intensive and results in ~7.8–22.7% higher water use efficiency yet crop productivity in long run could be affected due to reduced root growth on beds. The puddled transplanted rice (PTR) established under wet tillage, however, can decrease the water percolation losses by 14–16% and crop water demand by ~10–25%, and it forms hard pan in soil plough (7–10 cm) layer due to increased soil bulk density. Water stagnation under continuously flooded PTR is the major source of methane emissions with serious environmental implications. Methane emissions from flooded rice can increase global warming potential by 18.1–27.6% compared to intermittently flooded rice with multiple aerations. The conventional tillage can favor the germination of grassy weeds in wheat, while the broad-leaved weeds increase under zero tillage. Zero tillage with mulch load conserved ~4.0% higher moisture due to ~2.3% lesser soil temperature and evaporated ~27.6% lesser than the conventional tillage. Delayed rice transplanting with short-duration variety has potential of saving of up to ~140 mm of irrigation water in the semiarid areas of NW IGPs. Although the DSR had lower yield potential than the PTR, it saved ~50% irrigation water. The laser land leveling technology saved ~30% irrigation water and ~25% electricity and had a yield advantage of ~4%, compared with PTR on un-leveled fields. The mechanical transplanted rice had higher grain yield and more water saving than the manual transplanting or DSR. The review demonstrates that a single technology may not be applicable everywhere and integrated approaches with the multiple criteria—productivity, economics, energy and environmental sustainability—would be required to address the unsustainability issues of the R–W system of the NW IGPs. There is a need to elucidate and disseminate various site- and context-specific RCTs appropriate for the region to address the unsustainability issues and challenges of the system. Sustainable R–W production technologies with reduced water, energy and C footprints are required for increased water and energy productivity and C sequestration for the NW IGPs of South Asia. © 2021, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering.","Conservation agriculture; Cropping systems; Resource-conserving technologies; Tillage and residue management; Water-saving technologies","Crops; Cultivation; Deterioration; Environmental technology; Floods; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Irrigation; Landforms; Methane; Plants (botany); Productivity; Scheduling; Soils; Solvents; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Environmental footprints; Environmental implications; Environmental sustainability; Global warming potential; Issues and challenges; Resource conservation; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Soil conservation; cropping practice; cultivation; electricity generation; germination; global warming; methane; mulching; percolation; rice; soil temperature; sustainability; water demand; water use; wheat; South Asia; Fabaceae; Oryza sativa; Triticum aestivum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101721769

Each stove was used to show differences in sealing systems, combustion chamber shape, and heating surfaces in order to optimize biomass combustion and the energy produced at a low manufacturing cost. The influence of cooking stove design along with particle and gas emissions that resulted from the biomass combustion within the cooking stove was investigated in this study. Levels of diverse atmospheric contaminants, such as particulate matter, emission factor, NOx, CO2, and CO, and the temperature of the flue gases were determined with the Ch-28 method and UNE-EN 12815. The average emission of particulate matter was significantly reduced by modifying the geometry of the combustion chamber and heating surface of each stove, resulting in 5 g/h particle emissions in conventional equipment and 2 g/h in the improved equipment. In relation to gas emissions, there was a 25% maximum decrease in NOx gases and 35% in CO after modifying the heating surface of each stove. This background supports the evidence of technological improvement with high environmental impact and low economic cost for local manufacturers. © 2021 by the authors.

To form profitable fruit plantings in the Trans-Volga-Ural region, it is necessary to select varieties with high potential resistance to drought. The purpose of our study is to study the drought- and heat resistance of species and varieties of the genus Malus Mill growing in the study area. To estimate drought-resistance, we identified: the water content of leaves, water deficit, the water-retaining ability for 2 - 6 hours, the water loss on average for 1 hour, and heat-resistance. 180 samples of the genus Malus kinds, sorts, and varieties were the study objects for two years. Stress climatic factors were not noticed in 2019; therefore, most of the studied samples received a high assessment of relative drought-resistance.

However, the duration of these effects is poorly understood, and it is unclear whether impacts are amplified in forests with a history of previous human disturbance. Here, we focus on the Amazonian epicenter of the 2015–16 El Niño, a region that encompasses 1.2% of the Brazilian Amazon. We quantify, at high temporal resolution, the impacts of an extreme El Niño (EN) drought and extensive forest fires on plant mortality and carbon loss in undisturbed and human-modified forests. Mortality remained higher than pre-El Niño levels for 36 mo in EN-drought–affected forests and for 30 mo in EN-fire–affected forests. In EN-fire–affected forests, human disturbance significantly increased plant mortality. Our investigation of the ecological and physiological predictors of tree mortality showed that trees with lower wood density, bark thickness and leaf nitrogen content, as well as those that experienced greater fire intensity, were more vulnerable. Across the region, the 2015–16 El Niño led to the death of an estimated 2.5 ± 0.3 billion stems, resulting in emissions of 495 ± 94 Tg CO2. Three years after the El Niño, plant growth and recruitment had offset only 37% of emissions. Our results show that limiting forest disturbance will not only help maintain carbon stocks, but will also maximize the resistance of Amazonian forests if fires do occur.* © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

To accelerate the diffusion of PHEVs, investigation of commuter preferences towards the attributes of PHEVs is necessary. Therefore, the present study analyzes prospective owners’ choice decisions towards PHEVs in a typical Indian context. A stated preference survey was designed to collect responses from the current owners of conventional vehicles (CVs) in Delhi, India, and Mixed Logit (ML) models were developed to estimate commuters’ Willingness To Pay (WTP) for a set of key PHEV-specific attributes. The decomposition effect of prospective owners’ sociodemographic characteristics and trip characteristics on the mean estimates of random parameters was investigated by developing ML models with heterogeneity. Subsequently, the influence of improvement of each PHEV-specific attribute on prospective owners’ choice probability was investigated by calculating marginal effects. Among the various PHEV-specific attributes considered in the present study, high WTPs are observed for decrease in battery recharging time, reduction in tailpipe emission and increase in electric range. Therefore, an added emphasis on these attributes by vehicle manufacturers is likely to enhance the attractiveness of PHEVs to Indian commuters. The results also highlight the importance of government subsidy for promoting PHEVs in the Indian market. Prospective owners’ income, availability of home-based parking space, and average daily trip length are found to significantly influence the choice decision of Indian commuters towards PHEVs. © 2021 by the authors.

Results: We identify a paradoxical relationship in which education is associated with both lower levels of racial prejudice and increased support for climate policies, but also strengthens the negative effects of prejudices that persist at higher levels of educational attainment. For individuals with racially prejudiced views, we find that educational attainment decreases both agreement with the scientific consensus and support for climate policies.

Deception Island is a stratovolcano flooded by the sea, resulting in contrasting ecosystems such as permanent glaciers and active fumaroles, which creates steep gradients that have been shown to affect microbial diversity. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomics and metagenome-assembled genomes to explore the metabolic potentials and survival strategies of microbial communities along an extreme temperature gradient in fumarole and glacier sediments on Deception Island. We observed that communities from a 98 °C fumarole were significantly enriched in genes related to hyperthermophilic (e.g. reverse gyrase, GroEL/GroES and thermosome) and oxidative stress responses, as well as genes related to sulfate reduction, ammonification and carbon fixation. Communities from <80 °C fumaroles possessed more genes related osmotic, cold- and heat-shock responses, and diverse metabolic potentials, such as those related to sulfur oxidation and denitrification, while glacier communities showed abundant metabolic potentials mainly related to heterotrophy. Through the reconstruction of genomes, we were able to reveal the metabolic potentials and different survival strategies of underrepresented taxonomic groups, especially those related to Nanoarchaeota, Pyrodictiaceae and thermophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaeal lineages. © 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Antarctica; archaeon; bacterium; genetics; microflora; temperature; Antarctic Regions; Archaea; Bacteria; Microbiota; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111525380

The total density in the deciduous forest was lower in the heavily polluted zone (impact zone) than in the background zone, while there were no differences in the coniferous forest between the zones. The total breeding density of the community of hole-nesters increased in the impact zone over the 30 years (especially, in the deciduous forest in 2010–2020) after the significant reduction of industrial emissions. The breeding density of the two most abundant species varied in different directions: it increased for pied flycatcher and decreased for common redstart. This led to a change of dominants in the impact zone: redstart dominating until 2012 was replaced by pied flycatcher. The differences in the dynamics of species density are probably determined by the beginning of vegetation recovery near the smelter, which is favorable for pied flycatcher but not for redstart. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","breeding density; copper smelter; emission reduction; Ficedula hypoleuca; hole-nesters; long-term dynamics; Middle Urals; Phoenicurus phoenicurus","coniferous forest; deciduous forest; emission control; industrial emission; instrumentation; long-term change; passerine; Ficedula hypoleuca; Phoenicurus phoenicurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111957027

Codification of this area is at best a moving target, presenting unique challenges to legal educators. Preparing legal actors for evidence-based policymaking in this dynamic area necessitates a paradigm shift in legal education. Teaching climate change law in MENA universities offers a unique opportunity to incorporate disruptive teaching methods incorporating enquiry-based learning in curriculum development. Enquiry-based learning develops students' higher-level thinking by integrating skills and knowledge, preparing students to engage in real-world problem-solving. This chapter discusses the importance of enquiry-based learning as a tool to effectively educate future climate change practitioners and policy leaders. It sets out why the particular challenges of climate law require a departure from traditional teaching methods, and the benefits of enquiry-based learning supported by education technology (EdTech). The chapter then examines the practical challenges faced by educators in the MENA Region in the climate change area, especially in the context of MENA Universities. Particularly, slow uptake of innovative teaching methods at all levels of education in the MENA Region; weak focus on graduate skills training; financial constraints; challenges with resource accessibility; and conflict situations. Concrete proposals on how these problems can be addressed through updating teaching methods; focusing education toward the skills training; regional collaborations; and resource sharing climate practice in the MENA Region are then discussed. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

Why, then, do most public opinion surveys indicate rather high levels of concern and rather strong policy support, while de facto mitigation efforts in most countries remain far from ambitious? One possibility is that survey measures for public concern fail to fully reveal the true attitudes of citizens due to social desirability bias. In this paper, we implemented list-experiments in representative surveys in Germany and the United States (N = 3620 and 3640 respectively) to assess such potential bias. We find evidence that people systematically misreport, that is, understate their disbelief in human caused climate change. This misreporting is particularly strong amongst politically relevant subgroups. Individuals in the top 20% of the income distribution in the United States and supporters of conservative parties in Germany exhibit significantly higher climate change skepticism according to the list experiment, relative to conventional measures. While this does not definitively mean that climate skepticism is a widespread phenomenon in these countries, it does suggest that future research should reconsider how climate change concern is measured, and what subgroups of the population are more susceptible to misreporting and why. Our findings imply that public support for ambitious climate policy may be weaker than existing survey research suggests.

It was calibrated by extensive batch-tests and finally evaluated by long-term measurement campaigns realized at three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with different process configurations for nitrogen removal of reject water. To enable a model application with common full-scale data, the nitritation-connected supplementary processes that are responsible for N2O formation are not depicted in the model. Instead, within the new model approach the N2O formation is linked to the NH4-N oxidation rate by defining specific formation factors [N2O-Nform/NH4-Nox], depending on the concentrations of NO2 and O2 as well as the NH4 load. A comparison between the measured and the modeled N2O concentrations in the liquid and gas phase at the full-scale treatment plants prove the ability of the proposed modelling approach to represent the observed trends of N2O formation, emission and reduction using the standard parameter set of kinetics and formation factors. Thus, enabling a reliable estimation of the N2O emissions for different operational conditions. The measurements indicate that a formation of N2O by AOB cannot completely be avoided. However, a considerable reduction of the formed N2O was observed in an anoxic environment. Applying the model, operational settings and mitigation strategies can now be identified without extensive measurement campaigns. For further enhancement of the model, first results for kinetics of N2O reduction kinetics by denitrification processes were determined in laboratory-scale batch tests. © 2021 The Authors.","Asm; Denitrification; Greenhouse gas emission; Modelling; Nitrous oxide; Reject water","Kinetics; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Denitrification process; Long-term measurements; Measurement campaign; Mitigation strategy; Operational conditions; Process configuration; Reject water treatments; Wastewater treatment plants; Sewage treatment plants; nitrous oxide; oxygen; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; bycatch reduction device; concentration (composition); denitrification; detection method; identification key; identification method; oxidation; reaction kinetics; reduction; wastewater; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; water treatment plant; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Article; calibration; carbon footprint; controlled study; denitrification; diffusivity; gas diffusion; measurement; municipal wastewater; nitrification; nitrogen concentration; nonhuman; oxidation; phase transition; reduction (chemistry); reduction kinetics; theoretical model; waste water treatment plant; bioreactor; oxidation reduction reaction; wastewater; water management; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Oxidation-Reduction; Waste Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111893022

To achieve this, a methodology used to inventory pollutant emissions was used in accordance with the recommendations of the EMEP/EEA (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme/European Economic Area). This paper classifies particulates derived from road transport with reference to their properties and sources of origin. The legal status of environmental protection against particulate matter is presented. The emissions of particulate matter with different properties from different road transport sources is examined based on the results of Poland’s inventory of pollutant emissions in the year 2018. This study was performed using areas with characteristic traffic conditions: inside and outside cities, as well as on highways and expressways. The effects of vehicles were classified according to Euro emissions standards into the categories relating to the emissions of different particulate matter types. The results obtained showed that technological progress in the automobile sector has largely contributed to a reduction in particulate matter emissions associated with engine exhaust gases, and that this has had slight effect on particulate matter emissions associated with the tribological processes of vehicles. The conclusion formed is that it is advisable to undertake work towards the control and reduction of road transport particulate matter emissions associated with the sources other than engine exhaust gases. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, there is considerably more variability in level of concern and, it appears, in everyday sustainable behavior. But how does personality affect this variability in behavior? And how are underlying personality states like dispositional optimism linked to more sustainable everyday practices? Research in clinical psychology has suggested that dispositional optimism is a very positive personality characteristic associated with higher levels of hope and resilience, but applied research from other domains has reported that optimists can, on occasion, bury their heads in the sand and avoid attending to external threats, like climate change, in order to maintain mood state. So are optimists more immune to climate change messaging than non-optimists? And do they make fewer sustainable choices? A series of experimental studies, manipulating signifiers of carbon footprint (Study 1) and eco labels on products (Study 2) found that optimists made more sustainable choices than non-optimists and that both groups were influenced equally by climate change film clips in terms of sustainable choices (Study 1). Optimists also displayed a false consensus effect, overestimating the proportion of people who would behave more sustainably like themselves (Study 3). Given that global problems like climate change need concerted, cooperative effort, these optimistic beliefs about how others behave could be adaptive in the long-run. Designing climate change messages to appeal to optimists might be a critical consideration for the future. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.","behaviour change; climate change; climate change films; dispositional optimism; low carbon choice; semiotics of climate change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107223040

The study has to analyze the design, technological and operational methods to increase the performance of drilling tools made of various materials and has highlighted prospects of technological method applications. The scientific novelty of the study consists in the development of a new analytical model of PDC drill bit–well interaction. The developed model takes into account the drill bit manufacturing errors in the form of bit body–nipple axes misalignment on the drill bit strength. This result makes it possible to determine the permissible manufacturing errors to provide safe operation of the drill bit. It is established that there is an additional transverse force that presses the drill bit to the well wall in the rock due to manufacturing errors. It is determined that the magnitude of this clamping force can be significant. The material effect has been analyzed on additional clamping force. It is established that geometric imperfection of the drill bit causes the minimal effect for the elastic system of the pipe string, which includes a calibrator and is composed of drill pipes based on composite carbon fiber material, and the maximal effect—for steel drill pipes. Polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) drill bit and well wall contact interaction during operation in non-standard mode is considered.

The objective of this study is to examine the economic impacts of climate change on net crop income in Nile Basin Ethiopia using a Ricardian fixed effect approach employing the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) household survey data for Ethiopia in 2015 and 2016. The survey samples were obtained through a three‐stage stratified sampling technique from the five regions (Amhara, Tigray, Benishangul Gumuz, Oromia, and Southern Nation Nationality and People (SNNP) along the Nile basin Ethiopia. There are only 12–14% female household heads while there are 80–86% male households in the regions under study. In the regions, more than half of (64%) the household heads are illiterate and almost only one‐tenth of them (12%) had received remittance from abroad from their relatives or children. Crop variety adoption rate is minimal, adopted by the 31% of farmers. Only 30% of the surveyed farmers mentioned that they planted their crop seeds in row whereas the rest 70% had not applied this method. The regression results from the fixed effect least square dummy variable model showed that literacy, household size, remittance, asset value, and total land holdings have significant and positive impacts on the net crop income per hectare. The regional dummy variables estimate indicated that all the regions are negatively affected by climate change at varying levels. Strategies to climate change adaptation have significant and positive contributions in leveraging the damaging effects of climate change. The results also showed that increased winter and summer temperature and rainfall increase net crop income per hectare. The estimated coefficient of the interaction term of spring temperature and rainfall is significant and negative. On the other hand, while the mean annual temperature is damaging to crops, annual rainfall is beneficial. It can be deduced that, while increased temperature and rainfall in summer and winter increase the net crop income, the converse is true for winter and spring seasons. The study also proposes a specific, context‐dependent, farm‐level adaptation analysis of how farmers cope with the different climatic impacts of the Nile Basin and maintain the income levels that they have previously enjoyed. © 2021 by the authors.

While most studies had employed culture-dependent microbiological analyses or polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), the recent application of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has been effective and reliable in detecting the microbial consortium associated with food spoilage. Since MAP application is limited in China, applying HTS in assessing the microbial consortium of meat and meat products in the country becomes imperative. In this study, quality indexes and bacterial enumeration often used as spoilage indicators were employed to assess MAP fresh pork under chilled (4 °C) storage for 21 d. The results indicated that 70%O2/30%CO2 (Group A) retained more redness (a*) content, while 70%N2/30%CO2 (Group B) markedly reduced spoilage indicators compared to the control group. Notably, high-throughput sequencing indicated that Group B and 20%O2/60%N2/20%CO2 (Group C) inhibited the growth of abundant spoilers, Pseudomonas spp. and Brochothrix spp. Thus, MAP (Group B and C) has promising potential in inhibiting predominant meat spoilers during chilled storage.

Thus, transfer function enables assessment of the current technical state of pipelines. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","defect; expert assessment of industrial safety; integral safety parameter; stressed-strained state; transfer function","Defects; Explosions; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Pipeline processing systems; Toxic materials; Transfer functions; Dynamic mathematical model; Expert assessment; Materials processing; Metal structures; Operational safety; Performance properties; Process pipelines; Stressed-strained state; Pipelines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111525768

However, previous studies have shown that, under resource limitation, the species of both groups tend to have similar functional behavior. We measured a group of resource-use traits under controlled drought stress in Cenostigma microphyllum native to Caatinga of Brazil and the invasive species Calotropis procera that has a large occurrence in semiarid regions. The results showed that invasive well-watered plants always had higher CO2 assimilation rates and lower leaf construction costs than native plants, while stomatal conductance was similar. On the other hand, under water deficit conditions, the invasive plants tolerated more days of drought and showed higher root/shoot biomass ratio, leaf relative water content, lower leaf construction costs and payback time than the native species. Moreover, seven days after stress, the invasive plants displayed higher CO2 assimilation, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, instantaneous efficiency of energy use and lower leaf construction costs compared with the native species. The ability to acquire and distribute resources among the different plant tissues at the right time seems to be a fundamental combination for the plants used in the experiment. Thus, a more acquisitive strategy is fundamental for having enough carbon to invest in the root biomass in C. procera under drought, which could contribute to maintain higher leaf water status for longer time compared with C. microphyllum. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Caatinga; Carbon metabolism; Gas exchange; Leaf economics; Resource-use efficiency; Specific leaf area; Water deficit","angiosperm; biomass; drought stress; functional response; invasive species; root architecture; stomatal conductance; water demand; Brazil; Calotropis procera; Cenostigma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110343601

However, the compilation of emission inventory involves cumbersome data collection from diverse parties about the combustion activities and related emission factors that convert activity data to emissions. Here we design and implement a cloud-based information system that can facilitate efficient emission inventory compilation. We base our information system on cloud infrastructure and adopt a microservice architecture in which the data and computing needed in inventory compilation are accessed through service consumptions. This makes the inventory compilation processes online, digital and distributive, and enables seamless data sharing and collaborative compilation. By this way, scalable timely high-resolution emission inventory can be achieved for a rapid response mechanism where regulations, scientific data and computing, and local actions can be connected for efficient digital governance of urban air pollution and carbon management.

However, the combustion optimization methods commonly used lack the self-learning capability and have low utilization of historical data. In this paper, a combustion optimization method based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, dynamic modeling is realized based on online least squares support vector machine and multi-kernel learning, and the optimal kernel function weight coefficient and related kernel parameters are selected by an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Secondly, the DDPG algorithm is introduced to optimize the control variables. The simulation results demonstrate that the multi-kernel least squares support vector machine (MKLSSVM) model has better local fitting performance and global generalization performance. The DDPG optimizer and MKLSSVM predictor can effectively improve the boiler efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions while maintaining the stable reheat steam temperature. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","combustion optimization; DDPG; multi-kernel learning; Online LSSVM; reinforcement learning","Coal combustion; Deep learning; E-learning; Efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Support vector machines; Boiler efficiency; Combustion optimization; Deep deterministic policy gradient; Deterministics; Gradient algorithm; Multi-kernel; Multi-kernel learning; Online LSSVM; Optimization method; Policy gradient; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117345547

However, the differences in CH4 emissions across wetland types in these regions have not been well understood. We synthesized approximately 9000 static chamber CH4 measurements during the growing season from 83 sites across pan-Arctic regions. We highlighted spatial variations of CH4 emissions corresponding to environmental heterogeneity across wetland types. CH4 emission is the highest in fens, followed by marshes, bogs, and the lowest in swamps. This gradient is controlled by the water table, soil temperature, and dominant plant functional types and their interactions. The water table position for maximum CH4 emission is below, close to, and above the ground surface in bogs, marshes/fens, and swamps, respectively. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of CH4 emissions varied among different wetland types, ranging from the lowest in swamps to the highest in fens. The interactive impact of temperature and the water table positions on CH4 emissions are regulated with dominant plant functional types. CH4 emissions from wetlands dominated by vascular plants rely more on species composition than that dominated by non-vascular plants. Wetlands with greater abundance of graminoids (e.g., fens) have higher CH4 emissions than tree-dominated wetlands (e.g., swamps). This synthesis emphasizes the role of wetland heterogeneity in determining the strength of CH4 emissions. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","meta-analysis; methane; pan-Arctic; plant functional types; water table; wetland category","Feedback; Forestry; Global warming; Groundwater; Methane; CH4-measurements; Environmental heterogeneity; Impact of temperatures; Methane emissions; Soil temperature; Spatial variations; Species composition; Temperature sensitivity; Wetlands; methane; carbon dioxide; methane; biogenic emission; emission; heterogeneity; methane; wetland; Arctic; Article; marsh; peatland; soil temperature; swamp; synthesis; temperature sensitivity; vascular plant; vegetation; water table; wetland; greenhouse gas; soil; Tracheophyta; Arctic Regions; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Soil; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110941456

If modern slaves were a country, they would be the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, after China and the United States. Concurrently, anthropogenic changes to the global ecosystem have significant impacts on human life, creating vulnerability and displacement that drive modern slavery. This circular relationship is explored through the interaction of contemporary slavery with multiple anthropogenic processes recognized as “planetary boundaries.” It is a key assertion that the study of human rights (and slavery in particular), and the study of anthropogenic impacts, have been falsely seen as distinct and separate issues. In this Perspective, we map an unfolding and extremely troubling nexus between slavery, environmental degradation, and carbon emissions. We break this challenge down into the interconnected processes of extreme weather, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and pollution from manufacturing and resource extraction. We discuss how climate change is a threat multiplier to slavery, but also how slavery is a threat multiplier to the causes of climate change. We conclude by offering compelling policy implications to address these threat multipliers, to help guide future research and policy pathways. Abolishing slavery is shown to be one of the most effective instruments for climate change mitigation, especially given that the costs of ending slavery seem on par to about $20 billion, or the expense of a single large nuclear power plant. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate justice; Energy justice; Environmental justice; Human rights; Modern slavery; Slavery in the Anthropocene",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110274224

We analysed relationships between Amazon P and evapotranspiration (ET) in the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models to evaluate controls on surface moisture fluxes and assess the credibility of regional P projections. We found that only 13 out of 38 models captured an energy limitation on Amazon ET, in agreement with observations, while 20 models instead showed Amazon ET is limited by water availability. Models that misrepresented controls on ET over the historical period projected both large increases and decreases in Amazon P by 2100, likely amplified by unrealistic land-atmosphere interactions. In contrast, large future changes in annual and seasonal-scale Amazon P were suppressed in models that simulated realistic controls on ET, due to modulating land-atmosphere interactions. By discounting projections from models that simulated unrealistic ET controls, our analysis halved uncertainty in basin-wide future P change. The ensemble mean of plausible models showed a robust drying signal over the eastern Amazon and in the dry season, and P increases in the west. Finally, we showed that factors controlling Amazon ET evolve over time in realistic models, reducing climate stability and leaving the region vulnerable to further change. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this study, the WRF-Chem scenario tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of both the emission and meteorological changes on the winter PM2.5 from 2015 to 2019, especially that of regional transport and local emissions on the PM2.5 variations in HB. The results showed that meteorological changes in January 2019 increased the PM2.5 by 24% relative to January 2015, whereas emissions reduced it by 36%, indicating that emission reduction was vital in improving the air quality in HB. However, the meteorological changes increased the concentration of air pollutants by 10–25% relative to January 2018. This led to a rebound of the observed pollutant concentrations in January 2019, highlighting the importance of meteorological conditions on air pollution. Regional transport of air pollutants contributed to the inter-annual increase of wintertime PM2.5 by 78%, driven purely by meteorology from 2015 to 2019. This indicated that regional PM2.5 transport could aggravate PM2.5 levels in winter over HB with the reduction of air pollutant emissions in China. Additionally, the regional transport of air pollutants contributed to the decrease in PM2.5 in HB by 42%, resulting from the non-local emission reduction during COVID-19 lockdown in winter.

The role of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in plant responses to large igneous province volcanism is difficult to determine but important in relation to understanding ecosystem responses during mass extinction events. Leaf mass per area (LMA) is an important leaf measure for tracking plant responses to environmental pressures in the fossil record, but how it responds to SO2 exposure is unclear, particularly for nonangiosperm taxa. Methodology. Five gymnosperm species were grown in simulated paleoatmospheric conditions that included SO2 to determine how the plants responded. Pivotal results. All plants’ growth in high SO2 showed a significant decrease in LMA compared with the control (with no SO2).When grown in a highCO2, lowO2, and highSO2 treatment,most plants continued to showa decrease inLMA compared with the control but an increase comparedwith the high SO2 treatment with ambient CO2 and O2. Conclusions. Thesefindings suggest that exposure to SO2 significantly decreasesLMA, potentially reducing preservation potential in the fossil record. Exposure to combined SO2 and high CO2 reduces this effect, but this may also obscure the effects of SO2, leading to interpretations that ecosystem instability is primarily driven by increasing CO2, which may not be the case. © 2021 by The University of Chicago.

Depending on the orientation of any existing fault and fracture planes, such as critically stressed planes, this stress alteration will modify normal stresses acting on planes and could result in frictional sliding and release stored energy in the form of seismicity. Brine extraction (BE) is a technique that can be applied prior to, or during, CO2 injection to reduce pore pressure for increasing storage capacity and, potentially, for reducing the likelihood of frictional sliding. A workflow is described to assess the efficacy of BE for mitigating frictional sliding (i.e., seismicity) during injection and entails: site characterization, stress calculations and failure assessment, static and dynamic modeling, and BE operational planning. Site characterization describes the stress field used to calculate the Coulomb Failure Function (CFF) that constrains allowable pore pressure changes and injection rates in the numerical simulation of CO2 injection scenarios. The inclusion of BE in the workflow allows for determination of the potential need for pressure reduction, and evaluation of the effectiveness of this operation. Example application of the workflow using an injection field dataset near Decatur, IL, provides insight on fracture planes and stresses at the site, formation properties and the impact of variable CO2 injection-rate targets on whether BE plans are required. The study workflow indicates that BE could enhance CO2 injection rate by 39% and correspondingly reduce the potential for injection-induced seismicity as indicated by a reduction in CFF. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Brine extraction; CO2 storage; Coulomb failure function; Faults and fractures; Injection rate; Injection-induced seismicity; Workflow","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Extraction; Friction; Pore pressure; Stresses; Failure assessment; Frictional sliding; Geologic formations; Operational planning; Pressure reduction; Site characterization; Static and dynamic modeling; Stress calculations; Induced Seismicity; assessment method; brine; carbon sequestration; extraction method; failure analysis; fault; fluid injection; induced seismicity; pore pressure; Decatur [Illinois]; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110193998

Its founder Professor William Nordhaus was recently awarded Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel due to his pioneering work on the economics of climate change. In a recent paper in American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, Nordhaus uses the model to conclude that a 2.5°C target is almost out of reach. In this paper, we update DICE 2016 R2 with state-of-the-art models of the carbon cycle, heat uptake into the oceans, and the role of non-CO2 forcers. We find that the allowable remaining carbon budget (over the period 2015–2100) to meet a 2.5°C target to be 2,360 GtCO2 whereas the estimate obtained using DICE 2016 R2 is about 460 GtCO2. Nordhaus's estimate of the remaining carbon budget for this target is hence five times lower than estimates made by our updated DICE. We also compare our results with estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and find our results to be in line with the carbon budgets presented in IPCC SR 1.5. We explain the reasons behind the difference between our result and that of Nordhaus and propose that an updated climate module in DICE is warranted. © 2021. The Authors.

Hydrogen is a non-toxic energy carrier that could serve as a good alternative to fossil fuels. The use of hydrogen vehicles could help reduce carbon emissions thereby cutting down on greenhouse gases and environmental pollution. This could largely be achieved when hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources and is easily accessible through a widespread network of hydrogen refuelling stations. In this study, the techno-economic assessment was performed for a wind-powered hydrogen refuelling station in seven cities of South Africa. The aim is to determine the optimum configuration of a hydrogen refuelling station powered by wind energy resources for each of the cities as well as to determine their economic viability and carbon emission reduction capability. The stations were designed to cater for 25 hydrogen vehicles every day, each with a 5 kg tank capacity. The results show that a wind-powered hydrogen refuelling station is viable in South Africa with the cost of hydrogen production ranging from 6.34 $/kg to 8.97 $/kg. These costs are competitive when compared to other costs of hydrogen production around the world. The cities located in the coastal region of South Africa are more promising for siting wind powered-hydrogen refuelling station compared to the cities located on the mainland. The hydrogen refuelling stations could reduce the CO2 and CO emissions by 73.95 tons and 0.133 tons per annum, respectively. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hydrogen refuelling station; Hydrogen vehicles; South Africa; Transport sector; Wind energy","Carbon; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Vehicles; Carbon emissions; Energy; Energy carriers; High carbons; Hydrogen refueling stations; Hydrogen vehicles; Non-toxic; Optimal design; South Africa; Transport sectors; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109046030

However, there are still large discrepancies in satellite and numerical model-derived cloud datasets over the Arctic region due to a lack of observations. Here, we report observations of cloud base height (CBH) characteristics measured using a Vaisala CL51 ceilometer at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. The study highlights the monthly and seasonal CBH characteristics at the location. It is found that almost 40% of the lowest CBHs fall within a height range of 0.5–1 km. The second and third cloud bases that could be detected by the ceilometer are mostly concentrated below 3 km during summer but possess more vertical spread during the winter season. Thin and low-level clouds appear to be dominant during the summer. Low-level clouds are found to be dominant and observed in 76% of cases. The mid and high-level clouds occur in ~16% and ~7% of cases, respectively. Further, micro rain radar (MRR2) observed enhanced precipitation and snowfall events during the winter and spring which are found to be associated with the lowest CBHs within 2 km from the ground. The frontal process associated with synoptic-scale meteorological conditions explains the variabilities in CBH and precipitation at the observation site when compared for two contrasting winter precipitation events. The findings of the study could be useful for model evaluation of cloud precipitation relationships and satellite data validation in the Arctic environment. © 2021 by the authors.

To fully realize the benefits of modular-scale systems, however, it is crucial for the cost of the required CO2 capture to remain low, even at reduced flow rates compared with large-scale IGCC-CCS power plants. In this work, the CO2 capture process in seven pre-combustion power plant with capacities ranging from 54 to 543 MW was modeled using Aspen Plus v8.8. Four physical solvents (PEGPDMS-1, PEGPDMS-3, [bmim][Tf2N], and [emim][Tf2N]) were used to capture CO2 from a typical sulfur-free fuel gas streams in a countercurrent packed-bed absorber. The experimental solubilities of the fuel gas components in the solvents were modeled using the PC-SAFT Equation-of-State. For each power plant capacity, the absorber flooding was checked for all solvents under the operating conditions used. The simulation results showed that increasing power plant capacity from 54 to 543 MW increased the operating expenditure (OPEX) from 2.6 to 30 MM$/year and the capital expenditure (CAPEX) from 10 to 58 MM$. On the other hand, increasing power plant capacity decreased the OPEX and CAPEX expressed in $/ton CO2 captured, reducing the levelized cost of the CO2 capture (LCOC) of the process from 12.50 to 7.58 $/ton CO2 captured, which was attributed to the increased tonnage of the CO2 removed © 2021","Aspen Plus; Capital cost; CO2 capture; IGCC; Ionic liquids; Levelized cost; Mellapak 250Y; Operating cost; PEGPDMS; Physical solvents; Pre-combustion; [bmim][Tf2N]; [emim][Tf2N]","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Equations of state of gases; Fuels; Packed beds; Precombustion; Solvents; Capital expenditures; Operating condition; Packed bed absorbers; PC-SAFT equation; Physical solvent; Power plant capacities; Research communities; Synthesis reactors; Combined cycle power plants; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; combustion; ionic liquid; power plant; solvent",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107677975

A systematic investigation was carried out in order to understand the influence of deposition temperature on the structure, surface morphology, composition, linear and third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, photoluminescence and electrical characteristic of the deposited films. The rise in the deposition temperature led to increase in crystallinity and transmittance of the films. The films deposited at 450 °C showed the highest crystallite size, lesser dislocation density and fibrous surface morphology. The films deposited at 450 °C showed the highest transmittance of around 90% in the visible region and a direct energy band gap of 3.9 eV. Increase in the deposition temperature also reduced the film resistivity and enhanced the carrier concentration. The film deposited at 450 °C possessed the maximum carrier concentration of 2.04 × 1020 cm−3 and minimum resistivity of 0.2483 Ω cm. It was also observed that the deposition temperature influenced on photoluminescent emission and the third-order nonlinear properties of the films. The photoluminescence spectra analysis of the deposited films indicated the existence of oxygen vacancies and other defects which led to nearly a white light emission. The film deposited at 450 °C showed a nonlinear absorption coefficient, nonlinear refractive index and susceptibility of 0.72 cm/W, 5.74 × 10−3 cm2/W and 7.29 × 10−3 esu, respectively. These films exhibited optical limiting behaviour and the obtained least limiting threshold was 1.1 kJ/cm2. The results clearly showed the applicability of spray pyrolyzed SnO2 thin films deposited at 450 °C in optoelectronic and nonlinear devices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Nonlinear optics; Optical limiting.; Photoluminescence; Spray pyrolysis; Tin oxide","Carrier concentration; Conductive films; Crystallinity; Crystallite size; Deposition; Energy gap; Morphology; Nonlinear optics; Optical films; Oxide films; Refractive index; Spray pyrolysis; Surface morphology; Thin films; Tin oxides; Deposited films; Deposition temperatures; Linear order; Optical limiting.; Polycrystalline; SnO$-2$; Structure ordering; Thin-films; Third order nonlinear optical properties; Tin oxide films; Photoluminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105286776

Both deforestation and forest degradation influence carbon loss and greenhouse gas emissions and thus must be included in activity data reporting estimates, such as for the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) program. Here, we report on efforts to develop forest degradation mapping capacity in Nepal based on a pilot project in the country’s Terai region, an ecologically complex physiographic area. To strengthen Nepal’s estimates of deforestation and forest degradation, we applied the Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) algorithm, which uses a time series of the Normalized Degradation Fraction Index (NDFI) to monitor forest canopy disturbances. CODED can detect low-grade degradation events and provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Using an iterative process, we were able to create a model that provided acceptable accuracy and area estimates of forest degradation and deforestation in Terai that can be applied to the whole country. We found that between 2010 and 2020, the area affected by disturbance was substantially larger than the deforested area, over 105,650 hectares compared to 2753 hectares, respectively. Iterating across multiple parameters using the CODED algorithm in the Terai region has provided a wealth of insights not only for detecting forest degradation and deforestation in Nepal in support of activity data estimation but also for the process of using tools like CODED in applied settings. We found that model performance, measured using producer’s and user’s accuracy, varied dramatically based on the model parameters specified. We determined which parameters most altered the results through an iterative process; those parameters are described here in depth. Once CODED is combined with the description of each parameter and how it affects disturbance monitoring in a complex environment, this degradation-sensitive detection process has the potential to be highly attractive to other developing countries in the REDD+ program seeking to accurately monitor their forests. © 2021 by the authors.

Particulate matter (PM) is a critical factor in air pollution-associated CVD. PM forms in the air during the combustion of fuels as solid particles and liquid droplets and the sources of airborne PM range from dust and dirt to soot and smoke. The health impacts of PM inhalation are well documented. In the US, where CVD is already the leading cause of death, it is estimated that PM2.5 (PM &lt; 2.5 μm in size) is responsible for nearly 200,000 premature deaths annually. Despite the public health data, definitive mechanisms underlying PM-associated CVD are elusive. However, evidence to-date implicates mechanisms involving oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolic dysfunction and dyslipidemia, contributing to vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis, along with autonomic dysfunction and hypertension. For the benefit of susceptible individuals and individuals who live in areas where PM levels exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, interventional strategies for mitigating PM-associated CVD are necessary. This review will highlight current state of knowledge with respect to mechanisms for PM-dependent CVD. Based upon these mechanisms, strategies for intervention will be outlined. Citing data from animal models and human subjects, these highlighted strategies include: 1) antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C, carnosine, sulforaphane and resveratrol, to reduce oxidative stress and systemic inflammation; 2) omega-3 fatty acids, to inhibit inflammation and autonomic dysfunction; 3) statins, to decrease cholesterol accumulation and inflammation; 4) melatonin, to regulate the immune-pineal axis and 5) metformin, to address PM-associated metabolic dysfunction.

Kennedy (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), and Charlotte- Douglas (CLT). We utilize these coefficients in an attainment/nonattainment emission decrease/increase analysis to determine the importance of including second order sensitivity coefficients for quantifying O3 and PM2.5 concentration responses to LTO aircraft emission reductions near the airport. Sensitivity coefficients help to determine distinct chemical regimes, NOX-limited versus NOX-inhibited for the case of O3 formation, and NH3-rich versus NH3-poor for the case of PM2.5 formation. Overall, we find that NOX LTO emissions are the largest contributor to any potential nonlinearity in O3 and PM2.5 formation through LTO emissions. However, when utilizing Taylor series expansions to estimate O3 and PM2.5 concentration responses under LTO emission perturbation scenarios, differences in responses calculated using only first order coefficients and responses calculated using both first and second order coefficients were less than 1% for LTO emission perturbations less than 100%. Hence, we find from the results in this study that first order sensitivity coefficients are sufficient for constructing accurate LTO emissions perturbation scenarios. This study also demonstrates through the analyses performed, an illustration of how HDDM-based sensitivity calculations can be used to assess sector-specific impacts on attainment designations. © 2021 The Authors","Aircraft; Airport; CMAQ; DDM; Nonlinear; O3; PM2.5; Sensitivity","Air transportation; Aircraft; Airports; Ammonia; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Aircraft emissions; Community multi-scale air quality models; DDM; First-order sensitivity; Nonlinear; O3; PM$-2.5$; Second-order sensitivity; Sensitivity; Sensitivity coefficient; Air quality; air quality; airline industry; airport; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; concentration (composition); particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; air quality; aircraft; airport; article; calculation; California; concentration response; Illinois; Kansas; Massachusetts; mental capacity; New York; nonlinear system; particulate matter 2.5; quantitative analysis; Arizona; Boston; Charlotte; Durham [North Carolina]; Kansas City; Massachusetts; Missouri; North Carolina; Raleigh; Tucson; United States; Atlanta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102481782

Although awareness of climate change is growing, few are willing to alter their flight behaviour. Through a qualitative analysis of interview materials collected from Reykjavik Capital Region residents, this study explores how globally affluent, highly mobile young urbanites justify their international travel by plane, despite their climate change awareness, and if they are willing to change their behaviour. Six themes of justifications to continue air travel were identified; shifting responsibility, compensatory behaviours, lack of knowledge or awareness, lack of other options, benefits outweighing impacts, and carbon offsetting. Their use differed depending on respondents’ level of climate change awareness and willingness to reduce air travel, but willingness to reduce travel did not differ between awareness level scores. None were willing to quit flying regardless of their level of awareness. Compared with previous literature, we found a greater emphasis placed on the benefits of air travel. We suggest policy uptake for both individual and collective realms, such as kerosene tax and mandatory carbon offsetting, as shifting responsibility can delay action regardless of the way in which it is shifted, and reductions in these realms can only happen in concert. Other sources of well-being should be emphasized and the social norm around frequent travel actively challenged. Knowledge on the specific climate impacts of flights should be better communicated to the public and put into perspective with the global fair share of emissions and steep mitigation curves to keep warming below 1.5°. © 2021 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies","Aviation; Behavioural change; Climate change concern; Justifications",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105843612

However, the control of their properties, especially ECL, remains elusive and afflicted by a series of problems. Here, the authors report CDs that display ECL in water via coreactant ECL, which is the dominant mechanism in biosensing applications. They take advantage of a multicomponent bottom-up approach for preparing and studying the luminescence properties of CDs doped with a dye acting as PL and ECL probe. The dependence of luminescence properties on the surface chemistry is further reported, by investigating the PL and ECL response of CDs with surfaces rich in primary, methylated, or propylated amino groups. While precursors that contribute to the core characterize the PL emission, the surface states influence the efficiency of the excitation-dependent PL emission. The ECL emission is influenced by surface states from the organic shell, but states of the core strongly interact with the surface, influencing the ECL efficiency. These findings offer a framework of pre- and post-synthetic design strategies to improve ECL emission properties, opening new opportunities for exploring biosensing applications of CDs. © 2021 The Authors.

The generalizable framework is designed with a flexibility and logic that allows for refinement to accompany stakeholder review processes and highly localized decision-making.

By design, the meta-level framework enables utility decision-makers, regulators, insurers, and communities to analyze and track levels of resilience safeguards for a given system.

This is why green building and energy efficient technologies, especially photovoltaic (PV) systems, have been widely applied in new and existing constructions. They can, however, cause a new intractable challenge, i.e., fire safety. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the increasing number of scientific studies on photovoltaic system fire safety. Real fire incidents and faults in PV systems are briefly discussed, more particularly, original fire scenarios and victim fire scenarios. Moreover, studies on fire characteristics of photovoltaic systems and the suggested mitigation strategies are summarized. Hence, the focus of this paper is on fire safety of the system which is not only limited to surveying the existing literature but also detecting the research gaps. The analysis reveals that a PV fire incident is a complex and multi-faceted topic that cannot be simplified to a single variable causing a single outcome. This calls for stronger integration of all aspects while studying the cause of the fire and the resulting combustion products. Overall, this paper is envisioned to assist the researchers in the field of PV systems by mapping the fire characteristics of photovoltaic and helps to develop fire prevention strategies for building designers and decision-making authorities. © 2021","Combustion; Fire characteristics; Fire safety; Mitigation strategies; Photovoltaic (PV) systems","Combustion; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fireproofing; Greenhouse gases; Photovoltaic cells; Buildings sector; Energy efficient technology; Fire characteristic; Fire safety; Fire scenarios; In-buildings; Mitigation strategy; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; State-of-the art reviews; Fires",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105581334

From a sample of 115 respondents drawn from South Africa and Kenya and through interviews, discussions and interactions, this paper demonstrates that local residents deploy their indigenous knowledge in predicting seasonal weather and rainfall patterns, determining wind speed and direction, preserving grains for planting purposes and various traditional farming support systems to lessen the impacts of climate change on their agricultural activities. The paper concludes that merging local knowledge with modern science in Africa could help develop a syncretic agronomical knowledge amongst farmers in handling climate change. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Indigenous knowledge; Kenya; Small-scale agriculture; South Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111011832

The smog episodes were characterized by the high concentration of PM10, and were linked to a thermal inversion period in November 2011 in Hungary, when an anticyclone occurred across Europe. The sources of PM2.5 and PMcoarse were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF). Additionally, the source locations were explored by using the conditional probability function (CPF). A numerical weather prediction model (WRF) was also applied to evaluate the air pollution situation. In order to meet the goals of the study, the elemental composition with high (2-h) time resolution, the elemental size distribution, and the planetary boundary layer were examined in an urban background site of downtown Debrecen, Hungary. Our results highlight the importance of biomass burning (39%) and traffic (31%) as the major contributors to PM2.5. The main tracers of these sources (K, Cl, Pb, Zn) appeared mainly in droplet mode (0.5–1 μm). The major sources of PMcoarse fraction were soil (32%), and dust attributed to tramline construction (30%). The combination of PMF and CPF results revealed that the PM10 concentrations were affected by sources within the urban agglomeration of Debrecen (city centre and suburban areas) under the given meteorological conditions. This conclusion is further validated by the fact that the diurnal variation of the identified source contributions presented a distinct pattern that depended strongly on the daily activities of the city’s residents (compared to the usually unstructured diurnals of transported sources). © 2021, The Author(s).","CPF; Elemental composition with high time resolution; Elemental size distribution; Smog episodes; Source apportionment","aerosol; anticyclone; diurnal variation; particulate matter; smog; source identification; Debrecen; Europe; Hajdu-Bihar; Hungary; Hungary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104228366

The answer is crucial for the design and effectiveness of policy regimes intended to mitigate environmental damage. We investigate whether particular types of firms are more likely to be proactive; in other words, which firms tend to behave in a manner most consistent with the desired policy outcomes. Using data on per-firm ‘verified’ and ‘allocated’ emissions from the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) from 2005 till 2016, and given that some firms exceed or undershoot the allocated allowances by a large margin, we posit that this and related measures are useful proxies for a firm's proactiveness in responding to environmental policy. We find that public firms are less likely than private firms to be proactive, whilst the same is found for firms in common rather than civil law countries and for state-owned firms. Strikingly, proactiveness is associated both with greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and poorer firm performance, suggesting there is an economic cost to good environmental behaviour. Whilst the EU ETS is reducing emissions, it is not yet adequately compensating proactive firms or penalizing those who pollute – better system design could aid this further. © 2020 British Academy of Management",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078657341

During composting, the emission of undesirable odor adversely affects compost quality and causes environmental deterioration. Also, odor emission from composting adversely affects human health and well-being. Ammonia (NH3), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are major components of odorous gases responsible for unpleasant odor. Physiological parameters such as pH, temperature, and aeration affect the pattern of odor emission during the composting process. The lack of techniques for the accurate identification and estimation of odor and control are some major challenges associated with composting. Therefore, the present review article concentrates on challenges and solutions to odor control. Biotrickling filter, optimization of process parameters, usage of additives, microbial inoculation, and pre-treatment techniques are practiced to lower odor emission during the process. The application of metagenomics may provide insight into the various biogeochemical pathways that can be explored in the future for odor control. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Biotrickling filter; Composting; Greenhouse gas; Metagenomics; Microbial diversity; Odor emission","Additives; Ammonia; Biofilters; Composting; Deterioration; Hydrogen sulfide; Physiological models; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Waste treatment; Bio-trickling filters; Biological decomposition; Composting operations; Composting process; Environmental deterioration; Microbial inoculation; Optimization of process parameters; Physiological parameters; Odor control; ammonia; carbon; carboxylic acid; fragrance; hydrogen sulfide; nitrogen; volatile organic compound; aeration; ammonification; composting; control strategy; decomposition; ecosystem; greenhouse gas; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; moisture; nitrification; nonhuman; odor; odor control; organic waste; pattern recognition; pH; pollution; process optimization; Review; temperature; air pollutant; metabolism; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Composting; Hydrogen Sulfide; Odorants; Volatile Organic Compounds",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101731191

This study investigates a supply chain system consisting of a capital-constrained manufacturer and a well-funded supplier facing uncertain demand, in which the manufacturer may seek GCF from banks. An important prerequisite for obtaining a green loan is that the borrower must make green upgrades and ensure compliance with pre-specified environmental standards. We design a GCF model for a supply chain by imposing a hard constraint on carbon emissions. To determine the effectiveness of GCF, we conduct an in-depth analysis comparing the GCF with traditional trade credit financing (TCF), in which excessive carbon emissions are penalized. The optimal equilibrium solutions under GCF and TCF mode are obtained and their sensitivities to key parameters analyzed. Concerning the preferences of the two financing strategies, we find that under a relatively strict carbon emission policy, the manufacturer can set an appropriate green investment range to achieve a win-win situation with the supplier. Finally, we compare the social welfare of the supply chain for the different financing modes and find that there are regions in which both the social welfare and profit of the manufacturer can be a win-win. The government can guide manufacturers to make a win-win choice by setting different carbon caps. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission; Game theory; Green credit; Supply chain management; Trade credit","Carbon; Commerce; Investments; Regulatory compliance; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Environmental standards; Equilibrium solutions; Financial service; Financing strategies; In-depth analysis; Investment range; Supply chain systems; Trade credit financings; Green manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096016970

The influence of BC on O3 has thus received much attention. In this study, Mie scattering and the tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible radiation model are used to analyze the effect of BC optical properties on radiation. Combined with data of O3 precursors in Nanjing in 2014, an EKMA curve is drawn, and the variations in O3 concentration are further investigated using a zero-dimensional box mechanism model (NCAR MM). When O3 precursors are unchanged, radiation and O3 show a highly similar tendency in response to changing BC optical properties (R=0.997). With the increase of modal radius, the attenuation of fresh BC to radiation and O3 first trends upward before decreasing. In the mixing process, the attenuation of BC to radiation and O3 presents an upward tendency with the increase of relative humidity but decreases rapidly before increasing slowly with increasing thickness of coating. In addition, mass concentration is another major factor. When the BC to PM2.5 ratio increases to 5% in Nanjing, the radiation decreases by approximately 0.13%–3.71% while O3 decreases by approximately 8.13%–13.11%. The radiative effect of BC not only reduces O3 concentration but also changes the EKMA curve. Compared with the NOx control area, radiation has a significant influence on the VOCs control area. When aerosol optical depth (AOD) increases by 17.15%, the NOx to VOCs ratio decreases by 8.27%, and part of the original NOx control area is transferred to the VOCs control area. © 2021, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","black carbon; EKMA curve; optical properties; ozone; radiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107550599

Here, time-resolved surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR-SERS) is employed to successfully monitor the dynamics of CO2RR intermediates and Cu surfaces with sub-second time resolution. Anodic treatment at 1.55 V vs. RHE and subsequent surface oxide reduction (below −0.4 V vs. RHE) induced roughening of the Cu electrode surface, which resulted in hotspots for TR-SERS, enhanced time resolution (down to ≈0.7 s) and fourfold improved CO2RR efficiency toward ethylene. With TR-SERS, the initial restructuring of the Cu surface was followed (&lt;7 s), after which a stable surface surrounded by increased local alkalinity was formed. Our measurements revealed that a highly dynamic CO intermediate, with a characteristic vibration below 2060 cm−1, is related to C−C coupling and ethylene production (−0.9 V vs. RHE), whereas lower cathodic bias (−0.7 V vs. RHE) resulted in gaseous CO production from isolated and static CO surface species with a distinct vibration at 2092 cm−1. © 2021 The Authors.

While these measures helped prevent the community spread of the virus, the resulting environmental benefits of lockdown remained mostly unnoticed. While many studies documented improvements in air quality index, very few have explored the reduction in black carbon (BC) aerosols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations due to lockdown. In this study, we evaluated the changes in concentrations of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 before and during the lockdown period. Our results show that lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in concentrations of these pollutants. The average mass concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 before the lockdown was 11.71 ± 3.33 μgm−3, 108.71 ± 27.77 ngm−3, and 147.65 ± 41.77 μgm−3, respectively. During the lockdown period, the concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 was 2.46 ± 0.95 μgm−3, 23.19 ± 11.21 ngm−3, and 50.31 ± 11.95 μgm−3, respectively. The diagnostic ratio analysis for source apportionment showed changes in the emission sources before and during the lockdown. The primary sources of PAHs emissions before the lockdown were biomass, coal combustion, and vehicular traffic, while during the lockdown, PAHs emissions were primarily from the combustion of biomass and coal.

The modeling and evaluation of the probabilistic behavior of air pollution are crucial in providing useful information that can help in managing the environmental risk and planning for the adverse effects of air pollution. For modeling of air pollution, several statistical approaches have been considered; however, only a few approaches have been used for addressing the uncertainty in the analysis. This study proposes a new application of the Markov chain-based fuzzy states (MCFS) model using triangular fuzzy numbers for analysing the uncertainty in the occurrence of air pollution events and describing the transition behaviour of air pollution. In this study, the air pollution index (API) data collected from the city of Klang in Malaysia for a period between 2012 and 2014 is considered in the analysis. Based on the API data, a five-state Markov chain is considered for representing the five fuzzy states of air pollution. The fuzzy transition probabilities are estimated and used to determine the characteristics of air pollution such as the steady state probabilities and the mean first passage time for each state of air pollution. The findings show that, in general, the risk of occurrences for unhealthy events in Klang is small, nonetheless remains notably troubling. The results demonstrate that the MCFS can effectively model the air pollution index and it could be a better option in predicting air pollution. It may provide valuable information and more understanding about the dynamics of air pollution to the experts and policymakers. This will enable them to develop proper strategies to manage air quality. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution index; Fuzzy logic; Markov chains; Mean return time; Steady state","Air quality; Fuzzy sets; Uncertainty analysis; Air pollution index; Environmental risks; Markov chain models; Mean first passage time; Probabilistic behavior; State probability; Statistical approach; Triangular fuzzy numbers; Markov chains; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; estimation method; fuzzy mathematics; index method; Markov chain; return period; air pollution; air quality; article; fuzzy logic; human; Malaysia; Markov chain; probability; sensitivity analysis; steady state; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109373518

Deploying a combination of renewable energy systems with hydrogen production as the excess energy storage mechanism could be a sustainable long-term approach for addressing some of the energy problems of Afghanistan. Since Badakhshan is known to have a higher average wind speed than any other Afghan province, in this study, a technical, economic, and carbon footprint assessment was performed to investigate the potential for wind power and hydrogen production in this province. Wind data of four stations in Badakhshan were used for technical assessment for three heights of 10, 30, and 40 m using the Weibull probability distribution function. This technical assessment was expanded by estimating the energy pattern factor, probability of wind speeds greater than 5 m/s, wind power density, annual power output, and annual hydrogen output. This was followed by an economic assessment, which involved computing the Leveled Cost Of Energy (LCOE), the Leveled Cost Of Hydrogen (LCOH), and the payback period, and finally an carbon footprint assessment, which involved estimating the consequent CO2 reduction in two scenarios. The assessments were performed for 22 turbines manufactured by reputable companies with capacities ranging from 600 kW to 2.3 MW. The results showed that the entire Badakhshan province, and especially Qal'eh-ye Panjeh and Fayazabad, have excellent potentials in terms of wind energy that can be harvested for wind power and hydrogen production. Also, wind power generation in this province will be highly cost-effective, as the produced electricity will cost about one-third of the price of electricity supplied by the government. For better evaluation, the GIS maps of wind power and hydrogen outputs were prepared using the IDW method. These maps showed that the eastern and northeastern parts of Badakhshan province have higher wind power-hydrogen production potentials. The results of ranking the stations with SWARA-EDAS hybrid MCDM methods showed that Qal'eh-ye Panjeh station was the best location to produce hydrogen from wind energy. © 2021","Assessment of hydrogen production; Carbon footprint assessment; Economic assessment; GIS; Multi-criteria decision-making; Technical assessment","Carbon footprint; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Distribution functions; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Weibull distribution; Wind; Wind power; Cost of energies; Economic assessments; Energy pattern factor; Renewable energy systems; Storage mechanism; Technical assessment; Weibull probability distribution; Wind power density; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110374356

The paper discusses employing renewable energy sources as an alternative solution for the national grid to feed rural areas in Oman because air pollution is escalating due to the fast growth and the industrialization. The research has taken the load estimation in an Omani desert village called Yanqul, which necessitates about 40 MW. The paper has finalized that installing 12 units of the wind turbine 36 MW with 30 MW Solar Panels is feasible. The approach has included the module sizing calculations using the Power World Simulator, and HOMER Pro software for economic consideration and operational costs. The paper has encouraged using renewable energy as an alternative method over the traditional transmission system due to the technical issues connected with losses, power factor, synchronization, and pollution. The Levelized cost of renewable energy was found $1,366.56, which is cheaper than extending the national grid. This reduction has appeared on annual electricity bill per capita, which dropped to $581.3. Environmentally, the study has shown a reduction in CO 2 emissions by 22 tons, making value to air quality.

Efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of the National Health Service (NHS) have been broadly focused on reducing demand, through prevention and patient empowerment, and modifying supply side factors by focusing on lean care systems and low carbon alternatives. This narrative review concentrates on supply side factors to identify sustainable practices with a focus on actions that could be implemented in dermatology departments. For this study, a literature review was conducted In MEDLINE in April 2020. The search terms included ‘environmental sustainability’ and ‘climate change’ with ‘dermatology’, ‘telemedicine’, ‘NHS’, ‘surgery’ and ‘operating theatres’. Out of 95 results, 20 were deemed relevant to the review. Although the review showed that there is clearly growing interest in environmental sustainability, the identified literature lacked examples of comprehensive implementation and evaluation of initiatives. The literature discussed distinct areas including transport, waste management and procurement as part of a lean healthcare system. A number of papers highlighted the potential contribution of carbon-reducing actions without citing verifiable outcome data. This narrative review highlights the need for detailed environmental impact assessments of treatment options in dermatology, in tandem with economic analysis. In conclusion, we have identified a clear need for evidence-based guidance setting out implementable actions with identifiable benefits achievable within local clinical teams. This will require engagement between clinicians, patients and healthcare organizations. © 2020 British Association of Dermatologists",,"carbon; carbon footprint; climate change; dermatology; empowerment; environmental impact assessment; environmental sustainability; evidence based practice; health care organization; health care system; human; patient engagement; Review; risk reduction; telemedicine; waste management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099246446

The main goal of this experiment was to assess the effect of urease inhibitors on N use efficiency, N losses, and their economic impact in a maize-wheat field experiment. In this study, 10 treatments were compared, combining the urea fertilizer with or without urease inhibitor, applied in one or two dressings, and under optimal or sub-optimal irrigation. A single application of urease inhibitor (IN1d), coupled with the conventional urea, helped to reduce the nitrate leaching risk both during the maize period (even when compared to the two dressing treatment) and after harvest. In addition, this improvement was achieved together with an increase in economic benefit, even when compared with the application of the same amount of regular urea split into two dressings. Under low water availability systems, the benefits of applying urease inhibitors increased with respect to the application of regular urea, making this technique a very promising strategy for adaptation to climate change in arid and semiarid regions. © 2021 by the authors.","Ammonia volatilization; Fertilizer management; Nitrate leaching; Sustainable cropping systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111084614

This problem has been studied in cold weather, but it also takes place in warm climates such as those of Mediterranean countries, and it has not been widely targeted. In these countries, approximately 70% of its building stock was built during 1960–1980, its renovation being an opportunity to reduce its energy demand, improve tenants’ quality of life, and make it more resilient to climate change. In the retrofitting process, it is also important to consider tenants’ adaptability and regional scenarios. In this sense, the present work proposes an assessment model of retrofitting projects that takes into consideration energy consumption, comfort, tenants’ health, and monetary poverty. For this, the Index of Vulnerable Homes was implemented in this research to consider adaptive comfort in the energy calculation as well as the adaptability to climate change.

The optimisation analysis is performed for four different thermal insulation materials (glass wool, rock wool, extruded polystyrene, and expanded polystyrene). Natural gas is chosen as fuel for heating purposes, and horizontal perforated brick is preferred in the wall. One of the original features in this study is environmental analysis to determine the CO2 emission for the insulated wall in Turkey provinces. Another feature is that it has the most up-to-date data about HDD values and fuel and insulation material costs. The worst and best insulation materials are obtained as rock wool and glass wool, respectively. The optimum insulation layer thickness for the best case is varied between 0.07 m and 0.23 m, depending on the HDD values of provinces. The annual total energy saving cost is in the range of 4.4–53.5 $/(m2year), and the payback period is 0.11–0.38 years. Besides, the reduction in annual CO2 emission is changed between 53.2% and 94% for the best case, compared to the uninsulated wall. © 2021.

In the Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and Storage framework, Municipal Solid Waste is regarded as the main fuel for the system. To administer the analysis, a combination of a downdraft gasifier, a directly fired-gas turbine, Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell, Organic Rankine Cycle, and cryogenic CO2 separation unit is considered. The proposed integration is investigated from themodynamic, exergoeconomic, and environmental points of view. The multi-objective optimization is also conducted to minimize the CO2 emission and cost of electricity besides maximizing the overall exergy efficiency. By applying the optimum values for decision parameters, exergetic and economic results indicate that the combustion chamber and downdraft gasifier are identified as the component with maximum exergy destruction rate (17.44% and 14.59% of the total, respectively) due to high combustion and chemical reactions inefficiencies. Also, the net energy and exergy efficiency, cost of electricity, and specific CO2 emission result as 51.65%, 45.98%, 80.59 USD/MWh, and 101.20 kgCO2/kWh for the proposed system, respectively.

The emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gasses cause global warming. Most carbon emissions come from energy sectors, whereas transportation, industrial, and residential sectors are among the chief contributors. The present study investigates the effect of fiscal policy instruments, economic development, and foreign direct investment (FDI) on the sectoral emissions in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries. The data used in this study is taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) for the period between 2000 and 2018. Dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) have been used to analyze the long-run impact of fiscal policy instruments, economic development, and FDI on CO2 emissions from transportation, energy, and industrial sectors. Furthermore, the pairwise Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test was used to authorize the causal relationship among the variables under consideration. The results reveal that fiscal policy instruments, per capita gross domestic product, FDI, and CO2 emissions show a strong correlation in the industrial, electrical, and transportation sectors. Furthermore, it is shown that public spending is a more reliable tool to reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation and industrial sectors in the BRI region. This study provides useful information for policy-makers on taking preventive and corrective measures to reduce CO2 emissions in different sectors and promote sustainable development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Belt and Road Initiative; Fiscal policy instruments; Sectoral CO2 emissions","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; correlation; fiscal policy; foreign direct investment; global warming; policy making; public spending; transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101538916

Moreover, the optimum insulation thicknesses of the buildings that have both heating and cooling needs were determined for these insulation materials by means of Life Cycle Cost Analysis. The annual energy needs per unit area of the external walls of the buildings, which are insulated according to their optimum insulation thickness were determined and correspondingly the amount of fuel needed to meet this energy was calculated. In the study, CO2 emission values released from buildings to atmosphere were compared in terms of fuel amounts obtained from total energy demands during heating supplied from natural gas and cooling supplied from electricity of the residential buildings insulated with diverse insulation materials. Consequently, when CO2 reduction potentials of the buildings insulated with materials in the optimum insulation thickness are compared with those of the uninsulated buildings, insulation material providing highest potential in CO2 emission mitigation was to be found as Rock wool. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Housing; Insulating materials; Life cycle; Mineral wool; Wool; Yarn; External walls; Heating and cooling; Insulation materials; Life cycle cost analysis; Optimum insulation thickness; Reduction potential; Residential building; Thermal insulation materials; Thermal insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110488569

Drawing from a resident survey (n = 484) and applying a series of regression and mediation analyses, we tested the power of the VIP model in our sample to examine the influence of values, environmental self-identity, and personal norms on PSB while adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Our study revealed participants who held altruistic values (i.e., cared for the community, valued diversity and gender equality, and made decisions based on cooperation) had stronger environmental self-identity characterized by a belief that reflects biocentrism, ecofeminism, ecospirituality, or deep ecology. These identities were significantly associated with participation in more effective PSB after adjusting for personal norms. Participants with egoistic values had stronger anthropocentric identity and weaker personal norms which translated into lower participation in more effective PSB. Also, education increased PSB, with master's degree holders participating more than other groups. Overall, values, environmental self-identity, and higher education predicted participation in effective PSB. Our refined theoretical model is, therefore, promising for assessing multiple PSB at once, especially those that significantly reduce carbon footprint on the planet. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Education; Environmental self-identity; Portland; Pro-sustainable behaviors; Socio-demographics; Value-identity-personal norm model","altruism; anthropogenic effect; carbon footprint; higher education; numerical model; participatory approach; regression analysis; adult; article; carbon footprint; demography; drawing; ecology; education; female; gender equity; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mediation analysis; Oregon; resident; theoretical study; demography; ecology; Oregon; questionnaire; Oregon; Portland [Oregon]; United States; Demography; Ecology; Humans; Oregon; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104089876

The current study estimated the inward foreign direct investment (IFDI)-augmented EKCs for China’s 27 provincial divisions employing the advanced econometric methodologies involving cross-sectional dependence, slope heterogeneity, and second generation-based estimation procedures. The study has further contributed through a modification to “Stochastic Influence by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology” (STIRPAT) in terms of including IFDI to the standard model. Accordingly, this work estimated the standard EKC (involving economic development-carbon emissions linkage) as well as IFDI-carbon emissions linkage within the STIRPAT framework, by employing a panel vector error-correction-based estimation procedure. The findings revealed that (1) the conventional EKC estimates for national and regional samples (i.e., aggregate samples) presented linkages differing from the EKC links for the provincial divisions. It suggested that the EKC at the aggregated levels is likely the consequence of aggregation bias problem. (2) The links between IFDI (in power and non-power sector) and carbon emissions provided inverse U shape for the aggregate samples, while the provincial divisions presented heterogeneous results. This is perhaps because of the aggregation bias. Hence, the aggregation bias puzzle is unriddled. (3) Also, heterogeneous patterns are found in terms of turning points, degree of impact, and nature of the association of income and IFDI with carbon emissions. The meaningful policies can be extracted for the large countries encompassing varied economic development levels, such as China, if the EKC is evaluated at the disaggregate scales. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Aggregation bias; Carbon emissions; China; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Heterogeneous links; Inward foreign direct investment","economic development; environmental economics; environmental quality; foreign direct investment; investment; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon dioxide; China; cross-sectional study; economic development; statistical bias; Bias; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102022953

Therefore, vegetation response to climate change (VRCC) needs to be explored to foster specific-organised management programmes towards ecological conservation and targeted restoration policy to various climate extreme threats. This review aimed to explore the existing literature to characterise VRCC and to identify solutions and techniques fundamental in designing strategies for targeted effective adaptation and mitigation to achieve sustainable planning outcomes. Accordingly, this review emphasised recent theoretical and practical research on the vegetation-climate responses and their related impacts in the wake of climate change and its debilitating impacts on vegetation. Conse-quently, this study proposes the Information-based model (IBM), needed to examine Factors–forms of Impacts–Solutions (Techniques)–Risks assessment to identify and provide insights about VRCC in a given region. In conclusion, two enablers of adaptive indicators and the novel systems-based serve as a key policy formulation for sustainability in strengthening the goals of global involvement of local and sub-national governments and institutions in the effective management of vegetation and ecosystem protection. © 2021 by the authors.

This calls for adaptation strategies to optimize agricultural productions with minimal GHGs. This study aimed to identify these optimum agricultural managements in response to current and projected climatic scenarios for the Choctawhatchee Basin in Southeastern USA, an experimentally unexplored data-scarce region lacking validation data. This scenario-based modeling study analyzed a total of 1344 scenarios consisting of four major crops, eight managements (varying tillage, manuring, and residue), and forty climatic combinations under current as wells as two representative concentration pathways with process-based Denitrification and Decomposition (DNDC) model. The results indicated that the region’s GHGs and yields were most affected by higher temperatures (≥+3◦C) and extreme precipitation changes (≥±40%), while high atmospheric CO2 concentrations exerted positive fertilization effects. The manure-related and higher residue incorporation scenarios were found to be better options in varying climates with minimal present global warming potentials (GWP) of 0.23 k to −29.1 k MT equivalent CO2. As such, the study presented climate change impacts and potential mitigation options in the study region while presenting a framework to design GHG mitigation in similar data-scarce regions. © 2021 by the authors.

Four ‘Sandfish’ (Sfn) wells (Sfn-01, Sfn-02, Sfn-04 and Sfn-05), check-shots and 3D seismic data of five angle stacks (6–12°, 12–18°, 18–26°, 26–32° and 32–42°) were used in the study. Low frequency (0–2 Hz) models were generated from interpolation of high-cut-filtered compressional wave velocity log (P-sonic), shear wave velocity log (S-sonic) and density log guided by interpreted four seismic horizons. The low frequency models broaden the spectrum of the elastic volumes and also served as inversion constraints. The five partial angle stacks varying from 6–42° were simultaneously inverted using Jason’s Rock-Trace® inversion software which iterated trial inversions until the model sufficiently matched the seismic data. The near (6–12°) angle and far-far (32–42°) angle stacks were also inverted and compared with the inverted volumes from the simultaneous inversion. This was carried out to determine the effectiveness of near and far-far elastic impedance volume in delineating hydrocarbon reservoirs. The inverted elastic volumes P-impedance (ZP), S-impedance (ZS), density (ρ), near and far-far elastic and derived volumes lambda-rho (λρ), mu-rho (µρ), Poisson’s-ratio (σ) reveal vertical and lateral continuity of the reservoirs identified (K01, N01 and P01) at 2179 m, 2484 m and 3048 m, respectively. The delineated reservoirs showed good match with the sand tops away from the well control validated by a blind well test. The cross-plot of inverted ZP from simultaneous inversion and well ZP gave correlation coefficient of 86% indicative of high quality inverted volume which will reduce exploration risk. The plot of inverted ZP from simultaneous inversion and inverted far-far elastic volume reflected 82% correlation coefficient indicating that this method could be adopted in other fields with limited data and similar geological setting. Hence, the study has shown the efficacy of elastic volumes in delineating hydrocarbon reservoirs which can help locate optimum region for development wells. © 2021, The Author(s).","Elastic impedance volume; Far-far stack; Low frequency models; Near stack; Simultaneous inversion","Acoustic wave velocity; Gas industry; Geophysical prospecting; Hydrocarbons; Low pass filters; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Petroleum industry; Radioactivity logging; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Shear flow; Shear waves; Wave propagation; Well testing; Compressional wave velocity; Correlation coefficient; Geological setting; Global energy demand; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Oil and Gas Industry; Seismic inversion; Shear wave velocity; Oil well logging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108011045

However, wind generation has not been matched with integration solutions, which has led to high volumes of wind energy being dispatched down due to system stability issues and local network constraints. The deployment of energy storage portfolios within constrained areas to increase the consumption of variable renewables is assessed. Within constrained areas (constraint groups), storage portfolios are optimised using practical battery cost parameters to produce a range of portfolios that could alleviate constraints. The value streams that could make the deployment economically feasible are analysed, and the paybacks for the different deployment scenarios are obtained. In managing the variability of grid-integrated renewables, conventional network upgrades are cheaper under extant market arrangements but would only remove constraints: energy storage portfolios could eliminate both constraints and curtailments within each constraint group and could benefit from additional services through equitable market arrangements. In using the storage device for four-function services, the payback period certainly falls within the expected lifespan of the device; there are significant chances of having a payback period that falls within the expected lifespan when using the device for more than one service. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Constraints management; Energy storage policy; Locational storage value; Managing variable renewable energy; Northern Irish electricity grid; Storage market services",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110471147

Considering the current emphasis on the COP25 conference and the commitment to cut down carbon emissions level, this study also draws strength from the United Nations Sustainable development Goals (UNSDGs) that comprises of positive strides for access to clean and responsible energy consumption (SDGs 7, 12) and climate change mitigation issues (SDG-13). To this end, this study is a timely outlook that underpins the case of the European Union (EU) countries as well as the root cause of anthropogenic activities on clean trajectory of global environment. Hence, we investigate the connection between alternative and sustainable energy source, trade, income and emissions in 27 selected European Union economies by utilizing data covering the period 1990–2017 on an annual frequency. We used second-generation panel model estimators to analyze the relationship between the variables in the long-run. Specifically, the long run results from the MG (Mean Group), AMG (Augmented Mean Group), and CCEMG (Common Correlated Effects Mean Group) estimators reveal that sustainable and alternative energy sources have a negative significant impact on pollutant emissions while trade and income have a positive impact on carbon emissions except that the impact of trade is insignificant. Although the positive impact of openness in trade on carbon emission is insignificant, the positive impact suggests that the free-trade policy that is currently in place in the EU should further incorporate sustainable development goals (SDGs) to avoid the outsourcing of carbon emissions among the member countries. Causality tests reveal a feedback hypothesis between renewable energy, income, trade, and carbon emanations. The investigation proposes expanded utilization of sustainable power source to mitigate carbon emissions in the European Union. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental sustainability; European union; Income; Pollutant emissions; Renewable energy; Trade","Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Planning; Pollution; Alternative energy; Alternative energy source; Carbon emissions; Environmental sustainability; European union; Income; Longest run; Pollutants emissions; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy sources; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104598624

MENA is recognized as an active region in oil and gas production; this directly leads to increasing levels of ground ozone and particulate matter that affect human health. Other aspects of climate change, with key consequences for public health, are water, food, and vector-borne diseases, food insecurity, mental illness, and allergen-induced diseases. Some of the MENA countries are signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and actively contribute to sustaining a resilient climate that supports health and well-being. Several countries of MENA have submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) within their resources and capacities, many conditional on their economic growth. These INDCs provide a map for mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change. Through different domestic laws and policies, the INDCs introduce several institutional obligations to mitigate the adverse health impacts of climate change. The World Health Organization (WHO) has played an essential role in assessing the impacts of climate change and embracing several regional and domestic projects to tackle the resulting disease outcomes, most prominently witnessed in Malaria, with cholera and other gastrointestinal diseases. Other local initiatives are discussed in this chapter. Despite all of the embraced initiatives to maintain a climate resilient environment in MENA, integrating climate change considerations and policies into public health planning and vice versa, is still hindered across the region.

Here, we assess SWBs dilution capacity across the European continent to identify most vulnerable areas using information from centralized European databases. SWBs´ future dilution factor values are estimated based on representative concentration pathway scenarios impacts on rivers flow, and likely changes in European SWBs´ ecological status foretold. Results show that dilution factor in Europe increases by 5.4% in average. Yet, climate change effects are found to lead to a consistent dilution factor decrease for 11% of the 40074 European SWBs receiving WWTP discharge for the early century. This share reaches 17% for the midcentury period. We estimate that up to 42% of the SWBs receiving WWTP discharges and currently reaching a good ecological status show a 0.7 probability to have their ecological status downgraded due to climate change. Sites more vulnerable are located in the Mediterranean countries. Our findings highlight that climate change mitigation is essential for maintaining good ecological status in European SWBs. © 2021",,"Climate change; Ecology; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Centralised; Climate change impact; Dilution factors; Ecological status; Good ecological status; Plant discharge; Surface water body; Urban wastewater treatment plants; Vulnerable area; Waste water treatment plants; Dilution; surface water; climate change; climate effect; database; dilution; discharge; European Union; wastewater treatment plant; Article; climate change; data base; dilution factor; ecology; effluent; Europe; freshwater environment; hydrography; hydrological model; logistic regression analysis; mathematical parameters; priority journal; river; Southern Europe; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; water flow; climate change; environmental monitoring; Europe; water management; Europe; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Rivers; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105578697

Research in Spain began a little over twenty years ago, which was later than in other European countries, and it began in a heterogeneous way, both in the SUDS typology and spatially within the peninsular geography. The main objective of this work has been to know through bibliographic review the state of the art of scientific research of these systems and their relationship with the different types of climates in the country. These structures have a complex and sensitive dependence on the climate, which in the Iberian Peninsula is mostly type B and C (according to the Köppen classification). This means little water availability for the vegetation of some SUDS, which can affect the performance of the technique. To date, for this work, research has focused mainly on green roofs, their capabilities as a sustainable construction tool, and the performance of different plant species used in these systems in arid climates. The next technique with the most real cases analyzed is permeable pavements in temperate climates, proving to be effective in reducing flows and runoff volumes. Other specific investigations have focused on the economic feasibility of installing rainwater harvesting systems for the laundry and the hydraulic performance of retention systems located specifically in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. On the contrary, few scientific articles have appeared that describe other SUDS with vegetation such as bioretention systems or green ditches, which are characteristic of sustainable cities, on which the weather can be a very limiting factor for their development. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, Au/CeO2 proved to be an efficient catalyst in several reactions such as CO oxidation, water gas shift, and CO2 reduction. Here, by employing findings from operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the near and extended Au and Ce LIII energy edges, we focus on the fundamental aspects of highly active Au/CeO2 catalysts, mainly in the CO oxidation for understanding their complex structure-reactivity relationship. These results were combined with findings from in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, highlighting the changes of adlayer and ceria defects. For a comprehensive understanding, the spectroscopic findings will be supplemented by results of the dynamics of O2 activation obtained from Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP).

The experimental measurements were carried out at 338 K and atmospheric pressure according to EN1839 method T using the inert gases N2, CO2, He and Ar. The results showed that the ratio of the lower explosion limit in N2O (LELN2O) to the lower explosion limit in air (LELair) is 0.52 and the ratio of the maximum oxygen content in air (MOCair) to the limiting oxidizer fraction.in nitrous oxide (LOFN2O) is 0.36 + 0.02 independent of the inert gas. When comparing the inert gas amount at the apex based on the pure oxidizing component, which is O2 in case of air, N2O-containing mixtures need less inert gas to reach the limiting oxidizer quantity whereas the efficiency of inert gases is in the same order. The coefficients of nitrogen equivalency however were found to differ to some extent.

Many symbolic major events have celebrated these developments, e.g., in Venice, Italy, the 15th (2006) and 20th (2012) years of progress and more recently, in 2018, in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 25 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry. On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and for hydrology. The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the “Green” Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments’ development and satellite missions’ evolutions are described in a fourth section. A fifth section covers the key observations that altimeters provide and their potential complements, from other Earth observation measurements to in situ data. Section 6 identifies the data and methods and provides some accuracy and resolution requirements for the wet tropospheric correction, the orbit and other geodetic requirements, the Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Mean Dynamic Topography, Calibration and Validation, data accuracy, data access and handling (including the DUACS system). Section 7 brings a transversal view on scales, integration, artificial intelligence, and capacity building (education and training). Section 8 reviews the programmatic issues followed by a conclusion. © 2021 COSPAR","Coastal oceanography; Cryospheric sciences; Hydrology; Oceanography; Satellite altimetry; Sea level","Aneroid altimeters; Geodesy; Geodetic satellites; Orbits; Sea level; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Topography; Tracking radar; Weather forecasting; Coastal oceanography; Cryospheric science; Design research; Future mission; Major events; Mission design; Portugal; Provide guidances; Radar altimetry; Satellite altimetry; Hydrology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103075118

With ongoing rapid and competing development in diverse economic sectors, such as infrastructure, healthcare, sports, and education, amongst others, innovative financing approaches are needed to secure the necessary financing required to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the region. Climate finance is critical to achieve climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives. The integration of Islamic finance in the climate finance landscape could mitigate the funding gap in the region. This chapter explores the important roles of National Green Participative Banks (NGPB) to enable a broader and more efficient mobilization of resources for climate finance in the MENA Region. Through blended finance mechanisms that align Islamic, green, and social finance, as well as the guarantee of an inclusive financing for projects targeting rural populations, NGPBs can stimulate sustained and sharia compliant climate financing in the MENA Region. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

However, mixing between freshwater and seawater creates gradients of inorganic N and bioavailable organic matter, which affect N cycling. In this study, we compare nitrate reduction processes between estuary and offshore archipelago environments in the coastal Baltic Sea. Denitrification rates were similar in both environments, despite lower nitrate and carbon concentrations in the offshore archipelago. However, DNRA (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium) rates were higher at the offshore archipelago stations, with a higher proportion of autochthonous carbon. The production rate and concentrations of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) were higher in the estuary, where nitrate concentrations and allochthonous carbon inputs are higher. These results indicate that the ratio between nitrate and autochthonous organic carbon governs the balance between N-removing denitrification and N-recycling DNRA, as well as the end-product of denitrification. As a result, a significant amount of the N removed in the estuary is released as N2O, while the offshore archipelago areas are characterized by efficient internal recycling of N. Our results challenge the current understanding of the role of these regions as filters of land-to-sea transfer of N. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification; DNRA; DOM; Estuary; N2O; Sediment organic matter","archipelago; autochthon; concentration (composition); denitrification; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; organic matter; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104684015

The magnitude and seasonal variability of atmosphere-sea CO2 flux was investigated in high-latitude northern Norwegian coastal areas over 2018 and 2019, including four fjords and one coastal bay. The aim was to assess the physical and biogeochemical factors controlling CO2 flux and partial pressure of CO2 in surface water via correlation to physical oceanographic and biological measurements. The results show that the study region acts as an overall atmospheric CO2 sink throughout the year, largely due to the strong undersaturation of CO2 relative to atmospheric concentrations. Wind speed exerted the strongest influence on the instantaneous rate of sea-air CO2 exchange, while exhibiting high variability. We concluded that the northernmost fjords (Altafjord and Porsangerfjord) showed stronger potential for instantaneous CO2 uptake due to higher wind speeds. We also found that fixation of CO2 was likely a significant factor controlling ΔpCO2 from April to June, which followed phenology of spring phytoplankton blooms at each location. Decreased ΔpCO2 and the resulting sea-air CO2 flux was observed in autumn due to a combined reduction of the mixed layer with entrain of high CO2 subsurface water, damped biological activity and higher surface water temperatures. This study provides the first measurements of atmospheric CO2 flux in these fjord systems and therefore an important new baseline for gaining a better understanding on how the northern Norwegian coast and characteristic fjord systems participate in atmosphere carbon regulation. © Copyright © 2021 Aalto, Campbell, Eilertsen and Bernstein.","algae bloom; CO2 sink; fjord and channel ecosystems; microalga; primary production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111055195
