A systematically designed climate control system can enhance the yield of commercial greenhouses. This study aims to formulate a nonlinear multivariable transfer function model of the greenhouse model using thermodynamic laws by taking into account the variables that affect the Greenhouse Climate Control System. To control its parameters, Mamdani model-based Fuzzy PID is designed which is compared with the performance of proportional-integral (PI) and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers to achieve a smooth control action. The Fuzzy logic based PID provides robust control actions eliminating the need for conventional tuning methods. The robustness analysis is performed using values obtained from real-time implementation for the greenhouse model for Fuzzy based PID, PI and PID controllers by minimizing the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) and Integral Square Error (ISE). The greenhouse model has strong interactions between its parameters, which are removed by Relative Gain Array (RGA) analysis, thereby providing an effective control strategy for complex greenhouse production. Further, the stability analysis of non-linear greenhouse model is conducted with the help of the bode plot and Nyquist plot. Results show that good control performance can be achieved by tuning the gain parameters of controllers via step responses such as small overshoot, fast settling time, less rise time, and steady-state error. Also, smoother control action was obtained with Fuzzy based PID making the Greenhouse Climate Control System stable. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Bode diagrams; Climate control; Climate models; Errors; Fuzzy logic; Greenhouses; Humidity control; Man machine systems; Proportional control systems; Real time control; Robust control; Robustness (control systems); Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Greenhouse climate control; Integral absolute errors; Integral square errors; Intelligent controllers; Proportional integral derivative controllers; Real-time implementations; Temperature and humidities; Transfer function model; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090375473

However, to stabilize the climate at a warming level closer to the present day, such as the ""well below 2 °C""aspiration in the Paris Agreement, a net-zero carbon emission by 2050 is still insufficient. The recent IPCC special report calls for a massive scheme to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere, in addition to decarbonization, to reach negative net emissions at the mid-century mark. Another ambitious proposal is solar-radiation-based geoengineering schemes, including injecting sulfur gas into the stratosphere. Despite being in public debate for years, these two leading geoengineering schemes have not been directly compared under a consistent analytical framework using global climate models. Here we present the first explicit analysis of the hydroclimate impacts of these two geoengineering approaches using two recently available large-ensemble (>10 members) model experiments conducted by a family of stateof-the-art Earth system models. The CO2-based mitigation simulation is designed to include both emission cuts and carbon capture. The solar-radiation-based mitigation simulation is designed to inject sulfur gas strategically at specified altitudes and latitudes and run a feedback control algorithm to avoid common problems previously identified such as the overcooling of the tropics and large-scale precipitation shifts. Our analysis focuses on the projected aridity conditions over the Americas in the 21st century in detailed terms of the potential mitigation benefits, the temporal evolution, the spatial distribution (within North and South America), the relative efficiency, and the physical mechanisms. We show that sulfur injection, in contrast to previous notions of leading to excessive terrestrial drying (in terms of precipitation reduction) while offsetting the global mean greenhouse gas (GHG) warming, will instead mitigate the projected drying tendency under RCP8.5. The surface energy balance change induced by sulfur injection, in addition to the well-known response in temperature and precipitation, plays a crucial role in determining the overall terrestrial hydroclimate response. However, when normalized by the same amount of avoided global warming in these simulations, sulfur injection is less effective in curbing the worsening trend of regional land aridity in the Americas under RCP8.5 when compared with carbon capture. Temporally, the climate benefit of sulfur injection will emerge more quickly, even when both schemes are hypothetically started in the same year of 2020. Spatially, both schemes are effective in curbing the drying trend over North America. However, for South America, the sulfur injection scheme is particularly more effective for the sub-Amazon region (southern Brazil), while the carbon capture scheme is more effective for the Amazon region. We conclude that despite the apparent limitations (such as an inability to address ocean acidification) and potential side effects (such as changes to the ozone layer), innovative means of sulfur injection should continue to be explored as a potential low-cost option in the climate solution toolbox, complementing other mitigation approaches such as emission cuts and carbon capture (Cao et al., 2017). Our results demonstrate the urgent need for multi-model comparison studies and detailed regional assessments in other parts of the world. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Altitude control; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Drying; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Ozone layer; Solar radiation; Sulfur; Earth system model; Global climate model; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Large-scale precipitation; Ocean acidifications; Physical mechanism; Relative efficiency; Temporal evolution; Climate models; atmospheric chemistry; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; fluid injection; global warming; ozone; sulfur; twenty first century; North America; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090178290

Kenya's commitment to eradicate tsetse and trypanosomiasis dates to the 1980s through various control approaches which were spearheaded by the African Union. The aggressive control programmes together with climatic, land-use, and socio-economic changes immensely contributed to the reduction of African trypanosomiasis. Since 2012, Kenya has not recorded a case of human trypanosomiasis. However, African animal trypanosomiasis remains a major challenge to livestock production in 38 out of 47 counties. We aimed to determine the prevalence of tsetse flies and trypanosome infection rate and to build the capacity of small-holder livestock producers in vector control activities in Busia county. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2018 and December 2018 in Busia county, a beneficiary of the previous African Union-led trypanosomiasis and tsetse control initiatives. Odour-baited biconical traps were deployed for 48 h in five sampling areas. Captured tsetse flies were analysed by microscopy for trypanosome infections. Additionally, training and field demonstrations were conducted as part of capacity building to enhance participation of small-holder livestock producers in tsetse control activities. Results: A total of 94 tsetse flies mainly Glossina fuscipes fuscipes were captured from the five sampling areas. The apparent fly densities range from 0.08 to 1.55 tsetse per trap per day. Additionally, 75 biting flies mainly Stomoxys spp. were also trapped. An overall tsetse infection rate of 1.39% and 4.17% was observed for Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax, respectively. Regarding capacity building, a total of 26 small-holder livestock producers were trained on tsetse and trypanosomiasis control activities. Out of which, five were selected as focal persons and were further trained on integrated vector management techniques and tsetse survey methods. Conclusions: Our findings revealed the existence of trypanosome-infected tsetse flies which could potentially spread to other parts of the county. Training of small-holder livestock producers in tsetse and trypanosomiasis control activities should be supported and integrated in the county animal health and veterinary services. Given the observed low tsetse densities and trypanosome infection rates, the elimination of trypanosomiasis in Busia county is feasible. © 2020 The Author(s).","Busia county; Trypanosome infection rate; Trypanosomiasis; Tsetse density; Vector control","antitrypanosomal agent; African Union; Article; biting fly; capacity building; community participation; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease burden; ecological niche; Glossinidae; infection rate; Kenya; livestock; nonhuman; prevalence; social participation; species distribution; Trypanosoma brucei; Trypanosoma congolense; Trypanosoma vivax; trypanosomiasis; vector control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089729623

The digitization and online mobilization of herbarium specimens is rapidly advancing our understanding of plant phenological response to climate and climatic change. The current practice of manually harvesting data from individual specimens, however, greatly restricts our ability to scale-up data collection. Recent investigations have demonstrated that machine-learning approaches can facilitate this effort. However, present attempts have focused largely on simplistic binary coding of reproductive phenology (e.g., presence/absence of flowers). Here, we use crowd-sourced phenological data of buds, flowers, and fruits from >3,000 specimens of six common wildflower species of the eastern United States (Anemone canadensis L., A. hepatica L., A. quinquefolia L., Trillium erectum L., T. grandiflorum (Michx.) Salisb., and T. undulatum Wild.) to train models using Mask R-CNN to segment and count phenological features. A single global model was able to automate the binary coding of each of the three reproductive stages with >87% accuracy. We also successfully estimated the relative abundance of each reproductive structure on a specimen with ≥90% accuracy. Precise counting of features was also successful, but accuracy varied with phenological stage and taxon. Specifically, counting flowers was significantly less accurate than buds or fruits likely due to their morphological variability on pressed specimens. Moreover, our Mask R-CNN model provided more reliable data than non-expert crowd-sourcers but not botanical experts, highlighting the importance of high-quality human training data. Finally, we also demonstrated the transferability of our model to automated phenophase detection and counting of the three Trillium species, which have large and conspicuously-shaped reproductive organs. These results highlight the promise of our two-phase crowd-sourcing and machine-learning pipeline to segment and count reproductive features of herbarium specimens, thus providing high-quality data with which to investigate plant responses to ongoing climatic change. © Copyright © 2020 Davis, Champ, Park, Breckheimer, Lyra, Xie, Joly, Tarapore, Ellison and Bonnet.","automated regional segmentation; deep learning; digitized herbarium specimen; plant phenology; regional convolutional neural network; reproductive structures; visual data classification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089483729

Biogeochemical processes within the Southern Ocean regulate regional primary production and biological carbon uptake, primarily through iron supply, and support ecosystem functioning over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we assimilate existing knowledge and present new data to examine the biogeochemical cycles of iron, carbon and major nutrients, their key drivers and their responses to, and roles in, contemporary climate and environmental change. Projected increases in iron supply, coupled with increases in light availability to phytoplankton through increased near-surface stratification and longer ice-free periods, are very likely to increase primary production and carbon export around Antarctica. Biological carbon uptake is likely to increase for the Southern Ocean as a whole, whilst there is greater uncertainty around projections of primary production in the Sub-Antarctic and basin-wide changes in phytoplankton species composition, as well as their biogeochemical consequences. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, higher trophic level organisms and microbial communities are strongly influenced by Southern Ocean biogeochemistry, in particular through nutrient supply and ocean acidification. In turn, these organisms exert important controls on biogeochemistry through carbon storage and export, nutrient recycling and redistribution, and benthic-pelagic coupling. The key processes described in this paper are summarised in the Graphical Abstract. Climate-mediated changes in Southern Ocean biogeochemistry over the coming decades are very likely to impact primary production, sea-air CO2 exchange and ecosystem functioning within and beyond this vast and critically important ocean region. © Copyright © 2020 Henley, Cavan, Fawcett, Kerr, Monteiro, Sherrell, Bowie, Boyd, Barnes, Schloss, Marshall, Flynn and Smith.","biogeochemistry; carbon; ecosystem; iron; nutrients; ocean acidification; primary production; Southern Ocean",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089468983

The activated coke presented great catalytic performance for SO2 reduction by CO and H2. The reactivity of CO reducing SO2 was higher than that of H2, and the two gaseous reducing agents were independent of each other during the reaction process. The effect of CO2 on SO2 reduction was slight, while the participation of H2O resulted in a significant decrease in S yield.

Further, it aims to understand to what extent these corporations disclose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of the research consists of the global brands Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Daimler and Fiat. Global and national sustainability reports from headquarters and local subsidiaries are examined. To determine the disclosure for emissions content analysis is conducted. The GRI 305: Emissions standard, which sets out the reporting requirements on the issue emissions is used to identify the disclosures both from headquarters and subsidiaries. Findings: The sector-specific findings show that all sustainability reports from headquarters disclose much more specific information on greenhouse gas emissions than the reports from subsidiaries. Corporations that offer the most comprehensive sustainability reports disclose the least pages in environmental information. However, presenting the least information does not mean that these reports are rare in quality. Especially, two corporations who offer the least pages on environmental issues fully disclosed the classification of GRI 305: Emissions standard. It can be stated that these corporations emphasize the quality and not the quantity of disclosure. Although, local subsidiaries are not reporting to the extent as headquarters do good applications together with specific information are applied.

SOC monitoring is indispensable to the corresponding policies and should provide results at farm scale to allow for incentives. In Switzerland, farmers perform mandatory analyses of the SOC content of the 0–20 cm topsoil of every field, based on a composite sample, at least every 10 years. The corresponding results are stored in a database in canton of Geneva. These data may be relevant for topsoil SOC monitoring, in particular for carbon sequestration policies, provided that they show appropriate quality, which is analyzed in this study. The minimum detectable change (MDC) of past results calculated based on the observed SOC changes was 0.013% g g–1 at canton scale (2,700 fields). Based on extended sampling of three representative fields, different sampling strategies were simulated to determine the best future sampling guidelines for farmers. Collecting 20 aliquots with a gouge on the field diagonals was considered the best sampling compromise with field MDC of ∼0.1% g g–1 and a sampling duration of 20 min. Compared to this procedure, former farmers’ sampling was not biased in average but showed a variance of 0.22% g g–1 due to smaller number of aliquots and varying sampling depths. Based on the best sampling results and assumptions on farm-scale SOC variance or SOC differences, the MDCs at farm scale ranged from 0.21 to 0.12% g g–1 (5 fields) and 0.09 to 0.05% g g–1 (30 fields), respectively. These MDCs are small compared to published monitoring networks MDCs and allow determining SOC change rates at farm scale, thus offering perspectives for inexpensive and efficient monitoring in the frame of soil quality or climate mitigation incentives. For the latter, however, additional information with equivalent soil mass and deeper-layer carbon content would be necessary. © Copyright © 2020 Deluz, Nussbaum, Sauzet, Gondret and Boivin.","composite sampling; minimum detectable change; sampling method; soil organic carbon content; topsoil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089811630

Previous studies have reported that reducing sulfate aerosols potentially contributed to the recent rapid Arctic warming. In this study, a global aerosol-climate model (Community Atmosphere Model, version 5) equipped with Explicit Aerosol Source Tagging (CAM5-EAST) is applied to quantify the source apportionment of aerosols in the Arctic from 16 source regions and the role of aerosol variations in affecting changes in the Arctic surface temperature from 1980 to 2018. The CAM5-EAST simulated surface concentrations of sulfate and BC in the Arctic had a decrease of 43thinsp; and 23thinsp;, respectively, in 2014-2018 relative to 1980-1984 mainly due to the reduction of emissions from Europe, Russia and local Arctic sources. Increases in emissions from South and East Asia led to positive trends in Arctic sulfate and BC in the upper troposphere. All aerosol radiative impacts are considered including aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions, as well as black carbon deposition on snow- and ice-covered surfaces. Within the Arctic, sulfate reductions caused a top-of-atmosphere (TOA) warming of 0.11 and 0.25thinsp;Wthinsp span classCombining double low line inline-formula -2 /span through aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions, respectively. While the changes in Arctic atmospheric BC has little impact on local radiative forcing, the decrease in BC in snow and ice led to a net cooling of 0.05thinsp;Wthinspspan classCombining double low line inline-formula -2 /span. By applying climate sensitivity factors for different latitudinal bands, global changes in sulfate and BC during 2014-2018 (with respect to 1980-1984) exerted a span classCombining double low line inline-formula +0.088 /span and 0.057thinsp;K Arctic surface warming, respectively, through aerosol-radiation interactions. Through aerosol-cloud interactions, the sulfate reduction caused an Arctic warming of span classCombining double low line inline-formula +0.193 /spanthinsp;K between the two time periods. The weakened BC effect on snow-ice albedo led to an Arctic surface cooling of span classCombining double low line inline-formula -0.041 /spanthinsp;K. The changes in atmospheric sulfate and BC outside the Arctic produced a total Arctic warming of span classCombining double low line inline-formula + /span0.25thinsp;K, the majority of which is due to the midlatitude changes in radiative forcing. Our results suggest that changes in aerosols over the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere have a larger impact on Arctic temperature than other regions through enhanced poleward heat transport.

Although inter-model agreement is high for large-scale temperature signals, dynamical changes in atmospheric circulation are very uncertain4. This leads to low confidence in regional projections, especially for precipitation, over the coming decades5,6. The chaotic nature of the climate system7–9 may also mean that signal uncertainties are largely irreducible. However, climate projections are difficult to verify until further observations become available. Here we assess retrospective climate model predictions of the past six decades and show that decadal variations in North Atlantic winter climate are highly predictable, despite a lack of agreement between individual model simulations and the poor predictive ability of raw model outputs. Crucially, current models underestimate the predictable signal (the predictable fraction of the total variability) of the North Atlantic Oscillation (the leading mode of variability in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation) by an order of magnitude. Consequently, compared to perfect models, 100 times as many ensemble members are needed in current models to extract this signal, and its effects on the climate are underestimated relative to other factors. To address these limitations, we implement a two-stage post-processing technique. We first adjust the variance of the ensemble-mean North Atlantic Oscillation forecast to match the observed variance of the predictable signal. We then select and use only the ensemble members with a North Atlantic Oscillation sufficiently close to the variance-adjusted ensemble-mean forecast North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach greatly improves decadal predictions of winter climate for Europe and eastern North America. Predictions of Atlantic multidecadal variability are also improved, suggesting that the North Atlantic Oscillation is not driven solely by Atlantic multidecadal variability. Our results highlight the need to understand why the signal-to-noise ratio is too small in current climate models10, and the extent to which correcting this model error would reduce uncertainties in regional climate change projections on timescales beyond a decade. © 2020, Crown.",,"atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate modeling; error analysis; North Atlantic Oscillation; regional climate; signal-to-noise ratio; uncertainty analysis; article; climate change; Europe; North America; North Atlantic oscillation; prediction; signal noise ratio; simulation; uncertainty; winter; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088743711

Since collecting and transporting waste are important parts of waste management budget, it is necessary to apply an appropriate method to reduce costs of collection. The aim of this study is to design a new model for urban waste collection vehicle routing problem with time windows and energy generating from waste. Design/methodology/approach: A multiobjective model is presented with the objectives of minimizing cost of waste collection, reducing emissions from environmental pollutants and increasing income of recycles trade and energy recovery. Concerning the complexity of the model and its inability to solve large-scale problems, hyperactive genetic algorithms and multiple objective particle swarm optimization are applied. Findings: The proposed model not only affects costs and income but also reduces the emissions of environmental pollutants. To solve the formulated model, multitarget approaches are applied on the processing site of Kermanshah city as a case study. The solutions of these algorithms and the exact method of partial constraints are compared and the outcomes are verified by numerical analysis by solving various examples in small, medium and large scales. The proposed model helps to collect urban wastes in the shortest possible time in addition to reducing the total cost, revenues from the sale of recycled materials and energy generation. Research limitations/implications: Waste collection is related to VRP issue. Considering the environmental requirements in waste management, the concept of green supply chain is approached. This study provides a better understanding of urban waste management by examining various articles and combining economic and environmental dimensions. Waste management with a green approach and energy production from disposable waste involves many common stakeholders. Practical implications: This study suggests that proper waste management can generate revenue from municipal waste. Moreover, it reduces cost of collecting and emission of environmental pollutants. These findings could motivate companies to waste management with a sustainable approach. Originality/value: The proposed model boosts the current understanding of the waste management and energy generation of waste.

Lapse rates calculated from land surface temperature (γTs) and near-surface air temperature (γTa) have been widely used. However, γTs and γTa have different sensitivity to local surface energy balance and large-scale energy transport and therefore they may have diverse spatial and temporal variability, which has not been clearly illustrated in existing studies. In this study, we calculated and compared γTa and γTs at ~ 2200 stations over China from 1961 to 2014. This study finds that γTa and γTs have a similar multiyear national average (0.53 °C/100 m) and seasonal cycle. Nevertheless, γTs shows steeper multiyear average than γTa at high latitudes, and γTs in summer is steeper than γTa, especially in Northwest China. The North China shows the shallowest γTa and γTs, then inhibiting the vertical diffusion of air pollutants and further reducing the lapse rates due to accumulation of pollutants. Moreover, the long-term trend signs for γTa and γTs are opposite in northern China. However, the trends in γTa and γTs are both negative in Southwest China and positive in Southeast China. Surface incident solar radiation, surface downward longwave radiation and precipitant frequency jointly can account for 80% and 75% of the long-term trends in γTa and γTs in China, respectively, which provides an explanation of trends of γTa and γTs from perspective of surface energy balance. © 2020 Science China Press","Climatic factor; Land surface temperature; Lapse rate; Long-term trend; Near-surface air temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Energy balance; Incident solar radiation; Interfacial energy; Pollution; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Atmospheric stability; Contrast patterns; Energy transport; Long-wave radiation; Near surface air temperature; Southwest China; Spatial and temporal variability; Vertical diffusion; Land surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083681088

Innovation fuelled by automation, digitization, and electrification have led to the introduction of autonomous vehicles, automated drilling and tunnel boring systems, drones, and smart sensors. While these new technologies could contribute to improved profit margins, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and improved worker health and safety, they could also have significant impacts on local employment levels, skills creation, and local content in mining projects. Emerging technologies may also give rise to new types of environmental and occupational health problems, due to for example, the emissions of nanomaterials. Hence, new technologies may warrant a reassessment of project impact assessment categories, as some categories that may be relevant for assessing new technologies may not exist yet, whereas some that do exist may not be relevant. Hence, organisations conducting project assessments should prepare and respond to these technological shifts in the mining sector.

Recent AGB maps at continental and national scales have shown large uncertainties, particularly in tropical areas with high AGB values. Errors in AGB maps are linked to the quality of plot data used to calibrate remote sensing products, and the ability of radar data to map high AGB forest. Here we suggest an approach to improve the accuracy of AGB maps and test this approach with a case study of the tropical forests of the Yucatan peninsula, where the accuracy of AGB mapping is lower than other forest types in Mexico. To reduce the errors in field data, National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots were corrected to consider small trees. Temporal differences between NFI plots and imagery acquisition were addressed by considering biomass changes over time. To overcome issues related to saturation of radar backscatter, we incorporate radar texture metrics and climate data to improve the accuracy of AGB maps. Finally, we increased the number of sampling plots using biomass estimates derived from LiDAR data to assess if increasing sample size could improve the accuracy of AGB estimates. Results: Correcting NFI plot data for both small trees and temporal differences between field and remotely sensed measurements reduced the relative error of biomass estimates by 12.2%. Using a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, with corrected field plot data, backscatter and surface texture from the L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) installed on the on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS), and climatic water deficit data improved the accuracy of the maps obtained in this study as compared to previous studies (R2 = 0.44 vs R2 = 0.32). However, using sample plots derived from LiDAR data to increase sample size did not improve accuracy of AGB maps (R2 = 0.26). Conclusions: This study reveals that the suggested approach has the potential to improve AGB maps of tropical dry forests and shows predictors of AGB that should be considered in future studies. Our results highlight the importance of using ecological knowledge to correct errors associated with both the plot-level biomass estimates and the mismatch between field and remotely sensed data. © 2020 The Author(s).","Climatic water deficit; Forest biomass; L-band SAR; Random forest; Texture analysis; Yucatan peninsula","aboveground biomass; accuracy assessment; ALOS; backscatter; climate effect; dry forest; field survey; forest ecosystem; lidar; PALSAR; spatial distribution; tropical region; Mexico [North America]; Yucatan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089947240

The garnet-type ceramic electrolyte with high stability against metallic Li has drawn much attention, but it also suffers from huge interfacial resistance and Li dendrite penetration due to the unavoidable formation of the carbonate passivation layer and limited interface contact. Herein, we propose a facile and effective method of flame vapor deposition to spray candle soot (CS) coating on the garnet surface. It enables the reduction of the carbonate layer and the conversion to a highly lithiophilic interlayer especially when in contact with molten Li. The lithiophilicity is rooted in the enrichment of graphitic polycrystalline domains in CS, which can be chemically or electrochemically lithiated to form the ionic/electronic dual-conductive network containing LiC6 moieties. The CS interlayer binds the Li metal with the garnet electrolyte tightly with gradual transition of Li-ion conductivity, leading to a significant reduction of the area-specific resistance to 50 ω cm2 at 60 °C with high cycling and current endurance. Garnet-based symmetric cells and solid-state full cells conducting this strategy exhibit impressive electrochemical reversibility and durability under the preservation of the compact interface and smooth Li plating/stripping. The modified Li/garnet/FeF3 batteries exhibit a discharge capacity as high as 500 mA h g-1 and long-term cyclability for at least 1500 cycles (with capacity preserved at 281.7 and 201 mA h g-1 at 100 and 200 μA cm-2, respectively). This candle combustion strategy can be extended to more ceramic electrolytes compatible with high-temperature pretreatment.

To understand to what extent the field has successfully met these goals, we conducted a scoping review and bibliometric analysis. Methods: We searched 15 databases from 2005 to 2019 for peer-reviewed publications with the term “planetary health” in the title, abstract and/or keywords, with no language or geographical location limitations. We classified results into four categories (commentaries, comprehensive syntheses, educational material, and original research) and categorized original research according to expert-derived planetary health themes. Our bibliometric analysis highlighted publications over time, collaborations, and networks of keywords. Findings: Only 8.1% (n = 22) were research articles. Publications rose rapidly from 8 to 64 publications per year in 2015–2018. The top five author affiliation countries for most publications were the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and the top five collaborations were a subset of pairwise combinations between the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. The most common author keywords were the following: planetary health, climate change, ecology, and non-communicable diseases. Keyword co-occurrences clustered around high-level concepts (e.g., Anthropocene) and food system-related topics; two clusters lacked a theme. Interpretation: We show that the term planetary health is used mainly in commentary-like publications, not original research. Additionally, more global collaborations are lacking. Interdisciplinary work, as represented by keyword co-occurrence networks, is developing but could potentially be extended. The planetary health community should promote more worldwide research and interdisciplinary collaborations. © Copyright © 2020 Rossa-Roccor, Acheson, Andrade-Rivas, Coombe, Ogura, Super and Hong.","holistic health fields; interdisciplinary research; keyword network analysis; planetary health collaborations; planetary health themes",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089439400

Recently there has been growing interest in connectivity between ecosystems and the potential for connected ecosystems to facilitative ecosystem services. Tropical seagrass meadows are connected to coral reefs, as the reef barrier dissipates waves, which facilitates sediment accumulation and avoid erosion and export. Therefore, coral reefs might enhance the seagrass meadows capacity as a blue carbon sink. We tested this hypothesis through an assessment of blue carbon across a gradient of connected seagrass meadow and coral reef sites. We assessed attributes of seagrass meadows along a transect in addition to classifying the sites as exposed and sheltered. Classification of sites was completed through analyzing wave crest density in photographs and using granulometric evenness index. Organic carbon and organic matter were measured in sediment core samples and within seagrass living biomass (both above and below ground). Lastly, we measured changes in above and below ground traits of seagrass plants across the same sites. Gaps in the reef barrier were linked to high wave disturbance and exposed conditions, whilst barrier continuity to low wave disturbance and sheltered conditions. Organic carbon in sediments was 144 Mg ha–1 in the most sheltered (with reef barrier) and 91 Mg ha–1 in the most exposed (without reef barrier) meadows. Sheltered conditions also showed a redistribution of seagrass biomass to a greater quantity of roots compared to rhizomes. Whilst in exposed conditions the opposite occurred, which could be due to increased rhizome biomass have to enhanced anchorage or greater nutrient availability. This study found that coral reefs facilitate blue carbon potential in seagrass meadows indicating that coral reefs support this important ecosystem service. Also, results suggest that loss of coral reef structure due to bleaching and other stressors will likely result in a reduction of the blue carbon storage capacity of adjacent seagrass meadow. Further research should investigate how combined global and regional stresses may impact on the potential for coral reefs to buffer seagrass meadows, and how these stresses affect the functional traits of seagrass plants. © Copyright © 2020 Guerra-Vargas, Gillis and Mancera-Pineda.","Caribbean; connectivity; ecosystem service; living biomass; organic carbon stock; reef lagoon; sediments; Thalassia testudinum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089423466

Despite decades of soil gas flux measurements using manual chamber methods, limited temporal coverage has led to high uncertainty in flux magnitude and variability, particularly during peak emission events. Automated chamber measurement systems can collect high-frequency (subdaily) measurements across various spatial scales but may be prohibitively expensive or incompatible with field conditions. Here we describe the construction and operational details for a robust, relatively inexpensive, and adaptable automated dynamic (steady-state) chamber measurement system modified from previously published methods, using relatively low cost analyzers to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The system was robust to intermittent flooding of chambers, long tubing runs (> 100 m), and operational temperature extremes (12 to 39 C) and was entirely powered by solar energy. Using data collected between 2017 and 2019 we tested the underlying principles of chamber operation and examined N2O diel variation and rain-pulse timing that would be difficult to characterize using infrequent manual measurements. Stable steady-state flux dynamics were achieved during 29 min chamber closure periods at a relatively low flow rate (2 L min1). Instrument performance and calculated fluxes were minimally impacted by variation in air temperature and water vapor. Measurements between 08:00 and 12:00 LT were closest to the daily mean N2O and CO2 emission. Afternoon fluxes (12:00-16:00 LT) were 28% higher than the daily mean for N2O (4.04 vs. 3.15 nmolm2 s1) and were 22% higher for CO2 (4.38 vs. 3.60 umolm2 s1). High rates of N2O emission are frequently observed after precipitation. Following four discrete rainfall events, we found a 12-26 h delay before peak N2O flux, which would be difficult to capture with manual measurements. Our observation of substantial and variable diel trends and rapid but variable onset of high N2O emissions following rainfall supports the need for high-frequency measurements. © Author(s) 2020.

However, the molecular insight on the role of Cu is complicated and far from understood. We performed a first principle calculation on the anatase (101) surface modified by a single Cu atom deposited on the surface (CuS) or doped in the lattice (CuL). It is demonstrated the CuL is clearly more stable than the CuS and could promote the formation of oxygen vacancy (Vo) greatly. The CuS plays a role of donor, while the CuL is electronically deficient and becomes a global electron trapper. If a Vo is introduced, the excess electrons would immigrate to the empty gap state of the CuL and make it half-filled in some case, which implies its metallic characters and improved conductivity; meanwhile, the formation of Ti3+ is suppressed. Judging from the adsorption energies, it is the Vo that primarily improves the adsorption of CO2 in both linear and bent states, and the CuS could hardly stabilize CO2 more, while the promotion effect of Vo could even be counteracted by the CuL due to its electronic deficiency. The reduction pathways (CO2∗ → CO∗ + O∗) show that, with the assistance of the CuS, linear CO2 could directly transform into the carbonate-like geometry vertically binding to the surface, and the intermediate configuration of the bent CO2 horizontally bridging the Vo could be successfully skipped. Therefore, the barrier of the rate-determining transformation could be lowered from 0.75 to 0.39 eV. Furthermore, it is found the strong adsorption of the produced CO by the CuS might retard the smooth going of the catalytic process. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091744776

The study characterized climate hazards related to crop and livestock production in marginal areas of Zimbabwe based on field observations. The study was carried out using a participatory and interactive survey approach. The climatic related risks impinging on livestock and cereal production in communal areas were outlined. A tailored seasonal climate forecast system, based on farmers’ contextual knowledge and conventional approaches, for smallholder farmers aimed at providing information relevant for the management of climate-related production risks was developed. Thus, local knowledge which made farming possible in the past, through pre-season and intra-season farm management strategies under harsh climatic conditions needs to be appreciated and fused into new climate systems. The study recommends that Agricultural Extension Workers should communicate agro-meteorological information that is usable by conservation farmers to manage their food production from an informed position. Local Agricultural Extension Workers should identify and provide key local coping strategies where the tailored forecast could be useful to the farmers since they are strategically positioned in relation to the farmers’ environment. © 2020 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.","climate change; conservation farming; extension; smallholder farmer",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090925514

Currently, about 180-190 million tons of coal are burned in Russia to produce heat and electricity, with more than 60% in the eastern regions of the country. Most of the coal (about 80%) is consumed by large thermal stations, which are equipped with pollutant trapping systems. The remaining part is burned in numerous boiler houses that operate in both urban and rural areas to provide heat to social facilities and the population. The analysis shows that the role of boiler houses increases significantly in the territories with a low population or in remote and decentralized areas. In this regard, the coal pretreatment technology before burning including the thermal preparation of coal is important. The use of thermally prepared fuel (semi-coke) will significantly reduce emissions of NOx and SOx, as well as improve the ""culture"" of thermal energy production at small boilers by switching to fully automated technologies, as well as significantly reducing the financial burden of utilities by reducing the wage fund and emission fees. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Boilers; Coal; Coal industry; Fuels; Heating; Pollution; Energy productions; Fully automated; Heat and electricity; Pollutant trapping; Pretreatment technology; Thermal stations; Thermal transformations; Urban and rural areas; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090240521

Loading cocatalysts is regarded as an effective way to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of CNs. However, commonly used noble metal cocatalysts limit their applications due to their rarity and high cost. Herein, we present the effective synthesis of single-atom copper-modified CN via supramolecular preorganization with subsequent condensation, which provides effective charge transfer pathways by an ""infused""delocalized state with variable-valence catalysis at the same time. The C-Cu-N2 single-atom catalytic site can activate CO2 molecules and reduces the energy barrier toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Excellent performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction was found.

For improving the purifying effect of functional micro surfacing, two types of raw ore powders with exhaust-purifying potentials were selected as novel functional modifiers. Firstly, the road performance of purifying micro surfacing was evaluated according to the ASTM and ISSA standards. Then, the dispersion state of modifying agents in emulsified asphalt evaporation residue was analyzed and discussed using SEM and FTIR. Finally, the purifying effect of micro surfacing on exhausts was examined in a laboratory to investigate the impact of various experimental conditions on the purifying performance. Meanwhile, the purifying performance was also monitored in a field test. The results showed that the road performance of purifying micro surfacing could fulfill the requirements of relevant technical standards. Pyrite had better dispersion property than specularite and titanium dioxide inside asphalt. The purifying micro surfacing could achieve a better purifying effect on NOx and COx than traditional micro surfacing with TiO2. These environmentally friendly pavement materials could provide new solutions for the reduction of polluting emissions in automobile exhausts. © Copyright © 2020 Sun, Liu, Qin, Zeng and Yin.","characterization; exhaust purification; micro surfacing; pavement; road performance","Asphalt; Dispersions; Emulsification; Oxide minerals; Pyrites; Titanium dioxide; Automobile exhaust; Dispersion properties; Emulsified asphalts; Evaporation residues; Experimental conditions; Pavement surfacing; Polluting emission; Technical standards; Pavements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089353079

Understanding soil bacterial community and nutrient dynamics under contrasting management practices is of utmost importance for building climate-smart agri-food systems. Soil samples were collected at 0–15 cm soil depth from six management scenarios in long-term conservation agriculture (CA) and climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices. These scenarios (Sc) involved; ScI-conventional tillage based rice-wheat rotation, ScII- partial CA based rice-wheat-mungbean, ScIII- partial CSA based rice-wheat-mungbean, ScIV is partial CSA based maize-wheat-mungbean, ScV and ScVI are CSA based scenarios, were similar to ScIII and ScIV respectively, layered with precision water & nutrient management. The sequencing of soil DNA results revealed that across the six scenarios, a total of forty bacterial phyla were observed, with Proteobacteria as dominant in all scenarios, followed by Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria was 29% higher in rice-based CSA scenarios (ScIII and ScV) and 16% higher in maize-based CSA scenarios (ScIV and ScVI) compared to conventional-till practice (ScI). The relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria was respectively 29% and 91% higher in CT than CSA based rice and 27% and 110% higher than maize-based scenarios. Some taxa are present relatively in very low abundance or exclusively in some scenarios, but these might play important roles there. Three phyla are exclusively present in ScI and ScII i.e., Spirochaetes, Thermi, and Euryarchaeota. Shannon diversity index was 11% higher in CT compared to CSA scenarios. Maize based CSA scenarios recorded higher diversity indices than rice-based CSA scenarios. Similar to changes in soil bacterial community, the nutrient dynamics among the different scenarios also varied significantly. After nine years of continuous cropping, the soil organic carbon was improved by 111% and 31% in CSA and CA scenarios over the CT scenario. Similarly, the available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were improved by, respectively, 38, 70, and 59% in CSA scenarios compared to the CT scenario. These results indicate that CSA based management has a positive influence on soil resilience in terms of relative abundances of bacterial groups, soil organic carbon & available plant nutrients and hence may play a critical role in the sustainability of the intensive cereal based agri-food systems. © Copyright © 2020 Choudhary, Jat, Datta, Sharma, Rajashekar and Jat.","available nutrients; bacterial diversity; cereal-based systems; DNA sequencing; relative abundance","ammonium acetate; buffer; fertilizer; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; RNA 16S; sulfur; urease; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; agar gel electrophoresis; agriculture; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Betaproteobacteria; cereal; DNA extraction; electric conductivity; Euryarchaeota; fermentation; Gammaproteobacteria; gene sequence; irrigation (agriculture); maize; microbial community; Nitrospirae; nonhuman; nutrient dynamics; nutrient management; pH; Planctomycetes; principal coordinate analysis; Proteobacteria; soil microflora; spectrophotometry; taxonomy; tillage; turbidimetry; wheat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089344914

Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) is an Earth-based analog for spaceflight used to study body unloading, fluid shifts, and other factors unrelated to gravitational changes. While in space, astronauts need to use mental rotation strategies to facilitate their adaptation to the ISS environment. Therefore, spatial working memory is essential for crewmember performance. Although the effects of HDBR on spatial working memory have recently been studied, the results are still inconclusive. Here, we expand upon past work and examine the effects of HDBR with elevated CO2 (HDBR + CO2) on brain activation patterns during spatial working memory performance. In addition, we compare brain activation between 30 days of HDBR + CO2 and 70 days of HDBR to test the isolated effect of CO2. Eleven subjects (6 males, 5 females; mean age = 34 ± 8 years) underwent six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post-HDBR + CO2. During the HDBR + CO2 intervention, we observed decreasing activation in the right middle frontal gyrus and left regions of the cerebellum, followed by post-intervention recovery. We detected several correlations between brain and behavioral slopes of change with the HDBR + CO2 intervention. For example, greater increases in activation in frontal, temporal and parietal regions were associated with larger spatial working memory improvements. Comparing the HDBR + CO2 group to data from our previous 70-day HDBR study, we found greater decreases in activation in the right hippocampus and left inferior temporal gyrus for the HDBR + CO2 group over the course of the intervention. Together, these findings increase our understanding of the neural mechanisms of HDBR, elevated levels of CO2 and spaceflight-related changes in spatial working memory performance. © Copyright © 2020 Salazar, Hupfeld, Lee, Beltran, Kofman, De Dios, Mulder, Bloomberg, Mulavara and Seidler.","carbon dioxide; cognition; head down tilt bed rest; microgravity; spatial working memory","carbon dioxide; adult; Article; brain function; brain size; clinical article; cognitive function test; computer assisted tomography; electroencephalography; executive function; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; fusiform gyrus; gray matter; hippocampus; hospitalization; human; human tissue; hypothalamus; image analysis; longitudinal study; male; memory consolidation; Mini Mental State Examination; nerve potential; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen saturation; pilot study; superior frontal gyrus; task performance; time series analysis; visual memory; visual stimulation; white matter; working memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089342092

In this work, the reduced carbon dots (rCDs) with numerous surface hydroxyl groups were deliberately anchored onto flower-like ZnO spheres with a highly exposed surface area to form heterointerfaces with sufficient interfacial electronic coupling. The incorporated rCDs evidently promote the light harvesting and charge separation of the binary hybrid system, resulting in highly enhanced photocatalytic Cr(VI) degradation performance. Ultrafast time-resolved spectra reveal that the surface C - OH bonds of rCDs play a crucial role at the heterointerfaces to regulate the charge dynamics. The long-lived surface C - OH states not only act as electron donors but also become electron mediators to rapidly capture the photoelectrons from the intrinsic state in the time-domain of 1 ps and induce a much longer lifetime for achieving highly efficient photoelectron injection from rCDs to ZnO. These results manifest that rCDs can be a promising photosensitizer to apply in photocatalytic pollutant treatment and energy conversion fields. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Carbon; Dynamics; Energy conversion; Hybrid systems; II-VI semiconductors; Oxide minerals; Photocatalytic activity; Photoelectrons; Photons; Photosensitizers; Zinc oxide; Charge recombinations; Charge separations; Electronic coupling; Interfacial charge; Interfacial couplings; Photocatalytic application; Surface hydroxyl groups; Time-resolved spectra; Chromium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089132060

The current study aimed to provide policymakers, academics, and researchers with a snapshot of global SDGs-related research activity. Method: This was a cross-sectional descriptive bibliometric study. SciVerse Scopus was used to retrieve SDGs-related research publications for the period from 2015 to 2019. Results: In total, 18,696 documents were found. The Sustainability journal ranked first (n = 1008; 5.4%) in the number of SDGs-related publications. The World Health Organization was the most active institution in publishing SDGs-related documents (n = 581; 1.3%). Most of the retrieved documents belonged to SDG 17 (partnership) followed by SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), while SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) had the least number of publications. The European region (n = 9756; 52.2%) had the highest research contribution while the Eastern Mediterranean region (n = 1052; 5.6%) had the least contribution. After exclusion of SDG 17, the SDG 3 (good health and well-being) was the top researched SDG for the African region, the Eastern Mediterranean regions, and the South-Eastern Asian region. For the region of the Americas, European region, and the Western Pacific region, the SDG 13 (climate action) was the most researched. The SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) was the least researched in the African region, the region of the Americas, the European region, and the South-East Asian region. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, SDG 10 (reduced inequality) was the least researched while in the Western Pacific region, SDG 5 (gender inequality) was the least researched. The most researched targets of SDG 3 were targets 7 (sexual and reproductive health services) and 8 (universal health coverage) while the least researched targets were 5 (substance use disorders) and 9 (death from hazardous materials). International research collaboration within SDG 3 between high-and low-income countries was inadequate. Conclusion: The analysis presented in the current study are useful for researchers, institutes, governments, funding agencies, and policy-makers. Countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South-East Asia need to increase their funding and research collaboration in the field of SDGs. © 2020 The Author(s).","Bibliometric analysis; Scopus; Sustainable development goals","academic research; gender disparity; governance approach; health status; policy making; research institution; Sustainable Development Goal; Africa; bibliometrics; dangerous goods; documentation; drug dependence; Europe; health insurance; health service; health status; high income country; human; low income country; management; priority journal; publication; publishing; reproductive health; Review; scientist; sexual health; Southeast Asian; sustainable development; wellbeing; Western Hemisphere; World Health Organization; bibliometrics; cross-sectional study; global health; health care policy; Middle East; motivation; United Nations; Africa; Europe; Mediterranean Region; Middle East; Southeast Asia; United States; Scopus; Africa; Bibliometrics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Global Health; Goals; Health Policy; Humans; Middle East; Motivation; Sustainable Development; United Nations; Universal Health Insurance",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088882317

H2 is found to dissociate heterolytically with a moderate barrier on both facets. Diffusion of hydrogen leads to the preferred homolytic adsorption configuration. Vacancy formation by water formation is thermodynamically preferred at high hydrogen coverages. Both surfaces are found to be hydroxylated at typical reaction conditions with the highest coverage predicted for In2O3(110). O 1s core level shifts are calculated for different coverages. The hydroxylated surfaces show two distinct shifts corresponding to different types of OH-groups. The presence of surface oxygen vacancies is not visible in the O 1s signatures.

Previous modeling studies suggest that storm tracks will shift poleward due to the increases in the greenhouse gas concentrations. As a consequence of this, the Middle East, North Africa, and Mediterranean regions will most likely experience a strong precipitation decrease, increasing the pressure on the region's vulnerable environment. Our results from an Earth system model indicate that SAG can partially offset the poleward shift of the storm tracks, thus potentially soothing the environmental and water stresses of the region.

Despite the C-C and B-N pairs being isoelectronic, their different ionicities give rise to their distinct response to applied electric fields. For the nanographene models, the Diels-Alder addition obeyed the reaction axis rule and the activation barrier changed under an OEEF perpendicular to the carbon skeleton for enhanced/reduced intermolecular charge transfer, which provides a feasible strategy for the side-selective derivatization of graphene to obtain one-face-only adducts and Janus bifunctional products. By contrast, for the h-BN models, the variation of the activation barrier was pronounced when the electric field was aligned along the in-plane N-B bond rather than the well-accepted reaction axis. Electronic structure analyses indicated that, because of the opposite electron withdrawing/donating nature of the reacting sites of B/N, an OEEF along the N-B bond was capable of further enhancing the polarization via in-plane intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in a stabilized transition state and notable barrier reduction. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Boron nitride; Charge transfer; Chemical activation; Electric fields; Electronic structure; Graphene; III-V semiconductors; Nitrides; Polarization; Diels-Alder addition; Diels-Alder cycloadditions; Electronwithdrawing; External electric field; Hexagonal boron nitride; Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN); Intermolecular charge transfer; Intra-molecular charge transfer; Cycloaddition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088493051

Several strategies including the expansion of visible light response and the improvement of solar energy utilization and photocatalytic quantum efficiency via more effective separation of photogenerated carriers are the current focuses of research that direct the design and fabrication of viable photocatalysts. Herein, a series of composite photocatalysts assembled from plasmonic Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and Zn3In2S6 (ZIS) solid solutions were synthesized by means of a simple solvothermal method. In comparison with the pristine ZIS semiconductor, Cu NP loaded ZIS solid solutions showed greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity, selectivity and stability towards CO2 reduction under visible irradiation. Of note was that the optimized ZIS-Cu2 exhibited an enhanced CH4 production rate of ca. 292 μL g-1 h-1 and a selectivity of ca. 71.1%, which were among the highest numbers reported hitherto. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, shown by surface Cu NPs, was believed to play a critical role in the enhanced CO2 photoreduction efficiency. More importantly, the introduction of plasmonic Cu NPs could restrain the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and promote the migration of photogenerated electrons to better participate in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of water vapor. This work thus provides a facile means to design robust and flexible composite photocatalysts for visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction with high efficiency. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Copper; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Light; Photocatalytic activity; Plasmonic nanoparticles; Plasmons; Quantum efficiency; Solar energy; Solid solutions; Synthesis (chemical); Zinc compounds; Composite photocatalysts; Environmental problems; High quantum efficiency; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Photogenerated carriers; Photogenerated electrons; Visible light driven photocatalysts; Visible-light response; Surface plasmon resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088488888

Does the Paris Agreement come with effectiveness trade-offs? How ambitious is the Agreement, and how likely is it that countries will comply with it? Using an effectiveness formula to assess ambition, I find that the Paris Agreement constitutes an important improvement compared to business-as-usual.

The designed and fabricated gasifier (100 kg/h capacity) is a downdraft gasifier that is square in shape and operates slightly above atmospheric pressure to generate tar-free producer gas. The design operates with pellets and fluffy MSW. The generated producer gas was tested for both thermal applications. This designed gasifier can be scaled up and implemented to suit the requirements of industrial energy demand, which has wide-ranging applications. For optimum performance, a 25 kg amount of char is needed to gasify MSW completely. The energy output from the mass and energy balance is 92.5% optimal for effective gas generation. Energy generation from the designed gasifier and process optimisation for thermal energy from gas with enhanced efficiency abets in drastically reducing the cost of factory's energy consumption.

Straightforward in principle, relatively simple to implement, the approach has been applied in several labs worldwide, to the extent of achieving a ""common practice"" status, sometimes resembling a codified protocol. Simple as it may look on paper, yet the technique hides a number of pitfalls, which can impair the end result. After the introduction of solid-state high-speed cameras (CCD, then CMOS), gathering high-speed videos of single combustion events became a breeze: This, along with the possibility of easy stockpiling of data, lend to underrate data analysis: Sort of trading the accuracy of measurement for the repeatability. Another critical phase is dealing with the stretch, which affects any real flame: Measured data must be processed to obtain the unstretched flame speed and, ultimately, the laminar burning velocity. The relationship between flame speed and stretch will be discussed, being a key factor for the deconvolution of experimental, stretch-affected data.

The so-called artificial tree shows excellent performance and stability for CO production (17.8 μmol g-1 h-1), almost 3 times that of pristine g-C3N4. Density functional theory computations explain the intrinsic cause for the formation of the Z-scheme structure. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be attributed to a synergistic effect of the following factors: (1) the combination of α-Fe2O3 with g-C3N4 helps to promote light harvesting and CO2 adsorption; (2) the hybridization effectively enhances the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, suppressing the undesirable recombination of charge carriers; (3) the dendritic structure of α-Fe2O3 provides ample active sites with considerable steps, edges, and kinks along the twigs, and meanwhile, the exposed (001) facet with high electron conduction facilitates photoelectrons' transportation to the interface. This work provides new insight into constructing Z-scheme photocatalysts for CO2 conversion.

Then, forward simulations of carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of atmospheric CH4 (δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4) were conducted using the inversion fluxes to evaluate the source proportion of the global total CH4 emission. Model-simulated spatiotemporal variations of atmospheric CH4 reproduce the observational results well; however, the simulated δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4 values significantly underestimate their observed values as a whole. This implies that the proportion of biogenic CH4 sources in the global CH4 emission, deduced by inverse modeling, is overestimated, although the proportion is fairly comparable with the medians of recent multiple CH4 inverse modeling. To reduce the disagreement between the observed and calculated isotope ratios, the CH4 fluxes of individual source categories were adjusted using our atmospheric δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4 data observed at Arctic and Antarctic surface stations. The resultant global average biogenic, fossil fuel, and biomass burning CH4 fluxes over 2003–2012 are 346 ± 11, 162 ± 2, and 50 ± 2 TgCH4 year−1, respectively. It is also strongly suggested that the leveling-off of atmospheric CH4 in the early 2000s and the renewed growth after 2006/2007 are, respectively, explainable by the decrease in biogenic and biomass burning CH4 emissions for 2000–2006 and the increase in biogenic CH4 emissions after that period. These emission changes mainly originate in the tropics. ©2020.

As part of the project, an Urban Energy Transition Methodology is developed, elaborated and used to create Roadmaps, which indicate the interventions needed to get from the current situation to the desired sustainable future state of a city. For one of the partner cities, Amsterdam, such a Roadmap was developed. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper discusses the approach and methodology behind the City-zen Urban Energy Transition Methodology, with its six steps from the initial energy analysis to the roadmap towards a desired future state. The paper will illustrate this by results from the Amsterdam Roadmap study, in numbers and figures. Findings: The Roadmap study of Amsterdam revealed that the city can become energy neutral in its heat demand, but not in the production of sufficient electricity from renewables. Research limitations/implications: Although as yet only applied to the City of Amsterdam, the methodology behind the roadmap can be applied by cities across the world. Practical implications: An enormous effort is required in order to transform, renovate and adapt parts of the city. It was calculated, for instance, how many energy renovation projects, district heating pipes and photovoltaic panels will be annually needed in order to timely become carbon neutral, energy neutral and “fossil free”. Social implications: The technical-spatial content of the Roadmap was presented to stakeholders of the Dutch capital city, such as politicians, energy companies, commercial enterprises, and not least citizens themselves. Although informed by scientific work, the Roadmap appealed too many, demonstrated by the extensive media coverage. Originality/value: The City-zen Methodology builds upon earlier urban energy approaches such as REAP (Tillie et al., 2009), LES (Dobbelsteen et al., 2011) and Energy Potential Mapping (Broersma et al., 2013), but creates a stepped approach that has not been presented and applied to a city as a whole yet. As far as the authors know, so far, an energy transition roadmap has never been developed for an entire city. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Energy transition roadmap; Fossil free; Sustainable cities; Urban energy transition; Zero carbon; Zero energy","alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy resource; future prospect; sustainability; targeting; transitional economy; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076542139

Design/methodology/approach: A design approach has been developed based on simulation software and a modeled building. Therefore, a typical office building is considered for testing five efficiency measures in three climatic conditions in Algeria. This approach is conducted in two phases: first, the analysis of each measure’s effect is independently carried out in terms of cooling energy and heating energy intensities. Then, a combination of optimal measures for each climate zone is measured in terms of three sustainable indicators: final energy consumption, energy cost saving and CO2 emission. Findings: The results reveal that a combination of optimal measures has a substantial impact on building energy saving and CO2 emission. This saving can rise to 41 and 31 percent in a hot and cold climate, respectively. Furthermore, it is concluded that obtaining higher building performance, different design alternatives should be adapted to the climate proprieties and the local construction materials must be applied. Originality/value: This study is considered as an opportunity for achieving the national strategy, as it may contribute in improving office building performance and demonstrating a suitable tool to assist stakeholders in the decision making of most important parameters in the design stage for new or retrofit buildings. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CO2 emission; Cost saving; Design approach; Energy efficiency measures; Final energy consumption; Sustainable buildings","architectural design; building construction; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; national strategy; sustainability; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072032799

Ammonia volatilization is a major pathway of agricultural Nr loss. Using a process-based dynamic model, Shen et al. show that ammonia volatilization from agricultural land in the US will increase by up to 81% by the end of this century due to climate change alone, posing threats to food security, air quality, and ecosystem health, but mitigation strategies are available. © 2020 The AuthorsAmmonia (NH3) loss from fertilized agricultural land has significant environmental and economic consequences. Using an integrated model, we showed that, under an intensely warming climate scenario, agricultural land NH3 emissions will increase by about 80% in the US by the end of this century because of climate change alone, posing a serious threat to crop production, air quality, and ecosystem health. We found that a combination of climate-adaptive agricultural management practices with attainable mitigation measures can completely offset the warming-induced increment in NH3 emissions and improve crop production, air quality, and ecosystem health. © 2020 The AuthorsCropland ammonia volatilization (VNH3,AG) is a major pathway of agricultural nitrogen loss. It remains unclear, however, how climate warming and human intervention (e.g., agricultural management) will affect VNH3,AG. Here, we use a fully coupled agroecosystem/chemical transport model and multiple climate projections to quantify the changes in climate-induced VNH3,AG over the US. We show that climate change under an intensely warming scenario will increase VNH3,AG by 81% (95% confidence interval, 69%–92%) from 2010 to 2100. The increase in VNH3,AG will cause a 10% loss of nitrogen applied, decrease crop yields by 540 Gg-N year−1, increase atmospheric burden of ammonia/ammonium by 18%, and increase ammonia/ammonium deposition to sensitive ecosystems by 14%. We have found that combining climate-adaptive agricultural practices with feasible mitigation measures can fully offset the warming-induced increase in VNH3,AG, saving 13% of applied nitrogen, increasing yields by 735 Gg-N year−1, and providing net benefits for air quality and ecosystem health. © 2020 The Authors","agricultural nitrogen loss; ammonia volatilization; climate warming; mitigation strategies","adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; agricultural practice; ammonia; ecosystem health; fertilizer application; food security; nitrogen; volatilization; warming; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096497250

In this regard, multifunctional electrode material development with high performance is a contemporary trend. We report an innovative integrated nanostructure of Co-NC3 (Co-MOF annealed at 700 °C for 3 h under Ar) bestowed with admirable potential, derived from a newly designed Co(II)-based MOF comprising benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline. The Co-NC3 nanostructure derived from Co-MOF was found to be a highly efficient catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction with onset potential (0.90 V vs RHE) and half-wave potential (0.81 V vs RHE) comparable to those for the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C catalyst (0.91 and 0.83 V vs RHE). Next, the same catalyst was explored as a commendable energy-storage material for supercapacitors with a specific capacitance value of 310 F/g at a 0.5 A/g current density. We fabricated a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device from Co-NC3 and lit light-emitting diodes of 1.8 V each using three such supercapacitors in series. For the first time, a Co-MOF-derived supercapacitor was deployed successfully in a solar photovoltaic-based sensor node system.

However, there are increasing concerns about conflicts between the supply of rare-earth elements (REs) (mainly neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium) and the global expansion of wind power. Here, we provide a dynamic, technology-rich, and regional-specific approach to exploring such conflicts among ten world regions through 2050 under four widely recognized climate scenarios. We find that the significant increase in RE demand driven by the ambitious 2050 global wind-power targets cannot be achieved without 11- to 26-fold expansion in the RE production. Material recycling and efficiency, production expansion, and technical innovation are promising for alleviating RE supply shortages in the long term. However, the existing global RE supply structure, along with the intensifying geopolitical and environmental constraints, could inhibit the rapid expansion of wind power, which calls for global cooperation to foster a sustainable and responsible RE supply chain. In 2019, the United Nations called for more ambitious climate action to prevent catastrophic climate change. Decarbonizing our energy systems is one of the most important actions we can take. In response, many countries have developed ambitious plans to expand wind power. However, wind turbines heavily rely on rare-earth elements (REs), and it remains unclear whether supply can meet demand. We investigated potential conflicts between RE demand and supply across ten global regions up to 2050 under four widely recognized climate scenarios. We found that RE supply capacity to support ambitious system-wide wind-power development is likely to be hindered by the monopolistic structure of the RE supply chain and intensified geopolitical and environmental constraints, and an 11- to 26-fold increase in production will be necessary to meet ambitious wind-power-expansion targets. To overcome these RE supply challenges, we highlight the importance of facilitating free trade and diversifying RE production via global cooperation. Enhanced climate action is needed, but ambitious global wind-power-expansion targets raise concern regarding potential conflicts between the supply and demand of rare-earth elements (REs). Li et al. explore such conflicts across ten global regions through 2050 under four scenarios. They show that RE supply might not be able to meet ambitious wind-power development given the monopolistic structure of the RE supply chain and escalated geopolitical and environmental constraints. Sustainable and responsible RE supply chains are possible only via global cooperation. © 2020 The Authors","climate change; energy-metal nexus; material flow analysis; rare-earth elements; scenario analysis; wind power","climate change; concentration (composition); energy management; material flow analysis; rare earth element; scenario analysis; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090745492

The reaction of UPy with GO occurs predominately via the epoxide and hydroxyl groups on the GO which was confirmed from a combination of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and 13C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) measurements. The nacre-like films obtained were typically 50-100 μm thick, from cross-section scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. The GO d-spacing (X-ray diffraction, XRD) increased with increasing UPy content from 0.934 to 1.45 nm, resulting in porous films with reduced tortuosity to oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water. However, at higher UPy content, reduced tortuosity is balanced with the ability of UPy dimers to readily dissociate and exchange with water. The tensile strength and tensile toughness of the GO nacre-like film increased by up to 470% and 1100% and the maximum strain by a factor of ∼2, for the film with the highest UPy content. These improvements are achieved through a mechanism of extension and unfolding of the linear chain of six carbon atoms in UPy, enhancing strain under tensile loading permitting the platelets to slide more before failure. This work highlights the impact of enhanced interlayer interactions via hydrogen bonding in producing polymer-free nacre-like films.

In order to know the energy demand, meteorological information has been produced with a spatial resolution of 50 meters, taking into account the three-dimensional structure of the buildings and the land use properties around the buildings. Climate variables are dynamically downscaled from 1° to 50 m using a nesting approach. Energy simulations of buildings are implemented with the EnergyPlus model. To determine the cost of impacts, the future distribution of energy sources in the two climate scenarios analysed and the corresponding 2012 prices of the Spanish Energy Commission are taken into account. Impacts on the area's energy demand are calculated for 2030, 2050 and 2100 versus 2011 under two IPCC global climate projections: RCP 4.5 (emission stabilization scenario) and RCP 8.5 (little effort to reduce emissions). The expected changes in electricity consumption in the year 2100 are very important. RCP 8.5 shows a strong increase in electricity demand for cooling buildings. In RCP 4.5 decreases in electricity consumption are observed (-14.37%) due to very important decreases in temperature. On average, the global climate for the year 2100 will have an impact on a typical building block in Madrid of 117918 euros per year according to scenario RCP 8.5 while in scenario RCP 4.5 110537 euros per year would be saved. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buildings; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power utilization; Energy management; Land use; Cooling buildings; Electricity demands; Electricity-consumption; Global climate changes; Global climate projections; Meteorological information; Spatial resolution; Three-dimensional structure; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090285859

This aspect is due to the fact that alcohols have good combustion properties and high oxygen content. Butanol is a viable fuel for blending with conventional fuels such as gasoline or diesel because of its high miscibility with these conventional fuels. The high combustion speed of butanol compared to that of gasoline ensures a shorter burning process thus the engine thermal efficiency can potentially be improved. Moreover, the additional oxygen content of the alcohol n-butanol can potentially improve the combustion process and can lead to a reduction of carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons emissions level. Utilizing butanol-gasoline blends can provide a good solution for the reduction of greenhouse gases level (CO2) and pollutants level (CO, HC, and NOx). An experimental study was carried out in a spark ignition engine which was fueled with a blend of n-butanol-gasoline at different volume percentages. The objective of this paper is to determine the effects of butanol on the engine energetic performances and on the emissions (HC, CO and NOx). At first the engine fueled with pure gasoline to set up a reference at the engine load χ=55%, engine speed of n=2500 min-1 and different excess air coefficients (λ). After setting the reference the engine was fueled with butanol-gasoline blend (10% vol. butanol 90% vol. gasoline) with the same engine adjustments. At butanol use the CO, HC and CO2 emissions level decreased, but the NOx emission level increased. The butanol can be considered a good alternative fuel for the spark ignition engines without modifications. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Alternative fuels; Blending; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Engines; Ethanol fuels; Greenhouse gases; Methanol fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Regional planning; Combustion pro-cess; Combustion property; Combustion speed; Conventional fuel; Engine thermal efficiency; Excess air coefficient; Un-burnt hydrocarbons; Volume percentage; Gasoline",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089532687

Our research comes to help fighting the biggest problem that our world is facing today, global warming. This study aims to evaluate the energy potential of biofuels obtained from camelina sativa in order to reduce fossil fuel dependence, greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency. Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is a cruciferous oilseed plant belonging to the Brassicaceae (mustard) family with the common name false flax and gold of pleasure. Since camelina can grow under different conditions without being a competitor of food land, this energetic plant can be used for production of both, firstand second-generation biofuels. In our study we determined the elemental analysis of the subproducts obtained from camelina sativa, through experimental tests, and we built a mathematical model to determine the calorific power and to simulate the burning of the biofuels into a steam generator in order to analyse the energy potential.

The partial or total transition to other types of fuels, such as hydrogen, involves substantial changes in the combustion process and possible necessary constructive changes. In the study of the combustion of CH4-H2 mixtures, both numerically and experimentally, preliminary calculations are required, which will help to easily establish the parameters and working regimes and then to use for verifying the results. This paper aims to find an easier method of calculating these parameters, depending on the percentage of gas in the fuel mixture. The calculated values resulted this way will lead to some logical estimates of important aspects of combustion, such as flame field and temperature variation, related to the variation of the amount of hydrogen in the mixture.

The module has three aluminum alloy legs that are vertically adjustable. This construction using Fresnel lenses mounted in a hexagonal raster will increase the energy collected by a photovoltaic panel, thus significantly reducing energy losses and long-term costs. Compared to normal lenses, these lenses are considerably lighter because the material in the center of the lens is reduced, and for manufacturing can be used methyl polymethacrylate or polycarbonate, thus greatly reducing manufacturing costs.

One of the renewable sources providing the biomass necessary for the generation of bioenergy, widely used in the last decades in the EU countries is the Miscanthus culture, which by capitalisation provides a series of economic benefits, but especially in terms of environment. This can be used for the production of electricity and/or thermal energy both in large power plants (30 MW +), which use thousands of tons of biomass annually, and in small domestic systems that use several tons, during the winter months. By using the Miscanthus in the combustion process, the carbon dioxide emissions are reduced and the methane emissions from the deposits are eliminated. In the case of applying the technology for Miscanthus culture direct harvesting (culture of perennial plants, over 2 m high, and high density), the technological process consists of cutting, chopping and loading in the means of transport of the harvested material. The paper presents the technological process of direct harvesting and analysis of the results obtained, achieved with the help of the trailed forage harvester CTF. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Global warming; Harvesting; Regional planning; Carbon dioxide emissions; Combustion pro-cess; Domestic systems; Economic benefits; Methane emissions; Perennial plants; Renewable sources; Technological process; Small power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089489334

Specifically, an installation with a fixed grill and a homogeneous distribution of the air inlet over the combustion space are considered. In order to provide a thorough background for the experimental research, this paper presents first the challenges related to the air distribution. If for coal gasification the difficulty of the homogeneous penetration of the air inlet within the whole combustion volume is balanced by the possibility of the direct emission of CO valorization, for biomass gasification this factor becomes fundamental. The original contribution of the technology introduced in this paper assumes an improved combustion process for Lurgi-type gas generators. The experimental installation employed has a particular design, enabling a homogeneous distribution of the air inlet over the entire combustion zone, up to the top of the embers layer. This allows achieving a maximum CO2 content in the flue gas flux, effectively reducing it inside the embers bed. The high calorific value of biofuels used favors developing an efficient combustion process, occurring at high temperatures. Thus, the reduction process of the CO2 is self-controlled. The experimental installation operates at a slow fuel rate, with discontinued supply and precise airflow control. The quality of the gas obtained is evaluated based on the resulting open flame, analyzing its composition. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","Biomass combustion; Biomass gasification; Energy recovery; Homogeneous air inlet; Lurgi process","Air intakes; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Gas generators; Quality control; Regional planning; Biomass Gasification; Efficient combustions; Experimental installations; Experimental investigations; Experimental research; Gasification technologies; High-calorific-value; Homogeneous distribution; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089480200

The performances obtained in the development of modern engines have been strongly influenced by the emergence and development of the investigation equipment, especially the laser and the modern computing technique. Maritime transport generates about 4% of the total CO2 emissions produced by human activities, which means that its carbon value is almost as large as that of Germany. Emissions from this sector are not yet internationally regulated, but this issue is currently being debated within the IMO and the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change (UNFCCC). Of the strategies to reduce pollutant emissions from ships, identified so far, the technical solutions are the first ones that have been implemented on board. The advantage of using technical solutions onboard ships is the high efficiency of reducing a product or several pollutant products, but the main disadvantage is the high cost of implementing and operating them on board ships. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Engines; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Pollution; Regional planning; Ships; Computing techniques; Experimental investigations; Human activities; Maritime transport; Pollutant emission; Reduction of pollutions; Technical solutions; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089471923

However, given the low partial pressure of CO2in the flue stream, separation of CO2is particularly challenging. Taking inspiration from the crystal structures of diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks exhibiting two-step cooperative CO2adsorption, we report a family of robust tetraamine-functionalized frameworks that retain cooperativity, leading to the potential for exceptional efficiency in capturing CO2under the extreme conditions relevant to natural gas flue emissions. The ordered, multimetal coordination of the tetraamines imparts the materials with extraordinary stability to adsorption-desorption cycling with simulated humid flue gas and enables regeneration using low-temperature steam in lieu of costly pressure or temperature swings. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, MKM results are often biased due to the overestimation of adsorption strength in DFT calculations that are usually performed at an arbitrary low coverage of surface intermediates. We hereby developed a new iterative approach focusing on the main species present on the catalyst at the steady state, hence allowing adsorption energy calculation only in the presence of relevant intermediates. In this way, the complex parametrization process to determine scaling relations between adsorption energies and coverages is avoided, which will increase the efficiency and accuracy of the iteration process. When applying this approach to CO2 hydrogenation over GaPd2, we found within few iterations that only when running DFT calculations using the surface with both CO and HCOO precovered, the coverage of surface species obtained from MKM analysis can be consistent with that used in DFT calculations. It stems from our theoretical study that all the species coverages must be self-consistent in order to predict methanol selectivity in fair agreement with experiment.

In this work, we explore other possibilities, which include nontransition metal elements (Mg, Ca, Sr., Al, Ga, In, Si, and Sn) as well as late transition metals (Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ir) and lanthanides (La and Ce), often used in catalysis. Using periodic slab models with large supercells and state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) based calculations, we show that, in all the studied cases, CO2 appears as bent and, hence, activated. However, the effect is especially pronounced for dopants with large ionic crystal radii. This can increase desorption temperature by up to 230 K, almost twice the value predicted when early transition metals are used as dopants. However, a detailed analysis of the results shows that the main effect does not come from the electronic structure perturbations but from the distortion that the dopant generates into the surface atomic structure. A simple descriptor is proposed that would allow predicting the effect of the dopant on CO2 adsorption energy in transition metal carbide surfaces without the need for DFT calculations.

With this study of syngenetically frozen, ice-rich and organic carbon (OC)-bearing Yedoma and associated alas deposits in central Yakutia (Republic of Sakha), we aimed to assess the local sediment deposition regime and its impact on permafrost carbon storage. For this purpose, we investigated the Yukechi alas area (61.76495° N, 130.46664° E), which is a thermokarst landscape degrading into Yedoma in central Yakutia. We retrieved two sediment cores (Yedoma upland, 22.35 m deep, and alas basin, 19.80 m deep) in 2015 and analyzed the biogeochemistry, sedimentology, radiocarbon dates and stable isotope geochemistry. The laboratory analyses of both cores revealed very low total OC (TOC) contents (< 0:1 wt %) for a 12 m section in each core, whereas the remaining sections ranged from 0.1 wt % to 2.4 wt % TOC. The core sections holding very little to no detectable OC consisted of coarser sandy material were estimated to be between 39 000 and 18 000 BP (years before present) in age. For this period, we assume the deposition of organic-poor material. Pore water stable isotope data from the Yedoma core indicated a continuously frozen state except for the surface sample, thereby ruling out Holocene reworking. In consequence, we see evidence that no strong organic matter (OM) decomposition took place in the sediments of the Yedoma core until today. The alas core from an adjacent thermokarst basin was strongly disturbed by lake development and permafrost thaw. Similar to the Yedoma core, some sections of the alas core were also OC poor (< 0:1 wt %) in 17 out of 28 samples. The Yedoma deposition was likely influenced by fluvial regimes in nearby streams and the Lena River shifting with climate. With its coarse sediments with low OC content (OC mean of 5.27 kg m-3), the Yedoma deposits in the Yukechi area differ from other Yedoma sites in North Yakutia that were generally characterized by silty sediments with higher OC contents (OC mean of 19 kg m-3 for the non-ice wedge sediment). Therefore, we conclude that sedimentary composition and deposition regimes of Yedoma may differ considerably within the Yedoma domain. The resulting heterogeneity should be taken into account for future upscaling approaches on the Yedoma carbon stock. The alas core, strongly affected by extensive thawing processes during the Holocene, indicates a possible future pathway of ground subsidence and further OC decomposition for thawing central Yakutian Yedoma deposits. © 2020 Author(s).",,"carbon sequestration; decomposition; Holocene; organic carbon; organic matter; permafrost; sediment analysis; stable isotope; subsidence; thawing; thermokarst; upscaling; Lena River; Russian Federation; Sakha; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089407219

In this regard, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating open metal sites (OMSs) have emerged as promising materials. In this article, we propose the spin crossover as an experimentally feasible strategy for controllable gas molecule capturing on the OMS-containing MOFs. To this end, we have selected the neutral and cationic forms of M2(BTC)4 with M = Ni and Cu as prototypes of the paddlewheel secondary building unit of HKUST-1 and DUT-8, respectively. The interplay between magnetic properties and the adsorption behaviors of M2(BTC)4 toward six small gas molecules (CH4, H2, N2, CO2, CO, and H2S) is investigated using first-principle calculations. It is found that the adsorption of gas molecules on the low spin (LS) state of copper and high spin (HS) state of nickel is thermodynamically more favored. Whereas the differences between the adsorption enthalpies on the LS and HS states for cupric systems are not significant, in the case of nickel centers, the differences can reach more than 150 kJ mol-1. Our results indicate that all gas molecules are strongly adsorbed at the HS state of nickel centers and change from being chemisorbed to being physisorbed at the LS state. Taking inspiration from these results, we introduce Ni2(BTC)4 paddlewheels as controllable CO2 capture materials via spin crossover at the Ni center. To our knowledge, this is the first study that suggests the spin transition as a promising approach for CO2 capture/release technology. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gases; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Molecules; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Adsorption behavior; Adsorption enthalpies; Efficient strategy; First principle calculations; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Secondary building units; Sorbent materials; Spin transition; Nickel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088592742

Kildare, Ireland","Observational evidence of a quasi-quadrennial oscillation (QQO) in the polar mesosphere is presented based on the analysis of 24 years of hydroxyl (OH) nightglow rotational temperatures derived from scanning spectrometer observations above Davis research station, Antarctica (68? S, 78° E). After removal of the long-term trend and solar cycle response, the residual winter mean temperature variability contains an oscillation over an approximately 3.5-4.5-year cycle with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 3-4 K. Here we investigate this QQO feature in the context of the global temperature, pressure, wind, and surface fields using satellite, meteorological reanalysis, sea surface temperature, and sea ice concentration data sets in order to understand possible drivers of the signal. Specifically, correlation and composite analyses are made with data sets from the Microwave Limb Sounder on the Aura satellite (Aura/MLS v4.2) and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics satellite (TIMED/SABER v2.0), ERA5 reanalysis, the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST v5), and Optimum-Interpolation (OI v2) sea ice concentration. We find a significant anti-correlation between the QQO temperature and the meridional wind at 86 km altitude measured by a medium-frequency spaced antenna radar at Davis (R2 ∼ 0:516; poleward flow associated with warmer temperatures at ∼ 0:83±0:21 K (ms-1)-1). The QQO signal is also marginally correlated with vertical transport as determined from an evaluation of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in the mesosphere (sensitivity 0:73 ± 0:45 K ppmv-1 CO, R2 ∼ 0:18). Together this relationship suggests that the QQO is plausibly linked to adiabatic heating and cooling driven by the meridional flow. The presence of quasi-stationary or persistent patterns in the ERA5 data geopotential anomaly and the meridional wind anomaly data during warm and cold phases of the QQO is consistent with tidal or planetary waves influencing its formation, which may act on the filtering of gravity waves to drive an adiabatic response in the mesosphere. The QQO signal plausibly arises from an ocean-atmosphere response, and appears to have a signature in Antarctic sea ice extent. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air temperature; atmospheric chemistry; climate oscillation; hydroxyl radical; mesopause; mesosphere; polar meteorology; Antarctica; Davis Station; East Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089404963

However, limited data is available on the methanogenesis potential associated with supplementing a solely BP formulated concentrate to a pastoral based diet. Therefore the objective of this in vitro study was to investigate the effects of BP inclusion rate (in a formulated concentrate) to a pasture based diet on dietary digestibility, rumen fermentation patterns, methane production and the prokaryotic microbial community composition. Diets consisted of perennial ryegrass and one of two supplementary concentrates, formulated to be isonitrogenous (16% CP) and isoenergetic (12.0 MJ/ME/kg), containing either 35% BP, barley and soybean meal (BP35) or 95% BP (BP95) offered on a 50:50 basis, however, starch, NDF and fat content varied. The BPs, included in equal proportions on a DM basis, were soyhulls, palm kernel expeller and maize dried distillers grains. The BP35 diet had greater (P &lt; 0.05) digestibility of the chemical constituents DM, OM, CP, NDF, ADF. Greater total VFA production was seen in the BP35 diet (P &lt; 0.05). Daily methane production (mmol/day; +22.7%) and methane output per unit of total organic matter digested (MPOMD; +20.8%) were greatest in the BP35 diet (P &lt; 0.01). Dietary treatment influenced microbial composition (PERMANOVA; P = 0.023) with a greater relative abundance of Firmicutes (adj P &lt; 0.01) observed in the BP35. The Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly reduced in the BP95 diet (P &lt; 0.01). The relative proportions of Proteobacteria (adj P &lt; 0.01), Succinivibrionaceae (adj P &lt; 0.03) and Succinivibrio (adj P = 0.053) increased in the BP95 diet. The abundance of Proteobacteria was found to be negatively associated with daily methane production (rs, −0.71; P &lt; 0.01) and MPOMD (rs, −0.65; P &lt; 0.01). Within Proteobacteria, the relationship of methane production was maintained with the mean abundance of Succinivibrio (rs, −0.69; P &lt; 0.01). The abundance of the Firmicutes phyla was found to be positively correlated with both daily methane production (rs, 0.79; P &lt; 0.001) and MPOMD (rs, 0.75; P &lt; 0.01). Based on in vitro rumen simulation data, supplementation of an exclusively BP formulated concentrate was shown to reduce daily methane output by promoting a favorable alteration to the rumen prokaryotic community. © Copyright © 2020 Smith, Waters, Kenny, Boland, Heffernan and Kelly.","16S rRNA; by-products; methane; rumen microbiome; RUSITEC","methane; Actinobacteria; Article; Bacillus; Bacteroidetes; barley; Basidiomycetes; controlled study; diet supplementation; DNA extraction; Euryarchaeota; feces analysis; fermentation; gas chromatography; gene amplification; gene expression; gene sequence; growth rate; high throughput sequencing; in vitro study; Lactobacillus; lipid composition; Methanobrevibacter; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbiome; nonhuman; perennial ryegrass; Planctomycetes; Prevotella; Proteobacteria; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; soil microflora; soybean meal; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089100402

To the best of the author’s knowledge, an SLR rooted in bibliometric analysis has not been carried focusing on advent developments in CLSC. SLR employs scientific methodologies to select papers from standard databases. The SLR using advanced bibliometric and network analysis enables unveiling the key features of the contemporary literature. Design/methodology/approach: The author has analyzed over 333 documents published from 2008 and onward. Using the contemporary tools from bibliometric analysis tools, the author presented an exploratory analysis. A network analysis is utilized to visualize literature and create clusters for the cocited research studies, keywords and publication sources. A detailed multivariate analysis of most influential works published based top 100 articles via a cocitation matrix is done. The multivariate analysis used k-means clustering in which optimal number of clusters are estimated. The analysis is further extended by using a factor analysis, which enables determining the most influential clusters in the k-means clustering analysis. Findings: The SLR using a bibliometric and network analysis enables unveiling the key features of the contemporary literature in CLSC. The author examined published research for influential authors, sources, region, among other key aspects. Network analysis enabled visualizing the clusters of cocited research studies, cowords and publication sources. Cluster analysis of cocited research studies is further explored using k-means clustering. Factor analysis extends findings by identifying most contributing grouping of research areas within CLSC research. Each clustering technique disclosed a unique grouping structure. Originality/value: CLSC has received considerable attention, and its core areas start with focusing on reverse logistics concepts relating reuse, recycling, remanufacturing, among others. Contemporarily, the studies have enhanced reverse logistics core functionalities interfaced with the other interesting avenues related to CO2 emission reduction, greening and environmental protection, sustainability, product design and governmental policies. Earlier studies have presented a literature review of CLSC; however, these reviews are commonly conducted in the traditional manner where the authors select papers based on their area of expertise, interest and experience.

We develop here a facile and scalable ""delignification-impregnation-carbonization""strategy to fabricate uniformly dispersed NiFe alloy nanoparticles anchored on bamboo stick-derived N-doped carbon fibers (NiFe@N-CFs) as an air cathode for flexible Zn-air batteries. Benefiting from the inherent cellulose fibers with abundant macroporous structures in the raw bamboo stick, the lignified carbon fibers possess an interconnected porous structure. In addition to having high electrical conductivity endowed by one-dimensional carbon fibers, this porous structure is favorable for exposure of more active surface sites for electrochemical reactions and fast mass transport. Moreover, the strong metal-support interaction between NiFe nanoparticles and N-doped carbon and their synergistic effect may also contribute to the catalytic performance. Consequently, the resultant electrocatalyst displays excellent catalytic activity and stability toward oxygen electrocatalysis with a remarkably small potential gap (ΔE) of 0.71 V between the half-wave potential (E1/2) of the ORR and the potential at 10 mA cm-2 (Ej=10) of the OER. When employed as a bifunctional air cathode in a liquid Zn-air battery, the NiFe@N-CF based device can achieve a peak power density of 102 mW cm-2 and specific capacity of 729 mA h gZn-1 and can be steadily cycled for 150 h at 10 mA cm-2, which is extraordinary. The NiFe@N-CFs can also be used as a self-supporting air cathode in a flexible quasi-solid-state Zn-air battery, showing high round-trip efficiency and mechanical stability.

Independent evaluation of this self-reporting system is a fast-growing research topic. Here, we study the value of satellite observations of the column CO2 concentrations to estimate CO2 anthropogenic emissions with 5 years of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) retrievals over and around China. With the detailed information of emission source locations and the local wind, we successfully observe CO2 plumes from 46 cities and industrial regions over China and quantify their CO2 emissions from the OCO-2 observations, which add up to a total of 1.3 GtCO2 yr-1 that accounts for approximately 13% of mainland China's annual emissions. The number of cities whose emissions are constrained by OCO-2 here is 3 to 10 times larger than in previous studies that only focused on large cities and power plants in different locations around the world. Our satellite-based emission estimates are broadly consistent with the independent values from China's detailed emission inventory MEIC but are more different from those of two widely used global gridded emission datasets (i.e., EDGAR and ODIAC), especially for the emission estimates for the individual cities. These results demonstrate some skill in the satellite-based emission quantification for isolated source clusters with the OCO-2, despite the sparse sampling of this instrument not designed for this purpose. This skill can be improved by future satellite missions that will have a denser spatial sampling of surface emitting areas, which will come soon in the early 2020s. © 2020 Author(s).",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); emission inventory; industrial district; observatory; power plant; satellite data; urban atmosphere; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089344097

We apply a four-dimensional variational data assimilation system, based around the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) transport-dispersion model. We ran a series of observing system simulation experiments to estimate posterior error statistics of optimized monthly-mean CO2 fluxes in Australia. Our assimilations were run with a horizontal grid resolution of 81 km using OCO-2 data for 2015. Based on four representative months, we find that the integrated flux uncertainty for Australia is reduced from 0.52 to 0.13 PgC yr?1. Uncertainty reductions of up to 90% were found at grid-point resolution over productive ecosystems. Our sensitivity experiments show that the choice of the correlation structure in the prior error covariance plays a large role in distributing information from the observations. We also found that biases in the observations would significantly impact the inverted fluxes and could contaminate the final results of the inversion. Biases in prior fluxes are generally removed by the inversion system. Biases in the boundary conditions have a significant impact on retrieved fluxes, but this can be mitigated by including boundary conditions in our retrieved parameters. In general, results from our idealized experiments suggest that flux inversions at this unusually fine scale will yield useful information on the carbon cycle at continental and finer scales. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

The trigger of such contributions can be traced to Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF). The problem of deforestation is complex, involving social, economic and political sectors. On the other hand, a holistic approach has not been widely discussed and implemented. This paper attempts to review and aims at providing potential answer on how to manage the forest and its relations with people in order to combat forest destruction caused by people. We believed that managing such relationship is the key to maintain the sustainability of the forest while keeping its roles and sustainability. Literature review was employed to develop a problem framework, and to develop alternatives in bridging the relationships between forest and local community. Collecting relevant literatures using keywords such as ""forest and climate change mitigation"", ""agroforestry and climate change"", ""ecotourism and climate change"", and ""agroforestry and ecotourism"", 96 articles were found. Further, through matching the content and the research goals of the articles, 13 articles were selected for further content analysis. We proposed agro-ecotourism as the alternative answer that can be pursued to balance the relationship between forest and people, especially in putting forest as an important partner rather than an exploitable asset. Hence, agro-ecotourism may help to increase the awareness among local community on the critical roles of the forest in the long term to fight against climate changes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Conservation; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Land use; Planning; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Content analysis; Greenhouse emissions; Holistic approach; Land-use change; Literature reviews; Local community; Research goals; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088923280

The recent literature has focused on genomic signatures of climatic adaptation, but little is known about how plastic capacity may be influenced by biogeographic and evolutionary processes. We investigate phenotypic plasticity as a target of climatic selection, hypothesizing that lineages that evolved in warmer climates will exhibit greater plastic adaptive resilience to upper thermal stress. This was experimentally tested by comparing transcriptomic responses within and among temperate, subtropical, and desert ecotypes of Australian rainbowfish subjected to contemporary and projected summer temperatures. Critical thermal maxima were estimated, and ecological niches delineated using bioclimatic modeling. A comparative phylogenetic expression variance and evolution model was used to assess plastic and evolved changes in gene expression. Although 82% of all expressed genes were found in the three ecotypes, they shared expression patterns in only 5 out of 236 genes that responded to the climate change experiment. A total of 532 genes showed signals of adaptive (i.e., genetic-based) plasticity due to ecotype-specific directional selection, and 23 of those responded to projected summer temperatures. Network analyses demonstrated centrality of these genes in thermal response pathways. The greatest adaptive resilience to upper thermal stress was shown by the subtropical ecotype, followed by the desert and temperate ecotypes. Our findings indicate that vulnerability to climate change will be highly influenced by biogeographic factors, emphasizing the value of integrative assessments of climatic adaptive traits for accurate estimation of population and ecosystem responses. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to (i) compare the performance of a methanogenic BES between CO2-fed and biogas-fed cycles; (ii) investigate possible factors that may account for observed performance differences; and (iii) assess the performance of a biogas-fed biocathode at various applied cathode potentials. The maximum 1-d CH4 production rate in a biogas-fed biocathode (3003 mmol/m2-d) was 350% higher than in a CO2-fed biocathode (666 mmol/m2-d), and the biogas-fed biocathode was capable of maintaining high performance despite a variable biogas feed composition. Anode oxidation of reduced gases (e.g., CH4 and H2S) from biogas may theoretically contribute 4% to 35% of the total charge transfer from anode to cathode at applied cathode potentials of-0.80 to-0.55 V (vs SHE). The introduction of biogas did not significantly change the biocathode archaeal community (dominated by a Methanobrevibacter sp. phylotype), but the bacterial community shifted away from Bacteroidetes and toward Proteobacteria, which may have contributed to the improved performance of the biogas-fed system. This study shows that anaerobic digester biogas is a promising biocathode feedstock for BES biogas upgrading.

Trade-related provincial CO2 emission accounts have been reported and analyzed for China using three independently developed multiregional input-output (MRIO) models which have been widely used. Here we show that significant divergence exists in both consumption-based and income-based CO2 emission accounts for Chinese provinces in 2012 using different MRIO models. For example, the difference of CO2 emissions for Shandong Province calculated from two MRIO models can reach 208Mt, more than the terrestrial emissions of Argentina, United Arab Emirates, or The Netherlands. Reducing such divergence, however, requires only the agreement among various MRIO models on a small number of critical data elements.

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains much lower as compared to the state-of-the-art PSCs with conventional organic HTLs and noble metal electrodes, mainly due to the intrinsically inferior contact at the perovskite/carbon interface and high sheet resistance of carbon electrodes. To deal with these issues, C-based HTL-free PSCs with a modular design were fabricated, i.e., the final PSCs were assembled by two individual elements (semi-cell A and charge collector B) under pressure. Moreover, the mixed perovskite active layers were obtained using a modified anti-solvent dripping method, in which the oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (O-MWCNTs) were dispersed in an anti-solvent solution and its concentration was optimized for the best overall performance. Results indicated that the contact quality at the perovskite/carbon interface was remarkably improved by using this innovative method; the corresponding mechanism was attributed to the penetration of O-MWCNTs into both layers and the formation of a perovskite/carbon hetero-junction, thus forming a fast hole transport pathway from a perovskite to a carbon electrode with reduced recombination loss. As a result, the PCE increased up to 8.99%, and the unencapsulated PSCs retained 80% of their initial PCE under ambient conditions without intentionally controlling humidity for 500 h. We reported a feasible and effective strategy to improve the perovskite/carbon interface in C-based HTL-free PSCs.

By tracking the evolution of the excited states by transient absorption spectra and the kinetics of the instantaneous emission dipole moments obtained from transient fluorescence spectroscopy, it is found that, in nonpolar solvent, the relaxed S1 state is quadrupolar with little change of emission dipole moments for the two molecules within 30 ps, whereas in polar solvent, the quadrupolar state evolves to a symmetry broken S1 state, in which, the emission dipole moment exhibits a fast reduction in the first few picoseconds. The larger reduction in emission transition dipole moment for the molecule with stronger electron-donating methoxy groups indicates a larger extent of symmetry breaking compared with the one with weak electron-donating methyl groups. Consequently, we revealed that the magnitude of symmetry breaking can be tuned by changing the electron-donors in quadrupolar molecules. © 2020 the Owner Societies.",,"Charge transfer; Dipole moment; Electrons; Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Molecules; Charge-transfer dynamics; Electron-donating; Electron-donating ability; Emission transition; Femtosecond transient absorption; Non-polar solvents; Symmetry-breaking; Transient absorption spectra; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088252305

Spatially resolved concentration and temperature profiles reveal that addition of hydrogen to the lean reaction mixture leads to significant heat production and an increase in methane conversion. Moreover, reductive pulses during operation are not only able to regenerate the catalyst deactivated by water by removal of OH-groups from the catalyst surface, but even promote its activity after repeated application of pulsing for several hours. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the formation of a partially reduced PdO−Pd mixture during the pulsing, which explains the increase in activity. This state of high activity is stable for several hours under the tested lean conditions. The results presented in this study suggest an efficient in situ activation strategy to overcome water inhibition of methane total oxidation over Pd−Pt catalysts by careful process control. © 2020 The Authors.

India is home to a fifth of the world's population and a gamut of human activities, employing a far ranging spectrum of technologies and fuels, with consequent emissions. Atmospheric fine particles or aerosols in the region predominate in carbonaceous constituents and dust. Multi-institutional studies in the region have earlier focused on natural and anthropogenic climate forcing by aerosols and feedbacks on regional and global climate. Important gaps remain in understanding human activities influencing emissions, emission aerosol properties, and regional atmospheric processes, specifically those related to carbonaceous aerosol impacts on climate and air quality. With an aim to address these gaps, the COALESCE (Carbonaceous Aerosol Emissions, Source Apportionment and Climate Impacts) project was launched on 7 July 2017. The project adopts integration of scientific methods developed by both the climate and air quality research communities. New fundamental knowledge from the project and strong links to India's policy framework would enable climate and clean-air action in the region.

Unfortunately, this ""neo-traditional trend"" (Abdelsalam et al., 2013) is hindered by the performance of vernacular solutions, which are unable to meet the new needs of contemporary society. Advocates of this ideology believe that this situation is due to a lack of knowledge of these vernacular devices. From this point of view, this paper aims to establish a better knowledge of them for the purpose of improving their performance within contemporary buildings. Thus, it presents a comparison study between the traditional architecture represented by the Algiers Kasbah house and the M'zab valley house in Algeria. The choice of the case studies was made in light of the fact that notwithstanding the very opposite environmental contexts of each case study, they belong to the same typology of traditional houses called ""house with wast ed dar"". In fact, they share several similar environmental features such as the patio and the terrace. Even though initially there appear to be many similarities, some aspects of these devices vary from one environmental context to another. Therefore, this paper investigates the urban layout in which the houses are built as well as the principles of design and building materials in order to explore the impact of the physical and climatic conditions, referred to in this article as the ""geo-climatic environment"", on the environmental devices developed by each house. It compares the performance of these devices and how they respond to their geo-climatic environment in order to better understand their functioning mode which is the key of their successful adaptation to each environmental context and which could be the key to any future use of these vernacular devices in contemporary buildings. © Authors 2020.

Here, we investigate whether sea-ice drift can influence the stellar flux threshold for a snowball climate onset on rapidly rotating aqua-planets around a Sun-like star. Using a fully coupled atmosphere-land-ocean-sea-ice model and turning sea-ice drift on or off, circular orbits with no eccentricity (e = 0) and an eccentric orbit (e = 0.2) are examined. When sea-ice drift is turned off, the stellar flux threshold for the snowball onset is 1250-1275 and 1173-1199 W m-2 for e = 0 and 0.2, respectively. The difference is mainly due to the poleward retreat of sea ice and snow edges when the planet is close to the perihelion in the eccentric orbit. When sea-ice drift is turned on, the respective stellar flux threshold is 1335-1350 and 1250-1276 W m-2. This means that sea-ice drift increases the snowball onset threshold by ≈80 W m-2 for both e = 0 and 0.2, promoting the formation of a snowball climate state. We further show that oceanic dynamics have a small effect, ≤26 W m-2, on the snowball onset threshold. This is because oceanic heat transport becomes weaker and weaker as the sea-ice edge is approaching the equator. These results imply that sea-ice dynamics are important for the climate of planets close to the outer edge of the habitable zone, but oceanic heat transport is less important. © 2020.

The re-emitted thermal radiation from the nightside facing the observers during the transit event of such a planet contributes to the transmitted stellar radiation. We demonstrate that the transit spectra at the infrared region get altered significantly when such re-emitted thermal radiation of the planet is included. We assess the effects of the thermal emission of the hot Jupiters on the transit spectra by simulating observational spectroscopic data with corresponding errors from the different channels of the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. We find that the effect is statistically significant with respect to the noise levels of those simulated data. Hence, we convey the important message that the planetary thermal re-emission must be taken into consideration in the retrieval models of transit spectra for hot Jupiters for a more accurate interpretation of the observed transit spectra. © 2020.

Here we use spaceborne radar observations from CloudSat to map the precipitation frequency and phase on the GrIS, and we use those observations, in combination with a satellite simulator to enable direct comparison between observations and model, to evaluate present-day precipitation frequency in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The observations show that substantial variability of snowfall frequency over the GrIS exists, that snowfall occurs throughout the year, and that snowfall frequency peaks in spring and fall. Rainfall is rare over the GrIS and only occurs in regions under 2000 m elevation and in the peak summer season. Although CESM overestimates the rainfall frequency, it reproduces the spatial and seasonal variability of precipitation frequency reasonably well. Driven by the high-emission, worst-case Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario, CESM indicates that rainfall frequency will increase considerably across the GrIS, and will occur at higher elevations, potentially exposing a much larger GrIS area to rain and associated meltwater refreezing, firn warming, and reduced storage capacity.

The catalysts are the phosphinoborane Ph2P(CH2)2BBN (1), easily accessible in a one-step synthesis from diphenyl(vinyl)phosphine and 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (H-BBN), and its formaldehyde adduct Ph2P(CH2)2BBN(CH2O) (2), detected in the catalytic reduction of CO2 with 1 as the catalyst but properly prepared from compound 1 and p-formaldehyde. Reduction of CO2 with H-BBN gave mixtures of CH2(OBBN)2 (A) and CH3OBBN (B) using both catalysts. Stoichiometric and kinetic studies allowed us to unveil the key role played in this reaction by the formaldehyde adduct 2 and other formaldehyde-formate species, such as the polymeric BBN(CH2)2(Ph2P)(CH2O)BBN(HCO2) (3) and the bisformate macrocycle BBN(CH2)2(Ph2P)(CH2O)BBN(HCO2)BBN(HCO2) (4), whose structures were confirmed by diffractometric analysis. Reduction of CO2 with catecholborane (HBcat) led to MeOBcat (C) exclusively. Another key intermediate was identified in the reaction of 2 with the borane and CO2, this being the bisformaldehyde-formate macrocycle (HCO2){BBN(CH2)2(Ph2P)(CH2O)}2Bcat (5), which was also structurally characterized by X-ray analysis. In contrast, using pinacolborane (HBpin) as the reductant with catalysts 1 and 2 usually led to mixtures of mono-, di-, and trihydroboration products HCO2Bpin (D), CH2(OBpin)2 (E), and CH3OBpin (F). Stoichiometric studies allowed us to detect another formaldehyde-formate species, (HCO2)BBN(CH2)2(Ph2P)(CH2O)Bpin (6), which may play an important role in the catalytic reaction. Finally, only the formaldehyde adduct 2 turned out to be active in the catalytic hydroboration of CO2 using BH3·SMe2 as the reductant, yielding a mixture of two methanol-level products, [(OMe)BO]3 (G, major product) and B(OMe)3 (H, minor product). In this transformation, the Lewis adduct (BH3)Ph2P(CH2)2BBN was identified as the resting state of the catalyst, whereas an intermediate tentatively formulated as the Lewis adduct of compound 2 and BH3 was detected in solution in a stoichiometric experiment and is likely to be mechanistically relevant for the catalytic reaction.

This process is involved in pulmonary damage in patients exposed to airborne pollutants (exogenous stressors) and also to systemic inflammation/oxidative stress (endogenous stressors) associated with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Recent Advances: PNI is an important trigger of the early onset and progression of NCD in susceptible patients exposed to airborne pollutants. Irritation of the lung microvasculature by exogenous and endogenous stressors causes PNI. Circulating endogenous stressors in NCD can cause PNI. Critical Issues: Air pollution-triggered PNI causes increased circulating endogenous stressors that can trigger NCD in susceptible patients. Systemic inflammation/oxidative stress associated with NCD can cause PNI. Inflammation/end-oxidation products of macromolecules are also potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for NCD-triggered PNI-and PNI-triggered NCD. Future Directions: Understanding the molecular mechanism of PNI triggered by exogenous or endogenous stressors will help explain the early onset of NCD in susceptible patients exposed to air pollution. It can also help undercover biomarkers and mechanism-based therapeutic targets in air pollutant-triggered PNI, PNI-triggered NCD, and NCD-triggered PNI. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","airborne pollution; biomarker; noncommunicable disease; pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation; stressor; therapeutic target","bindarit; inducible nitric oxide synthase; lipid; myeloperoxidase; myeloperoxidase inhibitor; natural product; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; rosiglitazone; superoxide dismutase; biological marker; air pollution; atherosclerosis; autoimmune disease; cardiovascular disease; cell membrane permeability; chronic disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; degenerative disease; exosome; human; leukocyte activation; lung fibrosis; macromolecule; neutrophil; neutrophil chemotaxis; non communicable disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; oxidation; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; pneumonia; priority journal; pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation; Review; signal transduction; disease predisposition; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; non communicable disease; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology; pneumonia; Biomarkers; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Neutrophil Infiltration; Neutrophils; Noncommunicable Diseases; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Pneumonia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087111004

With the improvement of people’ living standard, the consumption of energy in residential sector has raised swiftly, leading to a rapid increase in corresponding CO2 emissions. To effectively mitigate household emissions, taking the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in China as a case study, this paper proposes a novel intelligent model combining driving forces exploration and prediction. The work first estimates the residential energy-related CO2 emissions precisely, and then the bivariate correlation analysis will be applied to analyze region discrepancy in main affecting factors of emissions based on 13 preliminary indicators. To obtain the principal information of above influencing factors as the input of prediction model, the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is introduced innovatively. Besides, butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) is enhanced to better optimize the parameters of least square support vector machine (LSSVM). The new proposed hybrid model, hereafter called as EBOA-LSSVM, will be utilized to predict residential CO2 emissions in the YRD. Ultimate simulation results present the new model's prominent performance through comparing prediction accuracy with other models. Finally, this article provides some advice for policy makers to guide CO2 emissions reduction from residents department. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bivariate correlation analysis; Butterfly optimization algorithm; Household CO2 emissions; Least square support vector machine","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Factor analysis; Housing; Optimization; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Bivariate correlations; Consumption of energy; Intelligent modeling; Kernel principal component analyses (KPCA); Least square support vector machines; Optimization algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Yangtze river delta; Forecasting; algorithm; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental policy; numerical model; optimization; prediction; strategic approach; algorithm; Article; butterfly optimization algorithm; carbon footprint; China; comparative study; household; human; mathematical model; prediction; priority journal; residential area; river ecosystem; simulation; support vector machine; China; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084179873

However, there have been only limited studies of BC emissions from residential biofuel stoves based on real-time measurements. In this study, a photo-acoustic extinctiometer (PAX)-based real-time measurement system was employed to monitor the emission characteristics of corncobs, corn stalks, cotton stalks and poplar branches in simple or improved stoves (with a total of 16 units) in Hebei Province, China. The real-time and phased emissions of BC, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were assessed, and the effects of stove type and fuel on emissions were analyzed. Under the same conditions, polar branches were associated with the highest BC emission factors (EFs) of up to 2.64 ± 0.42 g kg−1, while the EFs for improved stoves were higher than those for simple stoves. During the ignition phase, BC emissions were found to be low, while the later addition of fuel dramatically increased emissions, followed by a gradual decrease until the next fuel addition. The phased results show that the flaming phase had the highest BC emission rate, the fuel addition phase was associated with the highest BC EF. The BC emission rates and EFs for the ignition, fuel addition, flaming and smoldering phases ranged from 0.0014–0.014, 0.11–6.32, 0.18–2.24 and 0.03–0.32 mg s−1, and from 0.04–0.18, 0.38–9.53, 0.45–3.55 and 0.12–1.01 g kg−1, respectively. This study assessed the BC emissions from residential biofuel stoves using a larger sample size than in prior work. The results increase our understanding of the BC emissions process, which is helpful in terms of improving the accuracy of BC EF estimations. The real-time measurement process described herein is also expected to provide new approaches to minimizing BC emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuel combustion; Black carbon; Emission factor; Real-time measurement; Real-world characteristic","Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Housing; Image enhancement; Particulate emissions; Rural areas; Time measurement; Adverse effect; Emission characteristics; Emission factors; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Hebei Province; Improved stoves; Pollutant emission; Real time measurements; Stoves; biofuel; black carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; biofuel; atmospheric pollution; biofuel; black carbon; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollutant transport; real time; rural area; source apportionment; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; China; combustion; controlled study; emission factor; environmental parameters; Gossypium; household; maize; measurement accuracy; online system; particulate matter; photo acoustic extinctiometer; pollution and pollution related phenomena; priority journal; residential area; rural area; sample size; stove; air pollutant; household; human; pollutant; China; Hebei; Gossypium hirsutum; Zea mays; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; China; Environmental Pollutants; Household Articles; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083496908

A life cycle environmental impacts-based model was created using high resolution local data on household waste and current management practices in combination with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) datasets. The model allows users to define key system parameters such as masses of materials, transport options and end-of-life processes and produces results for 11 environmental impact categories including the Global Warming Potential (GWP). The results from the application of this model on the case study of Cornwall have shown that the substitution of PET with glass as the material for bottling under the current waste infrastructure and management practices could lead to significant increases in GWP and hinder efforts to tackle climate change. A sensitivity analysis of the glass/PET mass ratio suggests that in order to achieve equal GWP the glass bottles need to become approximately 38% of the weight they are now. Increasing the recycled content and decreasing losses during the recycling processes could also help lower the GWP by 18.9% and 14.5%, respectively. This model can be expanded further to include more types of plastics and other regions to evaluate designs of new regional circular economy with less plastics waste and pollution. Our study suggests that it is necessary and crucial to consider the specific waste infrastructure and management practices in place and use science-based models that incorporate life cycle thinking to evaluate any solutions to plastics pollution in order to avoid problem shifting. © 2020","Circular economy; Decision support; LCA; Plastics; Waste management","Aliphatic compounds; Artificial life; Climate models; Economic and social effects; Elastomers; Glass; Glass bottles; Global warming; Life cycle; Plastic bottles; Plastic products; Pollution; Polyethylene terephthalates; Sensitivity analysis; Waste management; Circular economy; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle thinking; Life-cycle environmental impact; Management practices; Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); Recycling process; Plastic recycling; plastic; polyethylene terephthalate; climate change; data set; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; plastic waste; pollution monitoring; polymer; trade-off; waste management; waste treatment; Article; climate change; controlled study; domestic waste; England; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; environmental protection; Global Warming Potential; greenhouse effect; household; life cycle assessment; pollution; priority journal; recycling; sensitivity analysis; waste disposal; weight; Cornwall [England]; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083484936

In this study, we collected soils from a grassland with 11-year history of nitrogen addition (0, 60, 120, and 240 kg N ha−1 yr−1 NH4NO3), and the soils were incubated for 6 weeks to estimate the direction and magnitude of soil priming and the underlying microbial carbon use strategy. We found glucose addition triggered a positive priming effect among all the treatments; however, the magnitude of the positive priming did not change under nitrogen addition. The stable soil organic carbon content under different nitrogen addition levels might support the no significant change in the magnitude of those positive priming. Using DNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP), we found that bacterial and fungal taxa consuming the added glucose were different in different nitrogen addition levels. The relative abundance of the K-strategist Acidobacteria increased with increasing nitrogen addition levels, while the r-strategist Firmicutes decreased with increasing nitrogen addition levels.

The predicted increase in flooding frequency and severity due to climate change could increase N2O emissions and shift grasslands from a net CH4 sink to a source. Therefore, effective management strategies are critical for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from flood-prone grasslands. We tested how repeated flooding affected the N2O and CH4 emissions from 11 different plant communities (Festuca arundinacea, Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis, and Trifolium repens in monoculture, 2- and 4-species mixtures), using intact soil cores from an 18-month old grassland field experiment in a 4-month greenhouse experiment. To elucidate potential underlying mechanisms, we related plant functional traits to cumulative N2O and CH4 emissions. We hypothesized that traits related with fast nitrogen uptake and growth would lower N2O and CH4 emissions in ambient (non-flooded) conditions, and that traits related to tissue toughness would lower N2O and CH4 emissions in flooded conditions. We found that flooding increased cumulative N2O emissions by 97 fold and cumulative CH4 emissions by 1.6 fold on average. Plant community composition mediated the flood-induced increase in N2O emissions. In flooded conditions, increasing abundance of the grass F. arundinacea was related with lower N2O emissions; whereas increases in abundance of the legume T. repens resulted in higher N2O emissions. In non-flooded conditions, N2O emissions were not clearly mediated by plant traits related with nitrogen uptake or biomass production. In flooded conditions, plant communities with high root carbon to nitrogen ratio were related with lower cumulative N2O emissions, and a lower global warming potential (CO2 equivalent of N2O and CH4). We conclude that plant functional traits related to slower decomposition and nitrogen mineralization could play a significant role in mitigating N2O emissions in flooded grasslands. © 2018","Extreme weather event; Flooding; Intensively managed grassland; Methane emissions; Nitrous oxide emissions; Plant functional traits","Floods; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Biomass productions; Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio; Effective management; Festuca arundinacea; Global warming potential; Greenhouse experiments; Nitrogen mineralization; Non-flooded conditions; Gas emissions; nitrogen dioxide; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; community composition; emission control; environmental management; flood frequency; flooding; grassland; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; plant community; Article; biomass production; carbon footprint; carbon nitrogen ratio; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; flooding; grassland; greenhouse effect; nitrogen mineralization; nitrogen uptake; nonhuman; plant community; priority journal; soil analysis; species composition; tall fescue; white clover; flooding; greenhouse gas; soil; Festuca arundinacea; Lolium perenne; Poa trivialis; Trifolium repens; Carbon Dioxide; Floods; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083390088

Previous studies have found that air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory infection by carrying microorganisms and affecting body's immunity. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ambient air pollutants and the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2 and O3) with COVID-19 confirmed cases. We observed significantly positive associations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the last two weeks with newly COVID-19 confirmed cases. A 10-μg/m3 increase (lag0–14) in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 was associated with a 2.24% (95% CI: 1.02 to 3.46), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.89 to 2.63), 6.94% (95% CI: 2.38 to 11.51), and 4.76% (95% CI: 1.99 to 7.52) increase in the daily counts of confirmed cases, respectively. However, a 10-μg/m3 increase (lag0–14) in SO2 was associated with a 7.79% decrease (95% CI: −14.57 to −1.01) in COVID-19 confirmed cases. Our results indicate that there is a significant relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 infection, which could partially explain the effect of national lockdown and provide implications for the control and prevention of this novel disease. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Generalized additive model; Novel coronavirus pneumonia","Air pollution; Disease control; Nitrogen oxides; Air pollutants; Control and prevention; Coronaviruses; Generalized additive model; Meteorological variables; Pollution concentration; Risk factors; Short-term exposure; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease incidence; health impact; infectious disease; infectivity; pollution effect; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; risk factor; viral disease; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease association; exposure; particulate matter; priority journal; risk factor; Betacoronavirus; city; environmental exposure; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083335173

In order to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of emission reduction policies, it is very important to separate meteorological effects from emissions in long-term PM changes. In this study, we used surface extinction coefficient (SEC) of aerosol particles as an indicator to estimate the long-term trend of PM pollutant conditions, and proposed a parameter surface ventilation index (SVI) to describe the atmospheric diffusion. A novel method was introduced to quantify the effect of atmospheric diffusion and emissions on SEC from an inter-annual scale, and its applicability and limitations was discussed. The results showed that annual mean SEC exhibited an increasing trend with a rate of 15.6 Mm−1∙year−1 from 2000 to 2007 and a decreasing trend with a rate of 14.4 Mm−1∙year−1 from 2008 to 2018. The annual frequency distribution of SVI obeyed a lognormal distribution. The SVI value mainly concentrated between 300 and 3600 m2.s−1, SEC was negatively correlated with SVI in this range. In most cases, SEC variations were mainly dominated by emissions, and SEC variations at clean sites were more influenced by atmospheric diffusion than that at polluted sites. Emissions remained high during 2003–2007, then gradually decreased during 2008–2014 and finally accelerated decrease during 2015–2018, indicating that control policies have effectively mitigated PM pollution since 2008. In generally, this method can provide valuable information for policy makers to evaluate the emission control measures for air pollution mitigation and prevention. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric diffusion; Quantitative effects; Surface extinction coefficient; Surface ventilation index","Aerosols; Diffusion; Emission control; River pollution; Emission control measures; Emission reduction policies; Extinction coefficients; Frequency distributions; Log-normal distribution; Meteorological condition; Meteorological effects; Pearl River Delta region; Air pollution; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; diffusion; particulate matter; policy making; aerosol; air pollution control; article; atmospheric diffusion; comparative effectiveness; pollutant; quantitative analysis; river",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083330029

Identifying the dominant factors driving CEI of the transport sector is important for CEI mitigation. This paper applied dynamic panel quantile regression to explore the effect of driving factors on CEI in the Chinese transport sector at the provincial level during 2000–2016. The empirical findings indicate that economic growth has a positive influence on CEI at low quantiles, whereas this effect is the opposite at high quantiles. Further, the findings show an inverted U-shaped pattern between economic growth and CEI at low quantiles, which validates the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis in low-CEI provinces. Energy intensity positively influences CEI, with the greatest impact occurring at higher quantiles. Among the lowest CEI provinces, private vehicles and cargo turnover appear to contribute to CEI, and a positive impact of urbanization exists, except at the 5th and 30th quantiles. In conclusion, policy implications for effectively promoting the CEI abatement in the transport sector are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission intensity; China; Driving factors; Quantile regression; Transport sector","Carbon; Public policy; Urban growth; Carbon emission intensities; Empirical findings; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Heterogeneous effects; Policy implications; Private vehicles; Quantile regression; Transport sectors; Economics; carbon emission; economic growth; environmental economics; heterogeneity; hypothesis testing; Kuznets curve; model test; model validation; panel data; policy approach; regression analysis; targeting; traffic emission; analytic method; Article; car driving; carbon footprint; China; economic development; energy resource; environmental impact; mathematical model; motor vehicle; priority journal; public policy; traffic and transport; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083308968

In this study, a multi-scenario ensemble simulation and environmental input-output (MES-EIO) model is developed for analyzing the impacts of different behaviors/policies over various economic sectors and generating the desired schemes of mitigating multi-pollutant emissions. MES-EIO is not only capable of simulating environmental emissions over a long-term planning horizon, but also describing the impacts of complex economic system on multi-pollutant and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The MES-EIO model is also applied to a real case of Guangdong province (in China) to display its applicability in environmental-emission simulation, where multiple scenarios are designed to examine the effects of different system components on modeling outputs. The major findings are: (i) agriculture, manufacturing and energy production would be the main environmental emission sectors over the planning period; (ii) through ensemble simulation, it could be noted that emissions of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3–N), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) would decrease by [17.6%, 60.7%], [14.7%, 59.3%], [28.3%, 63.4%] and [29.7%, 64.1%] during 2020–2030; (iii) rapid economic development may lead the city encounter the risk of severe environmental pollution, while low economic growth could not meet the demand of population expansion and urbanization; (iv) according to the results of scheme analysis, scenario S2-3-1 (followed by scenario S2-2-1) would be optimal for supporting sustainable development within the study area. The findings are helpful for generating optimized emission-reduction schemes that can effectively balance the tradeoff between socioeconomic development and environmental conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emission mitigation; Ensemble simulation; Input-output model; Multiple scenarios; Production activities; Scheme analysis","Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Chemical oxygen demand; Economic analysis; Emission control; Manufacture; Nitrogen oxides; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Emission mitigation; Ensemble simulation; Input output model; Multiple scenarios; Production activity; Scheme analysis; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082865241

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of a recently implemented policy to upgrade the quality of gasoline on reducing the fine particulate matter (PM) concentration. Based on regression discontinuity (RD) design, we systematically analyze the policy effect on the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at three scales, namely, the macro-, meso-, and microscales. Macroscale analysis measures the impact on all cities, and mesoscale analysis measures it on all monitoring stations, while microscale analysis focuses on the rush hours at each station. Our results show that the policy has little effect on reducing particulate matter pollution at the macro- or mesoscale, while positive evidence does exist at the microscale when focusing on pollution reduction during rush hours, especially for areas near main roads or junctions with heavy traffic. Our research suggests that the policy impact is affected by the heterogeneous pollution sources, and the potential of mitigating air pollution by continually upgrading the quality of gasoline will be limited after five stages of upgrades. In addition, one single policy can hardly completely solve particulate matter pollution in China, and a systematic design consisting of a series of policies is needed to mitigate this problem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control; Gasoline upgrade policy; Particulate matter; Regression discontinuity design","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Gasoline; Quality control; Air pollution in chinas; Fine particulate matter; Macroscale analysis; Micro-scale analysis; Monitoring stations; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter pollution; Pollution reduction; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082832031

Finding a free parking lot plays a role in reducing traffic congestion, gas emissions, and increasing the quality of life of people living and working in it. Therein, the fundamental part of every smart parking system is the detection of vehicle presence, which is usually employed by devices comprised of power-hungry sensors. This paper gives an extension to state-of-the-art by a systematic in-depth overview of technologies used for the smart parking detection realization consuming mW of power. Deeper insights on the real-scenario performances and power consumption of most popular sensor devices and Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) radio technologies available today (LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT) are provided. The results show that based on the architectures of IoT system, lowest consumption is for LoRa devices. Further, analysis of power consumption of commercial LPWA-based Smart parking sensor device is provided along with battery estimation lifetime, which is especially important for the deployment of future smart parking solutions. Battery lifetime heavily depends on the number of parking lots exchanges and based on the less frequent changes, the estimated battery lifetime is approximately 7 years. Inspired by the limitations of power-hungry and relatively expensive smart parking sensor devices, two strategies for the optimization are proposed: first one is based on the premise where a drop in received signal strength of the LPWA device can serve as the presence of the vehicle in the parking lot, while the second one proposes a big picture on a novel architecture for harvesting the surrounding energy and using the same for circuitry wake-up therefore saving the energy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","IoT power consumption; LPWA; Sensor performance; Smart parking","Electric power utilization; Gas emissions; Secondary batteries; Traffic congestion; Internet of Things (IOT); LPWA; Novel architecture; Radio technologies; Received signal strength; Sensor performance; Smart parking; Smart parking systems; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082752211

Established traditional monitoring networks have limited spatial resolution and are simply absent in many major cities across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Satellites provide snapshots of regional air pollution but require ground-truthing. Low-cost monitors can supplement and extend data coverage from these sources worldwide, providing a better overall air quality picture. We investigate the utility of such a multi-source data integration approach using two case studies. First, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, both traditional monitoring and dense low-cost sensor networks are compared with satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from NASA's MODIS system, and a linear conversion factor is developed to convert AOD to surface fine particulate matter mass concentration (as PM2.5). With 10 or more ground monitors in Pittsburgh, there is a 2-fold reduction in surface PM2.5 estimation mean absolute error compared to using only a single ground monitor. Second, we assess the ability of combined regional-scale satellite retrievals and local-scale low-cost sensor measurements to improve surface PM2.5 estimation at several urban sites in SSA. In Rwanda, we find that combining local ground monitoring information with satellite data provides a 40% improvement in surface PM2.5 estimation accuracy with respect to using low-cost ground monitoring data alone. A linear AOD-to-surface-PM2.5 conversion factor developed in Kigali, Rwanda, did not generalize well to other parts of SSA and varied seasonally for the same location, emphasizing the need for ongoing and localized groundbased monitoring, which can be facilitated by low-cost sensors. Overall, we find that combining ground-based low-cost sensor and satellite data, even without including additional meteorological or land use information, can improve and expand spatiotemporal air quality data coverage, especially in data-sparse regions. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; error analysis; MODIS; optical depth; particulate matter; satellite data; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; Pennsylvania; Rwanda; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092402918

The aim of this paper is to highlight the influence of the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles on the self-cleaning ability of cementitious materials, under staining with an aqueous solution of a rodamina B, followed by exposures to the action of UV rays, followed by artificial rain cycles and to determine the physico-mechanical properties of the material, as well as the white dregree of the samples and their self-cleaning. Based on experimental research results it can be said that the white degree of the samples increased with the increase of the TiO2 amount in the mixtures. Several other factors such as the intensity of the UV light also affected the self-cleaning capacity of the samples, better results being recorded for higher UVA intensity. The TiO2 amount in the mixtures also influences fresh and hardened state properties of the material such as setting time, apparent density, water absorbtion and porosity of the material. It can therefore be said that it is necessary to identify an optimal range of TiO2 nanopraticles concentration in the cementitious matrix, in order to obtain the maximum cumulative benefits in terms of self-cleaning capacity, physico-mechanical properties and costs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090863063

Demand for concrete, hence for cement, is constantly growing, especially in highly developed countries, which means that alternative binders are urgently required to meet the needs of millions of people, without compromising the CO2 levels of the atmosphere. Although environmental issues are currently not sufficiently convincing to create a sufficiently high demand for the production of geopolymer technology, this is expected to increase with the imposition of rules on carbon dioxide emissions and their effects. Preliminary alkali-activated geopolymer concrete mixtures were developed based on a rigorous trial-and-error process in order to establish the mechanical properties of the geopolymer paving blocks. The aim of this paper is to present results regarding the technology of development and optimisation for the production of geopolymer paving blocks, their mechanical properties and implementation possibilities in accordance with the intended scope of use.

In late January 2020, the Chinese government implemented strict quarantine measures across Hubei Province and other parts of the country to limit the transmission of COVID-19. An effect of these quarantine measures was the reduction in economic activity and associated emissions that contribute to air pollution. In this study, we quantify the spatial extent and magnitude of changes in air pollution concentrations across China by comparing complementary satellite, ground-based, and modeled data from the first two months of 2019 and 2020. We find a 48% reduction in satellite-derived average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in eastern China during a three-week period after the Lunar New Year (LNY) in 2020 compared to 2019, which follows significant declines in the pre-LNY period. We also observe a 49% and 11% decline in post-LNY satellite tropospheric column concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These satellite-based results are in general agreement with data collected from ground monitoring stations across the country, which show a decline in post-LNY PM2.5,NO2, and SO2 concentrations. Our modeling analysis suggests that these observed air quality improvements are driven primarily by the reduction in NO2 emissions, which indicate reductions in transportation and industrial pollution sources during COVID-19, but unfavorable meteorological conditions weaken the role of emissions reduction. Finally, we estimate a reduction by 5%, 14%, and 18% of days in the post-LNY period for 2020 that exceed national PM2.5 air quality targets for the entire country, eastern China, and Hubei Province. As more information becomes available on population characteristics and air pollution exposure patterns, this analysis can be extended to quantify human health related impacts to sudden changes in air pollution in China and other locations around the world. © 2020 The Author(s).

Fig orchards are mostly located on mountains in the region and production on slopes is mainly rain-fed except few irrigated locations with low levels of input use. Parallel to the increased demand for dried fruit and nuts among consumers of organic food, organic dried fig demand escalated during the last decades. Reasons to buy organic vary among consumers, however, health concern is still the motivation followed by environmental awareness especially for plant products. The objective of the study was to compare carbon emissions in organic and conventional fig production and to identify the main practices leading to significant emissions. All activities carried out at the orchard and in processing plant during the production season were recorded and each step was evaluated in respect to carbon emissions. In order to make the assessment representative for the region, farmers, processors and experts were surveyed. In case of carbon emission rates, relevant literature and data sources were used to obtain reference data. The carbon emissions were calculated taking into consideration cultural practices as fertilization, tillage, pest and disease management, pruning, pollination by male figs, and irrigation and harvest, and postharvest handling which included storage, drying, aflatoxin control, fumigation (storage pest control), and packaging operations. The emissions in conventional management was 570 kg Carbon dioxide (CO2) Equivalent (CO2-eq) ha compared to 242 kg CO2-eq ha-1 in organic systems. The emissions per kg of dried fig are calculated as 0.315 kg and 0.192 kg CO2-eq, in conventional and organic management, respectively. The major practices or operations contributing to the carbon footprint of dried fig sector are the fertilizer use, irrigation and phosphine treatments in conventional management systems; whereas soil tillage, cold storage and deep-freezing to kill storage pests are the major sources in organic dried fig production. Regarding control of storage pests, chemical and non-chemical methods showed significant differences in respect to carbon emissions. Carbon dioxide treatment under atmospheric pressure is recommended to organic dried fig processors due to lower carbon emission compared to deep-freezing. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The current study focused on a critical intersection in Baghdad city which is Shaab-Selekh intersection. Shaab-Selekh intersection can be classified as the most congested intersection for its high traffic density, especially in the morning and afternoon peak hours. This study evaluates the level of service, estimating the environmental impact (air pollution) due to traffic congestion, and propose set of sustainable tools to reduce air pollution associated with reduced congestion traffic. In order to reach these objectives, many factors were considered such as traffic volumes and counting time periods (morning and afternoon peak hour) in December 2018 by (video recording technique and manual counting). In addition, SIDRA software version 5.1 was used to evaluate the level of service for the intersection and indicated that it equal to LOS F, and to estimate air pollutants (CO2, HC, CO, NO2).

In this context, the use of artificial enzymes that are capable of substitute traditional industrial processes by environmental friendly routes is a challenge. Unfortunately, the complete understanding of the catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes remains elusive, thus hampering creation and development of enzymatic proteins. In this paper, the molecular mechanism of the non-natural multistep retro-aldolase reaction catalyzed by a de novo biocatalyst, the RA95.5-5, has been investigated by means of multiscale QM/MM methods. The design of a retro-aldolase presents the difficulty to create an enzyme being able to stabilize several transition states, maintaining low-energy barriers along the overall reaction. The obtained QM/MM free-energy landscape has allowed defining the rate-determining step corresponding to the carbon-carbon bond scission of the substrate, which is in accordance with the experimental data. A deep analysis of the electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the different amino acid residues of the protein, as well as the estimation of the electrostatic potential generated on key atoms of the substrate, has been carried out for the key steps of the reaction. The results, compared with previous computational studies on the most efficient de novo retro-aldolase, the RA95.5-8F, explains the different activities achieved during the directed evolution process and provides insights for future developments of more efficient enzymes.

Herein, we employed naturally occurring phytic acid as a renewable precursor to fabricate titanium phosphate (TiP)-supported Ru nanocatalysts with different reduction degrees of RuO2 (Ru/TiP-x, x represents the reduction temperature) by combining ball milling and molten-salt processes. Very interestingly, the obtained Ru/TiP-100 had good catalytic performance for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds at ambient temperature, resulting from the synergistic cooperation of the support (TiP) and the Ru/RuO2 with a suitable proportion of Ru0 (52%). Various carbonyl compounds could be efficiently converted into the corresponding primary amines with high yields. More importantly, the conversion of other substrates with reducible groups could also be achieved at ambient temperature. Detailed investigations indicated that the partially reduced Ru and the support (TiP) were indispensable. The high activity and selectivity of Ru/TiP-100 catalyst originates from the relatively high acidity and the suitable electron density of metallic Ru0. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","ambient temperature; carbonyl compounds; primary amines; reductive amination; supported metal catalysts","Amines; Ammonia; Ball milling; Carbonyl compounds; Catalyst selectivity; Energy resources; Nanocatalysts; Ruthenium; Ruthenium compounds; Temperature; Titanium compounds; Catalytic performance; Chemistry community; Efficient synthesis; Naturally occurring; Reduction temperatures; Reductive amination; Temperature synthesis; Titanium phosphate; Phosphorus compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089530526

However, standard theoretical approaches based on density functional theory (DFT) suggest complete poisoning of the active sites and are unable to rationalize the experimentally observed dramatic pH dependence and Tafel slopes, which have a critical impact on the electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we overcome these challenges through a rigorous theoretical investigation of FeNC single-atom catalysts using a combination of several state-of-the-art methods: hybrid functionals, continuum solvation, and potential-dependent electrochemical reaction energetics. Our model shows dipole-field interactions in CO2 adsorption to determine the overall activity, which resolves the contentious origin of experimentally observed pH dependence and rationalizes differences in activity and Tafel slopes among different samples in experimental work. A critical conclusion of our study is that single-atom catalysts can be tuned for electrocatalytic activity not only through the traditionally considered binding energies but also through the corresponding surface dipole moment of rate-determining surface intermediates. Our presented methodology paves the way for accurate mechanistic studies as well as the computational catalyst design of general single-atom catalysts.

To this end, N-doped carbon composites (NC) are prepared with different N-doping contents and used as supports for Fe particles. We find N-doped carbonaceous materials enable an effective control of the Fe oxidation state via an electronic interaction between Fe and N. This interaction leads to a decrease in the Fe particle size when the N-doping content is increased, as shown by structural characterization of transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction, and to a weakened oxygen affinity of the Fe particles in the presence of N-doped sites, as unveiled by H2-temperature-programmed reduction measurements with separate N2O and water vapor pretreatments. The weaker oxygen affinity correlates with the excellent long-term stability of Fe/NC catalysts during the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived m-cresol to form valuable aromatic products, whereas obvious oxidative deactivation is observed for Fe/C. An investigation of the surface nitrogen composition of all N-doped samples shows that their deactivation rate constants are closely related to the nitrogen content anchoring Fe into the carbon architecture, which indicates unambiguously that embedding nitrogen into the carbon skeleton (mainly including pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen functional groups) plays a critical role in stabilizing Fe, while amino-N is inclined to suffering from wastage during the hydrodeoxygenation reaction. These results are further confirmed computationally through an electronic analysis of Fe-N complexes embedded into graphene, showing that skeletal nitrogen sites shield Fe from oxidation relative to bare carbon or aminic nitrogen.

This can be achieved in two ways: the first is the use of low-emission hybrid vehicles, the second is the use of gear transmission system with improved efficiency. Both will reduce fuel consumption and provide more environmental protection. In the current work, a low-emission Ravigneaux hybrid transmission with thirteen operation modes is shown to be feasible. A fuel-efficient strategy is developed to control the fuel consumption of hybrid modes and reduce emissions. An efficiency analysis for all driving modes of the Ravigneaux hybrid transmission is conducted. The concept of potential power is used to determine the power ratios of any three links in the fixed reference frame (FRF) when the input link in the moving reference frame (MRF) is predictable. A single equation is developed that can be manipulated to determine all the powers flowing through the train. A numerical example is provided to give a complete view of the expected efficiency values. The proposed Ravigneaux hybrid transmission is found to be suitable for urban rather than external routes. The results can provide a theoretical bases for design works of hybrid transmissions with complex planetary gears. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Data of 48 types of the air-cooled air conditioners (i.e. 24 non-inverter and 24 inverter) made by 6 main manufacturers in the Vietnamese market have been used in this work. The nominal cooling capacity of the air conditioners is in the range of 9000 BTU/h and 24000 BTU/h. Based on the climate data gathering from 1983 to 2000 according to the National technical regulation on climatic data for building of the Ministry of Construction (QCVN 02:2009), the reference outdoor temperature bin distribution was established in the paper. The calculations of the energy consumption have been carried out for cities, namely Hanoi, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh city which are representatives of 3 typical climatic zones in Vietnam. The results show that the cooling seasonal energy consumption of the inverter air conditioners is lower than those with non-inverter compressors. Energy consumption for the air conditioners of the manufacturers and the impact of the climate conditions on efficiency were investigated in the study, also.

In a recent study, the red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis harvested offshore Australia was identified as highly effective for reducing methane production from enteric fermentation. Due to potential difference in methane-reduction potential and the financial burden associated with transporting the harvested seaweed over long distances, we examined locally sourced red seaweed A. taxiformis and brown seaweed Zonaria farlowii for their ability to mitigate methane production when added to feed widely used in the Californian dairy industry. At a dose rate of 5% dry matter (DM), California-sourced A. taxiformis and Z. farlowii reduced methane production by up to 74% (p &lt; 0.05) and 11% (p &lt; 0.05) during in vitro rumen fermentation, respectively. No effect on CO2 production was observed for either seaweed. The measured decrease in methane production induced by A. taxiformis and Z. farlowii amendment, suggest that these local macroalgae are indeed promising candidates for biotic methane mitigation strategies in California, the largest milk producing state in the United States. To determine their real potential as methane mitigating feed supplements in the dairy industry, their effect in vivo will need to be investigated. © Copyright © 2020 Brooke, Roque, Shaw, Najafi, Gonzalez, Pfefferlen, De Anda, Ginsburg, Harden, Nuzhdin, Salwen, Kebreab and Hess.","Asparagopsis taxiformis; feed supplementation; in vitro rumen fermentation; macroalgae; methane mitigation; Zonaria farlowii",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089012027

Ga-labeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N, N', N""-triacetic acid (NOTA) conjugated with truncated Evan blue (NEB) forms a complex with serum albumin in the interstitial fluid after it is locally injected and allows rapid visualization of the lymphatic system. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 44-year-old woman had a chief complaint of left nipple discharge. A 38-year-old woman came to the hospital after sensing a right breast mass. DIAGNOSES: The 2 patients were diagnosed with chylous fistula after breast cancer surgery based on the findings of a novel method, Ga-NOTA-Evans Blue (NEB) positron emission tomography/computed tomography. INTERVENTIONS: We successfully obtained clear images to locate the fistula using Ga-NEB positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for both patients. The lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes could be clearly visualized owing to the Ga-NEB activity during PET/CT. OUTCOMES: Three-dimensional positioning to locate the fistula could direct the application of the pressure dressing and reduce drainage markedly.

Herein, as-synthesized bismuthoxide-decorated graphene oxide (Bi2O3@GO) was used as an electro/thermal catalyst for CO2 reduction. Bi2O3@GO is found to be distributed uniformly, as confirmed by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopic analysis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows that the Bi2O3 has a β-phase with 23.4 m2 g−1 BET surface area. Significantly, the D and G bands from Raman spectroscopic analysis and their intensity ratio (ID/IG) reveal the increment in defective sites on GO after surface decoration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis shows clear signals for Bi, C, and O, along with their oxidation states. An ultra-low onset potential (−0.534 V vs. RHE) for the reduction of CO2 on Bi2O3@GO is achieved. Furthermore, potential-dependent (−0.534, −0.734, and −0.934 vs. RHE) bulk electrolysis of CO2 to formate provides Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of approximately 39.72, 61.48, and 83.00 %, respectively. Additionally, in time-dependent electrolysis at a potential of −0.934 versus RHE for 3 and 5 h, the observed FEs are around 84.20 % and 87.17 % respectively. This catalyst is also used for the thermal reduction of CO2 to formate.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors have all participated in the development, design and/or delivery of the course and have provided their reflections on the experience. In addition, they sought insights from students and other interested people on the impact and significance of this course. Findings: Carbon and energy management is an action learning-based co-created course initiated by the Chamber to address an interest in mitigating climate change amongst local businesses. Among businesses, the carbon economy is under considerable discussion. The increased awareness of climate change, and the need to better manage carbon, has led to local businesses eager to reduce greenhouse gases but lacking the expertise necessary. UNBC students (undergraduate and graduate) learn innovative and practical skills through creating carbon footprint analyses for small- to medium-sized business/non-profit clients, providing recommendations on reducing reliance on fossil fuels and formally presenting their findings to their clients. After five years, 46 businesses and non-profit organizations have participated in the course along with over 30 students and 5 separately hired student interns. The Chamber is now rolling out the program for Canadian Chamber of Commerce interested in similar community–university partnerships. Originality/value: This paper describes a course that is a novel approach to university–community partnerships, both in approach and focus area. The linking, through the course, of small- to medium-sized businesses with the provision of plans for carbon reduction developed by university students is an unusual approach. However, there is significant value to all partners in the approach. Allowing the main community partner to serve as the lead in the project also offers an unusual experience and perspective for the university partner, as often such partnerships are largely driven by the post-secondary institution’s interests and needs, which can create a challenging power dynamic. Instead, the course offers a lesson in how a university can be clearly in service to the community at the community’s invitation. Finally, this paper offers reflections on the value of this type of project for creating sustainability initiatives from the perspective of all participants, students, faculty, university administration, city government, participating businesses and the Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating the critical need for understanding a project as an intersection of all participating actors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Action learning; Carbon footprinting; Climate change education; Community–university partnerships",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085361489

A heavy-crude-oil obtained from a field in Alberta (27â€»780 cP at 25 °C) was used in all experiments, and the measurements were repeated on different types of substrates (quartz and calcite). Interfacial tension tests between heavy-oil and steam were also conducted to study the change in interfacial properties. All measurements in this research were performed at a range of temperatures up to 200 °C in a high-temperature-high-pressure cell. In gaining a comprehensive evaluation of this mechanism, several impacting factors such as pressure, phase change, and type of rock were taken into consideration and evaluated separately. Different types of new generation chemical additives-biodiesel, switchable-hydrophilicity tertiary amines (SHTA), nanofluids (dispersed SiO2 and ZrO2), ethers, alcohols, and chelating agents-were applied to the steam with a range of concentrations throughout interfacial tension and contact angle measurements to evaluate the wettability alteration performance at steam temperature and pressure. The irreversible mechanism of wettability state was the result when phase change occurred with the presence of brine. Wettability alteration and interfacial tension reduction in steam conditions were achieved after involving these new generation chemicals. Also, optimum chemical concentration was determined through interfacial tension and contact angle measurements. The study and analysis of chemical additive applications provide a more robust understanding of steam-induced wettability alteration mechanisms in a rock/heavy-oil/steam system. In summary, conventional steam additives can be altered by these cost-effective and thermally stable new generation chemicals showing potential for wettability improvement and interfacial tension reduction in practical applications.

Nanomaterials are promising candidates to contribute to a new generation of low cost and highly efficient solar cells. Due to their wavelength-scale dimensions, nanomaterials display exceptionally strong light-matter interactions that lead to large perturbations in absorption and emission compared to their bulk counterparts. Although most work on nanostructured solar cells has focused on increasing the absorption, emission control may have even greater potential for improving efficiency of state-of-the-art solar cells. In this Perspective, we describe how nanostructures can be applied to improve solar cell efficiency, focusing on emission control. First, we analyze the requirements for making the most efficient solar cell by looking at the thermodynamics of energy conversion. We show that an ideal solar cell at open circuit displays emission that is identical to its absorption. Comparing this to the emission of a typical silicon solar cell shows that there are three differences: The intensity, the angles in which light is emitted, and the spectrum. These differences lead to a reduction in efficiency, mainly due to a drop in open circuit voltage. For each loss mechanism, we discuss how nanomaterials can manipulate the emission and thereby reduce the voltage loss. Finally, we analyze the performance of two conceptual designs for solar cells based on nanomaterials. These give a large improvement in efficiency compared to conventional designs, showing the great potential of nanomaterials in solar cells.

Here, by combining multiple operando synchrotron spectroscopies, we identify at the atomic level a general evolution of single-atom Ni at SLEIs into a near-free atom state in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We uncover that the single-atom Ni at SLEIs tends to be dynamically released from the nitrogen-carbon substrate and then forms a near-free, isolated-zigzag active site (Ni1(2-δ)+N2) during the reaction. This isolated-zigzag Ni1(2-δ)+N2 active site facilitates the adsorption and dissociation of O2 into a crucial *O intermediate within the electrical double layers, realizing a highly efficient single-atom catalyst with the best ORR performance in alkaline solutions reported thus far.

Herein, we study a model system of copper nanowires with various degrees of silver modifications as electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Among them, the Cu68Ag32 nanowire catalyst achieves the highest activity and selectivity toward methane with an extremely high faradaic efficiency of ∼60%, about 3 times higher than that of primitive Cu nanowires, and even surpasses the most efficient catalysts for producing methane. By using in situ grazing-angle X-ray scattering/diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and Raman techniques, we found that the Cu68Ag32 nanowires underwent an irreversible structural reconstruction and well-stabilized chemical state of Cu on the catalyst surface under the working CO2RR conditions, which greatly facilitates the CO2 to methane conversion. Further analysis reveals that the restructuring phenomenon can be ascribed to a reoxidation/reduction-driven atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Ag. This work reveals the first empirical demonstration by deploying comprehensive in situ techniques to track the dynamic structural reconstruction/transformation in a model bimetallic system, which not only establishes a good understanding of the correlation between catalyst surface structure and catalytic selectivity but also provides deep insights into designing more developed electrocatalysts for CO2RR and beyond.

The health and environmental impacts of these guidelines were assessed by using a comparative risk assessment of deaths from chronic diseases and a set of country specific environmental footprints for greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater use, cropland use, and fertiliser application. For comparison, the impacts of adopting the global dietary recommendations of the World Health Organization and the EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems were also analysed. Each guideline's health and sustainability implications were assessed by modelling its adoption at both the national level and globally, and comparing the impacts to global health and environmental targets, including the Action Agenda on Non-Communicable Diseases, the Paris Climate Agreement, the Aichi biodiversity targets related to land use, and the sustainable development goals and planetary boundaries related to freshwater use and fertiliser application. Results Adoption of national FBDGs was associated with reductions in premature mortality of 15% on average (95% uncertainty interval 13% to 16%) and mixed changes in environmental resource demand, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 13% on average (regional range-34% to 35%). When universally adopted globally, most of the national guidelines (83, 98%) were not compatible with at least one of the global health and environmental targets. About a third of the FBDGs (29, 34%) were incompatible with the agenda on non-communicable diseases, and most (57 to 74, 67% to 87%) were incompatible with the Paris Climate Agreement and other environmental targets. In comparison, adoption of the WHO recommendations was associated with similar health and environmental changes, whereas adoption of the EAT-Lancet recommendations was associated with 34% greater reductions in premature mortality, more than three times greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and general attainment of the global health and environmental targets. As an example, the FBDGs of the UK, US, and China were incompatible with the climate change, land use, freshwater, and nitrogen targets, and adopting guidelines in line with the EAT-Lancet recommendation could increase the number of avoided deaths from 78 000 (74 000 to 81 000) to 104 000 (96 000 to 112 000) in the UK, from 480 000 (445 000 to 516 000) to 585 000 (523 000 to 646 000) in the USA, and from 1 149 000 (1 095 000 to 1 204 000) to 1 802 000 (1 664 000 to 1 941 000) in China. Conclusions This analysis suggests that national guidelines could be both healthier and more sustainable. Providing clearer advice on limiting in most contexts the consumption of animal source foods, in particular beef and dairy, was found to have the greatest potential for increasing the environmental sustainability of dietary guidelines, whereas increasing the intake of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and legumes, reducing the intake of red and processed meat, and highlighting the importance of attaining balanced energy intake and weight levels were associated with most of the additional health benefits. The health results were based on observational data and assuming a causal relation between dietary risk factors and health outcomes. The certainty of evidence for these relations is mostly graded as moderate in existing meta-analyses. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY. No commercial re-use.

In this paper, a novel decision support approach is developed and its applicability is demonstrated for the greater Thessaloniki area, Greece. In this area, the incineration facilities are hotly debated, mainly due to the “Not In My Back Yard” syndrome related with health considerations. The exclusive method of treatment is landfilling. Health impacts and corresponding externalities attributed to the operation of an incineration facility are reliably estimated. Three potential alternative sites and three scenarios of emission rates are considered, depending on the abatement technology used. The estimated externalities are compared to the corresponding ones attributed to other pressures in the area. The “Years of Life Lost (YOLL)” indicator attributed to the operation of the facility is 2.8 YOLL in the worst-case scenario. This corresponds to a minimal added implication in comparison with the 11,044 YOLL estimated for the area due to the other environmental pressures (road traffic, space heating, industrial activity). The externalities ratio (externalities due to incineration facility/total externalities) for the region is approximately 0.03%. Thus, the impact of this operation on human health is negligible -and preferable to landfilling- even in the case that maximum emission rates are considered. Efforts should be targeted towards enhancing public awareness and militating the widely acknowledged “Not In My Back Yard” syndrome by local communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical stressors; External costs; Health impacts; Resources management; Social benefit; Thermal treatment","Decision support systems; Health; Municipal solid waste; Abatement technologies; Decision supports; Environmental pressures; Greater Thessaloniki Area; Industrial activities; Maximum emissions; Not in my back yards; Worst case scenario; Waste incineration; decision support system; energy resource; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; not in my back yard response; waste treatment; article; awareness; decision support system; energy resource; Greece; heating; human; incineration; municipal solid waste; traffic; Greece; solid waste; waste disposal; Central Macedonia; Greece; Thessaloniki [Central Macedonia]; Greece; Humans; Incineration; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086626674

However, less attention has been given to the interactions between the different process stages. Accordingly, the mercury removal performance of a full-scale solid waste incineration plant, equipped with a dry flue gas treatment line was investigated using two complementary modeling strategies: a thermochemical equilibrium approach to study the mercury transformation mechanisms and speciation in the flue gas, and a kinetic approach to describe the mercury adsorption process. The modeling observations were then compared to real-operation full-scale data. Considering the typical flue gas composition of waste incineration facilities (high concentrations of HCl compared to Hg), it was found that a process temperature decrease results in better mercury removal efficiencies, associated with a higher oxidation extent of Hg in HgCl2, and the enhancement of the sorbent capacity. Improvements can also be attained by increasing the sorbent injection rate to the process, or the solid/gas separation cycles. An empirical correlation to predict the mercury removal efficiency from the main operating parameters of dry flue gas treatment units was proposed, representing a useful tool for waste incineration facilities. The presented modeling approach proved to be suitable to evaluate the behavior of full-scale gas treatment units, and properly select the most adequate adjustments in operating parameters, in order to respect the increasingly constraining mercury emissions regulations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Equilibrium and kinetics modelling; Full-scale parametric study; Mercury removal efficiency; Mercury transformation mechanisms; Solid waste incineration","Chlorine compounds; Efficiency; Flue gases; Flues; Gas emissions; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Municipal solid waste; Waste treatment; Complementary model; Dry flue gas treatment; Empirical correlations; Operating parameters; Solid waste incineration plant; Solid/Gas separation; Thermochemical equilibrium; Transformation mechanisms; Waste incineration; mercury; mercury; adsorption; correlation; empirical analysis; incineration; mercury (element); municipal solid waste; waste treatment; adsorption; Article; chemical reaction kinetics; concentration (parameter); flue gas; heavy metal removal; incineration; municipal solid waste; oxidation; phase separation; prediction; priority journal; solid waste management; species differentiation; thermochemical equilibrium approach; air pollutant; incineration; oxidation reduction reaction; solid waste; Adsorption; Air Pollutants; Incineration; Mercury; Oxidation-Reduction; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086428781

This has caused changes in vegetation communities, soil erosion, desertification and loss of carbon stocks. Little data exist regarding vegetation and ecosystems in the Icelandic highland before landnám and therefore the impact of land use over time is poorly understood. The objectives of the study are to examine the timing, nature and causes of land degradation in the highland of Northwest Iceland. Specifically, to determine the resilience of the pre-landnám highland environment to disturbances (i.e. climate cooling and volcanism) and whether land use pressure was of sufficient magnitude to facilitate ecosystem change. A sediment core was taken from the highland lake Galtaból. A chronology for the core was constructed using known tephra layers and radiocarbon dated plant macrofossils. Pollen analysis (vegetation), coprophilous fungal spores (proxy for grazing), and sediment properties (proxies for erosion) were used to provide a high-resolution, integrated vegetation and paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The pre-landnám environment showed resilience to climate cooling and repeated tephra fall. Soon after landnám the vegetation community changed and instability increased, indicated by changes in sediment properties. The pollen and spore record suggest introduction of grazing herbivores into the area after landnám. Following landnám, indicators of soil erosion appear in the sediment properties. Intensification of soil erosion occurred during the 17th century. The Galtaból record clearly demonstrates what can happen in landscapes without adequate management of natural resources and underestimation of landscape sensitivity. Introduction of land use resulted in changes in vegetation communities, loss of resilience and onset of increased soil erosion. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions may inform future decisions on management of the highland by providing baselines for natural variability in the pre-landnám environment. © 2020 The Author(s)","Anthropocene; Europe; Organic geochemistry; Paleolimnology; Stable isotopes; Vegetation dynamics","Agricultural robots; Ecosystems; Erosion; Land use; Natural resources management; Sediments; Soils; Vegetation; Ecosystem changes; Landscape changes; Landscape sensitivity; Natural variability; Paleoenvironmental reconstruction; Plant macrofossils; Sediment properties; Vegetation community; Climate change; climate change; dendrochronology; land use change; landscape change; long-term change; paleoenvironment; reconstruction; sediment core; settlement history; soil degradation; upland region; volcanism; Iceland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086394262

It has been claimed that ventilated building envelopes help to reduce energy use in buildings and improve occupant comfort. This study proposes a comprehensive comparison of the thermal behaviour between an Opaque Ventilated Façade (OVF) and a conventional unventilated Façade (UF) considering two reference days for the winter and summer period. The analysis is developed investigating different façade orientations and two states of windiness, which are a state of calm wind and a state with wind velocity higher than zero (i.e. 5.0 m/s at 10 m of height) are taken into account. These analyses were developed utilizing fluid-dynamic calculation under dynamic conditions. Thus for the two façades were calculated: (I) the hourly surface temperatures of the most external, (II) the temperature profiles for all the facade's layers; (III) the airflow profiles inside the cavity and near the façade; (IV) the hourly thermal fluxes that cross the façade. Finally, the daily energy fluxes and the energy-saving, achievable through the adoption of the OVF, is calculated for the different façade exposures and the conditions of windiness. The outcomes of this study highlight that the OVF guarantees an energy-saving ranging from 20 to 55%, with the highest rate during the summer day for the façade facing East/West. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society","Computational fluid dynamic; Energy saving; Ventilated facade","Fluid dynamics; Greenhouse gases; Ventilation; Comprehensive comparisons; Dynamic calculations; Energy performance; Energy use in buildings; Surface temperatures; Temperature profiles; Thermal behaviours; Ventilated buildings; Energy efficiency; airflow; building; energy efficiency; seasonal variation; summer; temperature effect; wind velocity; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085769684

This engineered photocatalyst was prepared by a two-step process: at first, the process of nanocasting was done by a templating method, followed by the kinetically-controlled coating technique. Specifically, mesoporous silica sphere and cyanamide were used as sacrificial template and precursor of carbon nitride, respectively, for the synthesis of hollow carbon nitride sphere which was further modified with titanium dioxide nanosheets. The remarkable photocatalytic activity of as-prepared nanocomposite could be attributed to its special structure, providing properties such as light-harvesting, multiple light reflection and enhanced active site. Owing to the synergistic effect between g-C3N4 and TiO2; the light absorption region has been enhanced, leading to the improvement of photocatalytic performance.

Sensitivity analysis and structural path analysis are combined to investigate the key pathways for bioethanol production impact mitigation. Results show that the first-generation technology has higher resource-use and environmental impacts compared to the second-generation technology. The gasoline-to-bioethanol transition enables CO2 emission reductions, but at the cost of increased water and farmland use. Key impact mitigation pathways are then investigated for the first four production layers (PL0→3) in bioethanol industries because these layers contribute to a significant environmental footprint. For PL0, water-saving technologies must be developed to reduce direct water use in first-generation bioethanol production. For PL1, the primary production material suppliers of the bioethanol industry, such as biomass feedstock, food and tobacco, and water supply industries were ascertained with high potential for impact mitigation. For PL2→3, key pathways are investigated by combining their sensitivity and impact values.

The falling costs of wind and solar PV have added to both the opportunities yet also challenges of balancing sometimes competing industry objectives of costs, security, and environmental impacts. This paper presents novel techniques for assessing possible future industry generation portfolios in three ways: (1) incorporating explicit metrics for energy trilemma objectives into modelling, (2) using the optimization process of evolutionary programming to map the solution space of ‘high performing’, near least-cost, portfolio solutions, and (3) applying boundary min–max cases and clustering to categorize these varied portfolios to better facilitate planning and policy making. We use an open-source evolutionary programming tool, National Electricity Market Optimiser, to assess possible future generation portfolios for Indonesia's Java-Bali interconnected power system. Our findings highlight the wide range of possible portfolios that might potentially deliver similar total industry costs, and their different security and environmental implications. In particular, additional solar photovoltaic deployment appears a low-risk opportunity to reduce costs and emissions compared to more fossil-fuel oriented mixes.

Finland has declared a national target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. As a part of this, the use of coal for energy purposes has been banned from year 2029 onwards. The Finnish electricity system is already very low-carbon, and more wind and nuclear power is being constructed. However, District heating (DH) is a backbone of the Finnish energy system, and it is still quite reliant on fossil fuels and domestic high-emission fuel peat, their share being 51% of DH fuels in 2018.

However, the effects of environmental and anthropogenic pressures on C dynamics in lower coastal plain forested wetlands in the southern U.S. are not well understood. We established four eddy flux stations in two post-harvest and newly-planted loblolly pine plantations (YP2–6, 2–6 yrs old; YP2–8, 2–8 yrs old), a rotation-aged loblolly pine plantations (MP, 15–27 yrs old), and a mixed bottomland hardwood forest (BHF, &gt;100 yrs old) in the lower coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. We analyzed the gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for age-related trends, interannual variability in response to climate forcing, and management-related disturbances from 2005 – 2017. For the first few years after being harvested, pine plantations were net C sources (NEE = 1133 and 897 g C m–2 yr–1 in YP2–6 and YP2–8, respectively). The MP was a strong C sink (–369 to –1131 g C m–2 yr–1) over the entire study period. In contrast, BHF was a C source (NEE = 87 g C m–2 yr–1 to 759 g C m–2 yr–1) in most years, although in the first year it did show a net C uptake (NEE = –368 g C m–2 yr–1). The source activity of BHF may have been related to increasing overstory tree mortality and diameter growth suppression. Decreases in relative extractable water in pine plantations enhanced GPP and RE. Pine plantations regained status as C sinks 5–8 years after harvest and recovered C equivalent to post-harvest losses at 8–14 years. Thus, coastal pine plantations have a net C uptake for only about half the 25-year rotation period, suggesting that they have decreased climate mitigation potential in comparison to protecting primary forests. However, primary forests in this area may be vulnerable to ecosystem transition, and subsequent C loss, due to the changing environmental conditions at the land-ocean interface. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon fluxes; Coastal plain forest; Drought; Forested wetlands; Harvesting; Managed forests","anthropogenic effect; carbon balance; carbon flux; carbon sink; coastal plain; coastal wetland; coastal zone; coniferous tree; land-sea interaction; net ecosystem exchange; net primary production; respiration; North Carolina; United States; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085132484

In this paper, this prospective tool is further improved with the capacity to compute voltage as well as active and reactive power flows at the level of the distribution grid. This added capacity allows analyzing various issues related to the integration of variable energy resources in three representative real medium voltage distribution grids (urban, rural and semi-urban). Technical flexibility solutions such as on-load tap changers, variable energy resources curtailment and storage technologies are modeled and compared to reinforcement. A cost comparison between these flexibility solutions is also carried out. Finally, the new version of the tool is used to evaluate the CO2−eq emissions linked to the development of the European power system infrastructure, with flexibility solutions, up to the year 2050 (both high voltage alternative and direct current lines reinforcement being considered) under a 2 °C climate energy policy scenario. Results show that it exists various options for the development of the European grid infrastructure, which are clearly sensitive to the level of accuracy in the representation of the physical infrastructures and their technical limitations.

However, the suitability of boundary-layer parameterizations for air pollution modeling over deep, coastal valleys has seldom been tested. An evaluation of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model performance for five planetary boundary-layer schemes (PBL) with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological driver was conducted at 1-km horizontal resolution for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over the Terrace-Kitimat valley of northwestern British Columbia, Canada. The top-ranked schemes were Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino Level 3 (MYNN3) for PM2.5 and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic for NO2. Both schemes ranked high for absolute SO2 levels, but the MYJ and Asymmetric Convective Model, version 2 (ACM2) schemes qualitatively emulated peak summertime diurnal concentrations in the near field of elevated point sources. Greater nighttime SO2 concentrations with MYNN3 and Yonsei University PBL schemes, in less agreement with station monitoring 8 km downwind of emissions from tall stacks, suggested sustained pollutant mixing and downward transport within the nocturnal boundary layer. Consequently, for these two schemes with representations of nonlocal mass flux transfers between model layers, inland penetrations of pollutant plumes were farther than those of ACM2, MYJ, and University of Washington schemes. For NO2 and PM2.5 that mainly discharged passively from fugitive, ground-level sources, hence are less accurately quantified than SO2 emissions, the fully local MYJ, and semi-local MYNN3 PBL schemes more reasonably reproduced peak season concentrations than other schemes. It is concluded that for air pollution modeling in rugged, remote areas, the mode of pollutant emissions is important for the choice of a PBL scheme. PM2.5 was consistently underestimated by the various PBL schemes, and aspects for improving CMAQ simulations for a complex environment are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","British Columbia; CMAQ modeling; Complex terrain; PBL schemes","Air quality; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Chemical analysis; Landforms; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Sulfur dioxide; Weather forecasting; British Columbia , Canada; Community multi-scale air qualities; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Nocturnal boundary layers; Planetary boundary layers; Spatial and temporal analysis; Three dimensional chemicals; Weather research and forecasting; Boundary layers; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric plume; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; boundary layer; fjord; gas flow; mixing; nitrogen dioxide; parameterization; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; boundary layer; concentration (parameter); forecasting; model; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; priority journal; quantitative analysis; simulation; British Columbia; Canada; Kitimat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085025323

Exhaust emissions from transit buses include carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). Key factors affecting bus emission rates have been evaluated separately or in limited combinations in prior studies, including bus size, fuel and powertrain, passenger load, driving cycle, and model year. However, bus emission rates are jointly affected by all of these factors. To systematically evaluate these factors, a transit bus emissions model (TBEM) was developed. TBEM is calibrated based on generic compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel bus types represented in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator and empirical cycle average emission rates from the Integrated Bus Information System. The importance of the factors varies depending on the pollutant. For emission rates per vehicle-kilometer, model year is an important factor for NOx and PM, fuel and powertrain is an important factor for CO and THC, and driving cycle and bus size are important factors for CO2. For emission rates per passenger-kilometer, passenger load is generally an important factor for each pollutant. For a given fuel and powertrain and pollutant, smaller buses have lower emission rates per vehicle-kilometer than larger buses. However, a full large bus has lower emission rates per passenger-kilometer than a full small bus. There are tradeoffs among bus types regarding emission rates, especially for THC and PM. The comparison of bus emission rates is dependent on interactions between these key factors. For example, the effect of bus size and passenger load on emission rates is larger for lower speed driving cycles. For 2010 and newer model year buses and for moderate to high speed driving cycles, diesel buses have the lowest NOx emission rates whereas for low speed cycles, CNG buses have the lowest NOx emission rates. However, for 2007 to 2009 model year buses, CNG buses have the lowest NOx emission rates regardless of driving cycle. The study will be useful in helping transit planners and policy makers to develop strategies to reduce transit bus fleet emissions and in providing accurate emission factors for use in bus life cycle inventories and emission inventories. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bus size; Exhaust emissions; Passenger load; Transit bus","Bus transportation; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Compressed natural gas; Diesel engines; Environmental Protection Agency; Life cycle; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Powertrains; Average emission rate; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Emission inventories; High speed driving; Life Cycle Inventory; Motor vehicle emissions; Total hydrocarbons; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Fleet operations; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; fossil fuel; hydrocarbon; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; emission inventory; exhaust emission; fossil fuel; life cycle analysis; natural gas; nitric oxide; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; Article; calibration; carbon footprint; catalyst; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; environmental protection; exhaust gas; particulate matter; priority journal; United States; velocity; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084988997

Several methods for biogas upgrading are used. The selection of biogas upgrading methods depends on the type of biogas and the facilities’ requirement according to local circumstances. This paper presents a study on an integrated process of cryogenic biogas upgrading by using renewable energy resources for sustainable development. Parabolic trough solar collector (PTC), organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power system and absorption refrigeration cycle are used in this process to separate the impurity of raw biogas. PTC supplies the required heat for the ORC, and absorption refrigeration cycles. Inlet biogas contains 61.10%, 36.93% and 0.01% (mole percent) CH4, CO2 and H2S. After purification, upgraded biogas contains 92.67% CH4 and 4% CO2. The results of the exergy analysis of the process show that the overall exergy efficiency of the integrated process and solar collector are 71.62% and 51.37% respectively. Also, the cryogenic heat exchangers have the highest exergy efficiency while the most exergy destruction occurs in the solar collector and afterward in the column.

Gas turbine functional parameters, quantities of emitted pollutants, prices of generated electricity and capital cost payback periods are determined. The rates of pollutants produced and fuel consumption are considered per unit of electricity generated. The results show that the best cooling system for cities with hot climates is the absorption chiller; it improves gas turbine net power by 18% in Bandar Abbas and 14% in Yazd, the energy efficiency by 5.8% in Bandar Abbas and 5.5% in Yazd, and the exergy efficiency by 2.5% in Bandar Abbas and 1.5% in Yazd. Inlet air cooling reduces NOx pollutant emissions by 60% in Bandar Abbas and 53% in Yazd and reduces electricity generated costs by 6.5% and 6.0% in Bandar Abbas and Yazd respectively. The inlet fogging system performs well only in arid regions. The most appropriate type of cooling system must be selected based on specific objectives (such as increasing power or reducing fuel consumption or reducing pollutants).

LUR models leverage information about environmental and anthropogenic factors such as cars, heating, or industry to predict air pollution in areas where no measurements have been made. However, existing approaches are often not globally applicable and require tedious hyper-parameter tuning to enable high quality predictions. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing OpenLUR, an off-the-shelf approach for modeling air pollution that (i) works on a set of novel features solely extracted from the globally and openly available data source OpenStreetMap and (ii) is based on state-of-the-art machine learning featuring automated hyper-parameter tuning in order to minimize manual effort. We show that our proposed features are able to outperform their counterparts from local and closed sources, and illustrate how automated hyper parameter tuning can yield competitve results while alleviating the need for expert knowledge in machine learning and manual effort. Importantly, we further demonstrate the potential of the global availability of our features by applying cross-learning across different cities in order to reduce the need for a large amount of training samples.

However, our understanding of global climatic controls on the IAV of ecosystem productivity has been limited by the lack of direct measurements of ecosystem productivity at the global scale. We used a long-term, fine-resolution solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) product (GOSIF) derived from SIF soundings measured by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) to investigate how climatic factors drive the IAV of global ecosystem productivity. We also examined how the results derived from SIF differed from those based on a satellite-derived measure of vegetation greenness and productivity - the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Both productivity measures showed the dominant role of soil moisture in driving the IAV of global ecosystem productivity, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. SIF was more sensitive to climate variability than was EVI. SIF was positively correlated with solar radiation in the humid regions, while no significant correlations were found between EVI and solar radiation. The stronger correlation of SIF with climate factors was also observed at the ecosystem level based on a number of eddy covariance flux sites, indicating that SIF had a higher ability in capturing the variations of gross primary productivity (GPP) than did EVI. The comparison between SIF and EVI also highlighted the biome-specific (depending on the tree cover) responses of ecosystem productivity to solar radiation under water stress. Our findings explicitly reveal the global climatic controls on the IAV of ecosystem productivity, and provide insight into the mechanistic differences between SIF and vegetation indices in characterizing ecosystem productivity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycle; Climate drivers; Drought; Earth system model; Gross primary productivity; Sun-induced fluorescence","annual variation; chlorophyll; climate change; covariance analysis; eddy covariance; MODIS; satellite data; solar radiation; vegetation index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084415543

However, quantifying the supply of hydrothermal Fe to the surface ocean requires accurately modeling its stabilization and removal processes, which are poorly known. Here, we determine the physical speciation of dissolved Fe along an oceanographic transect following a coherent hydrothermal plume that emanates from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and persists westward over 4,000 km in the Tropical South Pacific. Our observations show that the plume persists horizontally, but descends vertically, and consists primarily of very large Fe colloids. Guided by these observations, we develop a new size-resolved mechanistic model of hydrothermal Fe dispersion in this region, in which the stabilization of hydrothermal Fe is explained by a reversible particulate exchange process. This model accurately captures the lateral dispersion, downward settling and physical speciation of hydrothermal Fe along this transect. An alternate model that uses a hydrothermal source of Fe-binding ligands to facilitate Fe transport within the deep ocean can reproduce the long-range transport of hydrothermal Fe, but does not reproduce the vertical descent of the plume. Our model shows that hydrothermal Fe vented from the EPR is trapped in the deep ocean, and only 1% of this iron ever makes it to the surface where it can stimulate biological productivity. At the global scale, 3-5% of hydrothermal Fe makes it to the surface ocean, the vast majority of which originates from Southern Ocean vents and upwells in the Southern Ocean. Our best estimate of the global supply of hydrothermal Fe to the surface ocean, based on data-constrained estimates of ocean circulation, mantle 3He venting, and the hydrothermal Fe:3He ratio from the EPR, is 0.12±0.07 Gmol yr−1. This is about 60-70 times lower than the supply of Fe from aerosol dust deposition, but could be regionally important in the Antarctic zone of the Southern Ocean. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","dissolved iron; hydrothermal iron; numerical modeling; reversible scavenging; US GEOTRACES","Aerosols; Hot springs; Iron; Stabilization; Biological productivity; East Pacific Rise; Hydrothermal plume; Hydrothermal vent; Lateral dispersion; Long range transport; Mechanistic modeling; Ocean circulation; Oceanography; colloid; hydrothermal deposit; hydrothermal vent; iron; long range transport; marine environment; scavenging (chemistry); speciation (chemistry); East Pacific Rise; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084264375

For this purpose, the long and short-run impact of per capita income, FDI, and oil price on carbon emissions investigated by employing the ARDL and non-linear ARDL cointegration methodology, along with Granger causality in the context of Pakistan for 1971–2014. This study confirms the EKC hypothesis for Pakistan under both methodologies, whereas symmetric results show that economic growth and FDI intensify carbon emission in both the long and short-run, while oil price increase emission in the short-run and reduces emission in the long-run.

The relative importance of irregularities or defects within building walls is more prominent when the thermal insulation level increases. It is thus necessary to quantify the global thermal insulation level of building walls (i.e., including thermal bridges). Classical contact measurement methods only allow local measurements and would thus require the use of a high number of sensors which would limit their applicability. Besides, the presence of thermal bridges prevents the use of contact heat flux measurements because of the 2D or 3D nature of the associated heat transfers through the building walls. To overcome these limitations, the present study proposes an alternative approach consisting in measuring the heat flux on one location and extrapolating its value on the whole building wall through the measurement of the total heat transfer coefficient. Therefore, we developed and/or further improved five different in situ measurement methods of the total heat transfer coefficient on building walls. The measurement methods were thoroughly tested indoor thanks to lab-scale experiments carried out both in steady-state and transient regimes. The results obtained demonstrated the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed methods, as well as their intrinsic limitations. These in situmethods can be used to assess the heat losses on a whole building wall, including the contribution of thermal bridges. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Building; Heat transfer coefficient; In situ; Measurement; Operative temperature","Electric measuring bridges; Enthalpy; Heat flux; Heat transfer coefficients; Thermal insulation; Contact measurements; Energy performance of buildings; Heat flux measurement; In-situ measurement; Local measurement; Measurement methods; Performance gaps; Steady state and transients; Walls (structural partitions)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083549958

However, multiple lake ecosystems have been threatened by the expansion of aquatic macrophytes and the resulting bioaccumulation, which accelerates the process of lake terrestrialization. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the safe operating space of macrophyte biomass in order to control the terrestrialization of shallow lakes. In this study, we investigated the biomasses of dominant species and community types at different growth stages in different terrestrialized zones for a typical shallow lake in North China. Then, we developed a suitable method for estimating the safe operating space for the aquatic macrophyte biomass in different terrestrialization stages. Our results showed that the aquatic macrophyte biomass generally increased with the increasing terrestrialization stage. In addition, the biomass in September was lower than that in May. On the community scale, the biomass of Phragmites australis, Phragmites australis – Ceratophyllum demersum, and Nelumbo nucifera - Ceratophyllum demersum - Typha orientalis communities was significantly higher than that of Potamogeton pectinatus and Potamogeton pectinatus - Nelumbo nucifera communities. Terrestrialization exhibited lower impacts on plant biomass in May, whereas a greater impact of terrestrialization was observed in September. Generally, single-species communities had higher plant biomass than mixed communities. The target management years for different terrestrialized zones were established to calculate the safe operating space of macrophyte biomass. The current biomass values were much higher than those calculated for the safe operating space, especially in September and for the P. australis and P. australis - C. demersum communities, indicating that there is high pressure to manage these communities. The approach proposed in the study provides a scientific reference for macrophyte management to control the terrestrialization status of grass-type shallow lakes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic macrophytes; Biomass; Lake terrestrialization; Safe operating space; Shallow lakes","assessment method; biomass; community composition; growth; lacustrine environment; macrophyte; plant community; article; biomass; China; grass; growth curve; lake; macrophyte; Nelumbo nucifera; nonhuman; Pectinatus; Phragmites australis; Potamogeton; Typha; biomass; China; ecosystem; Poaceae; China; Ceratophyllum demersum; Embryophyta; Nelumbo nucifera; Phragmites australis; Potamogeton pectinatus; Typha orientalis; Biomass; China; Ecosystem; Lakes; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083313721

Regional air pollution prevention measures were extra implemented in the “2 + 26” region since 2017. However, haze pollution dramatically rebounded in the winter of 2018. Both of the observed analyses and the numerical results (basing on a global 3-D chemical transport model) demonstrated that, although intensified prevention measures existed, atmospheric circulation and local meteorological conditions still significantly influenced the variation in haze pollution. The simulated PM2.5 concentrations (with fixed emissions) driven by meteorology in 2018 were 12–15% higher than those with atmospheric circulations in 2017 both under a low and a high emission level, close to the observed 10% PM2.5 rebound. In 2018, positive sea ice anomalies around Beaufort Sea and “triple pattern” anomalies of sea surface temperature in the North Pacific and North Atlantic enhanced the anomalous anticyclonic circulations over the air-polluted region, and thus resulted in minimum surface wind speed during 1979–2018 and 16.8% shallower boundary layer than those in 2017. In the stagnated air of winter 2018, the transported dispersion of pollutant particles was weakened, however more secondary aerosols were produced by enhanced chemical reactions, which jointly contributed to the PM2.5 rebound in 2018. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Atmospheric teleconnection; Emission reduction; PM2.5","Atmospheric chemistry; Boundary layers; Chemical analysis; Climatology; Oceanography; Sea ice; Surface waters; Wind; Anticyclonic circulation; Atmospheric circulation; Chemical transport models; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Meteorological condition; Pollution management; Regional air pollution; Sea surface temperature (SST); Air pollution; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution control; sea ice; sea surface temperature; winter; aerosol; air pollution; article; Beaufort Sea; boundary layer; chemical reaction; China; climate; haze; meteorology; particulate matter; pollutant; rebound; sea ice; sea surface temperature; simulation; wind speed; winter; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Beaufort Sea; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083311204

We examined the frozen soil dynamics and N2O and CO2 efflux in a forest plantation (Populus ssp.) and farmland. The experiments were carried out at a forest reclamation site in Zhangbei county, Hebei province, China, from November 2017 to May 2018. Compared to the farmland, the forest plantation prolonged the retention of frozen soil because the shallower snow and the longer duration of snow cover in the forest contributed to a deeper frost depth and delayed soil thawing. The canopy also sheltered the frozen soil from the extreme fluctuations in freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) during the snow-free period. Contrasting snow regimes and FTC dynamics contributed to variations in CO2 and N2O between the forest plantation and the farmland. Path analysis showed that the soil water content and soil temperature were the main regulators of N2O and CO2 emissions, respectively, in both land-use types. By contrast, soil substrate and microorganism biomass minimally influenced N2O and CO2 efflux. In conclusion, forest cover influences frozen soil dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions by buffering temperature fluctuations in both snow-covered and snow-free periods. This study further highlights the potential importance of anthropogenic land-use changes in influencing the cold season energy balance and gas efflux in future milder winter climates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Farmland; Forest plantation; Frozen soil; Greenhouse gas emission; Snow cover","Carbon dioxide; Dynamics; Farms; Forestry; Freezing; Frozen soils; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Regression analysis; Snow; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Thawing; Comparison study; Delayed soil thawing; Forest plantation; Forest reclamation; Freeze-thaw cycles; Soil temperature; Soil water content; Temperature fluctuation; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; snow; carbon dioxide; snow; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; forest cover; forest dynamics; greenhouse gas; soil dynamics; soil temperature; agricultural land; Article; biomass; canopy; carbon footprint; China; comparative study; energy balance; environmental reclamation; forest management; freeze thawing; land use; nutrient; Populus; priority journal; soil; soil aggregation; soil temperature; vegetation; winter; agricultural land; forest; greenhouse gas; season; soil; China; Hebei; Zhangbei; Populus; Carbon Dioxide; China; Farms; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Seasons; Snow; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083305130

Five treatments were studied in this experiment: unamended soil (CK), unpyrolyzed calotropis (UPC), calotropis biochar at 250 °C (CB250), calotropis biochar at 400 °C (CB400), and calotropis biochar at 650 °C (CB650). These amendments were applied to the soil at level of 4% (w/w). The results of this study showed that applying unpyrolyzed calotropis residues increased cumulative CO2 emission from the soil by 117.3, 239.4 and 232.0% over CB250, CB400, and CB650, respectively, by the end of incubation. Compared to the unamended soil, applying CB250 reduced cumulative NH3 volatilization in soil by 71.5%, which attributed to ammonia adsorption because of increased cation exchange capacity and decreased soil pH, but CB650 increased cumulative NH3 volatilization by 73.3% after the 3-day incubation as a result of high soil pH. The available phosphorus in soil improved significantly (p ≤ 0.01) with adding unpyrolyzed calotropis residues and its biochar produced at different pyrolysis temperatures compared to the unamended soil. The values of available phosphorus in the soil under study influenced significantly by pyrolysis temperatures of produced biochar; this is due to the pyrolysis of feedstocks increases labile phosphorus.

Bacterial activity in landfill cover soils can play an important role in mitigating VOC emission. In order to evaluate the effects of degradation processes and characterize VOCs composition in landfill cover soil, gases from 60 sites and along 7 vertical profiles within the cover soil were collected for chemical and isotopic analysis at two undifferentiated urban solid waste disposal sites in Spain: (i) Pinto (Madrid) and (ii) Zurita (Fuerteventura, Canary Islands). The CO2/CH4 ratios and δ13C-CO2 and δ13C-CH4 values were controlled by either oxidation or reduction processes of landfill gas (LFG). VOCs were dominated by aromatics, alkanes and O-substituted compounds, with minor cyclics, terpenes, halogenated and S-substituted compounds. Degradation processes, depending on both (i) waste age and (ii) velocity of the uprising biogas through the soil cover, caused (i) an increase of degradation products (e.g., CO2, O-substituted compounds) and (ii) a decrease of degradable components (e.g., CH4, alkanes, alkylated aromatics, cyclic and S-substituted compounds). Terpenes, halogenated compounds, phenol and furans were unaffected by degradation processes and only depended on waste composition. These results highlight the fundamental role played by microbial activity in mitigating atmospheric emissions of VOCs from landfills. Nevertheless, the recalcitrant behaviour shown by compounds hazardous for health and environment remarks the importance of a correct landfill management that has to be carried out for years after the waste disposal activity is completed, since LFG emissions can persist for long time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biogas; Interstitial soil gas; Landfill; VOCs","Biodegradation; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Degradation; Halogenation; Isotopes; Paraffins; Soils; Solid wastes; Terpenes; Urban growth; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric emission; Degradation products; Halogenated compounds; Health and environment; Isotopic composition; Landfill-cover soils; Microbial activities; Substituted compounds; Land fill; alkane; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; delta carbon 13; methane; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; degradation; isotopic composition; landfill; soil pollution; soil quality; solid waste; volatile organic compound; Article; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); controlled study; gas; isotope analysis; landfill; landfill cover soil; landfill gas; limit of quantitation; microbial activity; priority journal; soil; solid phase microextraction; waste disposal; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083285255

Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (−45 to −51%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (−28 to −31.0%). By contrast, O3 levels increased (+33 to +57% of the 8 h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O3 by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. Relevant differences in the meteorology of these two periods were also evidenced. The low reduction for PM10 is probably related to a significant regional contribution and the prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols, but an in-depth evaluation has to be carried out to interpret this lower decrease. There is no defined trend for the low SO2 levels, probably due to the preferential reduction in emissions from the least polluting ships. A reduction of most pollutants to minimal concentrations are expected for the forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30th. There are still open questions on why PM10 levels were much less reduced than BC and NO2 and on what is the proportion of the abatement of pollution directly related to the lockdown, without meteorological interferences. © 2020","Lockdown; NO2; Ozone; Particulate matter; SARS-CoV-2; SO2","Epidemiology; Nitrogen oxides; Air quality monitoring stations; Atmospheric pollutants; Depth evaluations; Pollution level; Time evolutions; Traffic emissions; Urban air pollution; Urban background; Air quality; black carbon; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; concentration (composition); disease spread; epidemic; particulate matter; respiratory disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; traffic emission; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; city; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; quarantine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ship; Spain; titrimetry; traffic; urban area; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083031943

Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging, Kennedy Krieger Research Institute, Baltimore, MD, United States","Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), an index of brain vessel's dilatory capacity, is typically measured using hypercapnic gas inhalation or breath-holding as a vasoactive challenge. However, these methods require considerable subject cooperation and could be challenging in clinical studies. More recently, there have been attempts to use resting-state BOLD data to map CVR by utilizing spontaneous changes in breathing pattern. However, in subjects who have small fluctuations in their spontaneous breathing pattern, the CVR results could be noisy and unreliable. In this study, we aim to develop a new method for CVR mapping that does not require gas-inhalation yet provides substantially higher sensitivity than resting-state CVR mapping. This new method is largely based on resting-state scan, but introduces intermittent modulation of breathing pattern in the subject to enhance fluctuations in their end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) level. Here we examined the comfort level, sensitivity, and accuracy of this method in two studies. First, in 8 healthy young subjects, we developed the intermittent breath-modulation method using two different modulation frequencies, 6 ​s per breath and 12 ​s per breath, respectively, and compared the results to three existing CVR methods, specifically hypercapnic gas inhalation, breath-holding, and resting-state. Our results showed that the comfort level of the 6-s breath-modulation method was significantly higher than breath-holding (p ​= ​0.007) and CO2-inhalation (p ​= ​0.015) methods, while not different from the resting-state, i.e. free breathing method (p ​= ​0.52). When comparing the sensitivity of CVR methods, the breath-modulation methods revealed higher Z-statistics compared to the resting-state scan (p ​< ​0.008) and was comparable to breath-holding results. Next, we tested the feasibility of breath-modulation CVR mapping (6 ​s per breath) in 21 cognitively normal elderly participants and compared quantitative CVR values to that obtained with the CO2-inhalation method. Whole-brain CVR was found to be 0.150 ​± ​0.055 and 0.154 ​± ​0.032 %ΔBOLD/mmHg for the breath-modulation and CO2-inhalation method, respectively, with a significant correlation between them (y ​= ​0.97x, p ​= ​0.007). CVR mapping with intermittent breath modulation may be a useful method that combines the advantages of resting-state and CO2-inhalation based approaches. © 2020 The Authors","Breath modulation; Cerebrovascular reactivity; End-tidal CO2; Hypercapnia; Resting-state BOLD fMRI","adult; aged; aging; Article; blood vessel reactivity; BOLD signal; brain blood vessel; brain mapping; breath holding; breathing; breathing pattern; carbon dioxide breathing; cerebrovascular reactivity; cognition; comfort; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; feasibility study; female; frequency modulation; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; hypercapnia; intermethod comparison; intermittent breath modulation; male; normal human; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; brain; brain circulation; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; vascularization; young adult; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Breath Holding; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Female; Humans; Hypercapnia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Respiration; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082926707

A total number of 11 parameters are optimized simultaneously with respected to four optimization objectives, including the ISFC, NO, CH4 and Soot emissions. The main findings are as follows: More than half of the calculated cases in the Pareto front can meet the EURO V emission regulation. In addition, a larger EGR rate is needed in order to achieve a lower NO emission. The optimized natural gas spray angles are around 80° and 70°; the diesel spray angles are around 60°, 70° and 75°; the EGR rates are around 28% and 14%; the swirl ratios are around 1.6 and 0.5; the compression ratios are around 16.5 and 18.5; the azimuth angles are around −3° and 5°. The combustion modes of the optimized cases can be divided into three categories based on the difference between the natural gas and diesel injection timings. The high-temperature combustion regions in the NG PPCI (Partial Premixed Compression Ignition) combustion mode with open combustion chamber are widely distributed, which result in an obviously higher NO emission than the other combustion modes. However, its Soot emission is the lowest. For diesel PPCI and HPDI (High Pressure Direct Injection) combustion mode, the natural gas is mainly consumed through diffusion combustion. Therefore, the Soot emissions are relatively higher. However, as the ignition timing is postponed, their NO emissions are relatively lower. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Direct injection; Genetic algorithm; Many-objectives optimization; Natural gas","Diesel engines; Direct injection; Gas engines; Gases; Genetic algorithms; Natural gas; Soot; Compression ignition; Diffusion combustion; Direct injection natural gas engine; Emission regulation; High-pressure direct injection; High-temperature combustion; Optimization genetic algorithms; Three categories; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082670391

Expanding the voltage window by employing the hydrogel electrolyte is regarded as an effective method to improve the energy density of supercapacitor. Herein, we employ a zwitterionic natural polymer hydrogel with excellent mechanical strength and flexibility as electrolyte to assemble a solid-state zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (H-ZHS) with Zn foil and activated carbon electrode.

GHG projections to 2040 with a social–ecological system model yield overall greater emissions than simple extrapolations in official climate action planning. The most pronounced difference in emissions (39% higher) from energy use single-residence buildings resulting from urban sprawl. And this difference is not accounted for in the simple extrapolations.

In particular, treating ectomycorrhizal (EM) invasions, i.e., co-invasions by EM fungi and their EM host plants, as natural experiments may offer a powerful approach for testing how microbial traits influence ecosystem functions. Forests dominated by EM symbiosis have unique biogeochemistry whereby the secretions of EM plants and fungi affect carbon (C) and nutrient cycling; moreover, particular lineages of EM fungi have unique functional traits. EM invasions may therefore alter the biogeochemistry of the native ecosystems they invade, especially nitrogen (N) and C cycling. By identifying “response traits” that favor the success of fungi in introductions and invasions (e.g., spore dispersal and germination) and their correlations with “effect traits” (e.g., nutrient-cycling enzymes) that can alter N and C cycling (and affect other coupled elemental cycles), one may be able to predict the functional consequences for ecosystems of fungal invasions using biogeochemistry models that incorporate fungal traits. Here, we review what is already known about how EM fungal community composition, traits, and ecosystem functions differ between native and exotic populations, focusing on the example of EM fungi associated with species of Pinus introduced from the Northern into the Southern Hemisphere. We develop hypotheses on how effects of introduced and invasive EM fungi may depend on interactions between soil N availability in the exotic range and EM fungal traits.

The size of this carbon sink will depend on the degree to which second-growth forests are permanent and protected from re-clearing. Yet few studies have assessed permanence of reforestation, especially not at a large spatial scale. Here, we analyzed a 14-year time series (2001–2014) of remotely sensed land-cover data, covering all tropical Latin America and the Caribbean, to quantify the extent of second-growth forest permanence. Our results show that in many cases, reforestation in Latin America and the Caribbean during the early 21st century reversed by 2014, limiting carbon sequestration. In fact, reversals of reforestation, in which some or all gains in forest cover in the early 2000s were subsequently lost, were ten times more common than sustained increases in forest cover. Had reversals of reforestation been avoided, forests could have sequestered 0.58 Pg C, over four times more carbon than we estimate was sequestered after accounting for impermanence (0.14 Pg), representing a loss of 75% of carbon sequestration potential. Differences in the prevalence of reforestation reversals across countries suggest an important role for socio-economic, political, and ecological context, with political transitions and instability increasing the likelihood of reversals. These findings suggest that national commitments to reforestation may fall short of their carbon sequestration goals without provisions to ensure long-term permanence of new forests. © Copyright © 2020 Schwartz, Aide, Graesser, Grau and Uriarte.","carbon sequestration and storage; deforestation; forest persistence; land-use change; reforestation; second growth forests; tropical forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100738713

Based on a multi-level model of the time dependence of AE parameters, estimation of elastic homogeneous fracture intensity parameters of representative structural elements of a product and universal strength nanoconstants, the approach combines the traditional experimental way of resource estimation and kinetic representations of fracture. This allows to separate the effect of macro- and nano-factors on the AE of the material, variously related to the strength and acoustic emission activity of the material. A multilevel model and an informational-kinetic approach to acoustic emission diagnostics are described, combining nano-, micro- and macro-factors affecting acoustic emission activity, reliability of technical objects and methods for assessing their resource. On the example of a welded pressure vessel, the implementation of the method of its nano-diagnosis is considered. The possibility of effective resource estimation of various technical objects based on the information-kinetic approach to their acoustic emission diagnostics is shown. As a methodological basis, a multilevel model of the time dependences of the AE parameters is taken, which describes their behavior under conditions of strength and metrological heterogeneity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Industrial research; Kinetics; Manufacture; Regression analysis; Acoustic emission diagnostics; Emission parameters; Intensity parameters; Kinetic approach; Production technology; Resource estimation; Structural elements; Technical objects; Acoustic emission testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089962191

Thus, while the climate becomes unpredictable, they adapted to extreme weather conditions. However, changes in weather such as dryer summers, rain in summer, more extended summer season, longer rainy season, and high tides. It made the salt production decrease. Salt farmer have their adaptation strategies during climate change. This research aims to analyze reasons for adaptation strategies regarding climate change. The research conducted in Pati Regency from 2011 to 2016. Pati Regency is the 3rd most significant salt production area in Indonesia. We interviewed the respondents, as well as confirmed the data to other farmers, extension officers, and agency officers in the district. The data used in this paper are the salt farmer perception is regarding climate change and their adaptation strategies. We also used content analysis to strengthen our data based on literature and other founding. We found that Salt farmers use their strategy to fasten production, such as using canvas, black stone, LDPE (Low-Density Poly Ethylene), and HDPE (High-Density Poly Ethylene). LDPE and HDPE were introduced by Ministry Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) in 2013 and turned out to be very helpful for the farmers. The technology introduced by MMAF increased production by 14% and price by 144% than before while working loads become lighter, especially in the harvesting process. Several adaptation strategies have implemented in other Regencies, such as MMAF technology. However, it still needs continuous persuasion because not all farmers wanted to apply it. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Aliphatic compounds; Aquaculture; Ecology; Ethylene; High density polyethylenes; Adaptation strategies; Change impacts; Content analysis; Extreme weather conditions; Farmer perception; Salt production; Summer season; Working loads; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089470911

Current molecular genetics, cell biological, and epidemiological evidences have shown the correlation between PD and DM. PD shares the same pathogenesis pathways and pathological factors with DM. In addition, β-cell reduction, which can cause hyperglycemia, is a striking feature of DM. Recent studies indicated that hyperglycemia is highly relevant to the pathologic changes in PD. However, further correlation between DM and PD remains to be investigated. Intriguingly, polycystic monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which is co-expressed in dopaminergic neurons and β cells, is responsible for taking up dopamine into the presynaptic vesicles and can specifically bind to the β cells. Furthermore, we have summarized the specific molecular and diagnostic functions of VMAT2 for the two diseases reported in this review. Therefore, VMAT2 can be applied as a target probe for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to detect β-cell and dopamine level changes, which can contribute to the diagnosis of DM and PD during the prodromal phase. Targeting VMAT2 with the molecular probe 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ can be an entry point for the β cell mass (BCM) changes in DM at the molecular level, to clarify the potential relationship between DM and PD. VMAT2 has promising clinical significance in investigating the pathogenesis, early diagnosis, and treatment evaluation of the two diseases. © Copyright © 2020 Kong, Zhou, Feng, Zhuang, Wen, Zhang, Sun, Wang and Guan.","diabetes mellitus; dopamine; Parkinson’s disease; VMAT2; β-cell mass","carbon 11; dihydrotetrabenazine; dopamine; dopamine transporter; fluoropropyl f 18; insulin; neurotransmitter; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; radiopharmaceutical agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; thioredoxin interacting protein; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; unclassified drug; vesicular monoamine transporter 2; beta cell mass; cell population; cell proliferation; cellular parameters; clinical feature; correlational study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; dopaminergic nerve cell; early diagnosis; human; hyperglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; molecular genetics; molecular imaging; molecular probe; monoaminergic system; neurotransmission; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; Parkinson disease; pathogenesis; positron emission tomography; presynaptic nerve; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; Review; risk factor; signal transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088791153

Aiming at the serious problem of wind abandonment during the low temperature period of winter heating period in Northeast China, a multi-market mechanism is proposed. The carbon trading is analysed. Firstly, and the regional peak demand optimization model based on multi-scenario stochastic programming and the maximum wind power acceptance power calculation model of regional power grid is constructed to calculate the peak shaving demand and existing peak shaving in each period of the regional power grid. Maximum wind power acceptance under resources; Based on the coordination of carbon quotas among power generation groups and the subsection compensation mechanism of compensated peak shaving costs, and aiming at the minimum sum of total coal consumption costs, wind abandonment penalties and compensation costs, integrated dispatching model considering carbon trading and peak shaving compensation is established. Finally, an example is given to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon Trading Market; Peak Shaving; Power Generation; Wind Power","Carbon; Coal deposits; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Temperature; Wind power; Auxiliary services; Compensation costs; Compensation mechanism; Dispatch strategy; Dispatching models; Optimization modeling; Power development; Regional power grids; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088876487

The techno-economic and life cycle assessments of the process were performed and compared to the naphtha-cracking route. In these assessments two scenarios were defined to evaluate the impact of catalyst selectivity to 1,3-BD (58 and 69%). For the assessment of the environmental sustainability, three further cases were defined to determine the influence of the geographical location of the production plant considering the world's major ethanol suppliers: The United States, Brazil, and Europe. The results of the economic evaluation show that for a plant with a production capacity of 200 ktonne/year of 1,3-BD, and considering an average market price of azeotropic ethanol (450 €/m3), the minimum butadiene selling price for a 10% rate of return on investment ranges 1.13-1.26 times the average butadiene market price (1529 €/tonne). The process can be profitable for favorable combinations of market prices of ethanol and 1,3-butadiene, but the profitability of the process ultimately relies on the development of higher selective catalysts to reduce the consumption of ethanol per tonne of 1,3-butadiene since ethanol dominates the production costs. The LCA shows that switching from naphtha-derived butadiene to biobutadiene can lead to substantial reductions in CO2 emissions (GWP100) (8-26%) but, in turn, to a significant increase in water consumption (62 to 137-fold) and cumulative energy demand (50-250%). Being that ethanol is the major contributor to all impact categories (65-98% of the impacts), the location of the plant and catalyst selectivity significantly affects the environmental sustainability of the process. Considering the three impact categories and the uncertainty analysis of the LCA results, the best plant location would be Brazil, with a negative median impact value for GWP100 (-73 to -52 kg CO2 eq/tonne 1,3-BD) and the lowest median value for water consumption (235-299 m3/tonne 1,3-BD) but the highest median value for cumulative energy demand (207-241 GJeq/tonne 1,3-BD), the latter due to the low ethanol yield of sugar cane.

Two depth zones contained elevated methane concentrations: the upper 400 m (&lt;10 nM) and near gas seeps at the seafloor (up to 2100 nM). Seeps occurred at Four Way Closure Ridge (FWCR) at the active continental margin as well as at Southern Summit Formosa Ridge (SSFR) at the passive continental margin. In the upper ocean, methane dynamics correlated with (1) temperature, (2) water masses, and (3) suspended matter. In the first case, elevated methane concentrations and aerobic methane oxidation rates (MOxs) occurred in water with temperatures &gt; 10°C and &gt; 20°C, respectively. Both 16S rRNA gene and pmoA amplicon analyses revealed distinct microbial and methanotrophic communities in water with temperature of 27°C, ∼10°C, and 3°C. Second, we found elevated methane concentrations in 200–400 m in the FWCR-region whereas increased methane concentrations occurred in the uppermost 100 m above SSFR. The deeper plume above FWCR might be due to an intrusion of the Kuroshio water mass into SCS keeping the methane from being aerobically oxidized in the warm surface water and vented to the atmosphere. Finally, all peak methane concentrations occurred in water depth, with rather low backscatter, i.e., in water depth with less suspended matter. At the seafloor, ocean currents and long-term seepage appeared to control methane dynamics. We derived methane fluxes of 0.08–0.12 mmol m–2 d–1 from a 4.5 km2 area at FWCR and of 3.0–79.9 mmol m–2 d–1 from a 0.01 km2 area at SSFR. Repetitive sampling of the area at SSFR indicated that changing directions of ocean currents possibly affected methane concentrations and thus flux. In contrast to these seepage sites with distinct methane plumes, retrieval of drilling equipment produced no methane plume. Even gas emission triggered by seafloor drilling did not supply measureable methane concentrations after 3 h, but caused an increase in methanotrophic activity as determined by rate measurements and molecular-biological analyses. Apparently, only long-term seepage can generate methane anomalies in the ocean. © Copyright © 2020 Mau, Tu, Becker, dos Santos Ferreira, Chen, Lin, Wang, Lin and Bohrmann.","methane concentration; methane oxidation rate; methane seeps; methanotrophs; ocean current; ocean methane paradox; South China Sea; water column",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088583670

Design/methodology/approach: Data were extracted from a random sample of 911 new builds from 403 planning applications and related documents, across five Scottish local planning authorities (LPAs) who adopted GHG reduction policies. The data included GHG reduction, LZCGT installation and performance, use of plan designs to meet GHG reductions and exemptions from the GHG policies. Descriptive statistics using SPSS software, complimented by qualitative responses from questionnaires, helped to explain observed performance. Findings: The policies performed poorly, at the level of delivering low-hanging fruits, with significant room for improvement. Design-led opportunities in the GHG policies were not actively pursued; most LZCGT installation was exempted from GHG policies and the policies were poor in targeting the relationship between building unit size, GHG emission and reductions. Research limitations/implications: The source documents, where the data came from, had varying quality and completeness and some LPAs are over-represented in the data. The study applied limited criteria to evaluate policy performance. Practical implications: Areas for policymakers to further focus on when exploring how to enhance role and performance of LZCGT are highlighted, including practical suggestions. Originality/value: One of the few studies assessing policy performance and distilling lessons, from early adopters of GHG policies at local level planning, offer performance benchmarks and raise points of concern for policymakers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Local planning; New builds; Policy evaluation; Policy performance; Scotland","carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; local planning; performance assessment; policy making; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086173598

The template is based on imine-linked frameworks and their (001) facets seed the C=C bond formation reaction to constitute 2D sp2 carbon-conjugated frameworks. This strategy is applicable to templates with different topologies, enables designed synthesis of frameworks that cannot be prepared via direct polymerization, and creates a series of sp2 carbon frameworks with tetragonal, hexagonal, and kagome topologies. The sp2 carbon frameworks are highly luminescent even in the solid state and exhibit topology-dependent π transmission and exciton migration; these key fundamental π functions are unique to sp2 carbon-conjugated frameworks and cannot be accessible by imine-linked frameworks, amorphous analogues, and 1D conjugated polymers.

In Oman, the total quantity of MSW stood at 2.0 million tons per year. The emission from this waste is estimated at 2,181,034 tons/year (carbon dioxide equivalent). This article attempts to develop frameworks that considered landfilling, composting and recycling of MSW. Design/methodology/approach: To know the composition of the municipal solid waste in Oman, a quantitative research method was employed. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from MSWM in this study focus on three major gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 model is used to calculate GHG emissions from landfills and composting (IPCC, 2006). Four frameworks – baseline F0, framework F1, framework F2 and framework F3 – are outlined in this paper. The F0 represents the current situation of the MSW in which most of the waste goes to landfills and dumpsites. In F1, improved MSW collection service and landfilling are incorporated and open burning is restricted. The F2 considered landfilling and composting, while F3 is based on landfilling, composting and recycling. Findings: The framework F2, which proposes the composting process for the organic waste which normally goes to landfills, results in the reduction of emissions by 40% as compared to landfill practice. Similarly, the samples of MSW collected in Oman show a good amount of recycling waste. The framework F3, which considers the landfill, composting and recycling, reduced the total GHG emissions from 2,181,034 tons/year to 1,427,998 tons/year (carbon dioxide equivalent), representing a total reduction of 35% in emissions. Research limitations/implications: Different values such as CH4 correction factor, the fraction of degradable organic carbon and the fraction of DOC used to determine the GHG emissions from MSW considering landfilling, composting and recycling based on the IPPC model and existing literature review. The actual determination of these values based on the Oman conditions may result in more accurate emissions from MSW in Oman. Practical implications: Different frameworks suggested in this research have different practical implications; however, the final framework F3, which produces fewer emissions, required a material recovery facility to recycle the MSW in Oman. For framework F3, it is important that the residents in Oman have enough knowledge and willingness to do the waste segregation at the household level. Apparently, such knowledge and willingness need to be determined through a separate study. Originality/value: The frameworks F2 and F3 are considered to be more suitable solutions compared to the current practices for Oman and other gulf countries to reduce its per capita emissions from MSW and protect its local environment. There is a potential for further work that needs to explore the possible solutions to implement the suggested frameworks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emissions; Environment; Municipal solid waste; Recycling; Sustainability; Waste management and disposal","composting; emission control; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; landfill; literature review; municipal solid waste; recycling; Oman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084497368

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to describe the content of the most viewed climate change videos on YouTube. Methods:The term “climate change” was used to search onYouTube to garner a sample of the 100 most widely-viewed videos. Videos in a language other than English, or considered irrelevant, were excluded. Using a fact sheet from National Aeronautics and Space Administration, content categories were created and successively coded. Results: The mean number of views for the 100 videos evaluated was 231,140.2 views (SD= 718, 399.5) and the mean length was 12.1 minutes (SD= 24.1). Most videos were uploaded by a news source (77.0%), included a belief that climate change is happening (77.0%), and mentioned the impact of climate change on the environment (71.0%). Only one-third of the videos mentioned how to prevent climate change (33.0%). More than half focused on a specific environment and, of those, 47.2% specifically focused on cities. Compared to videos that did not focus on a specific environment, the videos with an environmental focus were more often intended for adults (87.3% vs. 53.3%, P≤0.001). Conclusion: This study highlights the need for climate change YouTube videos intended for youth. Targeting youth may lead to engagement of younger generations in climate change discourse and inspire climate action. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of YouTube as a platform for educational videos on climate change. © 2020 The Author(s).","Adolescents; Climate change; Social media","adult; article; city; climate change; cross-sectional study; female; human; human experiment; juvenile; language; learning; male; social media; videorecording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090687517

Polyacrylonitrilebased electrospun carbon nanofibers were prepared in this study at different carbonization temperatures for CO2 capture. The effects of the primary surface features and the functional groups of the carbon nanofibers on CO2 adsorption capacity were discussed. Results showed that the carbonization temperature influenced the porous texture and the surface chemical states of the carbon nanofibers significantly. The specific surface area, total pore volume, and micropore volume of the fibers increased with increasing carbonization temperature, but the ultra-micropore volume presented a different trend. The samples carbonized at 750 °C had the smallest average pore hydraulic radius. Moreover, in the micropore range, the volume of sub-micropores increased at a greater rate than that of ultra-micropores after activation. The carbonization temperature was also of great importance in controlling the nitrogen content and composition. A CO2 uptake of 3.47 mmol/g at 25 °C and 1 atm was achieved. The ultramicropore volume of the carbon nanofibers was the most important parameter for determining CO2 uptake at 1 atm; however, the CO2 adsorption capacity at 0.15 atm was highly dependent on the surface pyrrolic or pyridonic groups. © MYU K.K.","Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Carbon nanofiber; Carbonization","Carbon nanofibers; Carbonization; Gas adsorption; Global warming; Microporosity; Pore structure; Surface chemistry; Textures; Carbon dioxide adsorption; Carbonization temperatures; Electrospun carbon nanofibers; Hydraulic radius; Micropore volumes; Surface chemical state; Total pore volume; Ultra-micropore volumes; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090882282

Styron, J., Carolina Mariculture Company, Cedar Island, NC, United States","Coastal acidification in southeastern U.S. estuaries and coastal waters is influenced by biological activity, run-off from the land, and increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Acidification can negatively impact coastal resources such as shellfish, finfish, and coral reefs, and the communities that rely on them. Organismal responses for species located in the U.S. Southeast document large negative impacts of acidification, especially in larval stages. For example, the toxicity of pesticides increases under acidified conditions and the combination of acidification and low oxygen has profoundly negative influences on genes regulating oxygen consumption. In corals, the rate of calcification decreases with acidification and processes such as wound recovery, reproduction, and recruitment are negatively impacted. Minimizing the changes in global ocean chemistry will ultimately depend on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, but adaptation to these changes and mitigation of the local stressors that exacerbate global acidification can be addressed locally. The evolution of our knowledge of acidification, from basic understanding of the problem to the emergence of applied research and monitoring, has been facilitated by the development of regional Coastal Acidification Networks (CANs) across the United States. This synthesis is a product of the Southeast Coastal and Ocean Acidification Network (SOCAN). SOCAN was established to better understand acidification in the coastal waters of the U.S. Southeast and to foster communication among scientists, resource managers, businesses, and governments in the region. Here we review acidification issues in the U.S. Southeast, including the regional mechanisms of acidification and their potential impacts on biological resources and coastal communities. We recommend research and monitoring priorities and discuss the role SOCAN has in advancing acidification research and mitigation of and adaptation to these changes. © Copyright © 2020 Hall, Wickes, Burnett, Scott, Hernandez, Yates, Barbero, Reimer, Baalousha, Mintz, Cai, Craig, DeVoe, Fisher, Hathaway, Jewett, Johnson, Keener, Mordecai, Noakes, Phillips, Sandifer, Schnetzer and Styron.","capacity-building; coastal acidification; coral; crustaceans; hypoxia; shellfish; stakeholders",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088554598

Here, we describe biological risks under current levels of exposure to anthropogenic OA in the Salish Sea, an estuarine system that already experiences inherently low pH and aragonite saturation state (Ωar) conditions. We used the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Washington State Department of Ecology Salish Sea biogeochemical model (SSM) informed by a selection of OA-related biological thresholds of ecologically and economically important calcifiers, pteropods, and Dungeness crabs. The SSM was implemented to assess current exposure and associated risk due to reduced Ωar and pH conditions with respect to the magnitude, duration, and severity of exposure below the biological thresholds in the Salish Sea in comparison to the pre-industrial era. We further investigated the individual effects of atmospheric CO2 uptake and nutrient-driven eutrophication on changes in chemical exposure since pre-industrial times. Our model predicts average decreases in Ωar and pH since pre-industrial times of about 0.11 and 0.06, respectively, in the top 100 m of the water column of the Salish Sea. These decreases predispose pelagic calcifiers to increased duration, intensity, and severity of exposure. For pteropods, present-day exposure is below the thresholds related to sublethal effects across the entire Salish Sea basin, while mortality threshold exposure occurs on a spatially limited basis. The greatest risk for larval Dungeness crabs is associated with spatially limited exposures to low calcite saturation state in the South Sound in the springtime, triggering an increase in internal dissolution. The main anthropogenic driver behind the predicted impacts is atmospheric CO2 uptake, while nutrient-driven eutrophication plays only a marginal role over spatially and temporally limited scales. Reduction of CO2 emissions can help sustain biological species vital for ecosystem functions and society. © Copyright © 2020 Bednaršek, Pelletier, Ahmed and Feely.","anthropogenic stressors; attribution analyses; biogeochemical projections; Dungeness crab; nutrient remineralization; ocean acidification; pteropods; threshold",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088525566

For this reason, we studied catalysts for H2 oxidation at room temperature to ensure hydrogen safety. Catalysts were prepared by different preparation methods and compared to evaluate the role of Pt and Pd in Pt–Pd/TiO2 catalysts. The catalytic activity was significantly enhanced when activity metal size was small and it was exposed to catalyst surface to a high Pd ratio. For the 0.1%Pt-0.9%Pd/TiO2 catalyst, high hydrogen conversion of 90% was obtained under the condition of 0.5% hydrogen injection. To understand the correlation between activity and characteristics of catalyst, the physicochemical characteristics of the various catalysts were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed oxidation and reduction (TPOR) and Field Emission-Transmission Electron Microscope (FE-TEM) analysis. From these analysis, it was found that Pt served the role of highly dispersion of active metal (Pt–Pd) and as with increasing Pd ratio of active metal, hydrogen activity was increased, which indicates that hydrogen oxidation had proceeded on the Pd site. Finally, the valence state of the Pd influenced hydrogen oxidation activity of Pt–Pd/TiO2, which increased with increasing ratio of Pd0/PdTotal. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Bimetallic; H2 oxidation; Palladium; Platinum; Room-temperature","Hydrogen; Oxidation; Platinum metals; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Bimetallic catalysts; Catalyst surfaces; Field-emission transmission; Hydrogen injection; Hydrogen oxidation; Physicochemical characteristics; Preparation method; Temperature programmed oxidation; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085979367

The BC-rich ADE contained over 100% more poorly crystalline minerals than the adjacent tropical soil. Linear combination fitting of k-spacing in the X-ray Absorption Spectra (XAS) revealed that ferrihydrite contributed to 81.1% of the Fe-minerals in BC. A small but distinct peak was observed at 5.7 Å−1 in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure k oscillation of BC, revealing the presence of Fe[sbnd]C (including Fe-O-C) covalent bonds. No Fe[sbnd]C path was yielded by the XAS fitting when an obvious peak downshift of the first (Fe[sbnd]Fe1) shell was observed, suggesting that the availability of inner-sphere Fe[sbnd]C complexation was limited to the BC surface and interphase region. The main minerals for organo-mineral complexation were short-range-order (SRO) ferrihydrite on BC instead of corner-sharing FeO6 octahedra. Compared to ADE, the coordination number of the first (Fe[sbnd]Fe1) and second (Fe[sbnd]Fe2) shell was higher in BC, revealing a higher degree of order in coordination between the neighboring Fe mineral crystals. Black C limited the progressive aging of amorphous Fe phases and greatly enriched SRO ferrihydrite in the redox-fluctuating and high-leaching environment. The transformation of SRO ferrihydrite into the more crystalline Fe oxides was controlled by the local pH environment. A strong signal from the complexed phenolic group (aryl-OH, 1241 cm−1) and a distinct band of inner-sphere complexation (Fe-aryl C, 1380–1384 cm−1) were identified in the FTIR spectra. The enrichment of poorly crystalline minerals can have positive feedback on the long-term stabilization of BC. The scale-up application of biochar to agricultural and ecological systems may have a long-lasting impact on the enrichment and transformation of the SRO minerals in the soil. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Amazonian Dark Earth; Biochar (BC); Ferrihydrite; Organo-mineral interaction mechanism; Short-range-order (SRO) mineral; XAS","Agricultural robots; Complexation; Extended X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy; Feedback; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Minerals; X ray absorption; Amazonian dark earths; Coordination number; Crystalline minerals; Environmental implications; Extended X-ray absorption fine structures; Inner-sphere complexation; Mineral interactions; Short range ordering; Iron oxides; black carbon; ferric hydroxide; gold nanoparticle; biochar; black carbon; complexation; enrichment; environmental impact; ferrihydrite; transformation; tropical soil; amazonian dark earth; Article; controlled study; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; infrared spectroscopy; microscopy; priority journal; scale up; scanning electron microscopy; soil; synchrotron based transmission X ray microscopy; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray fluorescence; Amazon River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083177094

The current research focuses on assessing the impacts of forest fires on terrestrial ecosystem productivity in India during 2003–2017. Spatiotemporal changes of satellite remote sensing derived burn indices were estimated for both fire and normal years to analyze the association between forest fires and ecosystem productivity. Two Light Use Efficiency (LUE) models were used to quantify the terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of the forest ecosystem using the open-source and freely available remotely sensed data. A novel approach (delta NPP/delta burn indices) is developed to quantify the effects of forest fires on terrestrial carbon emission and ecosystem production. During 2003–2017, the forest fire intensity was found to be very high (>2000) across the eastern Himalayan hilly region, which is mostly covered by dense forest and thereby highly susceptible to wildfires. Scattered patches of intense forest fires were also detected in the lower Himalayan and central Indian states. The spatial correlation between the burn indices and NPP were mainly negative (−0.01 to −0.89) for the fire-prone states as compared to the other neighbouring regions. Additionally, the linear approximation between the burn indices and NPP showed a positive relation (0.01 to 0.63), suggesting a moderate to high impact of the forest fires on the ecosystem production and terrestrial carbon emission. The present approach has the potential to quantify the loss of ecosystem productivity due to forest fires. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Burn indices; Carbon emission; Forest fire; Greenhouse gas emission; Net primary productivity; Remote sensing","Biodiversity; Carbon; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Fire hazards; Remote sensing; Ecosystem productivity; Linear approximations; Net primary productivity; Remote sensing approaches; Remote sensing techniques; Satellite remote sensing; Spatio-temporal changes; Terrestrial ecosystems; Fires; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; carbon emission; correlation; forest fire; net primary production; remote sensing; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; air quality; air temperature; Article; autumn; biomass production; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental impact; environmental stress; forest fire; India; land use; particulate matter; photosynthesis; priority journal; remote sensing; soil moisture; tillage; vegetation; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083078777

Emissions of N2O from acidic forests are increasing rapidly; however, little is known about the mechanisms driving these emissions. We analyzed soil samples from a high N2O emission area (HEA, 224–601 μg N m−2 h−1) and an adjacent low emission area (LEA, 20–30 μg N m−2 h−1) of a highly acidified forest. HEA showed similar carbon and nitrogen (N) pools and microbial biomass to LEA, but significantly higher moisture and extractable nutrients than LEA did. GeoChip 4 detected 298 gene families (unadjusted P &lt; 0.05; 94, adjusted P &lt; 0.05) showing significantly different structures between HEA and LEA. Both areas had highly diverse N cycling functional genes. However, HEA had higher relative abundances of nor, P450nor, and archaeal nitrifier nirK, which provided evidence for the importance of denitrifiers in N2O emission. HEA also showed significantly higher relative abundances of lignin- and cellulose-degrading genes, oxygen-limitation-response genes and denitrifier ppk, but lower abundances of N- and phosphorus (P) -limitation-response genes especially denitrifier pstS, corresponding to the higher moisture and extractable nutrients conducive to denitrification. The moisture, extractable nutrients and pH explained over 50% variation in microbial communities, and extractable P appeared as the key factor driving community variation and consequently regulated N2O production.

Developing strategies to reduce the emissions associated with key global commodities is essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change. To date, however, there have been no studies that have estimated the potential to reduce GHG emissions associated with the production of wheat, a key global commodity, at a national scale through changes to wheat production systems. Here, we assess the consequences for net GHG emissions of Australian wheat production from applying three changes to wheat production systems: increasing the rates of fertiliser N to achieve the water-limited yield potential; increasing the frequency of lime applications on acid soils; and changing a two year cropping rotation (from wheat-wheat to legume-wheat). We predict that applying these three changes across the key wheat growing regions in Australia would increase production of wheat and legumes by 17.8 and 5.3 Mt, respectively, over the two-year period. Intensifying Australian production would reduce the need to produce wheat and legumes elsewhere in the world. This would free up agricultural land at the global scale and avoid the need to convert forestland and grassland to cropping lands to meet increasing global demands for wheat. We find that applying these changes across wheat growing zones would reduce the GHGs associated with Australian wheat production by 18.4 Mt CO2-e over the two-year period. Our research supports the notion that intensification of existing agricultural production can provide climate change mitigation. The impacts of intensification on other environmental indicators also need to be considered by policy makers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Burden shifting; Indirect land use change; Intensification","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Greenhouse gases; Lime; Soils; Agricultural land; Agricultural productions; Climate change mitigation; Developing strategy; Environmental indicators; Increase productions; Research support; Wheat production; Climate change; calcium oxide; nitrogen fertilizer; climate change; crop production; crop rotation; development strategy; emission control; greenhouse gas; wheat; agricultural land; Article; Australia; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; crop production; crop rotation; cropland; forest soil; grassland; harvest; legume; prediction; priority journal; soil acidity; wheat; agriculture; climate change; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Australia; Triticum aestivum; Agriculture; Australia; Climate Change; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083035402

Ultra-low emission policy for the Chinese steel industry states that emission concentrations of particulate matter, SO2 and NOx should not exceed 10, 35 and 50 mg/m3 respectively. The emission concentrations of the steel industry are the same as the ultra-low emission policy for the coal-fired power industry, but the pollutant control technologies of the two industries are different. Life cycle assessment method is applied to analyze the latest ultra-low treatment process for sintering flue gas emissions which includes electrostatic precipitation, ozone oxidation, wet desulfurization, wet denitration, condensation dehumidification and wet electrostatic precipitation. Following this novel ultra-low emission treatment, the concentrations of particulate matter, SO2, NOx, and PCDDs in the sintering flue gas decreased very significantly, attaining the new emission standard. With 1 ton of sinter as the functional unit and “cradle to gate” as the system boundary, the environmental impact of the process is 0.1811 and the total economic cost is 172.79 RMB, of which internal cost is 34.64 RMB and external cost is 138.15 RMB. The main environmental impacts result from applying the wet denitration and ozone oxidation processes. Sodium sulfite in the wet denitration process, and electricity and liquid oxygen in the ozone oxidation process are the key inputs that cause environmental impact. These findings are useful for a further optimization of the ultra-low emissions process from both the environmental and economic perspective, which is applicable in other regions of the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollutant; Life cycle assessment; Sintering flue gas; Ultra-low emission","Air pollution; Coal industry; Electrostatic separators; Electrostatics; Flue gases; Flues; Gas emissions; Humidity control; Iron and steel industry; Life cycle; Liquefied gases; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Oxidation; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Precipitation (chemical); Sintering; Sodium sulfite; Steelmaking; Sulfite process; Chinese steel industry; Economic perspective; Electrostatic precipitation; Emission concentration; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pollutant emission; Wet desulfurization; Wet electrostatic precipitation; Particulate emissions; nitrogen oxide; oxygen; ozone; sodium sulfite; sulfur dioxide; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; particulate matter; pollutant source; sinter; steel; air pollution control; Article; China; dehumidification; denitration; desulfurization; energy conservation; environmental impact; flue gas; iron and steel industry; life cycle assessment; nitration; oxidation; particulate matter; precipitation; priority journal; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083033666

The diurnal patterns of VOC emissions from identified sources are likely to be affected by the strength of emissions, variation of the planetary boundary layer height, and photochemical reactions. In addition, the PMF analyses of hourly and 24-hour averaged data of the hourly-resolved data (PMF_Hourly and PMF_Daily) were generally comparable, but the time series of VOC emissions from PMF_Hourly could not be well captured by PMF_Daily for two local VOC sources of gasoline exhaust and LPG.

In this work, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples of Xi'an, China in 2017 were analyzed by excitation-emission matrices and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) method to obtain the species, content, sources and seasonal variation characteristics of atmospheric chromophores. The results showed that humic-like (HULIS) chromophores and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-like (PAHs-like) chromophores were the most abundant chromophores in the samples, accounting for 42% and 33%, respectively. With the aggravation of air pollution, the relative content of low-polarity chromophores increased markedly, while the relative content of polar chromophores decreased. The concentrations of atmospheric chromophores exhibited obvious seasonal variation characteristics: high in winter and low in summer. Similarly, the relative contributions of atmospheric chromophores from each source varied with the season. In addition, special weather and human activities had a significant influence on the source of atmospheric chromophores. Dust source was an important source of atmospheric chromophores, which was susceptible to long-range incoming air masses from northwestern regions in spring. However, the chromophores from the dust source were easily removed by wet precipitation, which was the same as the chromophores from the combustion source. The chromophores from the combustion source were susceptible to human activities. The contribution of combustion source to atmospheric chromophores was reduced due to the implementation of air pollution control policies during the Chinese Spring Festival. In summer, the formation of photochemical secondary chromophores was more significant than in other seasons, and the photochemical secondary chromophores increased due to the formation of liquid phase reactions under high relative humidity conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chromophores; EEMs; PARAFAC; Pollution characteristics; Source apportionment","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Atmospheric humidity; Climate change; Combustion; Dust; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Photochemical reactions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; EEMs; Excitation emission matrices; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); High relative humidities; PARAFAC; Parallel factor analysis; Source apportionment; Chromophores; organic carbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; chemical compound; dust; factor analysis; fluorescence spectroscopy; organic carbon; particulate matter; seasonal variation; source apportionment; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; chromatophore; combustion; concentration (parameter); environmental policy; particulate matter; precipitation; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; summer; trend study; winter; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082967114

This paper conducted a meticulous analysis of two active and passive solar stills at different altitudes (Tochal: 3964 m and Tehran: 1171 m) during seven consecutive days between 24.07.2018 and 30.07.2018. The geometry of solar stills in both experiments is similar and for active type, the system utilized with thermoelectric (Peltier) modules and powered by a photovoltaic panel. Results revealed that altitude has a direct effect on the exergy of solar stills where the summit-located solar stills (passive and active) have higher exergy efficiency. Furthermore, higher evaporative exergy is obtained by both active solar stills at the Peak of Tochal Mountain and the center of Tehran. Likewise, heat transfer analysis showed that the highest and lowest heat transfer coefficients are obtained by active solar still at the Peak of Tochal Mountain and passive solar still in Tehran respectively. However, due to the higher glass temperature, the highest radiative heat transfer coefficients are obtained by Tehran-located systems. Economic results showed that the highest and lowest cost of water with 0.0079 and 0.0372 $/L are assessed by passive solar still in Tehran and active solar still at the Peak of Tochal Mountain respectively. Energy-matrices indicated that the lowest and highest energy payback time based on energy and exergy with 1.57 and 52.75 years attained by passive solar still in Tehran.

However, China's renewable energy technologies are still diffusing slowly. Based on the two-part model and the fixed-effect Tobit model, this paper investigates the factors affecting the diffusion of renewable energy technologies in 28 provinces in China between 2006 and 2017 from the perspective of an innovation system. It is found that increasing the renewable energy tariff surcharge subsidy, the share of relevant employees, and grid density will drive the diffusion of renewable energy technologies. Reducing the share of coal consumption will increase the probability of adoption of renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, a certain province's or other provinces’ renewable energy technology patent stocks both provide the knowledge infrastructure for the increase in the share of renewable energy generation. In contrast, the crowding-out effect of foreign direct investment will hinder the expansion of renewable energy generation share. Therefore, the failures in the six aspects of institutional design, market structure, personnel factor, external interaction, knowledge infrastructure, and physical infrastructure, will lead to the slow diffusion of renewable energy technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fixed-effect Tobit model; Innovation system; Renewable energy technologies; Technological diffusion; Two-part model","Diffusion; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy security; Patents and inventions; Personnel; Renewable energy resources; Emission reduction targets; Fixed effects; Foreign direct investments; Innovation system; Institutional design; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy technologies; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082532683

The process of crushing rocks to produce aggregates can also cause environmental damage since it generates stone powder, which is disposed of in the environment as waste material. Therefore, replacing cement with stone powder to reduce CO2 emissions during concrete production is an attractive alternative to sustainability. The use of high-strength concrete (HSC) appears to be another alternative since higher compressive strength results in lower CO2 emissions per MPa. In this context, the objective of the present work is to design a low-cement HSC via the partial replacement of Portland cement with stone powder and silica fume optimized using particle packing methods. The design approach selected consists of first designing the paste, followed by the design of the granular skeleton. Concretes were produced by varying the paste contents from 27 to 37% and the water/fines (w/f) ratio from 0.28 to 0.40. The efficiency of the HSCs was measured in the context of sustainability in terms of cement consumption and CO2 emissions, in addition to the properties of the fresh and hardened states. Results show that the most efficient composition of the paste was 64% Portland cement, 16% silica fume and 20% stone powder. The aggregate composition of 47% limestone sand, 30% gravel with a maximum particle size of 9.5 mm and 23% gravel with a maximum particle size of 19 mm presented the lowest void index. Respecting these material proportions, some concretes were designed with a compressive strength of 104 MPa using only 288 kg/m3 of cement. This represents a consumption of only 2.8 kg of cement/MPa of concrete compressive strength, which is less than the consumption reported by the literature for HSC (∼5 kg/m3/MPa) and results in a CO2 emissions/MPa reduction of over 44% in relation to concrete produced using mix design methods described in the literature. Furthermore, all of the low-cement HSC studied here presented high workability, excellent quality (according to the ultrasonic pulse velocities (above 4500 m/s)) and insignificant corrosion risk (based on the electrical resistivity test (higher than 100 KΩcm)). These findings contribute to the production of sustainable concretes since waste material can be used while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","High-strength concrete; Low-cement concrete; Particle packing; Stone powder; Sustainability","Aggregates; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Compressive strength; Concrete industry; Concrete mixtures; Concrete products; Corrosion; Design; Gas emissions; Gravel; Greenhouse gases; Lime; Particle size; Portland cement; Powders; Silica fume; Sustainable development; Concrete compressive strength; Electrical resistivity tests; High strength concretes; Low-cement concrete; Particle packings; Stone powders; Sustainable concretes; Ultrasonic pulse velocity; High performance concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082523348

In this study, the proposed statistical methods were applied to evaluate the impacts of Typhoon Meranti on climate change risk perception of undergraduates from Xiamen University, China. It is found that both the evaluation on personal efforts and domestic community efforts on climate change mitigation were significantly affected by the Typhoon Meranti, while the public risk perception structure of climate change did not change significantly after the typhoon. Meanwhile, disciplinary background, teaching contents and the location of hometown are main influential factors on interviewees’ risk perception of climate change. The results indicated that the transformation of public risk perception is a long-term process, education can be an effective approach to promote public's concern and comprehension on climate change.

Using the contingent valuation method, a sample of 427 respondents were asked about their willingness to pay for the air pollution reductions associated to a scenario of gradual introduction of hybrid electric buses in Valencia, Spain. Results show that 67% of the respondents are willing to pay extra for the adoption of this electric hybrid technology, being the mean willingness to pay € 0.33 per single bus fare. This would imply a 22% hypothetical increase in current bus fares and shows that public acceptance is critical for the successful introduction of these new low-emissions vehicles. Further, this paper differs from previous research in that it addresses the issue of heterogeneity among respondents. Thus, using latent class analysis, based on questions about environmental concerns, we identify three different classes of respondents: high, medium and low environmentally concerned. Mean willingness to pay for each class ranges from €0.25 to €0.38. Then we analyze willingness to pay determinants through the estimation of a Tobit model for each class of respondents. This reaffirms the existence of heterogeneity and accordingly suggests that treating the population as a single homogeneous group of respondents, as is common in the existing literature, may lead to biased parameter estimates and flawed decision-making regarding climate change action. © 2020","Contingent valuation method; Heterogeneity; Hybrid electric buses; Latent class analysis; Tobit model; Willingness to pay","Climate change; Decision making; Hybrid vehicles; Urban transportation; Contingent valuation methods; Heterogeneity; Hybrid electric bus; Latent class analysis; Willingness to pay; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082118113

In addition, forest conservation management, i.e., fire and DPR control, and reductions in wood production could increase C sequestration and reduce emissions. However, the offsets or promotion effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets resulting from these factors on forest biomass C sinks remain unknown in China. Using the carbon accounting and net mitigation of forest (CANM-Forest) methodology, we assessed the GHG budgets of disturbances and conservation management in China from 2000 to 2014. The objective of our study was to determine the main emissions factors, analyze the effective mitigation strategies, and clarify the offsets or promotion of these activities in relation to the Chinese forest biomass C sink. The results indicated that disturbances released 64.9 Tg Ce yr−1 and offset 32.1% of the forest biomass C sink, which was estimated based on national forest resource inventories. Harvesting was a major contributor to national GHG emissions, while the main driving factor of regional GHG emissions varied. Furthermore, conservation management significantly mitigated 27.3 Tg Ce yr−1 emissions and enhanced the net biomass C sink by 24.3%, indicated that 24.3% of the Chinese forest's biomass C sink was attributed to conservation management. Fire control dominated promotion effects in the national forests, and the main enhanced factor of the regional forest's biomass C sink varied. Proper forest conservation management should be implemented in accordance with the specific conditions of regional forests to increase contributions to GHG mitigation. Our study provided a forest C accounting for China and indicated that simulations of natural and human disturbances, together with forest management, could provide insights into mitigation options and sustainable forest management for policymakers. © 2020","Biomass carbon sink; Conservation management; Diseases pests and rats; Fire; Forest ecosystem; Harvesting","Biomass; Budget control; Carbon; Conservation; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Emission control; Fires; Harvesting; Rats; Carbon sink; Conservation management; Disturbance factors; Forest conservation; Forest ecosystem; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Mitigation strategy; Sustainable forest management; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081974841

Some aspects of use of gasification products of organic-containing wastes and landfill gas are considered. The presented comparison shows that landfill and generator gases can be attributed to the group of medium-calorific gases used both as boiler fuel and for production of liquid synthetic fuels. It should also be noted that generator and landfill gases contain a significant proportion of inert gases (from 22% to 60%), which is significantly higher than that of natural gases. Inert gases in landfill and generator gases are different. In the first case it is CO2, in the second it is N2. Unlike solid fuel boilers, in a boiler designed to burn gaseous fuels (natural gas), synthetic gases can also be burned without significant additional reconstruction. Due to the difference in gas calorific value, the ratio of fuel to air (with a constant coefficient of excess air α) will change to obtain the necessary thermal power, however, the volume of flue gases will differ slightly. Therefore, the flow sections of the boiler furnace can be saved. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Biogas; Boilers; Calorific value; Electric generators; Inert gases; Land fill; Natural gas; Boiler furnaces; Constant coefficients; Energy generations; Gas calorific values; Gasification products; Solid fuel boilers; Thermal energy generation; Thermal power; Synthetic fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089506724

Concrete was produced by replacing NRS with 22% upto 100% of NWS consists of particle sizes of 5 to 1800 μm, simultaneously combined with binding materials like fly ash (20, 30 and 40%) and silica fume (5 to 15%) as a substitute for cement in mixtures containing Dramix® 3D steel fiber 65/35 at 100kg/m3, and water curing temperature variation ranging follow ambient temperature from 28-34°C. The results indicated that the NRS was replaced with 100% NWS of 5...1800 μm fraction by weight of NRS, in UHPC containing 20% of fly ash combined with silica fume at the replacement levels of 5 to 15% contributed to improved mechanical properties. Detailed, compressive strength of UHPC obtained values 122, 128, 117, 115.3, and 118.5 MPa respectively. Similar results were also observed for the splitting tensile strength attained at 11.6, 11.9, 11.5, 10.5, 10.2 MPa, respectively, while flexural strength values range between 18.8 to 25.4 MPa. These values higher than compared to that of the NRS reference specimens without containing NWS at 28 days of curing. The achieved experimental results demonstrated that the addition of locally available NWS can be a good substitute for NRS, and therefore, can be effectively used in construction activities, which in turn reduces the depletion on the NRS resources. Furthermore, utilization of by-product materials reduces the carbon footprint of cementitious composites production as well as environmental pollution concerns. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089146714

The new biometeorology module is comprised of methods for the calculation of UV-exposure quantities, a human-biometeorologically weighted mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), as well as for the estimation of human thermal comfort or stress. The latter is achieved through the implementation of the three widely used thermal indices: Perceived temperature (PT), Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), as well as physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). Comparison calculations were performed for the PT, UTCI and PET indices based on the SkyHelios model and showing PALM calculates higher values in general. This is mostly due to a higher radiational gain leading to higher values of mean radiant temperature. For a more direct comparison, the PT, PET and UTCI indices were calculated by the biometeorology module, as well as the programs provided by the attachment to Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI) guideline 3787, as well as by the RayMan model based on the very same input dataset. Results show deviations below the relevant precision of 0.1K for PET and UTCI and some deviations of up to 2.683K for PT caused by repeated unfavorable rounding in very rare cases (0.027%). © 2020 Author(s).",,"climate change; climate modeling; comparative study; data set; large eddy simulation; numerical model; precision; project assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088915086

ERW also has possible co-benefits for improved food and soil security, and reduced ocean acidification2–4. Here we use an integrated performance modelling approach to make an initial techno-economic assessment for 2050, quantifying how CDR potential and costs vary among nations in relation to business-as-usual energy policies and policies consistent with limiting future warming to 2 degrees Celsius5. China, India, the USA and Brazil have great potential to help achieve average global CDR goals of 0.5 to 2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year with extraction costs of approximately US$80–180 per tonne of CO2. These goals and costs are robust, regardless of future energy policies. Deployment within existing croplands offers opportunities to align agriculture and climate policy. However, success will depend upon overcoming political and social inertia to develop regulatory and incentive frameworks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of ERW deployment, including the potential for excess industrial silicate materials (basalt mine overburden, concrete, and iron and steel slag) to obviate the need for new mining, as well as uncertainties in soil weathering rates and land–ocean transfer of weathered products. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon dioxide; silicate; basalt; carbon dioxide; iron; steel; agricultural land; atmospheric gas; carbon dioxide; economic analysis; energy policy; environmental policy; land-sea interaction; silicate mineral; weathering; Article; biogeochemical cycle; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; climate warming; cropland; enhanced rock weathering; environmental parameters; mathematical model; mineral mass balance; pollution transport; priority journal; rock; waste component removal; weathering; agriculture; atmosphere; Brazil; chemistry; China; crop; economics; environmental policy; greenhouse effect; India; isolation and purification; legislation and jurisprudence; mining; motivation; politics; prevention and control; probability; sediment; temperature; time factor; United States; Brazil; China; India; United States; Agriculture; Atmosphere; Brazil; Carbon Dioxide; China; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Policy; Geologic Sediments; Global Warming; Goals; India; Iron; Mining; Politics; Probability; Silicates; Steel; Temperature; Time Factors; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087720319

The unfeasibility of local concentration measurements and the limited applicability of simulations to practical systems hinder more precise guidelines. Here, we quantify the impact of the (electro)chemical environment on the selectivity pattern by using microstructured copper (Cu) electrodes prepared by ultra-short pulse laser ablation. We created regularly distributed micro-probes and assessed their product distributions at distinct overpotentials. The regular geometry enabled the accurate simulation of the local pH and CO2 concentration. Selectivity maps useful for mechanistic and applied studies emerged. They revealed clear patterns for C1–C3 products, suggesting novel insights, such as the presence of two reaction mechanisms for propanol. The effect on the selectivity pattern of operating parameters, such as enhanced mass transport and electrolyte composition, was also predicted by the maps. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.It is of utmost importance to convert CO2 into useful compounds to close the carbon cycle. Through electroreduction, value-added compounds can be obtained when using a copper (Cu)-based catalyst, albeit with limited control on the product distribution. Currently, we know qualitatively that the latter is largely influenced by the environment next to the electrode surface, but a deeper understanding of this effect is necessary for transforming it into an effective design tool for material and process optimization. By combining experiments and simulations on laser-microstructured Cu electrodes with defined geometries, we quantified the effect of the (electro)chemical environment on the product distribution, generating selectivity maps that accurately predict the influence of key operating conditions. Our study thus provides a powerful tool for engineering devices for the distributed production of fuels and chemicals as it is of direct application in the so-called artificial leaves. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.The local (electro)chemical environment largely influences the selectivity toward, for example, olefins or alcohols in the electroreduction of CO2 over copper (Cu)-based catalysts. However, this factor is mostly qualitatively understood. Here, by combining catalytic results from a set of laser-microstructured Cu electrodes with defined geometries and accurate modeling including bulk and local effects, we map the effect of local pH and CO2 concentration for the main products. We also show how our results are useful for device engineering. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 reduction; electrocatalysis; laser ablation; local electrochemical environment; microfabrication; oxide-derived Cu; reaction mechanism; SDG12: Responsible consumption and production; SDG13: Climate action; selectivity patterns",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087397993

In addition to providing services of nature this theory includes supporting, regulating and social or cultural services. This approach provoked further adjustment of the state regulation system in the way of developing the market of ecosystem services, considering the full range of services provided by nature to society, for the organization of a transparent mechanism for the use of natural resources and ecosystem services. However, to date, in the Russian Federation this approach has not received legislation support, but the academic community is actively working on this aspect and even suggests adding the value of ecosystem services in the methodology for assessing the national wealth. The economic assessment of real and potential damages from ecosystems' degradation using the theory of ecosystem services becomes extremely important for the development of an algorithm for optimal natural resource management at various levels of state regulation.

In Longyearbyen, Svalbard, the world’s northernmost city, deadly avalanches and permafrost thaw-induced architectural destruction has disrupted local governance norms and responsibilities. In the North Atlantic, the warming ocean temperatures have contributed to a rapid expansion of the mackerel stock which has spurred both geo-political tensions but also tensions at the science-policy interface of fish quota setting. These local climate-induced changes have created a domino-like chain reaction that intensifies through time as a warming Arctic penetrates deeper into responsibilities of governing institutions and science institutions. In face with the increasing uncertain futures of climate-induced changes, policy choices also increase revealing a type of “snowballing” of possible futures facing decision-makers. We introduce a portmanteau-inspired concept called “The Melting Snowball Effect” that encompasses the chain reaction (“domino effect”) that increases the number of plausible scenarios (“snowball effect”) with climate change (melting snow, ice and thawing permafrost). We demonstrate the use of “The Melting Snowball Effect” as a heuristic within a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework of anticipation, engagement and reflection. To do this, we developed plausible scenarios based on participatory stakeholder workshops and narratives from in-depth interviews for deliberative discussions among academics, citizens and policymakers, designed for informed decision-making in response to climate change complexities. We observe generational differences in discussing future climate scenarios, particularly that the mixed group where three generations were represented had the most diverse and thorough deliberations. © Copyright © 2020 Dankel, Tiller, Koelma, Lam and Liu.","Arctic; climate change; geopolitics; governance; responsible research and innovation; social sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088461068

The main focus is on the following question: can the nonlinear processes intrinsic to atmospheric physics, including natural positive feedback mechanisms, cause a mathematical bifurcation of the climate state, as a consequence of continued anthropogenic forcing by rising greenhouse gas emissions? Our analysis shows that such a bifurcation could cause an abrupt change to a drastically different climate state in the EBM, which is warmer and more equable than any climate existing on Earth since the Pliocene epoch. In previous papers, with this EBM adapted to paleoclimate conditions, it was shown to exhibit saddle-node and cusp bifurcations, as well as hysteresis. The EBM was validated by the agreement of its predicted bifurcations with the abrupt climate changes that are known to have occurred in the paleoclimate record, in the Antarctic at the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) and in the Arctic at the Pliocene-Paleocene transition (PPT). In this paper, the EBM is adapted to fit Anthropocene climate conditions, with emphasis on the Arctic and Antarctic climates. The four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) considered by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) are used to model future <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> concentrations, corresponding to different scenarios of anthropogenic activity. In addition, the EBM investigates four naturally occurring nonlinear feedback processes which magnify the warming that would be caused by anthropogenic <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> emissions alone. These four feedback mechanisms are ice-albedo feedback, water vapour feedback, ocean heat transport feedback, and atmospheric heat transport feedback. The EBM predicts that a bifurcation resulting in a catastrophic climate change, to a pre-Pliocene-like climate state, will occur in coming centuries for an RCP with unabated anthropogenic forcing, amplified by these positive feedbacks. However, the EBM also predicts that appropriate reductions in carbon emissions may limit climate change to a more tolerable continuation of what is observed today. The globally averaged version of this EBM has an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 4.34 K, near the high end of the likely range reported by the IPCC. © Author(s) 2020.

This effect has been shown to be photonic rather than thermal, but the exact plasmonic mechanism is unknown. Here, we conduct an in situ ATR-SEIRAS (attenuated total reflectance-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy) study of a sputtered thin film Ag cathode on a Ge ATR crystal in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 over a range of potentials under both dark and illuminated (365 nm, 125 mW cm-2) conditions to elucidate the nature of this plasmonic enhancement. We find that the onset potential of CO2 reduction to adsorbed CO on the Ag surface is -0.25 VRHE and is identical in the light and the dark. As the production of gaseous CO is detected in the light near this onset potential but is not observed in the dark until -0.5 VRHE, we conclude that the light must be assisting the desorption of CO from the surface. Furthermore, the HCO3- wavenumber and peak area increase immediately upon illumination, precluding a thermal effect.

The Kopi Luhur Dumpsite has 9 hectares area that implements an open dumping system that may cause the spread of flies and rat vectors, release unpleasant odors, and reduce environmental aesthetics. Also, the Kopi Luhur Dumpsite has inadequate leachate treatment plant and methane gas control system. The aim of this study was to assess environmental risk due to dumping activities at the Kopi Luhur Dumpsite using IRBA (Integrated Risk-Based Approach). IRBA examines 27 parameters under three classes, namely, site-specific criteria, waste characteristics at the dumpsite, and those related to the quality of leachate from the dumpsite. Data were obtained through mapping in the field, interviews with managers and communities surround and testing samples in the laboratory. The research results showed that the Kopi Luhur dumpsite has corresponded to moderate hazard level with a total risk index score 575.3536. Therefore, the recommendation actions are immediate rehabilitation of the dumpsite into sustainable landfill. © 2020 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088271496

Here, by using comprehensive ab initio computations, we discover two new iron monocarbide (FeC) binary sheets stabilized at 2D confined space, labeled as tetragonal-FeC (t-FeC) and orthorhombic-FeC (o-FeC), which are energetically more favorable compared with the previously reported square and honeycomb lattices. The proposed t-FeC is the global minimum configuration in the 2D space, and each carbon atom is four-coordinated with four ambient iron atoms, considered as the quasi-planar tetragonal lattice. Strikingly, the o-FeC monolayer is an orthorhombic phase with a perfectly planar pentacoordinate carbon moiety and a planar seven-coordinate iron moiety. These monolayers are the first example of a simultaneously pentacoordinate carbon and planar seven-coordinate Fe-containing material. State-of-the-art theoretical calculations confirm that all these monolayers have significantly dynamic, mechanical, and thermal stabilities. Among these two monolayers, the t-FeC monolayer shows a higher theoretical capacity (395 mAh g-1) and can stably adsorb Li up to t-FeCLi4 (1579 mAh g-1). The low migration energy barrier is predicted as small as 0.26 eV for Li, which results in the fast diffusion of Li atoms on this monolayer, making it a promising candidate for lithium-ion battery material.

Here, we propose to marriage the laser-induced ultrafast magnetism and nanophotonics to efficiently excite and control spin dynamics in magnetic dielectric structures. We demonstrate that nanopatterning by a 1D grating of trenches allows localization of light in spots with sizes of tens of nanometers and thus launch the exchange standing spin waves of different orders. The relative amplitude of the exchange and magnetostatic spin waves can be adjusted on demand by modifying laser pulse polarization, incidence angle, and wavelength.

However, only nodal flat-surface and nodal sphere TSMs are theoretically proposed due to strict symmetry requirements. Here, we propose that a series of surface-based topological phases can be realized in a tight-binding (TB) model with sublattice symmetry. These topological phases, named as nodal flexible-surface semimetals, include not only nodal surface and nodal sphere TSMs but also novel phases, like nodal tube, nodal crossbar, and nodal hourglass-like surface TSMs. According to the TB model, a family of carbon nanotube networks are then identified as nodal flexible-surface TSMs by first-principles calculations, and the topological phase transitions between these TSMs can be induced by strains. Moreover, the nodal flexible-surface TSMs with intrinsic high density of states at the Fermi level and special drumhead surface states are promising for studying high-temperature superconductors and strong correlation effects. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","carbon networks; first-principles calculations; nodal sphere; nodal surface; Topological semimetals","Calculations; Carbon nanotubes; High temperature superconductors; Carbon nanotube network; First-principles calculation; Flexible surfaces; Strong correlation effect; Sublattice symmetry; Tight binding model; Topological phase; Topological phasis; Topology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088208920

However, these materials are prone to photooxidation that reduces the emission quantum yield over time. Current commercial applications use device architectures to prevent oxidation without addressing the underlying degradation reactions at the nanocrystal level. To instead prevent loss of functionality by better synthetic engineering of the nanoscale emitters themselves, the underlying properties of these reactions must be understood and readily accessible. Here, we use solid-state spectroscopy to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of photothermal degradation in single QDs by systematically varying the ambient temperature and photon pump fluence. We describe the resulting degradation in emission with a modified form of the Arrhenius equation and show that this reaction proceeds via pseudo-zero-order reaction kinetics by a surface-assisted process with an activation energy of 60 kJ/mol. We note that the rate of degradation is â12 orders of magnitude slower than the rate of excitonic processes, indicating that the reaction rate is not determined by electron or hole trapping. In the search for new robust light-emitting nanocrystals, the reported analysis method will enable direct comparisons between differently engineered nanomaterials.

Up until now, studies have primarily focused on applying carbon nanotubes to membranes to achieve ultrafast mass transport. Here, we report the first preparation of silicon nanotube (SiNT) membranes via a template-assisted method and investigate the gas transport behavior through these SiNT membranes using single- and mixed-gas permeation experiments. The SiNT membranes consist of conical cylinder-shaped nanotubes vertically aligned on a porous silicon wafer substrate. The diameter of the SiNT pore mouths are 10 and 30 nm, and the average inner diameter of the tube body is 80 nm. Interestingly, among the gases tested, we found an unprecedentedly low CO2 permeance through the SiNT membranes in single-gas permeation experiments, exceeding the theoretical Knudsen selectivity toward small gases/CO2 separation. This behavior was caused by the reduction of CO2 permeability through the blocking effect of CO2 adsorbed in the narrow pore channels of the SiNT cone regions, indicating that CO2 molecules have a high affinity to the native silicon oxide layer (∼2 nm) that is formed on the inner walls of SiNTs. SiNT membranes also exhibited enhanced gas permeance and water flux as compared to classic theoretical models and, as such, may prove useful as a new type of nanotube material for use in membrane applications. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Gas permeation; H2/CO2separation; Nanopore; Silicone nanotube membrane","Carbon dioxide; Gases; Nanotubes; Permeation; Porous silicon; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Silicon wafers; Conical cylinders; Gas separations; Mixed gas permeation; Nanotube membranes; Silicon nanotubes; Silicon oxide layers; Silicon wafer substrates; Vertically aligned; Gas permeable membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088208782

In addition to economic factors, operators should also take environmental aspects into account when purchasing new vehicles. In this case, a useful criterion for selecting a vehicle is the Life Cycle Cost (LCC), which, in addition to the cost of purchasing a bus, takes into account the necessary expenses associated with its maintenance, operation, decommissioning, as well as emissions costs. This paper presents a study of the LCC values, estimated for the entire bus fleet based on several bus replacement variants, taking into account different shares of alternative buses in the transport fleet. Analyses have shown that replacing conventional buses by the compressed natural gas (CNG) powered buses will reduce life cycle cost by 27% compared to the LCC level in 2019. Increasing the share of electric buses in the fleet will significantly reduce the level of emissions of harmful substances contained in exhaust gases. © 2 0 2 0 U N I V E R S I T Y O F Z I L I N A","Alternative drive; City bus; LCC",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088090419

A variety of strategies have been proposed in the literature, including the selection of activator ions with characteristic electron configurations, the modification of the local crystal field, and the design of an emissive center pair and energy transfer. Eu2+-activated haloapatites are considered as candidates for phosphor converted light emitting devices due to their excellent stabilities, easy preparation, and high efficiency. In this work, single-phased, single-doped (Ba,Sr)5(PO4)3Br:Eu2+ is selected and multiple approaches are applied, leading to multicolor tunabilities of the phosphors, including a crystal field strength controlled spectral shift, occupancy selectivity induced spectral saltation, defect-driven color tunability, and irradiation dependent dynamic chromaticity. In the high Eu2+ concentration doped Ba5-mSrm(PO4)3Br phosphor, the main emission band shifts from 448 to 452 nm with increasing Sr2+/Ba2+ ratio, and a second emission band around the green region uplifts in the binary metal solid solution phosphors, leading to variable emission colors from blue to cyan under near UV excitation. Moreover, oxygen vacancy (VO) defects formed under synthetic reducing conditions endow the bromoapatites with bright self-activated luminescence. In the low Eu2+ concentration doped Ba2Sr3(PO4)3Br, the combination of the broad yellow-green emission from VO and bluish emission from Eu2+ contributes to a full spectrum feature. The gradual increase of Eu2+ concentrations regulates the tunable emission from yellow-green, through white, to blue under short UV excitation. Furthermore, due to the different absorption preferences of these two centers, Ba2Sr3(PO4)3Br:0.01Eu2+ shows white light emission under 254 nm irradiation while blue emission when exposed to 365 nm irradiation. The materials with multicolor luminescence show promising versatile applications in lighting, biological detection and anti-counterfeiting. The cooperative effects of multiple strategies provide a promising approach to regulate the optical properties of inorganic phosphors.

Alloy catalysts with dissimilar local metal atoms induce geometric and electronic effects that may greatly contribute to their performance. However, the fundamental mechanisms for CO2 reduction on a bimetallic Au alloy surface are still ambiguous. Here, we report effective CO2 reduction by the synergies between electronic and geometric effects of Mo-doped Au nanoparticles (MDA NPs). A 97.5% CO faradaic efficiency and 75-fold higher current density than pure Au nanoparticles were achieved at -0.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for MDA NPs with at least 50 h lifetime. Our experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the Au surface with increased electron density from Mo can effectively enhance CO2 activation. Moreover, the intermediate ∗COOH may be further stabilized by the local Mo atom through additional Mo-O binding to decrease the energy barrier. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Electrolytic reduction; Environmental technology; Geometry; Gold alloys; Gold nanoparticles; Molybdenum; Nanoparticles; Au nanoparticle; Electro reduction; Electronic effects; Faradaic efficiencies; Fundamental mechanisms; Geometric effects; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Theoretical calculations; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090503916

To this end, Obs4MIPs (1) targets observed variables that can be compared to CMIP model variables; (2) utilizes dataset formatting specifications and metadata requirements closely aligned with CMIP model output; (3) provides brief technical documentation for each dataset, designed for nonexperts and tailored towards relevance for model evaluation, including information on uncertainty, dataset merits, and limitations; and (4) disseminates the data through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) platforms, making the observations searchable and accessible via the same portals as the model output. Taken together, these characteristics of the organization and structure of obs4MIPs should entice a more diverse community of researchers to engage in the comparison of model output with observations and to contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation of the climate models.</p> <span idCombining double low line""page2946""/>At present, the number of obs4MIPs datasets has grown to about 80; many are undergoing updates, with another 20 or so in preparation, and more than 100 are proposed and under consideration.

Climate change is predominantly contributed by human activities and it presents a serious threat to nature and people. Greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide trap heat in the atmosphere and regulate climate. In addition, rapid urbanization and industrialization add more greenhouse gases to atmosphere and increase overall global temperature and further change the weather patterns. The unexpected weather conditions in Chennai has gained wide attention, especially after 2015 flood, Vardah and Ocki cyclones. In this study, the possible impact of climate change on rainfall over Chennai city is analysed under various Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Simulations of a Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Regional Climate Model (RCM) is downscaled using change factor method. The study results show that the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall over Chennai is likely to increase. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Flood control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Rain; Storms; Change factor methods; Environmental studies; Global temperatures; Global warming and climate changes; Human activities; Rapid urbanizations; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Weather patterns; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088531801

Especially shallow zones near land have been shown to be the main source for oceanic methane (CH4) emissions. Water depth has been predicted as the best explanatory variable, which is related to CH4 ebullition, but exactly how sediment methanotrophs mediates these emissions along water depth is unknown. Here, we investigated the relative abundance and RNA transcripts attributed to methane oxidation proteins of aerobic methanotrophs in the sediment of shallow coastal zones with high CH4 concentrations within a depth gradient from 10–45 m. Field sampling consisted of collecting sediment (top 0–2 cm layer) from eight stations along this depth gradient in the coastal Baltic Sea. The relative abundance and RNA transcripts attributed to the CH4 oxidizing protein (pMMO; particulate methane monooxygenase) of the dominant methanotroph Methylococcales was significantly higher in deeper costal offshore areas (36–45 m water depth) compared to adjacent shallow zones (10–28 m). This was in accordance with the shallow zones having higher CH4 concentrations in the surface water, as well as more CH4 seeps from the sediment. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the low prevalence of Methylococcales and RNA transcripts attributed to pMMO was restrained to the euphotic zone (indicated by Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data, photosynthesis proteins, and 18S rRNA data of benthic diatoms). This was also indicated by a positive relationship between water depth and the relative abundance of Methylococcales and pMMO. How these processes are affected by light availability requires further studies. CH4 ebullition potentially bypasses aerobic methanotrophs in shallow coastal areas, reducing CH4 availability and limiting their growth. Such mechanism could help explain their reduced relative abundance and related RNA transcripts for pMMO. These findings can partly explain the difference in CH4 concentrations between shallow and deep coastal areas, and the relationship between CH4 concentrations and water depth. © Copyright © 2020 Broman, Sun, Stranne, Salgado, Bonaglia, Geibel, Jakobsson, Norkko, Humborg and Nascimento.","coast; DNA; ebullition; marine; methane; methanotroph; RNA; sediment","ammonia; carbon; genomic DNA; messenger RNA; methane; methane monooxygenase; RNA 16S; surface water; unspecific monooxygenase; Article; Baltic Sea; carbon footprint; coastal waters; community structure; diatom; DNA extraction; Gammaproteobacteria; gene expression; gene sequence; marine environment; metagenomics; methanogenesis; methanotroph; Methylococcales; microbial community; microbial diversity; microorganism; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; photosynthesis; phylogeny; prevalence; quality control; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; sea; sea surface temperature; sediment; sequence analysis; taxonomy; Verrucomicrobia; waste water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088481731

Coastal wetlands are complex social-ecological systems that occur at all latitudes, from polar regions to the tropics. This overview covers wetlands in five continents. The wetlands are of varying size, catchment size, human population and stages of economic development. Economic sectors and activities in and around the coastal wetlands and their catchments exert multiple, direct pressures. These pressures affect the state of the wetland environment, ecology and valuable ecosystem services. All the coastal wetlands were found to be affected in some ways, irrespective of the conservation status. The main economic sectors were agriculture, animal rearing including aquaculture, fisheries, tourism, urbanization, shipping, industrial development and mining. Specific human activities include land reclamation, damming, draining and water extraction, construction of ponds for aquaculture and salt extraction, construction of ports and marinas, dredging, discharge of effluents from urban and industrial areas and logging, in the case of mangroves, subsistence hunting and oil and gas extraction. The main pressures were loss of wetland habitat, changes in connectivity affecting hydrology and sedimentology, as well as contamination and pollution. These pressures lead to changes in environmental state, such as erosion, subsidence and hypoxia that threaten the sustainability of the wetlands. There are also changes in the state of the ecology, such as loss of saltmarsh plants and seagrasses, and mangrove trees, in tropical wetlands. Changes in the structure and function of the wetland ecosystems affect ecosystem services that are often underestimated. The loss of ecosystem services impacts human welfare as well as the regulation of climate change by coastal wetlands. These cumulative impacts and multi-stressors are further aggravated by indirect pressures, such as sea-level rise. © Copyright © 2020 Newton, Icely, Cristina, Perillo, Turner, Ashan, Cragg, Luo, Tu, Li, Zhang, Ramesh, Forbes, Solidoro, Béjaoui, Gao, Pastres, Kelsey, Taillie, Nhan, Brito, de Lima and Kuenzer.","climate change; coastal wetland; mangrove; pressure; salt marsh; seagrass; state and impact on human welfare; sustainability",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088478168

The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) is the largest hydraulic engineering project in the world. We present a direct, ecosystem-scale demonstration of changes in the soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the TGD watershed before and after the surface water was reshaped. The average SOC content decreased from 12.9 to 9.5 g/kg between 2004 and 2012 and then recovered to 13.8 g/kg in 2017. Dynamics of SOC were partly attributed to shifts in the composition of soil microbial communities responsible for carbon biogeochemistry. The shifts in microbial taxa were associated with the changed microclimate affected by the TGD as well as global and regional climate variability. The microclimate, soil microorganisms, and plant organic carbon input explained 40.2% of the variation in the SOC content. This study revealed that dam construction was an important and indirect driver for the SOC turnover, and the subsequent effects on the upland soil ecosystem must be considered when large-scale disturbance activities (such as dam construction) are conducted in the future.

Urea/SCR, selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 generated through urea decomposition, is commonly regarded as the best way to reduce NOx in low temperature lean exhaust. However, the urea/SCR system has inherent drawbacks, i.e., periodic refill of the aqueous urea solution and a complicated hardware system. Here, we demonstrated a state-of-the-art catalyst that is extremely selective and efficient for reducing NOx, primarily with the most abundant reductant, CO, particularly in the presence of O2 (>5%) at low temperature. Under temperatures lower than 250 °C, IrRu/Al2O3 catalysts achieved higher NOx conversion by CO only than a commercial Cu-based urea/SCR catalyst employing NH3 as a primary reductant. Furthermore, the IrRu catalyst revealed high thermal stability and SO2 tolerance, which are very important factors for real world applications.

However, some current studies have cast doubt on the efficacy of such ecological restoration projects, partly due to the constraint of available water in northern China, leading to poor survival rates of planted trees in semiarid regions (15%). In this study, using a logical framework combining statistical analysis, partial least-squares path model analysis, and a regional climate model (RegCM) simulation with multisource dust indicators, we found that there was a reduction of dust in northern China that was synchronous with the increase in vegetation growth after ecological restoration. In contrast to previous reports of a decrease in wind speed due to ecological restoration, this study found that the increase in vegetation had an insignificant impact on local wind speed (p = 0.30). Instead, ecological restoration mainly reduced the sand emission in steppe area by improving the soil conditions of the underlying surface, and hence contributed 15% of the reduction of dust events in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area through dust transmission (p = 0.002). The effect of ecological restoration in the northern steppe on dust reduction over the northeastern metropolitan area of China should not be overstated.

Monitoring this state is therefore important for understanding physiological homeostasis in cells. Various fluorescent sensor proteins have already been developed to monitor intracellular redox state. We also developed fluorescent redox sensor proteins named Oba-Q and Re-Q, the emissions of which are quenched under oxidized and reduced conditions, respectively. Although these sensors were useful to visualize the redox changes in the cell over time, they have the weakness that their emission signals are directly influenced by their in situ expression levels. To overcome this problem, we developed a redox sensor protein with a single excitation peak and dual variable emission peaks. This sensor protein shows green emission under oxidized conditions and blue emission under reduced conditions. We therefore named this sensor FROG/B, fluorescent protein with redox-dependent change in green/blue. By using this sensor, we successfully measured the changes in intracellular redox potentials in cyanobacterial cells quantitatively caused by light/dark transition just by calculating the ratio of emission between green and blue signals. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

This experiment infer the adaptation relationship between plant geographical distribution and climatic conditions. The results show that the plants in Northeast China are generally more adaptable to climate change. The areas with poor adaptability are mainly at the junction of forest shrubs and grasslands. The geographical distribution of plants has changed, accounting for about 5%. The grassland ecosystem in the bush-grassland transition zone in the Greater Xing'an Mountains is also less adaptable to climate, accounting for about 35%. The vegetation in these areas tends to degenerate. The geographical distribution may change. The adjustment of plants in Northeast China to the future climate change is usually reasonable. 84% of the vegetation changes are positive changes. Especially in the eastern regions, the vegetation deduction conditions will be improved in the future, and the vegetation coverage in these regions may be improved. About 79% of the potential changes in vegetation can adapt to the future climate. Nevertheless, the grassland ecosystems in the Greater Xing'an Mountains and parts of Inner Mongolia are less adaptable to future climate change and tend to degrade. It provides new ideas for assessing vegetation adaptability or ecosystem adaptability.

Renewable energy quota is very important for the evaluation of economic benefits and energy conservation and emission reduction benefits. Based on Data Envelopment analysis, this paper establishes a model for evaluating the effectiveness of renewable energy quota system. The model takes the quota constraints of each province as input variables, the total installed capacity of each province and the CO2emission of each province as input variables, and takes the total GDP of each province as output variable, calculates the technical efficiency values of each province under the conditions of taking into account and excluding the quota constraints respectively.

Here we report a first-principles theoretical study on O2 activation and CO oxidation catalyzed by atomically dispersed Pt1/Pt2 anchored on a raised graphene (Gr) platform. The unique sharp-tip structure of the protuberant graphene platform (carbon-tip) can collect extra polarization electrons on the Pt-tip, promoting electron transfer between the catalyst and adsorbates, and greatly enhancing the chemical activity. Higher carbon-tips on defective graphene oxide with a carbon vacancy (Gr-V) produce more polarization electrons, a more localized electric field, and a larger up-shift of the d-orbital center of the Pt-tip, resulting in better catalytic performance. The carbon-tip enhancement reduces the energy barrier for the CO oxidation on Pt1O2/Gr-V from 1.19 eV to 0.56 eV compared with Pt1 on planar Gr. In addition, CO poisoning is significantly alleviated, with the CO poisoning rate G? reduced from 2.00 eV to 0.52 eV. Moreover, a linear relationship between the activation barrier and the binding energy of adsorbates is found for various atomically dispersed Pt-tip catalysts on the raised graphene oxide platform. Importantly, the order of catalytic activity is consistent with the carbon-tip enhancement, i.e., Pt1O2/Gr-V > Pt2O4/Gr-V > Pt1O2/Gr > Pt2O4/Gr. These findings provide important guidance for rational design of atomically dispersed catalysts.

By cross-referencing the results of the physical structure inspections, in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis, we demonstrate that the NiOTPd-T gains an optimum production yield of 1905.1 mmol g-1 of CH4 which is more than 10-fold improved as compared to that of TMOS decorated Pd nanocatalysts (Pd-T) at 573 K. Such an exceptional performance is attributed to the local synergetic collaboration between CO chemisorption on Pd atoms and H2 splitting on both the Pd and Ni atoms at the interface region. Once the collaboration is triggered, the subsequent NiOT reduction increases the number of metallic Ni sites. It further facilitates the H2 splitting, therefore optimizing the CH4 production yield of NiOTPd-T. Most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, with such a unique Pd-to-NiOT epitaxial structure, the NiOTPd-T catalysts exhibit the highest CH4 production yield among existing catalysts with the same loading and composition and of any geometric configuration.

Developing a renewable route to PX is highly desirable to address both economic and environmental concerns. Several attempts used noble metal catalysts, e.g. Pd/Al2O3, to synthesize PX from biomass-derived 4-methyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde (4-MCHCA), but suffered from a severe decarbonylation reaction, resulting in toluene as the main product. In this paper, we report an FeOx modification strategy to suppress the decarbonylation reaction on a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to a drastic shift in selectivity towards PX with a yield up to 81% via a cascade dehydroaromatization-hydrodeoxygenation (DHA-HDO) pathway. Characterization and control experiments revealed that the electron density of Pd sites decreased in an FeOx-modified Pd/Al2O3 catalyst compared to Pd/Al2O3, thus tuning the preferential adsorption mode of the substrate from η2-(C,O), the key transition state of the decarbonylation reaction, to the η1-(O) mode that favors the hydrodeoxygenation process. Notably, this designed catalyst is highly stable and is readily applicable in the selective synthesis of a broad range of desired aromatic chemicals via the same DHA-HDO pathway from cyclohex-3-enecarbaldehyde derivatives. Overall, this work develops a controllable catalyst modification strategy that tailors an efficient catalyst for petroleum-independent bio-PX synthesis. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Gasoline; Iron compounds; Plastic bottles; Precious metals; Xylene; Basic building block; Catalyst modification; Dehydroaromatization; Environmental concerns; Noble metal catalysts; Preferential adsorption; Selective production; Selective synthesis; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087678682

In obtained spectra, emission energies are independent of the applied bias voltage and resemble photoluminescence (PL) results, indicating that, in both cases, the light emission is due to neutral and charged exciton recombination. Interestingly, the electron injection rate, that is, the tunneling current, can be used to control the ratio of charged to neutral exciton emission. The obtained quantum yield in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is ~5 × 10-7 photons per electron. The proposed excitation mechanism is the direct injection of carriers into the conduction band. The monolayer WSe2 presents bright and dark defects spotted by STM images performed under UHV. STS confirms the sample as p-doped, possibly as a net result of the observed defects. The presence of an interfacial water layer decouples the monolayer from the gold support and allows excitonic emission from the WSe2 monolayer. The creation of a water layer is an inherent feature of the sample transferring process due to the ubiquitous air moisture. Consequently, vacuum thermal annealing, which removes the water layer, quenches excitonic luminescence from the TMD. The tunneling current can locally displace water molecules leading to excitonic emission quenching and to plasmonic emission due to the gold substrate. The present findings extend the use and the understanding of STM induced light emission (STM-LE) on semiconducting TMDs to probe exciton emission and dynamics with high spatial resolution. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Charge injection; Defects; Direct injection; Electron tunneling; Excitons; Gold; Gold metallography; Light; Molecules; Monolayers; Phosphorus; Photoluminescence; Semiconductor quantum wells; Substrates; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Tungsten metallography; Excitation mechanisms; Excitonic luminescence; Excitonic properties; High spatial resolution; Transferring process; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Tunneling current-induced; Vacuum thermal annealing; Selenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087472615

The plant response to these stresses consists of different processes to alleviate both cellular hyperosmolarity and ion disequilibrium or to synthesize antioxidant compounds. Cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) is a perennial crop of the Asteraceae family, native to the Mediterranean region, with a high production of biomass and grain, available for green chemistry, and able to grow in stressful environment. The aim of this work was to investigate different cardoon response mechanisms to abiotic stresses. Following this purpose, we evaluated the ability of cardoon seeds to germinate under salt stress condition and on the sprouts obtained we measured the total phenols content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (AA). In addition, the growth of cardoon seedlings under heavy metals (arsenic and cadmium) stress conditions was monitored. Moreover, based on library of cDNA previously constructed from seedlings growth in similar stress condition, the gene Phytochelatin Synthase (PS), associated with abiotic stress tolerance, was isolated. Furthermore, Natural Resistance of Macrophage (NRAMP3), Heavy metal ATPase (HMA), Inorganic Phosphate Transport (PHT), Zinc and Iron Protein (ZIP) genes associated with heavy metal stress were isolated and the levels of gene expression were measured. The results showed the ability of C. cardunculus to tolerate salt and heavy metals stresses, thanks to different defense mechanisms against abiotic stress implemented by cardoon plants. Then, this species can be considered as a promising future crop for green chemistry in marginal lands. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

A large proportion of under-five deaths in SSA and other developing regions have been attributed to undernutrition and poor household environmental conditions. Failure to address nutritional deficit and household environmental pollution in SSA will therefore likely result in many countries not meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.2 target which aims to reduce under-five mortality to less than 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths by 2030. This paper pinpoints the nutritional and environmental threats to child health in SSA, and identify interventions that will work best to improve child survival in countries. It is important to broaden the spectrum of interventions for improving child survival beyond health systems strengthening to enable countries meet the SDG 3.2 target. The following interventions are thus proposed: strengthening child welfare clinics through digital technologies; investment in school feeding programmes; addressing household air pollution; and improving water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in basic schools. There are certainly barriers to effective implementation of the proposed interventions in countries but are surmountable with strong political will and involvement of the private sector.

The addition of 2-ABT alters the balance of the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, resulting in more selective and efficient reduction of CO2 to CO. The 2-ABT adsorbate layer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and modeled by density functional theory calculations. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the 2-ABT modified electrodes suggests that surface Ag atoms are in the +1 oxidation state and coordinated to 2-ABT via Ag−S bonds. Under visible light illumination, the onset potential for CO2 reduction was −50 mV vs. RHE, an anodic shift of about 150 mV relative to a sample without 2-ABT. The adsorption of 2-ABT lowers the overpotentials for both CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution. A comparison of electrodes functionalized with different aromatic thiols and amines suggests that the primary role of the thiol group in 2-ABT is to anchor the NH2 group near the Ag surface, where it serves to bind CO2 and also to assist in proton transfer. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Several innovative technologies have been introduced in the market and many others are under development in order to reduce CO2 emissions during homologation cycles, including real driving emission tests. Among them, great attention has been paid to the waste heat recovery, since it can assure a significant improvement on overall engine efficiency and, so, fuel saving and CO2 emission reduction. A novel opportunity can be represented by directly exploiting the residual pressure and temperature of the flue gases through an Inverted Brayton cycle (IBC), in which the gases are expanded at a pressure below the environmental one, cooled down and then recompressed to the environmental value. The real useful power of an IBC-based recovery unit is strictly related to the behavior of the machines chosen as IBC turbine and compressor (pressure ratio vs. mass flow rate and efficiencies), considering that they run at the same speed, resulted by the equilibrium of a common shaft. Therefore, an experimentally based mathematical model has been developed to evaluate the coupling of an IBC-based recovery unit with a turbocharged diesel engine, operating on a dynamic test bed. In particular, experimental data of the engine have been used as boundary conditions of the IBC group and real operating maps of radial turbine and compressor have been considered. In this way, the actual room of recovery of the unit has been assessed, evaluating also the trade-off produced by backpressure induced on the engine by the IBC-based recovery unit, which hadn't been investigated yet. An overall net efficiency increase close to 3.4% has been demonstrated with respect to the original efficiency of the engine, when operates close to the maximum power. The analysis is concluded evaluating the correct functioning of the after-treatment devices of the engine: sufficiently higher temperature has to be assured to guarantee right pollutants abatement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Backpressure; Engine; Inverted Brayton cycle; Thermal energy recovery; Waste heat recovery","Air quality; Brayton cycle; Carbon dioxide; Deterioration; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Emission control; Fuel economy; Global warming; International law; Recovery; Waste heat; Waste incineration; After treatment devices; CO2 emission reduction; Efficiency increase; Environmental values; Innovative technology; Integrated evaluation; Quality deteriorations; Turbocharged diesel engine; Waste heat utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083563406

We investigated the variability of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), and particulate organic (POC) and inorganic carbon (PIC) in the tidal creeks within the Poaceae and Cyperaceae communities on flood-ebb cycle in a salt marsh of eastern China. In the Poaceae creek with high plant biomass and soil carbon stock, the DOC concentrations were higher by on average 1.00–1.48 times than that in the Cyperaceae creek across all seasons and spring and neap tide stages, while the difference of DIC was not notable. The POC and PIC concentrations were lower in the Poaceae creek compared to the Cyperaceae creek. Spring tides increased the carbon concentrations (except for PIC) in both creeks by on average 7–40%, relative to neap tides. Seasonal variations of sedimentary rate within the communities probably result in the discrepancy of particulate carbon loading between the creeks. The Poaceae creek functioned as a source of DOC and DIC throughout a year but as a sink of POC and PIC in summer and autumn, while it turned to a weak source of PIC in winter and spring. The Cyperaceae creek exhibited as a source of all carbon components throughout a year. We suggest that vegetation type (with soil carbon stocks), tidal regimes and sedimentary dynamics would synergistically determine the fate of carbon in the creeks. Our results are helpful in reliable estimates of carbon transport between the coastal marsh and the adjacent ocean. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon loading; Hydrological regime; Marsh creek; Seasonal variation; Vegetation type","hydrological regime; inorganic carbon; particulate inorganic matter; particulate organic matter; saltmarsh; seasonal variation; soil carbon; tidal cycle; vegetation type; China; Cyperaceae; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082866283

However, the low separation efficiency of charge carriers and deficient reactive sites have severely hampered the efficiency of the photocatalytic CO2 reforming process. Therefore, cocatalysts are usually loaded onto the surface of semiconductor photocatalysts to reduce the recombination of charge carriers and accelerate the rates of surface reactions. Herein, molybdenum (Mo) nanospheres are proposed as a novel non-precious cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic CO2 reforming of g-C3N4 significantly. The Mo nanospheres boost the adsorption of CO2 and activate the surface CO2 via a photothermal effect. The time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra reveals that the lifetime of photo-induced charge carriers is prolonged by the Mo nanospheres, which guarantees the migration of charge carriers from g-C3N4 to Mo nanospheres. Unexpectedly, Mo loaded g-C3N4 can effectively utilize a wide spectral range from UV to near-infrared region (NIR, up to 800 nm). These findings highlight the potential of Mo nanospheres as a novel cocatalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reforming to CH4. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CH4 evolution; Cocatalyst; g-C3N4; Molybdenum nanospheres; Photocatalytic CO2 reforming","Carbon dioxide; Charge carriers; Infrared devices; Nanospheres; Solar energy; Surface reactions; CH4 evolution; CO2 reforming; Cocatalyst; g-C3N4; Photo-induced charge; Semiconductor photocatalyst; Separation efficiency; Time-resolved fluorescence; Molybdenum; carbon; carbon dioxide; graphite; graphitic carbon nitride; hydrocarbon; methane; molybdenum; nanosphere; unclassified drug; adsorption; carbon dioxide; catalyst; methane; molybdenum; nanoparticle; photochemistry; photodegradation; pollutant removal; adsorption; Article; green chemistry; nanocatalyst; photocatalysis; reduction (chemistry); solar energy; surface property; ultraviolet radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080098714

To mitigate against these issues, researchers and scientists are developing simple and efficient techniques. Among these, semiconductor photocatalysis has gained widespread attention as a pivotal solution to energy scarcity and environmental protection. The specific surface area (SSA), band gap energy, and morphology of the materials are the key factors for photocatalysis, and it influences the photocatalytic property. Irradiation of photocatalysts generates holes and electrons. Holes are present in the valence band (VB,) and they undergo oxidation reaction to produce hydroxyl radicals (.OH). Electrons in the conduction band go through a reduction process, and they react with oxygen in the air to produce superoxide radical anions (O2−.). These active radicals degrade the toxic organic compounds to produce H2O and CO2. Several approaches have been utilized to improve the photocatalytic activity of visible light photocatalysts. They include doping, structural control, phase transfer, band gap regulation, and surface sensitization. The major characteristics of efficient photocatalysts include non-toxicity, photoactivity, and inertness to chemical and biological matters, photostability, ability to absorb near UV/visible regions, and cost-effectiveness. Herein, major semiconductor photocatalytic materials, namely, TiO2, ZnO, WO3, SiC, CuO, CdS, PbS, and SnO2, are elaborately discussed.

The catalysis under the NTP conditions enabled significantly higher CO2 conversions (∼85 %) and CH4 yield (∼84 %) at relatively low temperatures compared with the conventional thermally activated catalysis. Regarding the catalyst preparation, it was found that the reduction temperature can affect the chemical state of the metal and metal-support interaction significantly, and thus altering the activity of the catalysts in NTP-driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. A kinetic study revealed that the NTP-catalysis has a lower activation energy (at ∼21 kJ mol−1) than that of the thermal catalysis (ca. 82 kJ mol−1), due to the alternative pathways enabled by NTP, which was confirmed by the comparative in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier (DRIFTS) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) characterisation of the catalytic systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 hydrogenation; DRIFTS; Non-thermal plasma (NTP); Ru/MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH)","Activation energy; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Hydrogenation; Mass spectrometry; Ruthenium compounds; Catalyst preparation; CO2 hydrogenation; DRIFTS; Layered double hydroxides; Metal-support interactions; Mg-Al layered double hydroxide; Nonthermal plasma; Reduction temperatures; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079398678

Recent research has revealed that solid electron mediators facilitate shuttle of electrons and thereby enhance photocatalytic activity. However, for a mediator-free direct Z-scheme system, it still remains a challenge to promote the Z-scheme-type charge transfer at the interface. Herein, we report that the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over the direct Bi4TaO8Cl/W18O49 (BiW) Z-scheme system, which is assembled from Bi4TaO8Cl nanosheet and nanosized W18O49, is markedly enhanced by simple integration of the photocatalytic process with external heating. The CO yield over a typical BiW Z-scheme system is increased by 87 times when the system temperature is increased from 298 K to 393 K. This yield via BiW photocatalysis at 393 K is higher than Bi4TaO8Cl photocatalysis at 298 K by a factor of 167. The superior performance of BiW Z-scheme system at elevated temperature is believed to result from the thermo-enhanced shuttle of electron from W18O49 to Bi4TaO8Cl. Moreover, this BiW Z-scheme enables long-lasting catalytic reduction of CO2 in the dark after light irradiation, benefiting from the thermal release of stored electrons in W18O49 to the conduction band of Bi4TaO8Cl. This study suggests that photothermal synergy can enhance the Z-scheme behavior, providing a promising means for designing photothermal catalysts for the solar-catalytic reduction of CO2 to fuel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bi4TaO8Cl; CO2 reduction; Direct Z scheme; Photocatalytic; Photothermal; W18O49","Artificial photosynthesis; Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Electrons; Photocatalytic activity; Bi4TaO8Cl; CO2 reduction; Direct Z scheme; Photo-catalytic; Photo-thermal; W18O49; Chlorine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075418482

However, distillation columns account for the largest contribution to the total energy consumption of chemical processes due to their high heat demands. Consequently, there is a strong need for energy efficient column designs to reduce drastically the carbon dioxide emissions and thus to reach the settled climate goals of the chemical industry. In this paper, the FluxMax approach is used to identify energy optimal column designs. The representation of the distillation process by the elementary processes mixing, heating/cooling and phase separation leads to increased degrees of freedom of optimization compared to classical column modeling approaches. In this way, a non-conventional design with minimal energy consumption is identified. The energy-optimized configuration is a column with improved heat transfer between vapor and liquid streams. MESH equations are used for the validation of the FluxMax design, as they are state-of-the-art in process modeling tools. While the new design reduces the energy demand by up to 64% compared to the classical design, additional heat exchange area is required to exploit the energy reduction potential. A multi-objective optimization—energy duty vs. heat exchanger area—is carried out to identify the optimal trade-off between energy demand and heat exchanger area related capital cost. The highly energy-efficient designs identified by the FluxMax approach may be realized in practice by horizontal columns or modularized container solutions. © Copyright © 2020 Schack, Jastram, Liesche and Sundmacher.","distillation columns; energy-efficiency; heat exchange; heat integration; methanol; process design","Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Chemical plants; Costs; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Distillation; Distilleries; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Global warming; Heat exchangers; Multiobjective optimization; Phase separation; Purification; Space heating; Carbon dioxide emissions; Distillation process; Energy-efficient design; Energy-efficient distillation; Heat-exchanger areas; Optimized configuration; Separation and purification; Total energy consumption; Distillation columns",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088484569

In the Atlantic Forest of northern Argentina, large areas have been replaced by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) monocultures. Plant and litter transformation, together with harvesting operations, change microclimatic conditions and edaphic properties. Management practices such as thinning promote the development of native understory vegetation and could counterbalance negative effects of forest replacement on soil. Here, the effects of pine plantations and thinning on physical, chemical and microbiological soil properties were assessed. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community structure were analyzed using a metabarcoding approach targeting ribosomal markers. Forest replacement and, to a lesser extent, thinning practices in the pine plantations induced significant changes in soil physico-chemical properties and associated shifts in bacterial and fungal communities. Most measured physical and chemical properties were altered due to forest replacement, but a few of these properties reached values similar to natural forests under the thinning operation. Fungal alpha diversity decreased in pine plantations, whereas bacterial alpha diversity tended to increase but with little statistical support. Shifts in community composition were observed for both fungal and bacterial domains, and were mostly related to changes in plant understory composition, soil carbon, organic matter, water content, pH and bulk density. Among several other changes, highly abundant phyla such as Proteobacteria (driven by many genera) and Mortierellomycota (mainly driven by Mortierella) decreased in relative abundance in the plantations, whereas Acidobacteria (mainly driven by Acidothermus and Candidatus Koribacter) and Basidiomycota (mainly driven by the ectomycorrhiza Russula) showed the opposite response. Taken together, these results provide insights into the effects of forest replacement on belowground properties and elucidate the potentially beneficial effect of thinning practices in intensive plantation systems through promoting the understory development. Although thinning did not entirely counterbalance the effects of forest replacement on physical, chemical and biological soil properties, the strategy helped mitigating the effects and might promote resilience of these properties by the end of the rotation cycle, if subsequent management practices compatible with the development of a native understory vegetation are applied. © Copyright © 2020 Trentini, Campanello, Villagra, Ferreras and Hartmann.","atlantic forest; biodiversity; Pinus taeda; plant understory; soil microbiome; thinning practice","ground water; RNA 16S; Acidobacteria; Acidothermus cellulolyticus; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Argentina; Article; Ascomycetes; atlantic forest; Bacteroidetes; Basidiomycetes; Betaproteobacteria; biodiversity; bioinformatics; bioremediation; Comamonadaceae; community structure; DNA extraction; ectomycorrhiza; Euryarchaeota; forest; fungal community; gene amplification; gene sequence; Liberibacter; loblolly pine; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial consortium; microbial diversity; microbiome; monoculture; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; pine; plant community; plantation; productivity; Proteobacteria; quality control; Rhizobium; rhizosphere; soil acidification; soil acidity; soil analysis; soil microflora; soil moisture; soil property; solar radiation; vegetation; water availability; water content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088433057

However, the magnitude and sign of anthropogenic forcing in cirrus clouds is still very uncertain depending on the treatments for ice-nucleating particles (INPs), the treatments for haze particle freezing, and the ice nucleation scheme. In this study, a new ice nucleation scheme (hereafter the HYBRID scheme) is developed to combine the best features of two previous ice nucleation schemes, so that global models are able to calculate the ice number concentration in both updrafts and downdrafts associated with gravity waves, and it has a robust sensitivity to the change of aerosol number. The scheme is applied in a box model, and the ice number concentrations (9:52 ± 2:08 L-1) are somewhat overestimated but are in reasonable agreement with those from an adiabatic parcel model (9:40±2:31 L-1). Then, the forcing and cloud changes associated with changes in aircraft soot, sulfur emission, and all anthropogenic emissions between the preindustrial (PI) period and the present day (PD) are examined using the CESM/IMPACT global model with the HYBRID scheme. Aircraft soot emissions decrease the global average ice number concentration (Ni) by-1:0 ± 2:4 × 107 m-2 (-1 %) (over the entire column) due to the inhibition of homogeneous nucleation and lead to a radiative forcing of-0:14 ± 0:07 W m-2, while the increase in sulfur emissions increases the global average Ni by 7:3 ± 2:9 × 107 m-2 (5 %) due to the increase in homogeneous nucleation and leads to a radiative forcing of-0:02 ± 0:06 W m-2. The possible effects of aerosol and cloud feedbacks to the meteorological state in remote regions partly contribute to reduce the forcing and the change in Ni due to anthropogenic emissions. The radiative forcing due to all increased anthropogenic emissions from PI to PD is estimated to be-0:20 ± 0:05 W m-2. If newly formed secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) act as INPs and inhibit homogeneous nucleation, the Ni formed from heterogeneous nucleation is increased. As a result, the inclusion of INPs from SOA increases the change in Ni to 12:0±2:3×107 m-2 (9 %) and increases (makes less negative) the anthropogenic forcing on cirrus clouds to-0:04 ± 0:08 W m-2 from PI to PD. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; anthropogenic source; cirrus; haze; ice crystal; radiation budget; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088410166

Accordingly, it is closely related to economic growth - which supports the living needs of human beings. In many cases, human activities related to land use are often uncontrollable, impacting many negative effects on the environment, both locally and globally. More broadly, these activities will lead to some changes in land cover and some other physical features such as climate. In order to understand the phenomenon of land cover changes, we approach them through modelling. To detect any changes in land cover in a region, it is necessary to identify the driving factors causing land-cover change. The relation between driving factors and response variables can be evaluated by using regression analysis techniques. In this case, land cover change is a dichotomous phenomenon, i.e., binary. Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) model is one of the regression analyses which can be used to describe the nature of dichotomy. From the results of this study, the driving factors causing land-cover change in West Java were found, those are: The distances to the central business districts in some certain areas such as Bandung City, Bekasi Regency, Bekasi City, Bogor Regency, Karawang Regency, and Sukabumi Regency; the distance to the the capital of the province; the distance to the main roads; the population numbers; and some physical features of the land such as slope, curvature, and height.

Rubber plantation is one of the carbon-absorbing ecosystems, due to its long life and large biomass content. The aim of this study was to estimate the above-ground carbon stock based on Sentinel 2A remotely sensed imagery, through vegetation index approaches. In the initial stage, the image was corrected radiometrically to obtain a bottom of atmosphere (BoA) reflectance values, so that all spectral indices that were run could provide reliable results. The vegetation indices used in this study were RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), ARVI (Atmospheric Resistant Vegetation Index), and SARVI (Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index). The values generated from those indices were correlated with field data of carbon stock, which was derived from breast height diameter (BHD)-based biomass measurements and allometric equations. Correlation and regression analyses of carbon stock and vegetation indices were then used to interpolate the samples to the entire study area, using exponential, logarithmic, and quadratic equations. The resultant above ground carbon stock maps were then tested for accuracy assessment using field data collected independently. It was found that the ARVI-based estimation model with BoA reflectance radiometric correction, combined with exponential regression equation, showed the best accuracy values of 84.48% (supported by r2 = 0.473). Based on this model, the above-ground carbon stock estimate in Ngobo and Getas Plantation, PTPN IX were 527,072.39 tons in an area of 2,656,615 hectares, or 198.4 tons/hectares. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

A protocol was developed containing thirty-two indicators to assess plans capacity to act as a strategic planning tool to develop, analyse and implement strategies for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The evaluation indicated that strategies addressing the UHI are rarely included in metropolitan plans. Strategic plans showed a lack of evidence-base to inform the potential actions. Urban warming is often linked to extreme weather events anticipated under climate change, not the UHI as a systemic and increasing phenomenon.

Despite the negligence of climate policy at the federal level in the United States, subnational governments have taken action to adapt to climate change impacts. Using national-level data on subnational government climate activities, this research examines three aspects of coastal community adaptation actions. First, it examines whether there are differences in climate adaptation activity between coastal and non-coastal communities. It then tests the relative importance of political partisanship, population, perception of climate risk, and awareness of state-level climate planning effort. Lastly, it examines the impact of participation within climate policy networks on the likelihood of a subnational government taking a climate adaptation action. Three types of network partners are examined: those focused on sea-level rise and coastal communities, climate change mitigation, and general environmental organizations. Concern about severe storms, awareness of state plans, and having a network partner focused either on climate mitigation or the environment were found to be statistically significant indicators of climate adaptation action. The paper discusses the importance of understanding the localized context of adaptation within nested governance structures, and how informal policy networks can facilitate learning and innovation across coastal communities. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","climate change adaptation; community-level governance; policy networks; subnational governments","Public policy; Risk perception; Sea level; Storms; Adaptation response; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Coastal communities; Environmental organizations; Governance structures; Policy networks; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone management; environmental risk; participatory approach; vulnerability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087025586

Here, the diffusion conditions and their changes under future warming scenarios are examined. The relative strength of haze events in the Northern China Plain region increase from 150% during 2006–15 to 190% during 2090–99 under RCP8.5 scenarios, induced by a stronger and longer-lasting anticyclone anomaly in eastern China. The strengthened anticyclone anomaly is mainly induced by increased northern wave train convergence emanating from the Barents–Kara Sea, and the longer duration of the anticyclone anomaly is mainly induced by stronger local feedback that can extract more energy from the basic state to maintain the anticyclone anomaly in eastern China. Aerosol reduction is found to play a dominant role in strengthening the upstream wave train near the Barents–Kara Sea and the downstream anticyclone in eastern China, while the effects from increased greenhouse gases are small. The results of this study indicate that future aerosol emissions reduction can induce deteriorating diffusion conditions, suggesting more stringent regulations on aerosol emissions in China are needed to meet air quality standards. © 2020 The Author(s).

Due to the large mass and volume of traditional instruments as well as supporting systems, in-situ measurements of the CO2 vertical profile within the boundary layer are rare. This study used a miniaturized CO2 monitoring instrument based on a low-cost non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor to measure the CO2 vertical profile and meteorological parameters of the lower troposphere (0–1000 m) in southwestern Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China. The sensors were onboard a tethered balloon with two processes: the ascending process and the descending process. The results showed that the overall trend of CO2 concentration decreased with height. Weather conditions and CO2 emission sources caused fluctuations in CO2 concentrations. The CO2 concentration varied from morning to afternoon due mainly to the faster spread of air mass during daytime, with strong convections and the accumulation of emissions at night. The low-cost sensor produced results consistent with the traditional gas chromatography method. The Weather Research and Forecasting model could not capture the CO2 profiles well due mainly to the bad performances in boundary layer height and the potential outdated fossil fuel emissions around the experimental site. This experiment is the first successful attempt to observe the CO2 vertical distribution in the lower troposphere by using low-cost NDIR sensors. The results help us to understand the vertical structure of CO2 in the boundary layer, and provide data for calibrating and validating transport models. © 2020 The Author(s).

By using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (backward trajectory model) and surface wind data, the transmission characteristics of atmospheric CO2 in Taiyuan are studied in various seasons. The results show that, in Taiyuan, the CO2 mole fraction in autumn and winter is higher than that in spring and summer, and on haze days is higher than that on non-haze days. The diurnal variation characteristic of CO2 mole fraction in each season is ‘single peak and single valley’ with the peak value around 0700 (hereafter refers to Beijing Time) and the valley value around 1600. The CO2 mole fraction on workdays is slightly higher than that on non-workdays and obviously different around 0800 of the early peak. Horizontal diffusion can reduce the CO2 mole fraction, while breezy weather is not beneficial to CO2 diffusion. The wind direction and speed in the upper levels are different from those near the surface, and the close air masses in the southwest–west–northwest sector raise the CO2 concentration in Taiyuan obviously. This indicates that the CO2 in Taiyuan is mainly contributed by local sources. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, the porous media burners have the problem of inclined flame when used for surface heat treatments. In order to solve this problem, a new structure of porous media burner with pores step distribution in radial direction is proposed in this paper, four representative pores distributions in radial direction are chosen in order to reveal the influences of the new structure on flame characteristic of the porous media burner. Results show that the radial distribution of pores in combustion zone of burner affects the flame characteristic greatly. In the pore concentrated region, the increase of resistance loss reduces the gas flow rate, and causes the temperatures of gas and solid lower than that in the other regions.

Given the changes in mean annual temperature and annual precipitation for the last 40 years in the region, understanding of the sensitivity of Trojan fir and Scots pine trees to changing climate seems to be critical so that better management strategies can be developed against the potential climate extremes of the future in the region. Moreover, our knowledge on the influence of current silvicultural methods on seedling density and growth in these forests is limited. Therefore, in this study, the growth response (i.e., radial growth) of Trojan fir and Scots pine trees to the changing climate were examined. In addition, the influence of current silvicultural practices on seedling growth and density in these forests was also monitored. Trojan fir appeared more sensitive to the climatic variables (i.e., temperature and precipitation) than Scots pine in the region. It was also found that the current silvicultural practices might favor Trojan fir over Scots pine in these forests. Natural dynamics and current silvicultural implications would benefit Trojan fir, however, given the species’ potential sensitivity to the changing climate, current silvicultural approaches can be modified to favor Scots pine, and to increase the resilience of these forests against climate extremes expected in the region’s future. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","Climate change; drought; scots pine; Trojan fir","Climate change; Drought; Plants (botany); Abies nordmanniana; Annual precipitation; Climatic variables; Management strategies; Mean annual temperatures; Scots pine; Silvicultural practices; Trojans; Forestry; air temperature; climate change; coniferous tree; growth response; mixed forest; precipitation (climatology); silviculture; stand structure; sustainable forestry; Abies Nordmanniana; Drought; Forestry; Forests; Pinus Sylvestris; Turkey; Abies; Abies nordmanniana subsp. equi-trojani; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074681437

At present, climate change impacts on the coast, such as storm surges and rising sea levels, are an inevitability and, in some regions, they are already damaging coastal tourism economies. It is clear, therefore, that our relationship with the coast will change. Given the importance of coastal tourism, this new relationship needs to incorporate adaptive measures; including a blue space and wellbeing focus, education and awareness of challenges facing the natural environment. We make this case by re-evaluating the literature on coastal tourism and climate adaptation policies. Using recent examples, we also offer an indication of new policy directions for coastal destinations. At present coastal tourism plans and policies largely ignore how destinations might respond and adapt to climate change impacts.

Alongside cropland expansion, agricultural intensification practices modify crop water use and land and water productivity. Particularly, one form of agricultural intensification known as multi-cropping (the cultivation of a piece of land sequentially more than once a year) can result in greater agricultural output per unit of land, as well as more productive use of the available water throughout the annual rainfall cycle. We assess the influence of these two processes, cropland expansion and agricultural intensification, in agricultural green water use in Brazilian agriculture. We applied the biophysical crop model Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) to estimate green water use for single and double cropping of soybean (Glycine max) and maize (Zea mays) in Brazil. The first part of our study analyses changes in soybean green water use and virtual water content nationwide between 1990 and 2013, and in a second part we look into the effect of double-cropping on water use for soybean and maize in the Brazilian states of Paraná and Mato Grosso between 2003 and 2013. The results show that cropland expansion plays a more prominent effect in green water use for production of soybean than intensification, and harvested area increase was responsible for the appropriation of an additional 95 km3 of green water in 2013 when compared to 1990, an increase of 155%. We estimate that an additional green water use of around 26 km3 related to second season maize was appropriated through increase of cropping frequency, and without expansion of cropland, in 2013 in the selected states. We discuss the importance of considering multi cropping practices when assessing green water sustainability, and the importance of differentiating green water appropriation through expansion and through cropping frequency changes. © 2020 The Author(s).

Renewable energy generation capacity has risen in both standalone and grid-connected systems. The chief reason is the ability to produce clean energy, which is both environmentally friendly and cost effective. This paper presents a new control algorithm along with a flexible energy management system to minimize the cost of operating a hybrid microgrid. The microgrid comprises fuel cells, photovoltaic cells, super capacitors, and other energy storage systems. There are three stages in the control system: an energy management system, supervisory control, and local control. The energy management system allows the control system to create an optimal day-ahead power flow schedule between the hybrid microgrid components, loads, batteries, and the electrical grid by using inputs from economic analysis. The discrepancy between the scheduled power and the real power delivered by the hybrid microgrid is adjusted for by the supervisory control stage. Additionally, this paper provides a design for the local control system to manage local power, DC voltage, and current in the hybrid microgrid. The operation strategy of energy storage systems is proposed to solve the power changes from photovoltaics and houses load fluctuations locally, instead of reflecting those disturbances to the utility grid. Furthermore, the energy storage systems energy management scheme will help to achieve the peak reduction of the houses’ daily electrical load demand. Also, the control of the studied hybrid microgrid is designed as a method to improve hybrid microgrid resilience and incorporate renewable power generation and storage into the grid. The simulation results verified the effectiveness and feasibility of the introduced strategy and the capability of proposed controller for a hybrid microgrid operating in different modes. The results showed that (1) energy management and energy interchange were effective and contributed to cost reductions, CO2 mitigation, and reduction of primary energy consumption, and (2) the newly developed energy management system proved to provide more robust and high performance control than conventional energy management systems. Also, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust model for microgrid energy management. © 2020 by the authors.

The situation can be mitigated by passive climate solutions to reduce energy consumption in buildings. This study investigated the effectiveness of the green roof concept in reducing energy demand for cooling in different climatic regions. The impact of several types of green roofing of varying thermal conductivity and soil depth on energy consumption for cooling school buildings in Egypt was examined. In a co-simulation approach, the efficiency of the proposed green roof types was evaluated using the Design-Builder software, and a cost analysis was performed for the best options. The results showed that the proposed green roof types saved between 31.61 and 39.74% of energy, on average. A green roof featuring a roof soil depth of 0.1 m and 0.9 W/m-K thermal conductivity exhibited higher efficiency in reducing energy than the other options tested. The decrease in air temperature due to green roofs in hot arid areas, which exceeded an average of 4◦ C, was greater than that in other regions that were not as hot.

Yet, support for a large deployment of WtE plants is not universal because there is a widespread concern that energy from waste discourages recycling practices. Moreover, incineration plants generate air pollution and chemical waste residuals and are expensive to build compared to modern landfills that have appropriate procedures for the prevention of leakage of harmful gasses. In the context of the EU, this paper aims to provide a picture of the actual role of WtE as a disposal option for municipal solid waste (MSW), enabling it to be utilized as a source of clean energy, and to address two important aspects of the debate surrounding the use of WtE; namely, (i) the relationship between WtE and recycling, and (ii) the effects of decentralization, waste mobility, and plant ownership. Finally, it reviews the role of the EU as a supranational regulator, which may allow the lower government levels (where consumer preferences are better represented) to take decisions, while taking spillovers into account. © 2020 by the authors.

The devastating impact of the changing climate is expected to grow over this century; nonetheless, the international community now has unprecedented predictive capacities at its disposal to prevent and mitigate this change. Drawing on scientific advances, numerous initiatives have emerged to strengthen international cooperation on climate-related security risks. Among these, the ‘Responsibility to Prepare’ framework, launched by the Center for Climate and Security in 2017, provides a strategic agenda on a set of principles and goals to ensure a global response to climate-related pressures. As a regional actor, the European Union (EU) has also increasingly recognised the security risks posed by climate change, developing new approaches and tools to address them more systematically. A number of recent developments in the Common Foreign and Security Policy are consistent with the Responsibility to Prepare framework. These steps appear to underscore the EU’s willingness to promote this global framework. Nonetheless, further efforts will still be needed in coming years if the EU is to integrate climate concerns into a broader, all-encompassing climate foreign policy and translate its vision into practice. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate security risks; conflict prevention; European Union; resilience; responsibility to prepare",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089788011

However, the planation niches which are types of management on the productivity of bamboo is not yet understood. The research evaluates the impact of plantation niches on the productivity of highland bamboo in potential bamboo growing areas of West Amhara, Ethiopia. Farta, Banja, Dega Damot, and Sinan districts were selected for the study to represent potential highland bamboo growing areas in West Amhara. In each district, three kebeles (smaller administrative units in Ethiopia) were also selected based on their resource status and prevalence growing niches. Finally, a total of 324 sample plots were randomly selected over study areas for data collection. The Productivity and basal area of the bamboo stand were estimated by using DBH of the culm. Whereas the volume of bamboo stands was estimated using DBH, the height of culm breast, and total culm size. The diameter distribution of bamboo culms along plantation niches shows positively skewed between 4 and 8cm ranges. The standing stock of culm ranges from 19,188±336 culms ha−1 to 23,129±390 culms ha−1 in woodlot and riverbank niches, respectively. The biomass storage capacity of highland bamboo varies from 92.2±4.2ton ha−1 to 118.6 ± 4.2 ton ha−1 total dry weight (TDW) from the roadside to riverbank plantation niches. Generally bamboo has a higher potential of accumulating huge dry weight, which is a good indicator of its potential for carbon sequestration and environmental protection. Therefore, it needs great attention from respective stakeholders to get twin benefits of bamboo as production and climate change mitigation. © 2020 The Author(s).

Social research was conducted in an upland area of central Timor Leste with farmers who have been planting trees since 2012 for soil stabilisation, timber, biodiversity enhancement and potential carbon income. A semi-structured survey of 40 tree planting households across six villages was conducted in 2017 to determine the perceived benefits and challenges of reforestation. Additional in-depth, qualitative interviews were conducted in 2018 with 5 village leaders, 8 project farmers and 10 non-project farmers to gain a deeper understanding of some of the issues raised in the survey. Farmers reported that the benefits of tree plantations were income from tree payments from an NGO; investment in children’s education; and improved biodiversity. The challenges to reforestation included livestock damage; lack of water; insects; weeds; and distance to the tree plantations. We conclude that community-based reforestation projects in Timor Leste have the potential to contribute to smallholders’ livelihoods through direct carbon payments and ecosystem services. However, household equity in terms of land ownership, labour, carbon income and social development need to be addressed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon certification; carbon forestry; community reforestation; household equity; rural livelihoods; smallholder; Timor Leste; tree plantations","carbon emission; community forestry; ecosystem service; forest management; forestry production; livelihood; reforestation; smallholder; Lesser Sunda Islands; Sunda Isles; Timor; Timor-Leste; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088663590

The response to the last glacial maximum (LGM) has been well studied, however, the effect of previous glaciation periods on plant demographic history is still not well studied. Here we investigated the population structure and demographic history of Primula fasciculata that widely occurs in the Hengduan Mountains and Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We obtained genomic data for 234 samples of the species using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing and combined approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and species distribution modeling (SDM) to evaluate the effects of multiple glaciation periods by testing several population divergence models and demographic scenarios. The analyses of population structure showed that P. fasciculata displays a striking population structure with six groups that could be identified genetically. Our ABC modeling suggested that the current groups diverged from ancestral populations located in the eastern Hengduan Mountains after the largest glaciation occurred in the region (~ 0.8–0.5 million years ago), which is consistent with the result of SDMs. Each current group has survived in different glacial refugia during the LGM and experienced expansions and/or bottlenecks since their divergence during or across the following Quaternary glacial cycles. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of population genomics for evaluating the effects of past climatic changes in alpine plant species with shallow population structure. © Copyright © 2020 Ren, Mateo, Conti and Salamin.","demography; genetic structure; Hengduan Mountains; population genomics; Quaternary climatic changes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088421454

Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations were determined by ICP-OES in soil and plant samples. Soils were not polluted according to the critical value; furthermore, the elemental composition did not differ among the sampling sites of the IURG. The rural site was also polluted due to heavy amounts of untreated wastewater of the adjacent Chao Phraya River. Bioaccumulation factors of Ba, Cu, and Mn was higher than 1, suggesting active accumulation of these elements in plant tissue. Our findings proved that the deposition of air pollutants and the resistance to air pollutants in the case of plant leaves were different and that humus materials of the soils had relevant role in bioaccumulation of Al, Ba, and Cu.

However, under the stringent air pollution controls, how the wintertime PM2:5 concentration (i.e., the mass concentration of atmospheric particles with diameters less than 2.5 μm) varies and how much the meteorological conditions contribute to the interannual variations in PM2:5 concentrations are still unclear, and these very important for the local government to assess the emission reduction of the previous year and adjust mitigation strategies for the next year. The effects of atmospheric circulation on the interannual variation in wintertime PM2:5 concentrations over the Beijing- Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in the period of 2013-2018 are evaluated in this study. Generally, the transport of clean and dry air masses and an unstable boundary layer in combination with the effective near-surface horizontal divergence or pumping action at the top of the boundary layer benefits the horizontal or vertical diffusion of surface air pollutants. Instead, the co-occurrence of a stable boundary layer, frequent air stagnation, positive water vapor advection and deep nearsurface horizontal convergence exacerbate the wintertime air pollution. Favorable circulation conditions lasting for 2-4 d are beneficial for the diffusion of air pollutants, and 3-7 d of unfavorable circulation events exacerbates the accumulation of air pollutants. The occurrence frequency of favorable circulation events is consistent with the interannual variation in seasonal mean PM2:5 concentrations. There is better diffusion ability in the winters of 2014 and 2017 than in other years. A 59.9% observed decrease in PM2:5 concentrations in 2017 over the BTH region could be attributed to the improvement in atmospheric diffusion conditions. It is essential to exclude the contribution of meteorological conditions to the variation in interannual air pollutants when making a quantitative evaluation of emission reduction measurements. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Sediment load in 2004 is estimated at 13.4 Mt yr−1; by 2018, ≈5000 km2 of land had farm plans implemented and annual sediment load reduced by 6.2% of the 2004 load. If SLUI stops at the 2018 level of implementation, by 2038 it is predicted to achieve a 15.7% reduction in annual sediment load. If SLUI continues to implement farm plans, 7949 km2 of land will be treated by 2043 and annual sediment load could be reduced by a further 14.7%. Climate change is predicted to substantially increase sediment loads. By 2043 annual sediment load for the region is predicted to increase, compared to 2004, by between 8.3 and 23.7%.

Land-use distribution is one of the key factors affecting air quality, and research on the impact of land-use distribution on air pollution has drawn wide attention. However, considerable studies have mostly used linear regression models, which fail to capture the nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns) and to show how impacts on PM2.5 vary with land-use magnitudes. In addition, related studies have generally focused on annual analyses, ignoring the seasonal variability of the impact of land-use distribution on PM2.5, thus leading to possible estimation biases for PM2.5 . This study was designed to address these issues and assess the impacts of land-use distribution on PM2.5 in Weifang, China. A machine learning statistical model, the boosted regression tree (BRT), was applied to measure nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5, capture how land-use magnitude impacts PM2.5 across different seasons, and explore the policy implications for urban planning. The main conclusions are that the air quality will significantly improve with an increase in grassland and forest area, especially below 8% and 20%, respectively. When the distribution of construction land is greater than around 10%, the PM2.5 pollution can be seriously substantially increased with the increment of their areas. The impact of gardens and farmland presents seasonal characteristics. It is noted that as the weather becomes colder, the inhibitory effect of vegetation distribution on the PM2.5 concentration gradually decreases, while the positive impacts of artificial surface distributions, such as construction land and roads, are aggravated because leaves drop off in autumn (September–November) and winter (December–February). According to the findings of this study, it is recommended that Weifang should strengthen pollution control in winter, for instance, expand the coverage areas of evergreen vegetation like Pinus bungeana Zucc. and Euonymus japonicus Thunb, and increase the width and numbers of branches connecting different main roads. The findings also provide quantitative and optimal land-use planning and strategies to minimize PM2.5 pollution, referring to the status of regional urbanization and greening construction. © 2020 by the authors.

There is, however, minimal evidence that green walls can influence ambient environmental conditions, especially taking into account the variable environmental conditions encountered in situ. The aim of this paper was to determine if green walls have a quantitative effect on ambient air quality in an urban environment. Ambient PM, noise, and temperature were recorded at 12 green wall and adjacent reference wall locations across a dense urban centre, over a 6-month period. The results indicated that PM levels and temperature did not significantly differ between the green wall and reference wall sites. Ambient noise at the green wall sites, however, was significantly lower than at the reference wall locations. It is suggested that mechanically assisted, or ‘active’ green wall systems may have a higher PM and temperature reduction capacity, and if so, they will be more valuable for installation in situ compared to standard passive systems, although this will require further research. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, we performed a quantitative HIA for the population of Scania (1,247,993), the southernmost county in Sweden, in 2016. The impact of annual mean concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 µm (PM2.5), modeled at their home residences for the year 2011, on mortality, asthma, dementia, autism spectrum disorders, preeclampsia and low birth weight (LBW) was explored. Concentration–response (C-R) functions were taken from epidemiological studies reporting meta-analyses when available, and otherwise from single epidemiological studies. The average level of PM2.5 experienced by the study population was 11.88 µg/m3 . The PM2.5 exposure was estimated to cause 9–11% of cases of LBW and 6% of deaths from natural causes. Locally produced PM2.5 alone contributed to 2–9% of the cases of diseases and disorders investigated. Reducing concentrations to a maximum of 10 µg/m3 would, according to our estimations, reduce mortality by 3% and reduce cases of LBW by 2%. Further analyses of separate emission sources’ distinct effects were also presented. Reduction of air pollution levels in the study area would, as expected, have a substantial effect on both mortality and adverse health outcomes. Reductions should be aimed for by local authorities and on national and even international levels. © 2020 by the authors.

Displacement due to extreme events is particularly challenging for small island developing states (SIDS) given their high exposure and vulnerability to tropical cyclones. Devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean in 2017 exposed non-economic loss and damage associated with prolonged displacement of entire island populations due to complete destruction of communities. Such was the case in Ragged Island, The Bahamas, where the entire population was displaced. This study assesses national policies, plans, legislation and reports from The Bahamas to determine non-economic loss and damage experienced by displaced residents and how the policy landscape addresses these issues. We find that non-economic loss and damage was acknowledged neither by the policy landscape nor by Government actions, but that there were likely health impacts and disruptions to sense of place and connection to the island. Failure to consider non-economic loss and damage also contributed to assessments that costs of rebuilding outweighed benefits. While existing literature has acknowledged policy deficiencies on loss and damage at the national level in SIDS, this study illustrates real-world impacts of these deficiencies. The case of Ragged Island highlights the need for SIDS to take the lead in developing national responses to loss and damage as they are currently experiencing severe impacts, which are intensified by the lack of clear policies, plans or strategies. Key policy insights Climate-induced displacement is linked to non-economic loss and damage, particularly when displacement is prolonged and due to extreme events. However, these impacts are rarely addressed in national policies, plans or strategies. National policies that address climate-induced displacement and non-economic loss and damage are critical in order to reduce impacts experienced by displaced communities and expand feasibility assessments of rebuilding to include more than economic considerations. SIDS are currently experiencing non-economic loss and damage and should take the lead in developing national policies and strategies to assess, address and report on these impacts, particularly those SIDS that rely on international funders for recovery and response to extreme events. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Caribbean; displacement; extreme events; human mobility; loss and damage; Non-economic losses","developing world; environmental policy; feasibility study; policy implementation; state role; tropical cyclone; Bahamas; Caribbean Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087853426

The method is based on a new ability to determine the dissociation constant, K°d, for ion pairs formed between any radical anion and any inert electrolyte counterion. These dissociation constants can be used to determine relative shifts of redox potential as a function of electrolyte concentration, connecting referenced potentials determined with electrochemistry (with 0.1 M electrolyte) to electrolyte-free values. Pulse radiolysis created radical anions enabling determination of equilibrium constants for electron transfer between anions of donor and acceptor molecules as a function of electrolyte concentration in THF. The measurements determined ""composite equilibrium constants"", KeqC, which contain information about the dissociation constant for the electrolyte cations, X+, with the radical anions of both the donor, K°d(D-,X+) and the acceptor, K°d(A-,X+). Dissociation constants were obtained for a selection of radical anions with tetrabutylammonium (TBA+). The electrolyte was found to shift the reduction potentials of small molecules 1-methylpyrene and trans-stilbene by close to +130 mV whereas oligo-fluorenes and polyfluorenes experienced shifts of only (+25 ± 6) mV due to charge delocalization weakening the ion pair. These shifts for reduction of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are smaller than shifts of +232 and +451 mV seen previously for benzophenone radical anion with TBA+ and Na+ respectively where the charge on the radical anion is localized largely on one C=O bond, thus forming a more tightly bound ion pair.

The impact of PM2.5 mass and sulfur changes were represented as UFP penalties. Bootstrapping was applied to calculate standard errors for the different trend and penalty estimates. Results showed that PM2.5 mass and sulfur concentrations declined significantly over the study period. The analysis found an estimated 7.3% (95% CI: 3.5, 11.1%) UFP penalty due to long-term PM2.5 mass trends, and a 9.9% (95% CI: 6.2, 13.7%) UFP penalty due to long-term sulfur trends. Findings from this study suggest that future UFP control efforts should account for the role of PM2.5 mass and sulfur changes. Implications: Using one of the longest available time series of UFP concentrations (1999 to 2018), this study examined the hypothesis that long-term trends of PM2.5 mass and sulfur concentrations have an impact on UFP trends. We found that PM2.5 mass and sulfur reductions had a small but significant impact, i.e., penalty, on UFP trends. Improved understanding of the impact of PM2.5 mass and sulfur concentrations on UFP trends can inform future air quality control efforts. © 2020, © 2020 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Health risks; Quality control; Respiratory system; Time series; Accumulation modes; Generalized additive model; Human health risks; Long-term impacts; Long-term trend; Sulfur concentrations; Sulfur reduction; Ultrafine particle; Sulfur; sulfur; sulfur; air monitoring; air pollution; Article; bootstrapping; comparative study; controlled study; environmental impact; futurology; generalized additive model; hypothesis; mass; Massachusetts; material state; measurement error; particulate matter; physical phenomena; polydisperse coagulation; priority journal; punishment; sensitivity analysis; statistical model; time series analysis; toxic concentration; trend study; ultrafine particle; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Boston; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Sulfur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087530471

This is anticipated to result in further challenges for maritime safety. Those operating in ice-infested waters require various types of information for sea-ice and iceberg hazards. Ice information requirements depend on regional needs and whether the stakeholder wants to avoid ice all together, operate near or in the Marginal Ice Zone, or areas within the ice pack. An insight into user needs demonstrates how multiple spatial and temporal resolutions for sea-ice information and forecasts are necessary to provide information to the marine operating community for safety, planning, and situational awareness. Although ship-operators depend on sea-ice information for tactical navigation, stakeholders working in route and capacity planning can benefit from climatological and long-range forecast information at lower spatial and temporal resolutions where the interest is focused on open-water season. The advent of the Polar Code has brought with it additional information requirements, and exposed gaps in capacity and knowledge.

Assessing the hierarchy of long-term environmental controls on diatom communities of Yellowstone National Park using lacustrine sediment records. Lake Reserv Manage. 36:278–296. An ecosystem’s ability to maintain structure and function following disturbance, defined as resilience, is influenced by a hierarchy of environmental controls, including climate, surface cover, and ecological relationships that shape biological community composition and productivity. This study examined lacustrine sediment records of naturally fishless lakes in Yellowstone National Park to reconstruct the response of aquatic communities to climate and trophic cascades from fish stocking. Sediment records of diatom algae did not exhibit a distinct response to fish stocking in terms of assemblage or algal productivity. Instead, 3 of 4 lakes underwent a shift to dominance by benthic diatom species from 1935 to 1950, which suggests lower lake levels resulting from warmer, drier climatic conditions. The lake that did not undergo such a shift is fed by groundwater rather than snowmelt, suggesting a buffering effect by water source. Dissimilarity analysis shows that the diatom assemblages in all 4 lakes have become increasingly dissimilar since circa 1955, suggesting that communities have not yet stabilized from the first-order influence of climate. Thus, climate likely had a more prominent influence on diatom community structure than did manipulation of the fish community. Understanding the relative importance and interplay among abiotic and biotic stressors and the resultant resilience of an ecosystem provides implications for the adaptive management of lakes. © 2020 North American Lake Management Society.","Climate change; diatoms; fish stocking; paleolimnology; resilience; trophic cascade; Yellowstone National Park",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085355811

For PTI suitable instruments are needed to detect faults, such as diesel particulate filter failures. Diffusion charging is well established as a charging method for particle sensors and is suited to realize low-cost instruments for exhaust particle number measurements in the appropriate size and concentration regime. In order to manufacture affordable instruments, sensors should not only be low cost, but their calibration procedure must be simple and reliable. We experimentally investigated the impact of test aerosol properties—such as material, size, concentration and morphology—on the counting efficiency of two pulsed-mode, unipolar diffusion charging approaches: (i) conventional diffusion charging and (ii) modulated precipitation. By separately characterizing the particle charging process and the overall sensor response with different test aerosols, we found that the modulated precipitation principle shows a very good correlation to particle number concentration, although the method significantly depends on the particle morphology. The conventional approach is not well suited for particle number measurements due to its intrinsic dependency on particle size. We demonstrate that the counting efficiency of the modulated precipitation configuration measured with different tests aerosols stays within 3% for particle sizes up to 80 nm. The difference between a calibration with soot and salt particles with respect to the total solid particle number concentration was estimated to be smaller than 11%. Thus, a calibration according to recently introduced PTI legislation with any of the test aerosols considered is feasible. Tailpipe measurements confirmed the applicability of the modulated precipitation configuration for PTI. As a consequence, the use of diffusion charging based instruments in periodic inspections seems to be suitable due to appropriate sensor response and the simplicity of the calibration process.

We estimated the amount by which current nitrogen (N) concentrations and loads exceed criteria in rivers, lakes and estuaries nationally. Criteria corresponded to national ‘bottom-line’ (i.e. minimal) environmental objectives set by government policy. Three metrics were evaluated: (1) degree of compliance describes the current TN loads in receiving environments relative to criteria; (2) catchment N status describes the acceptability of catchment N loads compared to criteria; and (3) excess load indicates the amount by which the N load exceeds the maximum allowable load (kg yr−1). Non-compliance with N criteria was broadly distributed nationally particularly in low-elevation catchments. Catchments with unacceptable N status constituted at least 31% of New Zealand’s land area, which corresponds to at least 43% of the country’s agricultural land. The national excess load was estimated to be at least 19.1 Gg yr−1. We are 97.5% confident that estimated excess loads exceed zero for nine of 15 regions and for the nation as a whole.

After the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM), Loss and Damage is now considered the third pillar–besides mitigation and adaptation–of climate action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper studies what the Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC WGII AR5) has to say about this emerging topic. We use qualitative data analysis software (text mining) to assess which climatic stressors, impact sectors and regions the report primarily associates with losses and damages, and compare this with the focus areas of the WIM. The study reveals that IPCC WGII AR5 primarily associates losses and damages with extreme weather events and economic impacts, and treats it primarily as a future risk. Present-day losses and damages from slow-onset processes and non-economic losses receive much less attention. Also, surprisingly, AR5 has more to say about losses and damages in high-income regions than in regions that are most at risk, such as small island states and least developed countries. The paper concludes with recommendations to the IPCC for its 6th Assessment Report (AR6) to include more evidence on losses and damages from slow-onset processes, non-economic losses and damages and losses and damages in vulnerable countries. Key policy insights IPCC WGII AR5 discusses evidence about losses and damages predominantly in relation to sudden-onset disasters and economic costs. More research is needed on losses and damages from slow-onset processes and non-economic loss and damage, particularly in vulnerable countries in the Global South. Funding agencies should support research in these areas and IPCC WGII AR6 should pay more attention to these topics. Losses and damages are not only a future risk, but already a present-day reality for vulnerable people in climate hotspots.

The environmental justice literature shows that polluting sites tend to disproportionately affect low income and disenfranchised communities. Could this be reversed or mitigated by linking positive amenities to polluting sites? The South Korean experiment of building community amenities (recreation centers, pools, gyms, etc.) at waste incinerators may provide answers to this intriguing question. Using the Difference-in-Differences design we found that while incinerators without amenities have substantial negative impacts on local land and real estate markets, we did not observe any such impact in areas with incinerators that have amenity features. Thus, the amenity features of the incinerators (along with enhanced regulatory emissions standards) are mitigating the negative economic impacts of incinerators. © 2019, © 2019 Newcastle University.","amenities; environmental justice; impact mitigation; incinerators; property values","amenity; economic impact; emission control; environmental justice; incineration; low income population; property market; regulatory framework; standard (regulation); Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074580498

Vanuatu made headlines when its Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and External Trade, the Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, announced his government’s intention to explore legal action as a tool to address climate loss and damage suffered in Vanuatu. Our contribution places this announcement in the context of Vanuatu’s own experience with climate loss and damage, and the state’s ongoing efforts to secure compensation for loss and damage through the multilateral climate change regime. We then discuss the possibilities for legal action to seek redress for climate loss and damage, focusing on two types of action highlighted in Minister Regenvanu’s statement: action against states under international law, and action against fossil fuel companies under domestic law. After concluding that the issue of compensation for climate loss and damage is best addressed at the multilateral level, we offer proposals on how the two processes of litigation and negotiation could interact with each other and inspire more far-reaching action to address loss and damage from climate change. Key policy insights The review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage offers an opportunity to start putting in place a facility for loss and damage finance under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A climate damages tax (CDT) on fossil fuel companies seems a particularly promising option for mobilizing loss and damage finance. Such a CDT could be one revenue stream for a relevant loss and damage facility. Legal action–including cases against foreign states or fossil fuel companies–could bolster the position of climate-vulnerable states in multilateral negotiations on loss and damage finance. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In this paper, I examine the nexus between a subnational quasi-state publicly funded hydrocarbon research program and a novel knowledge-production regime and explore how this relationship resulted in the production of oil from Alberta's oilsands. In particular, the paper highlights the significance of the Alberta Oilsands Technology and Research Authority (AOSTRA), a quasi-public institution credited with financing research, which among other finding, made the in-situ oilsands' mining method steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) commercially viable. SAGD proved essential in enlarging the Province’s oil reserves, but this paper focuses on AOSTRA’s novel intellectual property regime. Under that regime the intellectual property AOSTRA (the Provincial government) held the licensing rights to the research it funded and commanded its future revenues. In contrast to accounts of the development of the current mode of entrepreneurial knowledge production that emphasizes the new knowledge-enclosures of the biosphere, I suggest this was a novel system of knowledge-enclosure of the ""necrosphere.""

The main objectives of this study are to assess the energy use pattern and to select the best method among Cobb–Douglas (CD), multiple linear regressions (MLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) and support vector machine (SVM) models to estimate potato output energy in Jiroft city, located in the south of Kerman province, Iran. Data were collected with questioner method from expert farmers. Results indicated that the average of total input energy is about 84309.43 MJ ha−1 and the average of total output energy is 130217.14 MJ ha−1. Irrigation water (36%) and fertilizers (26%) were found to be the most important energy inputs in potato production. Unlike most literature reviews, in this study for better and more accurate model evolutions in energy forecasting, five different sizes of training selection (TS) were used: 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90%. Some statistical indexes (RMSE, MAPE, and R2) of the different data selection calculated from k-fold in two training sets. The results showed that RBF model has a great prediction performance at all different values of training data selection. The average value of R2 was found to be more than 0.98. Between SVM and MLP models, the test performance will be improved by size reduction of training selection. Thus, the RBF model is chosen as the best model for fitting and modeling the output energy of potato production. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","energy modeling; potato production; prediction; sensitivity analysis; Soft computing models","Data reduction; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Irrigation; Radial basis function networks; Soft computing; Support vector machines; Agricultural sector; Energy model; Energy use patterns; Multi layer perceptron; Multiple linear regressions; Prediction performance; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Soft computing models; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064743189

Remotely sensed data may complement field data and thus help to increase the precision of estimates and circumvent some of the problems with missing sample observations in inaccessible areas. Here, we report the results of a study conducted in a 15,867 km² area in the dry miombo woodlands of Tanzania, to quantify the contribution of existing canopy height and biomass maps to improving the precision of canopy height and AGB estimates locally. A local and a global height map and three global biomass maps, and a probability sample of 513 inventory plots were subject to analysis. Model-assisted sampling estimators were used to estimate mean height and AGB across the study area using the original maps and then with the maps calibrated with local inventory plots. Large systematic map errors – positive or negative – were found for all the maps, with systematic errors as great as 60–70 %. The maps contributed nothing or even negatively to the precision of mean height and mean AGB estimates. However, after being calibrated locally, the maps contributed substantially to increasing the precision of both mean height and mean AGB estimates, with relative efficiencies (variance of the field-based estimates relative to the variance of the map-assisted estimates) of 1.3–2.7 for the overall estimates. The study, although focused on a relatively small area of dry tropical forests, illustrates the potential strengths and weaknesses of existing global forest height and biomass maps based on remotely sensed data and universal prediction models. Our results suggest that the use of regional or local inventory data for calibration can substantially increase the precision of map-based estimates and their applications in assessing forest carbon stocks for emission reduction programs and policy and financial decisions. © 2020 The Authors","Biomass maps; Dry tropical forests; Model-assisted estimation; Systematic map errors","Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120711622

Most of southern and eastern Switzerland as well as parts of Piedmont, Lombardy, and the Habsburg territories in northern Italy (the modern provinces of Alto Adige/South Tyrol and Trentino) had been affected. Whereas this event has only been examined in detail for Switzerland, e.g. by a multi-disciplinary study of researchers at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research in Bern for the reason of the 150th anniversary of the fl ood disaster in 2018, a more detailed analysis of the impact and coping strategies in northern Italy is still missing. Following a historiographic approach, this study aims to shed a light on the potential of written and pictorial evidence to reconstruct the event and its consequences for Italy. The paper starts with an overview of interdisciplinary approaches in historical climatology, historical hydrology and historical disaster studies. It then summarizes some main results of the 2018 study for Switzerland, and fi nally it focuses on a rough reconstruction of the situation in northern Italy based on local and supra-regional newspapers such as the «Gazzetta Ticinese», the «Gazzetta Piemontese» (predecessor of «La Stampa»), and the «Bozner Zeitung».

However, industrial and agricultural activity is often detrimental to soil health and can distribute heavy metal(loid)s into the soil environment, with harmful effects on human and ecosystem health. In this Review, we examine processes that can lead to the contamination of agricultural land with heavy metal(loid)s, which range from mine tailings runoff entering local irrigation channels to the atmospheric deposition of incinerator and coal-fired power-plant emissions. We discuss the relationship between heavy metal(loid) biogeochemical transformations in the soil and their bioavailability. We then review two biological solutions for remediation of contaminated agricultural land, plant-based remediation and microbial bioremediation, which offer cost-effective and sustainable alternatives to traditional physical or chemical remediation technologies. Finally, we discuss how integrating these innovative technologies with profitable and sustainable land use could lead to green and sustainable remediation strategies, and conclude by identifying research challenges and future directions for the biological remediation of agricultural soils. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108317612

The objective function included penalties for network complexity and generalization error, among which a newly introduced penalty that makes use of the effective number of parameters provided by Bayesian Regularization. The developed framework was tested on data collected from a power plant consisting of twelve diesel engine-powered generators. It was found that the newly introduced penalty was enough to yield well-performing ANN s who demonstrated superior performance when compared to some traditional ML models, with up to a 75% reduction in the mean relative error when compared with a normal radial-basis network.

The syrup was prepared by mixing sucrose, glucose, fructose, and distilled water in a 1:1:1:0.8 weight ratio. A disk-type mixer suitable for high-viscosity materials was built to mix this syrup with MWNTs. To find out the optimum mixing conditions for effective disentanglement of MWNTs, the content ratio of MWNTs to sugar syrup was varied at each mixing step. Digital image processing technique was used with optical micrographs to quantitatively estimate the dispersion of nanotubes in sugar syrups. This revealed that the most homogeneous dispersion of MWNTs in the sugar syrup was achieved by gradually adding the syrup at each mixing step rather than all at once at the initial mixing step. The dynamic viscosity (η') of the mixtures was measured to evaluate the overall dispersion state of MWNTs. The incorporation of MWNTs increased the η' of sugar syrup, exhibiting a decreased η' with an increase in the degree of dispersion. To validate this novel dispersion method for polymer composites, disentangled MWNTs were transferred into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN); they exhibited uniform dispersion in each polymer matrix, without reagglomeration occurred. ©2020 The Polymer Society of Korea.

The climate approach shows a downward trend in precipitation from 12 to 16% and an increase in temperature from 1.2 to 2.3 °C, and this during the last three decades. A continuous decline in the piezometric level exceeding 12 m for the Cenomanian–Turonian aquifer and 17 m for the Plio-Quaternary aquifer has been observed. The groundwater mineralization is controlled by the dissolution of evaporate and carbonate minerals, by the bases exchange phenomenon, and by the marine intrusion, especially in Plio-Quaternary aquifer. Also, the groundwater quality in the study area deteriorates gradually over time and space. However, the results of this study confirm that the groundwater from Essaouira basin is vulnerable to the global warming. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Groundwater; Hydrochemistry; Piezometry; Semi-arid area","Aquifers; Global warming; Water quality; Groundwater mineralizations; Piezometric levels; Public authorities; Quaternary aquifers; Semi-arid climate; Semi-arid environments; Semiarid area; Study areas; Groundwater resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100600724

Riskscapes encompass different viewpoints on the threat of loss across space, time, individuals and collectives. This Special Issue of the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy, and Society enhances our understanding of the multifaceted and interlocking dimensions of climate change and riskscapes. It brings together rigorous and critical international scholarship across diverse realms on inquiry under two, interlinked, themes: (i) governance and institutional responses and (ii) vulnerabilities and inequalities. The contributors offer a forceful reminder that when considering climate change, social justice principles cannot be appended after the fact. Climate change adaptation and mitigation pose complex and interdependent social and ethical dilemmas that will need to be explicitly confronted in any activation of ""Green New Deal""strategies currently being developed internationally. Such critical insights about the layered, unequal and institutional dimensions of risks are of paramount import when considering other riskscapes pertaining to conflict and war, displaced people and pandemics like the 2019-2020 global COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).

While the climate is warming globally, some localities are experiencing climate cooling, the effects of which are poorly understood. Our herbarium-based study of a geographically restricted species shows that the timing of reproduction can shift earlier as the climate becomes cooler and wetter. Local variation in climate change may be a key factor driving the high variability of changes observed in plant reproduction and climate cooling should be considered along with other global change drivers. This will help enable accurate predictions for the successful management of climate change effects. Summary Plant phenological responses to global warming are well studied. However, while many locations are experiencing increased temperatures, some locations are experiencing climate cooling. Little work has been conducted to understand plant phenological responses to cooling trends, much less the combined effects of cooling and other factors, such as changing precipitation. Furthermore, studies based on herbarium specimens have been instrumental in demonstrating plant responses to global warming; but to our knowledge, herbarium records have not been used to investigate responses to cooling. We collected data from 98 years of herbarium records to evaluate whether the reproductive phenology (flowering/fruiting) of an annual mustard, cedar gladecress (Leavenworthia stylosa), has changed as the climate has become cooler and wetter in central Tennessee, USA. Additionally, we conducted two field experiments to assess reproductive consequences of different flowering times. Over the last century, gladecress reproductive phenology has shifted 2.1 days earlier per decade, concurrent with wetter conditions during germination and cooler conditions during reproduction. Field experiments showed that plants with extremely early and moderately early flowering had equivalent reproduction, but these plants had greater reproduction than intermediate- and late-flowering plants. Counter to expectations from global warming studies, our work demonstrates that climate cooling and greater rainfall can result in earlier plant reproductive phenology, potentially due to asymmetric selection for early flowering. Future studies may need to consider climate cooling along with other global change factors to fully explain changes in plant phenology. Our understanding of plant responses to climate cooling can be enhanced through additional herbarium-based research. © 2020 The Authors.

Inoculation of methanotrophic and N2 O-reducing bacteria was able to reduce CH4 and N2 O emission up to 4.19 mg CH4 /m2/day and 351.29 µg N2 O/m2/day, respectively. Those bacterial applications were also able to increase paddy growth and yield productivity. According to DGGE profile, inoculation of the biofertilizer seemed to have a transient impact on bacterial communities in paddy soil at 36 days after transplanting (DAT) which showed the lowest similarity with all samples (a similarity index of 0.68).

Limestone (CaCO3) is converted into lime (CaO), MgCO3 is converted to MgO and carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted during clinker manufacturing and burning of fossil fuel. Blast furnace slag is a waste of steel industries and it contains CaO, MgO and silicates etc. The CO2 emission reduction and energy efficiency improvement of the clinker manufacturing unit are investigated (M/s Emami Cement Limited, Village-Risda, Suhela Road, Baloda Bazar, Chhattisgarh) during the clinker manufacturing are around 2-4% of total raw feed. Blast furnace slag is used as elective raw materials which are fed into the kiln inlet with the help of winch machine. It is converted into the clinker and reduces the CO2 emission and fuel consumption. Blast furnace slag is already calcined due to high temperature in the furnace. The authors have investigated the CO2 emission reduction using blast furnace slag as alternative raw material for clinker manufacturing at the earlier mentioned cement plant to conserve natural resources and also suggested the alternatives for the emission reduction using the process integration approach. © 2020 Scientific Publishers.

This work synthesizes data pertaining to aerosols (specifically, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters &lt;2.5 micrometers, PM2.5) and conditions leading to violations of South Korean air quality standards (24-hr mean PM2.5 &lt; 35 µg m-3). PM2.5 variability from AirKorea monitors across South Korea is evaluated. Detailed data from the Seoul vicinity are used to interpret factors that contribute to elevated PM2.5. The interplay between meteorology and surface aerosols, contrasting synoptic-scale behavior vs. local influences, is presented. Transboundary transport from upwind sources, vertical mixing and containment of aerosols, and local production of secondary aerosols are discussed. Two meteorological periods are probed for drivers of elevated PM2.5. Clear, dry conditions, with limited transport (Stagnant period), promoted photochemical production of secondary organic aerosol from locally emitted precursors. Cloudy humid conditions fostered rapid heterogeneous secondary inorganic aerosol production from local and transported emissions (Transport/Haze period), likely driven by a positive feedback mechanism where water uptake by aerosols increased gas-to-particle partitioning that increased water uptake. Further, clouds reduced solar insolation, suppressing mixing, exacerbating PM2.5 accumulation in a shallow boundary layer. The combination of factors contributing to enhanced PM2.5 is challenging to model, complicating quantification of contributions to PM2.5 from local versus upwind precursors and production. We recommend co-locating additional continuous measurements at a few AirKorea sites across South Korea to help resolve this and other outstanding questions: carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide (transboundary transport tracer), boundary layer height (surface PM2.5 mixing depth), and aerosol composition with aerosol liquid water (meteorologically-dependent secondary production). These data would aid future research to refine emissions targets to further improve South Korean PM2.5 air quality. Copyright: © 2020 The Author(s).

The score consists of five variables (age ≥70 years, mean arterial pressure <90 mm Hg, pH < 7.35, creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, and confusion). In contrast to the previously reported population in southern Israel, a desert climate, we apply the score system to a Japanese humid subtropical climate. Methods: The study included patients with a principal diagnosis of hypothermia who were admitted to our community hospital between January 2008 and January 2019. Using the medical records from initial visits, we retrospectively calculated in-hospital mortality prediction scores along with sensitivity and specificity. Results: We recruited 69 patients, 67 of which had analyzable data. Among them, the in-hospital mortality rate was 25.4%. Hypothermia was defined as mild (32-35°C) in 34 cases (50.7%), moderate (28-32°C) in 23 cases (34.3%), and severe (<28°C) in 10 cases (14.9%). The C-statistics of the in-hospital mortality prediction score was 0.703 (95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.84) for thirty-day survival prediction. After adjustment of the cutoff point of each item with ROC analysis and selection of the variants, the C-statistics of the in-hospital mortality prediction score rose to 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.92). Conclusion: The in-hospital mortality prediction scores showed slightly less predictive value than those in the previous report. With some modification, however, the score system could still be applied efficiently in the humid Japanese subtropical climate. An appropriate management strategy could be established based on the predicted mortality risk. © 2020 The Authors.

There exists variation in state-level responses to climate change, firmly placing it within the context of state-level representation. There are various explanations for policy outcomes at the state level, including public opinion, institutional control, interest group activity, among others. With respect to climate change, another potential explanation provided by scholars for the variation in policy responses is the degree of risk posed by climate change to a particular state. However, climate change serves as a somewhat unique policy position as it is highly visible and has been a polarizing issue in American political discourse. This paper analyzes how risk, political control, and opinion affect policy responses to climate change. Employing multiple measures for state-level action on climate change as well as state-level opinion on the existence and perceived threat of climate change, this analysis theorizes that given the polarized nature of the climate change debate in the United States, public opinion on the realities of climate change and partisan control of state government influences policy outcomes more so than any level of quantified threat from climate change. The causal reasoning for this dual effect is the impact of citizen demands and overarching party ideologies. Even when controlling for wealth, energy industry activity, and political lobbying within states, findings indicate a strong relationship between citizen opinion and partisan control on state-level action on climate change, posing a challenge for combatting long-term impacts of climate change. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","climate change; partisan control; policy outcomes; public opinion; representation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094898295

Building a coordinated, inclusive and green GCV can be an effective and efficient way to achieve carbon emissions mitigation targets for countries that participate highly in GCVs. In this paper, we first describe the energy consumption as well as the territorial and consumption-based carbon emissions of Belarus and its regions from 2010 to 2017. The results show that Belarus has a relatively clean energy structure with 75% of Belarus' energy consumption coming from imported natural gas. The 'chemical, rubber and plastic products' sector has expanded significantly over the past few years; its territorial-based emissions increased 10-fold from 2011 to 2014, with the 'food processing' sector displaying the largest increase in consumption-based emissions. An analysis of regional emissions accounts shows that there is significant regional heterogeneity in Belarus with Mogilev, Gomel and Vitebsk having more energy-intensive manufacturing industries. We then analysed the changes in Belarus' international trade as well as its emission impacts. The results show that Belarus has changed from a net carbon exporter in 2011 to a net carbon importer in 2014. Countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, such as Russia, China, Ukraine, Poland and Kazakhstan, are the main trading partners and carbon emission importers/exporters for Belarus. 'Construction' and 'chemical, rubber and plastic products' are two major emission-importing sectors in Belarus, while 'electricity' and 'ferrous metals' are the primary emission-exporting sectors. Possible low-carbon development pathways are discussed for Belarus through the perspectives of global supply and the value chain. © 2020 The Author(s).","Belarus; CO 2 emissions; greening global value chains; input-output","Energy utilization; Food processing; International trade; Plastic products; Plastics industry; Rubber industry; Rubber products; Carbon emissions; Energy-intensive manufacturing industries; Ferrous metals; Global value chain; Low-carbon development; Primary emissions; Trading partners; Value chains; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094663970

Following this footprint, the transportation sector is experiencing a paradigm shift and the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) has prodigious plausibility in reducing carbon emission. However, the anticipated EV penetration is hindered by several challenges, among them are their shorter driving range, slower charging rate and the lack of ubiquitous availability of charging locations, which collectively contribute to range anxieties for EVs' drivers. Meanwhile, the expected immense EV load onto the power distribution network may degrade the voltage stability. To reduce the range anxiety, we present a two-stage solution to provision and dimension a DC fast charging station (CS) network for the anticipated energy demand and that minimizes the deployment cost while ensuring a certain quality of experience for charging e.g., acceptable waiting time and shorter travel distance to charge. This solution also maintains the voltage stability by considering the distribution grid capacity, determining transformers' rating to support peak demand of EV charging and adding a minimum number of voltage regulators based on the impact over the power distribution network. We propose, evaluate and compare two CS network expansion models to determine a cost-effective and adaptive CSs provisioning solution that can efficiently expand the CS network to accommodate future EV charging and conventional load demands.

Traditional land-cover classification methods with multi-feature extractions on specific scene perform well on a single river basin, however, poorly address inter-basin classification owing to the varied texture shown in satellite images cross river basins (e.g., topography and climates). Current transfer learning approaches with domain adaptation, which can shorten the discrepancies between two river basins, pay less attention to diversity of multi-feature extractions given by remote sensing images, which may lead to negative transfer. To better address the above challenges, this paper proposes a model known as Dual Adversarial Networks for Land-cover Classification (DANLC). Our DANLC architecture consists of two domain adversarial networks in a paralleled structure, namely RGB and texture networks, for multi-feature extractions, which are able to capture the underlying representation of satellite images from different perspectives and get invariable transfer component. Results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model in both the classification effect and robustness compared with traditional methods and state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Application programs; Image texture; Remote sensing; Rivers; Textures; Topography; Watersheds; Adversarial networks; Domain adaptation; Land cover classification; Learning approach; Remote sensing images; Satellite images; Scene classification; State of the art; Transfer learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094128642

In the future DC distribution system, as the line load continues to increase, more and more single-core cables work in parallel with multiple cables of the same pole., and how to evenly distribute the parallel circuit current has always been a key issue restricting the parallel operation of the cable in same-pole. Starting from the operation control of grid connected AC/DC converter under unbalanced grid voltage, this paper gives theoretical derivation that the busbar current of DC system always has double frequency harmonics. Then, referring to the three-phase AC system, based on the impedance parameter calculation method of'conductor-earth', the calculation method of AC impedance parameters of multi-circuit cable lines in symmetrical bipolar and monopole DC system is deduced. On the basis of the theoretical analysis, conclusion is put forward, which is, in symmetrical monopole DC system, the current sharing is the best when the mutual impedance between the positive and negative pole cables is equal in each circuit. Finally, supported by a symmetrical bipolar DC power distribution demonstration project in Shenzhen, this paper optimizes the DC bus layout scheme with two cables running in parallel through the finite element calculation. It also verifies derivation of harmonic current sharing in the symmetrical monopole DC system proposed in this paper. © 2020 IEEE.","AC DC hybrid distribution system; DC single core power cable; Optimal layout scheme; Parallel operation of the same polarity cables; Unbalanced power grid","Automobile electronic equipment; Cables; DC power transmission; Electric impedance; Electric towers; Emission control; Energy storage; Poles; Rectifying circuits; DC distribution system; Dc power distribution; Demonstration project; Development directions; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Harmonic current sharing; Theoretical derivations; Unbalanced grid voltages; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093978809

In the past decades, the renewable energy has been developed rapidly. However, intermittent power supply, such as wind and photovoltaic power supply, is random and volatile, which will bring some difficulties to the optimal scheduling of power system after it is connected to the grid. In order to solve this problem, an operation multi-objective optimization model of integrated energy system (IES) was proposed to optimize system operation cost, carbon emission and primary energy consumption to the maximum extent. Then, this paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization algorithm, called multiple target cross entropy algorithm based on decomposition (MOCE/D), trans-forming multi-objective operation problems into a series of single objective optimization subproblems, and by considering the sup-ply and demand balance of power, natural gas, cold and thermal energy and the operation limitation of each module to solve the integrated energy system model of non-convexity, nonlinear, and multi-local optimal problems. Finally, the overall performance of the proposed MOCE/D algorithm is comprehensively studied. The results of statistical simulation show that, compared with the traditional CCHP system, the proposed operation multi-objective optimization model of integrated energy system (IES) can effec-tively reduce the operation cost, carbon emission and primary energy consumption. In addition, MOCE/D has better optimiza-tion effect and stronger competitiveness compared with other algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.","integrated energy system; multi-objective optimization; power system; renewable energy","Carbon; Deterioration; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Operating costs; Photovoltaic cells; Ecological environments; Integrated energy systems; Local optimal problems; Multi-objective optimization models; Photovoltaic power supply; Primary energy consumption; Single objective optimization; Statistical simulation; Multiobjective optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093929938

Two sets of tests with idle (850-900 rpm) and mid-range (2500 rpm) are considered. Experiments were performed for three identical engines with different mileages and obtained results were discussed. According to the obtained results, after applying changes to the engine management system, a 22% reduction in the unburned hydrocarbon emission in both cases was obtained. Furthermore, it is found that 31 and 5% reduction in carbon monoxide emissions in the idle and mid-range were obtained, respectively.

Identifying the location of artificially drained areas is an important step in achieving environmentally sustainable agricultural production. However, in many regions, data on the presence or the distribution of artificial drainage systems are rare. We outline an approach to identify artificially drained soils using Earth observation (EO) satellite imagery and digital elevation data. The method exploits the contrasting phenology of grass during a peak growth stage to identify artificially drained and undrained soils. Two machine-learning techniques, support vector machine and random forest, were tested. Classification accuracy up to 91% was achieved using photointerpreted accuracy points using higher resolution satellite imagery. Additional investigations would be required to establish whether the drained conditions identified were a result of artificial drainage or from naturally well-drained soils occurring within larger soil units. Herein, the Republic of Ireland is used as a test case. Based on our findings, the area of artificially drained grassland within the study area could be revised upward, with 44% (or 1/4345, 000 ha) of pasture currently classed as ""poorly drained""identified as ""artificially drained.""At one location, a change in the modeled drainage condition at field level was demonstrated following drain installation. The presented method demonstrates the ability of EO satellites to quickly and accurately map field drainage status at farm management scales over a wide area. This has the potential to improve management decisions at local scales, but also has implications in terms of national policy development and regulation in areas such as water quality and climate change mitigation. © 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","artificial drainage; grassland; heavy soils; Landsat","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Decision trees; Farms; Learning systems; Observatories; Satellite imagery; Soils; Support vector machines; Water quality; Classification accuracy; Climate change mitigation; Digital elevation data; Drainage condition; Management decisions; Poorly drained soils; Republic of Ireland; Sustainable agricultural; Drainage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092623022

Focusing on efforts to encourage environmental sustainability by organisations within three northern English cities, it highlights how a process of 'integrative marginalisation' may be observed, in which radical visions of a low-carbon future are simultaneously embraced and excluded at an institutional scale. Integrative marginalisation displays four salient features: initial welcome and acceptance; relatively small investments of support; the exclusion of substantial changes from mainstream decision making; and the assertion of institutional priorities that limit potential action.

Using a SC model, energy cost, actual power loads during peak periods, and carbon dioxide emission can be minimized. For the SC problem, many researchers have proposed various evolutionary algorithms including CCGBSO, which applied cooperative coevolution to GBSO. However, there is still room to improve quality of the solution by CCGBSO.

Industrial flue gases which contain 3-30% CO2 (v/v) are a major constituent of global CO2 emissions. Employing microalgae for biological fixation of CO2 from flue gas is a prospective strategy for the reduction of CO2 emissions since microalgae have the capability of utilizing inorganic carbon to rapidly generate biomass via photosynthesis. In the current study, the locally isolated microalgal strains Chlorella sp. and Desmodesmus sp. were employed to assess the CO2 sequestration potential from simulated flue gas, comparable to the emissions from the cement industry. The gross calorific values (GCVs) were determined to evaluate the potential of employing microalgal biomass for co-firing processes. Desmodesmus sp. showed the highest CO2 tolerance, as it exhibited a biomass productivity and CO2 fixation rate of 1.17 g L-1 and 0.26 g L-1 day-1 respectively under undiluted flue gas (15.50% CO2). However, the GCVs of Chlorella sp. biomass were higher than Desmodesmus sp. biomass under all flue gas dilutions. Nonetheless, the GCVs of Desmodesmus sp. were in the range of 23.277-24.202 MJ/kg, comparable to biomass typically used in co-firing applications. © 2020 IEEE.","cement flue gas; Chlorella sp; CO2fixation; Desmodesmus sp; gross calorific value; microalgae","Algae; Biomass; Carbon dioxide process; Cement industry; Cements; Engineering research; Flue gases; Flues; Gas emissions; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Microorganisms; Biological fixation; Biomass productivity; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 sequestration; Gross calorific values; Inorganic carbon; Microalgal biomass; Simulated flue gas; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092037162

Contrarily to continental areas, studies on cyanobacteria in islands are scarce and need to be reinforced, since climate change impacts are expected to be harsher in islands, due to their geographical isolation and higher exposition to external influences. Here we present a review of the occurrence of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in inland and coastal ecosystems in the Atlantic Ocean islands. These microorganisms were reported from diverse habitats, including saline thermal lakes (Iceland), freshwater lakes, terrestrial habitats (Azores, Cuba), and marine coastal areas, either planktonic (Madeira, Canary Islands, Cape Verde) or associated to plants and corals (Brazil, Caribbean Sea). Most of cyanobacteria were reported from freshwaters but some species were found in different habitats. Species richness also varied between islands, with higher number in islands located in temperate regions, and the number of common taxa was low (1-3%). Several toxic species and different types of cyanotoxins were also reported in the Atlantic islands, which are expected to increase with climate change. Mitigation measures should be considered to avoid cyanotoxins risks to environmental and public health. This works shows the great potential of Atlantic islands for cyanobacteria taxonomic, ecological and biogeography research, but more studies are needed with emphasis on less studied islands and habitats and using novel approaches as molecular systematics tools. Furthermore, such studies are of paramount importance for environmental conservation and management strategies, especially facing climate changes. ©","Azores; biodiversity; cHABs; climate change; Cuba; Iceland; Oceanic islands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091996933

These assessments are needed to project which populations will better tolerate or respond to global warming across the tree species distribution range. Warmer and drier conditions have been forecasted for the Mediterranean Basin, where Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is the most widely distributed conifer in dry sites. This species shows plastic growth responses to climate, being particularly sensitive to drought. We evaluated how 32 Aleppo pine forests responded to climate during the second half of the 20th century by using dendrochronology. Climatic constraints of radial growth were inferred by fitting the Vaganov–Shashkin (VS-Lite) growth model to ring-width data from our Aleppo pine forest network. Our findings reported that Aleppo pine growth decreased and showed the highest common coherence among trees in dry, continental sites located in southeastern and eastern inland Spain and Algeria. In contrast, growth increased in wetter sites located in northeastern Spain. Overall, across the Aleppo pine network tree growth was enhanced by prior wet winters and cool and wet springs, whilst warm summers were associated with less growth. The relationships between site ring-width chronologies were higher in nearby forests. This explains why Aleppo pine growth was distinctly linked to indices of atmospheric circulation patterns depending on the geographical location of the forests. The western forests were more influenced by moisture and temperature conditions driven by the Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO) and the Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the southern forests by the East Atlantic (EA) and the august NAO, while the Balearic, Tunisian and northeastern sites by the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Scandinavian pattern (SCA). The climatic constraints for Aleppo pine tree growth and its biogeographical variability were well captured by the VS-Lite model. The model performed better in dry and continental sites, showing strong growth coherence between trees and climatic limitations of growth. Further research using similar broad-scale approaches to climate–growth relationships in drought-prone regions deserves more attention. © 2020 by the authors.

Dimensions of the system box considered in this paper are electrically small at the failure frequency. This result in a complex wave impedance for the radiated emissions at the system box boundary which is in the near field region of the unintentional radiators on the system board. A metamaterial frequency selective absorber is developed to exhibit the target surface impedance for the wave impedance by finding an equivalent bulk material. It is shown that the most effective absorber in near field should conjugate match to the wave impedance at that location.

The data from tomato-growers was analyzed using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach to separate the efficient and inefficient ones and to identify the wasteful uses of energy in tomato production. The study also helped to determine the effects of the energy optimization on reducing GHG emission. The results revealed that technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of farmers were 0.71, 0.91 and 0.78, respectively. Also, energy saving target ratio for tomato production was calculated as 16.78%. It means that 7441.50 MJ ha'1 of total input energy could be saved while holding the constant level of tomato yield. Moreover, the highest contribution to total energy saving was made by fertilizer with 37.28% of total saving, followed by diesel fuel (35.17%) and farmyard manure (9.67%).

How to objectively evaluate the effect of emission reduction and achieve accurate prediction of air quality simulation is a research hotspot in the field of atmospheric environment. In order to accurately evaluate the emission reduction effect of air pollution process and the simulation effect of air quality, a data mining algorithm is proposed to evaluate and simulate the emission reduction effect of air pollution. Firstly, using the conventional meteorological data of Beijing Olympic Sports Center Station, and choosing two air pollution processes of March 11-14, 2018 and March 14-17, 2013, the atmospheric capacity coefficient is calculated, the evaluation index of model performance is selected, and the relationship between environmental pollution and economic growth is analyzed by decoupling tool. Then, KNN data mining algorithm and WRF-Chem model are used to compare. The average PM2.5 concentration with or without emission reduction was analyzed. Finally, the air quality was simulated and the correlation between simulation value and monitoring value was evaluated by using evaluation index. The results show that the emission reduction method based on KNN data mining algorithm can better predict the change trend of PM2.5 average concentration, and strongly illustrate the effectiveness of air pollution reduction. The numerical simulation results of air quality are basically consistent with the monitoring values, which verifies the accuracy of the method. In general, PM2.5 concentration in the air pollution process in 2018 is significantly lower than that in similar meteorological conditions, which reflects the long-term and vigorous emission reduction effect. © 2020 Parlar Scientific Publications.

The use of renewable energy and particularly the solar thermal energy represents one of the most promising alternative strategies. In Kosovo, the global horizontal radiation ranges from 1241 kWh/m2 per year in Shterpce to 1461 kWh/m2 per year in Gjakova, while the average for Kosovo can be estimated at 1351 kWh/m2 per year. The average sun duration for the city of Pristine is 5.44 h, while the average horizontal irradiation is 3.79 kWh/m2 per day. Participation of energy consumption in household is still dominant - about 41.4% of the total consumption in Kosovo, 15% of this energy is used for domestic hot water. This energy demand can be lowered significantly by using improved building construction techniques and utilization of RES-s, especially solar thermal. The first step is to map the city in different areas to locate suitable locations for the installation of solar collectors serving sanitary hot water. The demand for sanitary hot water varies from object to object, this variation depends on whether the building is individual or collective, school institutions or religious buildings, for this reason the classification of buildings was done according to the request for sanitary hot water. After that the demand for sanitary hot water is calculated for several different institutions: Residential houses, Dormitories and Hospitals. For all of the above-mentioned cases the data for: solar fraction, solar contribution, CO2 avoided, collector temperature, financial analysis etc. are gained using the TSOL 2018 software. To evaluate the activation energy for a time period, the daily, monthly and annual performance for three systems which are located in University Clinical Center of Pristine, Kosovo have been analyzed. In addition the results of the mathematical model, simulation and measured solar energy contribution for solar station in Infective disease clinic have been compared. In this paper, a proposal for replacing the conventional water heaters with the domestic solar water heaters (DSWH) is made. A case study for 38289 Residential households in Pristine has been selected. The initial cost of the solar water heater for the city is 60113730 ε. The system saves 7274910 € annually and reduced Co2 emission by 22973400 kg. The results from the paper show that the DSWH is economically feasible in Pristine and can result in fuel saving and CO2 emission reduction. © 2020 by the authors.","CO2 reduction; Domestic hot water; Energy analysis; F-chart method; Renewable energy; Saving electricity; Solar thermal energy; T*SOL2018",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091207787

On these grounds, we here discuss a means to protect over 25 million people and important economical regions in northern Europe against sea level rise. We propose the construction of a Northern European Enclosure Dam (NEED) that stretches between France, the United Kingdom, and Norway. NEED may seem an overwhelming and unrealistic solution at first. However, our preliminary study suggests that NEED is potentially favorable financially, but also in scale, impacts, and challenges compared to that of alternative solutions, such as (managed) migrations and that of country-by-country protection efforts. The mere realization that a solution as considerable as NEED might be a viable and cost-effective protection measure is illustrative of the extraordinary global threat of global-mean sea level rise that we are facing. As such, the concept of constructing NEED showcases the extent of protection efforts that are required if mitigation efforts fail to limit sea level rise. ©2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Enclosures; Alternative solutions; Climate change mitigation; Cost-effective protection; Global mean sea levels; Global threats; Sea level rise; United kingdom; Sea level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090978844

Decarbonising cities involves complex strategic planning and needs system level thinking and changes. This has been increasingly realised at the municipal level, but challenges remain regarding the tools, involvement of stakeholders and on the development of policies. The focus of the research is on the use of participatory foresight for fostering smart energy transition on a municipal level, the key benefits and success factors that participatory foresight brings, and the replicability of this approach. Within the novel Cities4ZERO framework, an overarching methodology for a smart urban decarbonisation transition, guiding cities through the process of developing the most appropriate strategies, plans, projects, as well as looking for the commitment of key local stakeholders for an effective transition-foresight framework, was developed and tested in five pilot cities.

The annual total comprehensive building energy consumption was 31.37-128.08 kWh/(m2·a). The annual total CO2 emissions from building operation in the coach stations was 17.01-134.77 kgCO2/(m2·a).

The energy consumption and CO2 emission level of coach stations and that of other kinds of public buildings were compared. Results showed that the energy consumption and CO2 emission levels of coach stations investigated were relatively low, mainly because the passenger thermal comfort was scarified. Based on the investigation data, energy consumption analysis models of coach stations in five regions were established by simulation when the passenger thermal comfort was met.

A large energy-saving potential and emission reduction potential can be achieved, among others, by understanding energy consumption patterns in more detail. However, existing studies show that it requires many input parameters or disaggregated individual end-uses input data to generate the load profiles. Therefore, we have developed a simplified approach, called weighted proportion (Wepro) model, to synthesise the residential electricity load profile by proportionally matching the city's main characteristics: Age group, labour force and gender structure with the representative households profiles provided in the load profile generator. The findings indicate that the synthetic load profiles can represent the local electricity consumption characteristics in the case city of amsterdam based on time variation analyses. The approach is in particular advantageous to tackle the drawbacks of the existing studies and the standard load model used by the utilities. Furthermore, the model is found to be more efficient in the computational process of the residential sector's load profiles, given the number of households in the city that is represented in the local profile. © 2020 by the authors.","ALPG; Electricity; Household; Load profiles; LPG; Modelling; Residential; Wepro model","Emission control; Energy conservation; Housing; Loads (forces); Computational process; Electricity-consumption; Emission reduction potentials; Energy saving potential; Input parameter; Residential electricity; Residential energy; Residential sectors; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090804460

The aim of this work is to define a methodology that helps decision makers in air quality planning, combining two different approaches: Source-Apportionment techniques (SA) and Integrated Assessment Modelling (IAM). These techniques have been applied over a domain in Northern Italy to analyze the contribution of emission sources on PM10 concentration and to compute an optimal policy, obtained through a multi-objective optimization approach that minimizes both the PM10 yearly average concentration and the policy implementation costs. The results are compared to the Po Basin air quality plan impacts. The source-apportionment technique and the IAM optimization approach show intervention priorities in three main sectors: residential heating, agriculture, and road transport. The Po Basin air quality plan is effective in reducing PM10 concentrations, but not efficient, as a matter of fact the cost-effective policy at the same cost has a higher impact on air quality and on greenhouse gases emissions reduction. © 2020 by the authors.

Decision‐makers from local to national scales will be tasked with planning under conditions of high uncertainty, often with minimal data. Participatory scenario planning is a method for devising adaptation strategies under high uncertainty, and we hypothesized that it could also be used for identifying systemic, inclusive, and transformative adaptation options at the community scale, and for highlighting opportunities for cross‐scalar collaboration. We conducted scenario exercises with two communities in southeastern Nigeria that have experienced increasing flooding and other challenges linked to climate variability. Both communities identified drivers of change that intersect with climate, as well as community‐scale actions that would improve adaptation to a range of future scenarios. We found evidence that scenario exercises can stimulate communities to develop transformative approaches to climate adaptation that seek to reduce climate risk by creating new systems and processes. We also found that community‐identified priorities for strategic action highlight how larger‐scale interventions could coordinate with communities to adapt more effectively. Participatory scenario planning is therefore a potentially important tool for adaptation planning in regions in which future conditions are highly uncertain. © 2020 by the authors.

A wide spectrum of moderately to well-preserved palynomorphs represent a high Middle Triassic plant diversity. Based on the distribution of diverse spore-pollen assemblages five Anisian Palynozones (A-E) and two Ladinian ones (F, G) are differentiated. Throughout these Palynozones the occurrence of spores and pollen, assigned to plant groups so far known only from the Palaeozoic, shed a new light on the evolution of plant assemblages during the Triassic. The comparison of Palynozones A-G with palynostratigraphic schemes from the central part of the Germanic Basin and from the Tethyan realm demonstrate the regional variability of marker species ranges - especially for the Anisian. In agreement with the lithological record, two prominent transgressive events (Lower Muschelkalk, Upper Muschelkalk) are indicated by increased abundances of marine particulate organic matter in palynofacies data. Marginal marine influence is documented at the base of the studied interval, comprising the Buntsandstein and the base of the Lower Muschelkalk. Carbonate carbon isotopes data show a negative shift at the boundary between Lower and Middle Muschelkalk. Coincidently, a prominent change in relative abundances of climate-sensitive plant groups (e.g. Triadispora spp. vs. Pteridophytes) indicate a change to relatively dryer climatic conditions during the Middle Muschelkalk. © 2020 Universita degli Studi di Milano.

Going forward, and supported by policy, a stratification of passenger car powertrain options is anticipated, with customers able to choose from a zero-tailpipe emission battery electric vehicle (BEV), fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) or a selection of hybridised vehicles ranging from a mild to a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Further to this, technology improvements and connectivity between vehicle and energy generation and supply offer further opportunities to accelerate reduction in carbon emissions in the transport sector. The structure of this new transport paradigm is pathway dependent. Multiple conflicts exist, pulling the system in different directions and threatening its sustainability.

This will require the world to move to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and numerous governments have committed to reach net zero by this date, or even earlier. It is widely recognised that achieving net zero at the state, country and regional levels will necessitate a systems-wide approach across all the major sources of GHG emissions, which include power generation, transport, industrial processes and heating. Land use is also critical with billions of trees needing to be planted and a change in the amount of meat eaten. There is a growing realisation that hydrogen has a vital role to play, particularly to decarbonise sectors and applications that are otherwise extremely difficult to abate, such as industrial processes, heavy duty freight movement, dispatchable power generation and heating applications. Hydrogen will also provide long-term (for instance seasonal) energy storage, enabling much greater uptake of renewable power generation, which itself is a key prerequisite of the clean energy transition. Hydrogen can play a role in the decarbonisation of all major segments, and this means it can facilitate cross-sector coupling, enabling the exploitation of synergies between different key parts of the economy. This article discusses the different production routes to low and zero carbon hydrogen, and its uses across numerous applications to minimise and eliminate carbon dioxide and GHG emissions, building a picture of the key role that hydrogen will play in the energy transition and the broader global move towards decarbonisation and climate stabilisation. An overview of some of the ongoing and planned demonstration projects will be presented, outlining the importance of such activities in providing confidence that the hydrogen approach is the right one for multiple geographies around the world and that there are technologies that are ready to be deployed today. © 2020 Johnson Matthey.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Decarbonization; Economics; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Industrial emissions; Land use; Demonstration project; Energy transitions; Global temperatures; Heating applications; Industrial processs; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Pre-industrial levels; Renewable power generation; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090434161

This shift to the smart grid concept involves, among others, the utilization of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar panels and storage systems, contributing towards grid decentralization while improving control over power generation. In order to seamlessly integrate DERs into power systems, embedded devices are used to support the communication and control functions of DERs. As a result, vulnerabilities of such components can be ported to the industrial environment. Insecure control networks and protocols further exacerbate the problem. Towards reducing the attack surface, we present an authentication scheme for DERs, DERauth, which leverages the inherent entropy of the DER battery energy storage system (BESS) as a root-of-trust. The DER authentication is achieved using a challenge-reply mechanism that relies on the corresponding DER's BESS state-of-charge (SoC) and voltage measurements. A dynamically updating process ensures that the BESS state is up-to-date. We evaluate our proof-of-concept in a prototype development that uses lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries for the BESS. The robustness of our design is assessed against modeling attacks performed by neural networks. © 2020 IEEE.","Authentication; Battery energy storage systems; Distributed energy resources; Power grid","Authentication; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy storage; Lithium-ion batteries; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; VLSI circuits; Authentication scheme; Battery energy storage systems; Carbon emissions; Communication and control; Distributed Energy Resources; Industrial environments; Prototype development; Rooftop solar panels; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090401309

Future typical weather files are widespread, but few researchers have put together methodologies to reproduce future extreme conditions. Furthermore, climate uncertainties need to be considered and it is often difficult due to the lack of data accessibility. In this article, we propose a methodology to re-assemble future weather files ready-to-use for building simulations using data from the European Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) dynamically downscaled regional climate multi-year projections. It is the first time that this database is used to assemble weather files for building simulations because of its recent availability. Two types of future weather files are produced: typical weather years (TWY) and heatwave events (HWE). Combined together, they can be used to fully assess building resilience to overheating in future climate conditions. A case study building in Paris is modelled to compare the impact of the different weather files on the indoor operative temperature of the building. The results confirm that it is better to use multiple types of future weather files, climate models, and or scenarios to fully grasp climate projection uncertainties. © 2020 MDPI AG.

In this study, we investigated the alterations in chemical compositions, surface functionalities, and N speciation initiated by different carbonization temperatures (350, 500, and 650 ◦C) and the effects of these alterations on N bioavailability in soil. The objective was to identify suitable temperature condition(s) for the conversion of CLCM into a carbonized product of appropriate bio-recalcitrance that is capable of improving N bioavailability in soil more than the un-carbonized CLCM. The results showed an increased bio-recalcitrance of the manure with increasing carbonization temperatures due to drastic changes in the chemical makeup and accumulation of heterocyclic aromatic N structures. Subsequently, these alterations in the chemical makeup and state of the organic N species in the manure affected N bioavailability in soil. Notably, N bioavailability of CLCM and benefits on plants were improved when soil was supplied with CLCM that was altered at 350 ◦C. With these observations, we concluded that alterations in chemical and surface structural compositions and N speciation at 350 ◦C are optimum for instituting the required bio-recalcitrance to CLCM in order to improve N bioavailability in soil for plants. © 2020 by the authors.

BEVs are being positioned as one significant strand in the web of policy intended to translate the good intentions of Article 2 of the Conference of the Parties 21 Paris Agreement into reality. Governments and municipalities are anticipating that a widespread shift to BEVs will significantly reduce transport-related carbon emissions and, therefore, augment their nationally determined contributions to emissions reduction within the Paris Agreement. However, matters are more complicated than they may appear. There is a difference between thinking we can just keep relying on human ingenuity to solve problems after they emerge and engaging in fundamental social redesign to prevent the trajectories of harm. BEVs illustrate this. The contribution to emissions reduction per vehicle unit may be less than the public initially perceive since the important issue here is the lifecycle of the BEV and this is in no sense zero-emission. Furthermore, even though one can make the case that BEVs are a superior alternative to the fossil fuel-powered internal combustion engine, the transition to BEVs may actually facilitate exceeding the carbon budget on which the Paris Agreement ultimately rests. Whether in fact it does depends on the nature of the policy that shapes the transition. If the transition is a form of substitution that conforms to rather than shifts against current global scales and trends in private transportation, then it is highly likely that BEVs will be a successful failure. For this not to be the case, then the transition to BEVs must be coordinated with a transformation of the current scales and trends in private transportation. That is, a significant reduction in dependence on and individual ownership of powered vehicles, a radical reimagining of the nature of private conveyance and of public transportation. © The Author(s) 2020.

Among renewable fuels and heat pumps, waste heat utilization has an important role in Fortum's plans for the decarbonization of district heating production, and Fortum is considering the possibility of utilizing waste heat from a large data center in its district heating network. The goal of this paper is to investigate the feasibility and required amount of waste heat to achieve this goal. Two different operation strategies are introduced - an operation strategy based on marginal costs and an operation strategy prioritizing waste heat utilization. Each strategy is modeled with three different electricity price scenarios. Because the low temperature waste heat from a data center must be primed by heat pumps, the electricity price has a significant impact on the feasibility of waste heat utilization. Prioritizing waste heat utilization leads to higher production costs, but a lower waste heat capacity is needed to reach the goal of 95x00025; renewables in production. The higher electricity price emphasizes the differences between the two operation strategies. Waste heat utilization also leads to significant reductions of CO2emissions. © 2020 MDPI AG.

The CO2 emission from soil, the respiration of coarse wood debris, the total respiration, and the net fluxes of CO2 and water vapor were evaluated. In areas of dead spruce forest affected by xylophages and saprotrophs, as well as by windfall, a noticeable decrease in specific gross respiration is absent. This is related to the fact that reduced CO2 respiration of living trees is compensated by emission from coarse wood debris and a sharp (3- to 3.5-fold) and long-term (no less than six years long) rise in soil respiration (hotspots) under dead-standing spruce trees. The contribution to carbon emission from soil hotspots per unit area in dead spruce stands under dry standing trees is greater than the role of decomposition of coarse wood debris (14.4 and 9%, respectively). The observation period is characterized by a significant decrease in the annual net CO2 sink in the area studied: from –300 to –95 g C m–2 year–1, which is followed by reduced evapotranspiration (0.0116 g H2O m–2 s–1 in May–October 2018 as compared to 0.0142 g H2O m–2 s–1 in the same period of 2010). We assume that the observed decrease in carbon uptake is related both to the reduction in the primary spruce productivity and to an increase in gross respiration from larger areas of decomposed spruce trees. The calculations show that if the area of the dead spruce stands is further increased to 27%, the resulting net balance of the territory will switch to a CO2 source for the atmosphere. This should be taken into account for remote forecasting. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","carbon net balance; climate change; coarse wood debris; deadwood; extreme weather events; Picea abies; taiga; windfall; xylophages; СО2 efflux from the soil","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Debris; Soils; Carbon emissions; Carbon exchange; Coarse wood debris; Long-term effects; Observation Period; Soil respiration; Spruce productivity; Spruce stands; Forestry; boreal forest; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; coarse woody debris; respiration; soil emission; water vapor; Novgorod; Russian Federation; Picea; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089961921

Therefore, high octane numbers reduce the engine knocking risk, leading to higher compression threshold and, consequently, higher engine efficiencies. This allows higher compression ratios to be considered during the engine design stage. Current spark-ignited (SI) engines use knock sensors to protect the engine from knocking, usually adapting the operation parameters (boost pressure, spark timing, lambda). Moreover, some engines can move the settings towards optimized parameters if knock is not detected, leading to higher performance and fuel economy. In this work, three gasolines with different octane ratings (95, 98 and 100 RON (research octane number)) were fueled in a high-performance vehicle. Tests were performed in a chassis dyno at controlled ambient conditions, including a driving sequence composed of full-load accelerations and two steady-state modes. Vehicle power significantly increased with the octane rating of the fuel, thus decreasing the time needed for acceleration. Moreover, the specific fuel consumption decreased as the octane rating increased, proving that the fuel can take an active part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The boost pressure, which increased with the octane number, was identified as the main factor, whereas the ignition advance was the second relevant factor. © 2020 by the authors.","Fuel economy; Knock sensor; Knocking; Octane number; Performance; Spark-ignition; Vehicle acceleration","Antiknock rating; Combustion knock; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Machine design; Ambient conditions; High-performance vehicles; Higher compression ratios; Operation parameters; Optimized parameter; Research octane number; Spark-ignited engines; Specific fuel consumption; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089916303

Therefore, it is useful to quantify how these savings help to achieve the energy balance of a Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) compared to an air source heat pump or a condensing boiler coupled to a chiller. This paper assesses how these savings affect the number of photovoltaic panels installed on the roof of a building to obtain the NZEB target. The study is conducted by dynamic simulation for a building used as a bed and breakfast, virtually placed in two Italian towns. The energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions, the percentage of renewable energy used, and the photovoltaic surface needed are assessed. Finally, the discounted payback period is calculated. The results show that the GSHP, unlike the systems to which it is compared, allows an NZEB to be obtained by balancing yearly energy consumption with energy production systems which only use on-site renewable energy sources (by exploiting the surface available on the roof) for both of the climatic conditions considered. GSHP also allows primary energy requests equal to or less than 57 kWh/m2 to be obtained. © 2020 by the authors.","Dynamic simulation; Ground source heat pump; HVAC system; NZEB; Photovoltaic panels; Renewable energy sources","Air source heat pumps; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Roofs; Zero energy buildings; Climatic conditions; Condensing boilers; Energy production systems; Groundsource heat pump (GSHP); Net-zero energy buildings; Photovoltaic panels; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089914735

Oxy-petcoke combustion is an attractive CO2 capture option as it avoids the use of additional absorption units and chemicals, and results in a CO2 + H2O flue gas stream that is compressed and dehydrated in a CO2 capture and purification unit (CO2CPU). The additional cost of the CO2CPU can be reduced through high pressure combustion. Hence, this paper reports a techno-economic analysis of an oxy-petcoke plant with CO2 capture simulated at pressures between 1 and 15 bars in Aspen Plus™ based on USA and KSA scenarios. Operating at high pressures leads to reduced equipment sizes and numbers of units, specifically compressors in CO2CPU, resulting in increased efficiencies and decreased costs. An optimum pressure of ∼10 bars was found to maximize the plant efficiency (∼29.7%) and minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), cost of CO2 avoided and cost of CO2 captured for both the USA and KSA scenarios. The LCOE was found to be moderately sensitive to changes in the capital cost (∼0.7% per %) and increases in cost of petcoke (∼0.5% per USD/tonne) and insensitive to the costs of labour, utilities and waste treatment. © 2020 by the authors.","AspenPlus™ simulation; CO2capture; Oxy-fuel combustion; Petroleum coke; Pressurized combustion","Air purification; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Computer software; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Fossil fuels; Gasoline; Petroleum analysis; Petroleum coke; Petroleum industry; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; High-pressure combustion; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Levelized cost of electricities; Oil producing countries; Oxyfuel combustion; Plant efficiency; Techno-Economic analysis; United States of America; Petroleum refining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089909324

The city has carried out massive air pollution-control programmes since 2012. As a result, the concentrations of air pollutants in Lanzhou have decreased. In order to examine the effects of air pollution-control programmes on air temperature, the differences in air temperatures between Lanzhou and Yuzhong (a small county adjacent to Lanzhou) and their change between 2009–2011 (P1) and 2013–2015 (P2) were calculated. The results showed that the maximum (minimum) temperature difference significantly increased (decreased) by 0.32°C (0.40°C) in winter (summer) between P1 and P2, indicating an increase (decrease) of the maximum (minimum) temperature in winter (summer) in Lanzhou caused by the reduction in air pollution. Therefore, the diurnal temperature range in Lanzhou increased by 0.50°C in summer and 0.22°C in winter during P2 compared with P1. The increase in the maximum temperature in winter and the decrease in the minimum temperature in summer are supported by a decrease in mean air temperature at night and by an increase of mean air temperature in daytime in winter and summer during P2 compared with P1. The increase in temperature in daytime may be ascribed to more absorption of solar radiation at the surface. The decrease in temperature at night in summer is caused by increasing light rainfall. The decrease in temperature at night during winter may be related to more loss of surface heat through long wave radiation. © 2020 The Authors.

To mitigate floods, pluvial risk maps with climate change scenarios have been developed to help major urban areas adapt to a changing climate. In some cases, subnational governments have played a key role to develop these maps. However, governance research about the role of subnational governments in geospatial data development in urban water transitions has received little attention. To address this gap, this research applies the Governance Assessment Tool as an evaluative framework to increase our understanding of the governance factors that support the development of pluvial flood risk maps at the subnational level. For this research, we selected the region of Flanders in Belgium. This region is considered among the frontrunners when it comes to the creation of a pluvial flood risk map with climate change scenarios. Data have been collected through in-depth interviews with steering committee actors involved in the development process of the map. The research identified that the current governance context is supportive of the creation of the flood risk map. The government of Flanders plays a key role in this process. The most supportive qualities of the governance context are those related to the degree of fragmentation (extent and coherence), while the less supportive ones are those related to the “quest for control” (flexibility and intensity). Under this governance context, government actors play the primary role. The Flemish government led the maps' creation process and it was supported by the lower governmental levels. As the provincial government was an important actor to increase local participation, collaboration with private and non-governmental actors in the steering committee was more limited. The financial resources were also limited and the process required a continuous development of trust. Yet, the Flemish Environmental Agency, with the use of technology, was able to increase such trust during the process. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Supplemented with theories and principles from ecology, the model's economic strategies refer whether the project considers meaningful part of the produced electricity for generating a local economy; environmental strategy comprises embodied energy, energy storage and self-maintenance; social strategy includes whether the project considers generating active and passive interaction using on-site electricity. Ballast Point Park in Sydney was used as a test bed to examine the model and sustainability of park's renewable energy use. The findings showed that environmental strategies were evident in the park, social strategies remained average and economic strategies with renewable energy were lacking. Interactions with on-site produced electricity was further claimed to be an imperative feature of any public space.

Rural electrification via gasification has the potential to satisfy electricity access and demand. This study conducts an economic evaluation of rural electrification through gasification of biomass and municipal solid waste (MSW) using a 60 kW downdraft gasifier, developed at Oklahoma State University. The effects of feedstock cost, electricity selling price, feed-in-tariff, tipping fee, tax rate, and the output power are evaluated using major financial parameters: the net present value, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, simple payback period, and discounted payback period, and sensitivity analysis. Results show that the downdraft gasification power system offers a payback period of 7.7 years, while generating an internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value of 10.9%, 7.7%, and $84,550, respectively. Results from a sensitivity analysis indicate that the feed-in-tariff has the greatest positive contribution to the project’s net present value. Using MSW, the gasification power system potentially reduces carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide emissions as compared to direct combustion and landfill. The technology provides a promising future for rural electrification utilizing biomass and MSW whilst offering economic and environmental benefits for local communities. © 2020 by the authors.

Background and Objectives: Land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) are significant sources of carbon emissions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed that the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus program, also known as REDD+, could contribute to carbon sinks in tropical regions. These reductions could serve as carbon credits that offset emissions from other sources. Materials and Methods: This study uses the cellular automaton technique to simulate the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and the gain-loss method, to measure carbon emissions resulting from forest conversion. The output of the integration of the models makes it possible to evaluate one of the most important financial costs: opportunity costs. Two scenarios (with and without consideration of carbon sequestration) in rubber and oil palm plantations are examined. Results: A sensitivity assessment in Kalimantan, Indonesia, shows that carbon sequestration from plantations affects value of opportunity costs less than social discount rates. Further analysis suggests that oil palm plantations have a greater impact than rubber plantations. Conclusions: Our study provides a case that can be applied to other regions for evaluating the impacts of plantation carbon sequestration, and insights that can help local policymakers design a financially attractive REDD+ program in other forest areas of the world. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon sequestration; Opportunity costs; REDD+ program","Deforestation; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Land use; Palm oil; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Business-as-usual; Carbon sequestration; Forest conversion; Forest degradation; Oil palm plantations; Opportunity costs; Reducing emissions; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Carbon; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; cost analysis; environmental policy; forest management; land use change; Asia; Carbon; Deforestation; Environmental Regulations; Land Use; Rubber; Borneo; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089672872

The spatial and urban form of cities is a key factor in achieving more efficient energy production and consumption and becomes more important with rapid urbanisation across much of the world. City urban form and planning are therefore potentially powerful levers for the energy transition. This paper examines the extent to which city 'energy strategies' address the critical spatial and urban form characteristics of cities as a means to achieve a more efficient energy system. We construct an assessment framework of key aspects of the spatial and urban development of cities related to transport and accessibility and urban form. The framework is used to assess the degree to which energy strategies take into consideration aspects of urban development in four cities that are taking significant action on the energy policy: Hong Kong Oakland, Oslo, and Vancouver. We conclude that in these cities there is only fragmentary consideration of the potential of shaping spatial and urban form in the interests of energy efficiency. © 2020 by the authors.

Yet coal usage, particularly in the power sector, is rising in many developing countries. Indonesia is a notable example. While government policy is widely considered as the principle driver of Indonesia's increasing coal consumption, studies have largely overlooked the influence of socioeconomic forces. To understand these effects, we utilize a decomposition analysis to capture the individual effect of five drivers of coal consumption in Indonesia over 1965 to 2017: (1) the energy mix, (2) energy intensity of GDP, (3) population, (4) urbanization, and (5) urban incomes. Results show the energy mix has exerted the largest effect on coal consumption. In addition, by accounting for other socio-economic influences, we found that other less appreciated factors have contributed to rising coal consumption. In order of contribution these were the urban economic effect, the growing relative share of urban population, and the population increase itself in absolute terms. We thus demonstrate that the drivers of growing coal consumption are multi-faced, complex and intertwined. Our findings show that developing nations such as Indonesia share a need to decouple urban population growth and increasing per capita wealth from fossil fuel (and coal) emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

We perform holistic life cycle assessments on the energy payback time, carbon footprint, and environmental impact scores for perovskite-silicon and perovskite-perovskite tandems benchmarked against state-of-the-art commercial silicon cells. The scalability of processing steps and materials in the manufacture and operation of tandems is considered. The resulting energy payback time and greenhouse gas emission factor of the all-perovskite tandem configuration are 0.35 years and 10.7 g CO2-eq/kWh, respectively, compared to 1.52 years and 24.6 g CO2-eq/kWh for the silicon benchmark. Prolonging the lifetime provides a strong technological lever for reducing the carbon footprint such that the perovskite-silicon tandem can outcompete the current benchmark on energy and environmental performance. Perovskite-perovskite tandems with flexible and lightweight form factors further improve the energy and environmental performance by around 6% and thus enhance the potential for large-scale, sustainable deployment.

There is a need to prepare detailed measures according to cargo type given the high correlation between the types of dust-producing cargo primarily managed at ports and local industries. This study attempts to establish the attributes of the cargo handled at ports and the relationship between supply chains built for local key industries and the air quality of the local community. It aims to ascertain which cargo needs managing preemptively at the local level, based on the major cargo types handled in a port. A correlation analysis and Granger causality test were performed to investigate the causality between the factor of cargo and fine dust concentrations. The results in this study indicate the necessity for intensive management of scrap metal cargo among the major cargo handled at the target port, which confirms the large effect of management on fine dust reduction, as well as on reduction efficiency. The results suggest requirements to expand the regulations on the emissions of supply chains by cargo type, not by industry type. Additionally, it is required to minimize the blind spots of management and form an eco-friendly supply chain by introducing green technology. The preparation of emission control measures is also necessary. The findings provide useful insights for the sustainable operations of the local supply chain around the target port and will help the strategic agenda for future improvement. © 2020 by the authors.","Busan gamcheon port; Cross-correlation; Fine dust; Granger causality; Local supply chain; Port operations; Time series modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089590578

However, the life span of the electric taxicab's battery depends on the driving pattern and charging strategy. This paper investigates the optimal driving pattern and charging strategy for a plug-in electric taxi to maximize its operating profit by determining the optimal scheduling decision throughout its lifespan, which is equally divided into a set of consecutive time slots. For each time slot, there are four possible operations: driving, slow driving, parking, and charging. Instead of solving the scheduling problem for the whole batteries' lifespan as a single problem, to reduce the computational complexity, the whole problem is broken down to a series of sub-problems which are built for a short timespan. To address the real-world problem, the sub-problems are integrated with an electric vehicle simulation model, which provides the initial parameters. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can lower the daily battery cost by 2.2% and reduce the daily electricity cost. © 2020 AACC.",,"Charging (batteries); Costs; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Charging strategies; Electric-vehicle simulation; Electricity costs; Initial parameter; Optimal scheduling; Real-world problem; Scheduling problem; Urban driving cycles; Taxicabs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089590298

Some studies have linked local-scale urban ventilation performance with the local climate zone (LCZ) that is proposed for surface temperature studies. However, there is a lack of evidence-based studies showing LCZ ventilation performance and arming the reliability of using the LCZ classification scheme to demonstrate local-scale urban ventilation performance. Therefore, this study aims to analyse LCZ ventilation performances in order to understand the suitability of using the LCZ classification scheme to indicate local-scale urban ventilation performance. This study was conducted in Shenyang, China, with wind information at 16 weather stations in 2018. The results indicate that the Shenyang weather station had an annual mean wind speed of 2.07 m/s, while the mean wind speed of the overall 16 stations was much lower, only 1.44 m/s in value. The mean wind speed at Shenyang weather station and the 16 stations varied with seasons, day and night and precipitation conditions. The spring diurnal mean wind was strong with the speeds of 3.56 m/s and 2.21 m/s at Shenyang weather station and the 16 stations, respectively. The wind speed (2.21 m/s at Shenyang weather station) under precipitation conditions was higher than that (1.75 m/s at Shenyang weather station) under no precipitation conditions. Downtown ventilation performance was weaker than the approaching wind background, where the relative mean wind speed in the downtown area was only 0.53, much less than 1.0. The downtown ventilation performance also varied with seasons, day and night and precipitation conditions, where spring diurnal downtown ventilation performance was the weakest and the winter nocturnal downtown ventilation performance was the strongest. Moreover, the annual mean wind speed of the 16 zones decreased from the sparse, open low-rise zones to the compact midrise zones, indicating the suitability of using LCZ classification scheme to indicate local-scale urban ventilation performance. The high spatial correlation coecients under dierent seasons, day and night and precipitation conditions, ranging between 0.68 and 0.99, further armed that LCZ classification scheme is also suitable to indicate local-scale urban ventilation performance, despite without the consideration of street structure like precinct ventilation zone scheme. © 2020 by the authors.

To quantitatively investigate the agricultural water-use efficiency in regions exhibiting the complex agricultural structure, this study developed an indicator named water footprint of crop values (WFV) that is based on the water footprint of crop production. Defined as the water volume used to produce a unit price of crop (m3/CNY), the new indicator makes it feasible to directly compare the water footprint of different crops from an economic perspective, so as to comprehensively evaluate the water-use efficiency under the complex planting structure. On the basis of WFV, the study further proposed an indicator of structural water-use coefficient (SWUC), which is represented by the ratio of water-use efficiency for a given planting structure to the water efficiency for a reference crop and can quantitatively describe the impact of planting structure on agricultural water efficiency. Then, a case study was implemented in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. The temporal and spatial variations of WFV were assessed for the planting industries in 14 prefectures and cities of Xinjiang between 1991 and 2015. In addition, contribution rate analysis of WFV for different prefectures and cities was conducted to evaluate the variations of WFV caused by different influencing factors: agricultural input, climatic factors, and planting structure. Results from these analyses indicated first that the average WFV of planting industries in Xinjiang significantly decreased from 0.293 m3/CNY in 1991 to 0.153 m3/CNY in 2015, corresponding to an average annual change rate of −3.532%. WFV in 13 prefectures and cities (with the exception of Karamay) has declined significantly during the period of 1991–2015, indicating that agricultural water-use efficient has effectively improved. Second, the average SWUC in Xinjiang decreased from 1.17 to 1.08 m3/CNY in the 1990s, and then declined to 1.00 m3/CNY in 2011–2015. The value of SWUC was highly consistent with the relative value of WFV in most prefectures and cities, showing that planting structure is one of the primary factors affecting regional agricultural water-use efficiency. Third, the contribution rate of WFV variations from human factors including agricultural input and planting structure was much more significant than that from climatic factors. However, the distribution of agricultural input and the adjustment of planting structure significantly differed among prefectures and cities, suggesting regional imbalances of agricultural development. This study indicated the feasibility and effectiveness of controlling agricultural water use through increasing technical input and rational selection of crops in the face of impending climate change. Specifically, we concluded that, the rational application of chemical fertilizers, the development of the fruit industry, and the strict restriction of the cotton industry should be implemented to improve the agricultural water-use efficiency in Xinjiang. © 2020, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","agricultural input; climatic factors; contribution rate; planting structure; structural water-use coefficient; water footprint of crop values","climate change; climate conditions; crop production; feasibility study; spatiotemporal analysis; water footprint; water management; water use efficiency; China; Xinjiang Uygur; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089581680

The main goal of this research is to analyse the bioclimatic potential of different Malagasy climatic zones. In addition, this study analyses and compares energy consumption and carbon emissions in six building categories commonly found in Sub Sahara African cities designed to be placed in thirteen cities unequally distributed in the six climatic regions in Madagascar. To reach this objective, hourly weather data for the last thirty years were analysed for two seasons. At the same time, the adaptive comfort model defined by the ASHRAE 55 served as a reference for the evaluation of different passive design potentials. The results showed that in the sub-Saharan or hot zone, the range of comfort varies according to with the geographical position and that the number of hours of thermal comfort and acceptability is in the majority of the cases outside the range recommended in the international standards (CIBSE, ASHRAE and ISO). Finally, it was concluded that Madagascar Island, such as other countries, should build their own standard due to the average demand for cooling energy increases every year up to 3.4% in the coastal towns and more than 80% of carbon emissions can be reduced in hospitals in Madagascar, as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa, by increasing the maintenance cost between 7% and 10% of the total life cycle cost of a building. In Madagascar Island, the building Life cycle cost ranges from 12% to 14% for the construction cost, 0–1% for the renovation cost, 36%–73% for the energy cost, 2%–3% for the maintenance cost on the whole LCC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioclimatic zones; Buildings; CO2 emission; Energy consumption; Life cycle cost; Simulation","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Maintenance; Office buildings; Tropics; Bioclimatic zone; Carbon emissions; CO$-2$/ emission; Commercial building; Comparative analysis; Energy-consumption; Madagascar; Maintenance cost; Residential building; Simulation; Energy utilization; bioclimatology; building; carbon emission; comparative study; cooling; cost analysis; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; Madagascar; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089549387

However, few studies have used forage species recently introduced into the market, and more studies that assess the performances of these species in integrated systems are needed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of intercropped sorghum and Paiaguas palisadegrass (including the species name) in a crop-livestock integration system for pasture recovery. The field experiment was conducted in the municipality of Rio Verde, Goiás, Brazil, using a randomized block design with four replications. The treatments consisted of the following forage systems: monocropping of sorghum, monocropping of Paiaguas palisadegrass, row intercropping of sorghum with Paiaguas palisadegrass, interrow intercropping of sorghum with Paiaguas palisadegrass and intercropping of sorghum with oversown Paiaguas palisadegrass. To obtain a desired population of 240,000 plants ha-1, 12 seeds of sorghum and 5 kg of viable pure seeds of the forage species were planted per meter and hectare, respectively. The growth of Paiaguas palisadegrass in the same row as sorghum reduced the sorghum grain yield. The intercropping of sorghum with oversown Paiaguas palisadegrass hindered the initial development of Paiaguas palisadegrass in terms of plant height and number of tillers due to shading, and this effect was reflected in the dry mass production. Row and interrow intercropping provided higher dry mass production without affecting the forage quality. Therefore, the interrow intercropping of sorghum with Paiaguas palisadegrass was found to be a promising agricultural technique for grain and forage production that could be used for the establishment of new pastures or pasture recovery. © 2020, Southern Cross Publishing.","Brachiaria brizantha; Grain yield; Integrated systems; Sorghum bicolor; Tropical forage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089536512

The emitted electrons are measured in the energy range from 1 to 400 eV for He and CH4 targets and up to 600 eV for O2 to include the K-LL Auger line of oxygen. The electrons are detected over different emission angles varying from 20∘ in the extreme forward direction to 160∘ in the backward direction. The single-differential cross section (SDCS) and total cross section are deduced from the measured DDCSs spectra for all the targets. The DDCS and SDCS are compared with the state-of-the-art continuum distorted wave-eikonal initial state (CDW-EIS) theoretical model. The CDW-EIS model provides excellent agreement with the oxygen data at MeV energy, whereas the deviation in the case of keV energy is substantial, in spite of having nearly the same perturbation strength. The forward-backward angular asymmetry shows a saturation effect in the case of keV energy protons but no such signature is observed for the high-energy collision. A systematic analysis reveals that the asymmetry at low electron energy is sensitive to the associated atomic or molecular structure and is in close agreement with the theory. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,"Charge density waves; Distortion (waves); Electron energy levels; Electron spectroscopy; Electrons; Heavy ions; Oxygen; Continuum distorted wave-eikonal initial state; Double differential cross sections; High-energy collisions; Ionization of atoms; Perturbation strength; Single-differential cross sections; Systematic analysis; Theoretical modeling; Electron emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089526681

Hourly data on pollutant concentrations from 11 automatic atmospheric monitoring stations and meteorological data in Shenyang from 2017 to 2019 were used to analyze the spatio-temporal variation rules of CO (carbon monoxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), O3 (ozone), PM2.5 and PM10 (PM particles with an aerodynamic diameters of not more than 2.5 μm and 10 μm) and their relationships with meteorological parameters. Meanwhile, the regional transmission route of pollutants was analyzed by the hybrid single particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The results showed that the concentration of O3 in the northern area of the city was higher than that in the south; CO, SO2 and NO2 were relatively high in the urban center; and PM2.5 and PM10 were relatively high in the southwest. The average concentration of pollutants was lowest in 2019. The concentration of O3 was the highest in spring, while CO showed no significant variations between different seasons. The remaining pollutant concentrations appeared to be high in winter and low in summer. The cumulative concentrations of the six pollutants were the highest in March, and relatively low in July-September. The diurnal concentration variations of O3, CO and SO2 exhibited a ""single peak, "" while others showed a ""double peak and double valley. "" Temperature was positively correlated with O3 concentration and negatively correlated with others. Wind speed was negatively correlated with the concentration of PM2.5, NO2, and O3.

Thereby, it strongly depends on the carbon/nutrients ratio of the wastewater. The physiological COD/N/P ratio for PPB growth in domestic wastewater makes the addition of an external organic carbon source necessary in order to allow for an efficient process. However, PPB need a source of alkalinity (as CO2) to grow on reduced organics that serves as an electron acceptor since biohydrogen production (an alternative electron sink) is inhibited by ammonium. A preliminary experiment showed that high nutrients-loading wastewater was limited by CO2 imbalance, leading to poor removal efficiencies. Subsequently, the effect of the oxidation state of the organics added as external organic carbon sources to PPB reactors treating low nutrients-loading domestic wastewater has been analyzed. Three organics were used as additives to PPB development in four consecutive batches: acetate (more oxidized), ethanol and butyrate (more reduced). The PPB population was settled and the general performance under the three situations, in terms of organics, N and P assimilation, and growth kinetics was not significantly different irrespective of the external organic carbon source. The reactors were dominated by PPB, though reduced organics allowed for dominance of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, whereas oxidized organics caused co-dominance of R. palustris and Rhodobacter capsulatus. Thereby, alkalinity (as bicarbonate), and not the oxidation state of the organics, is the key parameter for the efficient treatment of domestic wastewater by PPB. © 2020 by the authors.","Emerging anaerobic processes; Partition-release-recovery; Phototrophic mechanisms; Purple phototrophic bacteria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089483136

The key factors determining species diversity in Inner Asia are past climate changes and precipitation parameters. By contrast, the temperature conditions of the current climate do not affect the species richness significantly. The following current climatic parameters are important for woody plants: precipitation seasonality, mean precipitation in winter and spring, and diurnal range of temperature. Quite the opposite, the species richness of herbaceous plants is determined by climate-change velocity from the mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum, the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation, and mean summer temperatures. Over time, distribution ranges of rare plants in the studied region may be reduced due to the increasing aridization. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","climate change; environmental factors; Inner Asia; plant diversity; species richness","climate variation; environmental factor; herb; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); range size; seasonal variation; species diversity; species richness; vascular plant; woody plant; Asia; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089479236

The main sources of pollution with PCDD/F include industrial and non-industrial combustion sources, like domestic contaminated wood burning, house fires, burning of leaves from trees, etc. When looking for alternative energy sources and reduced energy costs, solid waste incineration plants are intended to be built in the vicinity of urbanized areas, and thus, the need emerges for examination and prediction of to what extent the solid waste incineration plants might affect the surrounding ecosystem, air pollution, and human health. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) (or simply PCDD/F congeners) belong to the group of semi-volatile organic compounds with environmental stability and long-range transfer in the ambient air. Dioxin isomers are highly toxic and may have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects in humans. PCDD/F is detected in air, water, sediment, plants and animals. PCDD/F is generally distributed in the particulate phase in ambient air. For solid waste incineration plant emissions, the distribution of PCDD/F particles into particles with a diameter of &lt;10 μm is more than 81% of the total particulate matter, and more than 54% of the PCDD/F is distributed into particles with a diameter of &lt;2.5 μm. The aim of this study is to investigate the sources of PCDD/F, emissions and potential hazards, i.e., a toxic equivalent in Lithuania. The measurements were performed in two largest cities of Lithuania Vilnius and Kaunas, where the level of PCDD/F discovered was from 0.015 to 0.52 pg/m3 and from 0.02 to 0.05 pg/m3, respectively. The sites for the monitoring were selected based on their proximity to the locations of the planned cogeneration power plants in these cities. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; House fires; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs); Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs)","Air pollution; Chemical contamination; Cogeneration plants; Isomers; Organic pollutants; Particles (particulate matter); Plants (botany); Solid wastes; Volatile organic compounds; Alternative energy source; Cogeneration power plants; Industrial combustion sources; Polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxin (PCDDs); Polychlorinated dibenzofurans; Semivolatile organic compounds; Solid waste incineration plant; Total particulate matter; Waste incineration; atmospheric pollution; bioavailability; dioxin; environmental assessment; PCDD; PCDF; pollutant source; solid waste; waste management; Lithuania; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089462215

Zinc, lead, cadmium and chromium metal levels were higher in the research group than healthy controls. In addition, reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity decreased due to metal exposure and oxidative stress occurred in the research group. Smoking contributed to the exposure of amount of the metals. In research group, positive correlations were found between metal exposures and life span/term of employment.

In this paper, the pollutant emissions (i.e. HC, CO, NOx, SOx and PM) from aircraft during landing and take-off (LTO) cycles at Nanjing Lukou Airport (NKG) in 2016 were investigated using an improved method, which considered the taxi-in and –out time calculated based on the real data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), instead of using the referenced time recommended by ICAO. First, the pollutant emissions and their characteristics were studied from different perspectives. Second, two various mitigation measures of emissions were proposed, and the performance of emission reduction was analysed. Our analysis shows that: (1) A320 and B738 emitted the largest emissions at NKG; (2) pollutants were mainly emitted during the taxi mode, followed by climb mode; (3) B738 had the lowest emissions per (seat•LTO) among all aircraft, while CRJ had the lowest emissions per unit LTO; (4) shortening the taxiing time and upgrading aircraft engines are both effective measures to mitigate pollutant emissions. © 2020, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

A specific feature of this model is the bistability with the coexistence of ""snowball""equilibrium and ""warm""attractor in the form of equilibrium or cycle. It is found that multiplicative and additive noises shift probabilistic distribution in opposite directions. The multiplicative noise introduced into the death rate of vegetation changes the dispersion of random states and their localization in the phase diagram. This type of noise cools down the system and is responsible for its transition to the snowball state. On the contrary, the additive noise warms up the climate with increasing noise intensity. A cumulative effect of multiplicative and additive noises occurs under their simultaneous influence. This effect determining the evolutionary behavior of a climate-vegetation system depends on the ratio of intensities of these noises. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,"Additives; Climate models; Probability distributions; Sensitivity analysis; Signal processing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vegetation; Anomalous behavior; Anomalous climate; Cumulative effects; Multiplicative noise; Probabilistic distribution; Stochastic sensitivity analysis; Vegetation change; Vegetation systems; Additive noise; article; climate; mortality rate; noise; sensitivity analysis; stochastic model; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089342316

These are calculated on the basis of engine testing results obtained in a specified range of operation modes. The investigation results obtained for the operation process of uprated locomotive engine 12D49M (12CHN26/26 rated at 2200 kW) have shown prevailing of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in total toxic emissions in modes close to standard power. At partial loads CO emissions prevail. Thus, in the first case reduction of integrated toxic parameters can be achieved through measures aimed at decreasing NOx emissions (such as reduction of maximal cycle and local temperatures). In the second case measures reducing CO emissions (such as increase of actual cycle temperatures) are effective. Meanwhile it is known that the reduction of actual cycle temperatures results in a worse indicated efficiency of the engine and, consequently, in its worse fuel efficiency. To avoid this phenomenon correction of heat release phase with simultaneous reduction of cylinder pressure growth rate is necessary. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

This study assessed climate and LULC change impacts on the hydrological processes of a tropical headwater inland valley catchment in Uganda. The hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to analyze climate and LULC change impacts on the hydrological processes. An ensemble of six regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, were used for climate change assessment for historical (1976-2005) and future climate (2021-2050). Four LULC scenarios defined as exploitation, total conservation, slope conservation, and protection of headwater catchment were considered. The results indicate an increase in precipitation by 7.4% and 21.8% of the annual averages in the future under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Future wet conditions are more pronounced in the short rainy season than in the long rainy season. Flooding intensity is likely to increase during the rainy season with low flows more pronounced in the dry season. Increases in future annual averages of water yield (29.0% and 42.7% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) and surface runoff (37.6% and 51.8% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) relative to the historical simulations are projected. LULC and climate change individually will cause changes in the inland valley hydrological processes, but more pronounced changes are expected if the drivers are combined, although LULC changes will have a dominant influence. Adoption of total conservation, slope conservation and protection of headwater catchment LULC scenarios will significantly reduce climate change impacts on water resources in the inland valley. Thus, if sustainable climate-smart management practices are adopted, the availability of water resources for human consumption and agricultural production will increase. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change impacts; Land use/land cover management; SWAT model; Water resources; Wetland-catchment nexus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089285708

Thanks to their multifunctional role, they can support small farmers, contribute to hydrogeological risk reduction, water regulation, preservation of soil, agrobiodiversity and landscape, as well as being examples of mitigation and adaptation towards climate change. The Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) aims to identify agricultural systems of global importance, preserving landscape, agrobiodiversity and traditional knowledge, through dynamic conservation principles. The Sabana de Morro is a traditional agroforestry system located in El Salvador based on cattle grazing in pastures with the presence of Crescentia alata and Crescentia cujete trees, locally called Morro or Jicaro. We documented the main characteristics of this system, that has never been deeply studied, in the Municipality of Dolores, in accordance with the five GIAHS criteria, and through detailed land use mapping, to assess the relations between landscape structure, agrobiodiversity and traditional silvopastoral practices. Sabana de Morro proved to be based on strong interactions between trees, cattle and farmers. The pulp of the Morro fruits is eaten by grazing cattle, completing their feeding and giving a peculiar taste to the locally produced cheese. Morro trees provide shade for the animals while cattle contribute by spreading their seeds that also take advantage of the manure. Results show that this agroforestry system contributes to the preservation of a rich agrobiodiversity and of the traditional landscape. At the same time, it supports local farmers' livelihood and is consistent with the aim of the GIAHS programme, even if further surveys and research are needed to assess the real possibility of the inclusion in this FAO programme. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper offers three propositions focused on the role of intermediaries in the GCF, and tests these using data from the GCF and the wider literature. The results show a growing dominance of international intermediaries in GCF project development and implementation, the low capacity of national intermediaries to conceive and scale projects, and the mismatch between planned and actual funding allocations. Collectively, these outcomes derail the GCF from its core objectives of promoting country ownership of projects, building capacity of local intermediaries, and equitable allocation of funding between mitigation and adaptation.

Studies of micro-level rebounds frequently emphasise human agents' personal responsibility in causing or facilitating these rebounds. Studies of macro-level rebounds tend to focus instead on autonomous, depersonalised mechanisms through which energy efficiency increases lead to increased consumption of energy services, often via social structural changes. This leaves out the role of powerful human actors facilitating these structural changes and often reaping rich rewards for doing so. Here I depart from existing rebound effect approaches, drawing on Giddens’ structuration theory to offer a sociological account of how macro-level rebound effects occur. I argue that well-resourced actors co-opt energy efficiency increases to provide new or enhanced CO2-producing goods and services while fostering public desire for these and lobbying vigorously against tighter CO2 emissions standards. Hence these rebounds result from the actions of powerful actors manipulating social structure for personal or corporate reward. I illustrate this with the empirical example of macro-level rebound effects in the US car industry, also employing a radical departure from traditional rebound effect approaches. I argue that policymakers need to take the actions of these powerful individuals more seriously. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Powerful actors; Rebound effect; Social structuration theory; US car Industry","Automotive industry; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Sociology; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Consumption of energy; Efficiency increase; Personal responsibility; Rebound effect; Social structure; Structuration Theory; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy policy; policy approach; policy making; structural change; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089265748

In the present study, the laminar burning velocity SL of NH3/air mixtures has been measured at unburnt gas temperature Tu from 298 K to 448 K, covering equivalence ratios from 0.85 to 1.25 and at 1 atm using the heat flux method. Kinetic simulations were made with five literature mechanisms developed for NH3 combustion, i.e., Nakamura et al., Otomo et al., San Diego, Okafor et al., and Mei et al. mechanisms, and the influence of radiation heat losses was considered. Using the obtained burning velocity data at different temperatures, the temperature dependence coefficients α in [Formula presented] were derived, and compared with different models’ predictions. Further analyses of the temperature dependence of SL were carried out through examination of the overall activation energy, temperature and species profiles as well as the reaction paths, and a unique flame structure at the rich side of adiabatic NH3/air flames was found, which resembles ‘over-rich’ phenomena in hydrocarbon flames. At equivalence ratio larger than 1.1 ± 0.05, the NH3/air flames become so rich that (1) the NH2 radical overwhelms the H and OH radicals in maximum mole fraction; (2) after the flame front, H2O converts back to H2 with NO formed at the same time, causing the superadiabatic flame temperature phenomena, i.e. adiabatic flame temperature being lower than the maximum achieved in the flame. Moreover, local minimum NO concentration is found right after the over-rich NH3/air flame front, which may be helpful in reducing NO emissions from NH3 flames in practical applications. © 2020","Ammonia flame; Elevated temperature; Laminar burning velocity; Temperature dependence","Activation energy; Ammonia; Free radicals; Heat flux; Temperature distribution; Velocity; Burning velocity; Equivalence ratios; Hydrocarbon flames; Kinetic simulation; Laminar burning velocity; Radiation heat loss; Superadiabatic flame temperature; Temperature dependence; Adiabatic flame temperature; ammonia; carbon; hydrocarbon; hydroxyl radical; adiabaticity; adsorption; air; Article; combustion; energy; flame; gas; heat loss; high temperature; priority journal; temperature dependence; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089230442

Rigorous process simulation, optimization, techno-economical evaluation, and carbon emission calculation are performed. We start from the aldol condensation process converting furfural and acetone to the jet-fuel intermediate. COSMO-SAC model and the PR+COSMOSAC equation of state (EOS) are firstly incorporated to estimate the missing physical properties of both pure component and the mixture. In this part, three process schemes (the distillation-only process, the multi-effect evaporation (MEE) assisted process, and the solvent-less process) are investigated, and the total annual cost (TAC) are compared. Comparing with the distillation-only process, the optimization results indicate a more favorable condition in the solvent-less process (89.76% TAC reduction) than the MEE-assisted process (25.54% TAC reduction). Moreover, different strategies of integrating the aldol condensation process with the front-end furfural production process are discussed. They are presented in five scenarios. YUMC (yearly unit manufacture cost) and ER (emission ratio) are calculated to quantify the economic performance and CO2 emission. Through this work, we suggest that the Scenario 4 (YUMC = 0.716 USD/kg, ER = −1.65) would be the most suitable one for CO2 reduction in the future, and the Scenario 2 (YUMC = 0.698 USD/kg, ER = 0.28) could be the nearest solution to enhance the economic performance and reducing CO2 emission based on the current technology. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Aldol condensation; Bio-jet fuel; Furfural; Multi-effect evaporation; PR+COSMOSAC; Techno-economic analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089217398

Our recent work has established that the enzyme is fully capable of catalyzing the reverse of the physiological reaction, namely, the reduction of CO2 to formate using NADH as a source of reducing equivalents. The steady-state kinetic parameters in the forward and reverse directions are consistent with the expected Haldane relationship. The addition of an NADH-regenerating system consisting of glucose and glucose dehydrogenase increases the yield of formate approximately 10-fold. This work points to possible ways of optimizing the reverse of the enzyme's physiological reaction with commercial potential as an effective means of CO2 remediation. New insight into the maturation of the enzyme comes from the recently reported structure of the FdhD sulfurase. In E. coli, FdhD transfers a catalytically essential sulfur to the maturing molybdenum cofactor prior to insertion into the apoenzyme of formate dehydrogenase FdhF, which has high sequence similarity to the molybdenum-containing domain of the C. necator FdsA. The FdhD structure suggests that the molybdenum cofactor may first be transferred from the sulfurase to the C-terminal cap domain of apo formate dehydrogenase, rather than being transferred directly to the body of the apoenzyme. Closing of the cap domain over the body of the enzymes delivers the Mo-cofactor into the active site, completing the maturation of formate dehydrogenase. The structural and kinetic characterization of the NADH reduction of the FdsBG subcomplex of the enzyme provides further insights in reversing of the formate dehydrogenase reaction. Most notably, we observe the transient formation of a neutral semiquinone FMNH, a species that has not been observed previously with holoenzyme. After initial reduction of the FMN of FdsB byNADHto the hydroquinone (with a kred of 680 s-1 and Kd of 190 μM), one electron is rapidly transferred to the Fe2S2 cluster of FdsG, leaving FMNH. The Fe4S4 cluster of FdsB does not become reduced in the process. These results provide insight into the function not only of the C. necator formate dehydrogenase but also of other members of the NADH dehydrogenase superfamily of enzymes to which it belongs. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon assimilation; Electron transfer; Enzyme kinetics; Enzyme structure; Formate dehydrogenase; Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089211788

OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively assess the co-benefits of climate change mitigation to children, we expanded the suite of adverse health outcomes in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) to include additional outcomes associated with prenatal and childhood exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2:5 ). We applied this newly expanded program to an assessment of the U.S. Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the United States’ first regional market-based regulatory program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the electric power sector within the Northeast. METHODS: We used calculated changes in ambient PM2:5 concentrations for the period 2009–2014, with newly incorporated concentration–response (C-R) functions to quantify changes in the incidence of preterm birth (PTB), term low birth weight (TLBW), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and asthma. These outcomes are causally or likely to be causally related to PM2:5 exposure. Cost per case estimates were incorporated to monetize those changes in incidence. RESULTS: The estimated avoided cases of adverse child health outcomes included 537 asthma cases, 112 preterm births, 98 cases of ASD, and 56 cases of TLBW, with an associated avoided cost estimate ranging from $191 to $350 million. In a previous analysis of health benefits of RGGI, the only benefits accruing to children were limited to prevented cases of infant mortality and respiratory illnesses, with a monetized impact of $8.1 million—only 2–4% of the new results attributable to RGGI. CONCLUSION: The results of this innovative analysis indicate that RGGI has provided substantial child health benefits beyond those initially considered. Moreover, those health benefits had significant estimated economic value. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6706. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This data set is one of the first in situ surveys in Cuban waters available to the international community. Along northwest Cuba, these data suggested coastal upwelling and revealed, for the first time, a ~50 km diameter Cuban ANticyclonic (CubAN) eddy and a ~25 km diameter cyclonic eddy, which together advected upwelled waters offshore. The CubAN eddy was associated with downwelling, and the cyclonic eddy with upwelling. At the western tip of Cuba, local currents were predominantly anticyclonic, presumably due to the proximity of the retracted Loop Current, with limited export of coastal waters. Conversely, additional data from two cruises when the Loop Current was extended showed cyclonic circulation within upwelling filaments extending far offshore. These processes are important, as they can potentially entrain marine organism larvae from local reefs into the Loop Current system and to other reef ecosystems of the region. They might also affect the transport of pollutants, as hydrocarbons in case of a spill in Cuban waters. The 2016 cruise took place after the shedding of a Loop Current Ring, which involved an unusually large (~250 km) cyclonic frontal eddy. The eddy signature was observed down to 1,200 m depth, deeper than the Loop Current. A surface drifter revealed a low relative vorticity (0.19 f) inside the eddy. Along its southern edge, filaments exported from the Campeche Bank were associated with high relative chlorophyll a at 3,060 m depth. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

In this study, three farms (in the Emilia-Romagna region), managed with both conventional and conservation practices (the last ones with and without sub-irrigation systems), were monitored from 2014 to 2017 to highlight the impact of different crops and soil managements on soil arthropods, in terms of abundance, composition, and soil biological quality (applying QBS-ar index). To do this, linear mixed models were performed, whereas arthropods assemblages were studied through PERMANOVA and SIMPER analysis. Soil communities varied among farms, although most differences were found among crops depending on management practices. Nonetheless, conservation systems and a wider reduction in anthropogenic practices provided better conditions for soil fauna, enhancing QBS-ar. Moreover, arthropod groups responded to soil practices differently, highlighting their sensitivity to agricultural management. Community assemblages in corn and wheat differed between managements, mainly due to Acari and Collembola, respectively. In conservation management, wheat showed the overall greatest abundance of arthropods, owing to the great number of Acari, Collembola, and Hymenoptera, while the number of arthropod groups were generally higher in crop residues of forage. © 2020 by the authors.

In the context of climate change and ambitious emission reduction targets, environmental concerns have risen high on the political agenda. Existing methods for assessing transport-related environmental impacts typically depend on realized or modeled travel behavior. Many of them do not entail a spatial dimension, ignore the importance of the land use component, lack scenario building capabilities or have limited communication value. Consequently, accessibility analysis and planning could make a valuable contribution towards a low carbon transition, but needs to attune to the specific objective of reducing transport-related greenhouse gas emissions. This paper introduces a novel conceptualization of location-based accessibility, where CO2 emissions are used as a travel cost in place of time or monetary costs. By identifying and assessing options for interventions in the land use and transport system, carbon-based accessibility instruments might serve a number of potential decision-making purposes related to low carbon mobility planning. Carbon-based accessibility of a business park in the Munich region is analyzed in multiple scenarios to demonstrate the application potential of the method. The experiential application focuses on the effects of changes in vehicle efficiency and occupancy rates of both car and transit, but also compares the resulting carbon-based accessibility levels to alternative sites with the transport system unchanged. Applying carbon-based accessibility instruments to real-world planning issues could enhance strategic decision-making processes in the context of climate change mitigation. © 2020 The Authors","Accessibility instruments; Climate change; CO2 emissions; Integrated land use transport planning","accessibility; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; conceptual framework; decision making; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact; traffic emission; travel behavior; Bavaria; Germany; Munich",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088936713

In this work, we use a Bayesian-neural-network approach to reconstruct surface carbonate chemistry variables for the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) and the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) along the North American East Coast from 1982 to 2015. The reconstructed monthly time series data suggest that the rate of fCO2 increase in the MAB (18 ± 1 μatm per decade) is faster than those in the SAB (14 ± 1 μatm per decade) and the open ocean (14 ± 1 μatm per decade). Correspondingly, pH decreases faster in the MAB. The observed stagnation in the aragonite saturation state, Ωarag decrease during 2005–2015 in the MAB, is attributed to the intrusion of water from southern and offshore regions with high Ωarag, which offsets the decrease expected from anthropogenic CO2 uptake. Furthermore, seasonal asymmetry in the evolution of long-term change leads to the faster change in the amplitudes of the seasonal cycle in carbonate chemistry variables in coastal waters than those in the open ocean. In particular, the increase in the seasonal-cycle amplitude of dissolved inorganic carbon in the MAB is 2.9 times larger than that of the open ocean.

However, our understanding of the linkages among groundwater, food, and climate is still limited. Here, we offer a Bayesian framework to simulate crop yield at a regional scale and quantify its relationships and associated uncertainty with climate, groundwater, agricultural, and energy-related variables. We implemented the framework in the rice-producing regions of Louisiana from 1960-2015. To build a parsimonious model, we used a probability-based variable selection approach to detect the key drivers of rice yield. Rice yield increased, groundwater declined, and area planted declined or did not change over 56yrs. The number of irrigation wells, groundwater level, air temperature, and area planted were found to be the key drivers of rice yield. The regression coefficients showed that rice yield was positively related to groundwater level, and negatively related to area planted and the number of irrigation wells. The limited influence of N fertilizer was noted on rice yield for the period when fertilizer data were available. The inverse relationship between rice yield and area planted pointed to the adaption of efficient crop management practices that maintained or increased yield, despite the decline in area planted. The farmers' ability to install irrigation wells during droughts sustained the yields over long-term but not short-term. This decline in rice yield in response to drought over the short-term might explain the negative relation between yield and irrigation wells. Overall, this work highlighted the uncertainty in relationships between rice yield and key drivers and quantified the intimate connection between food and groundwater. This work may have implications for managing two highly competing commodities (i.e., groundwater and food) in agricultural regions. Copyright: © 2020 Singh et al.

This study uses source-apportionment photochemical air quality modeling to estimate the health burden (expressed as incidence) of an array of PM2.5- A nd ozone-related adverse health impacts, including premature death, attributable to 17 mobile source sectors in the US in 2011 and 2025. Mobile sector-attributable air pollution contributes a substantial fraction of the overall pollution-related mortality burden in the U.S., accounting for about 20% of the PM2.5 and ozone-attributable deaths in 2011 (between 21 000 and 55 000 deaths, depending on the study used to derive the effect estimate). This value falls to about 13% (between 13 000 and 37 000 deaths) by 2025 due to regulatory and voluntary programs reducing emissions from mobile sources. Similar trends across all morbidity health impacts can also be observed. Emissions from on-road sources are the largest contributor to premature deaths; this is true for both 2011 (between 12 000 and 31 000 deaths) and 2025 (between 6700 and 18 000 deaths). Non-road construction engines, C3 marine engines and emissions from rail also contribute to large portions of premature deaths. Across the 17 mobile sectors modeled, the PM2.5-attributable mortality and morbidity burden falls between 2011 and 2025 for 12 sectors and increases for 5. Ozone-attributable mortality and morbidity burden increases between 2011 and 2025 for 10 sectors and falls for 7. These results extend the literature beyond generally aggregated mobile sector health burden toward a representation of highly-resolved source characterization of both current and future health burden. The quantified future mobile source health burden is a novel feature of this analysis and could prove useful for decisionmakers and affected stakeholders. © 2020 The Author(s).

This requires the enhancement of current observation infrastructures around the world, particularly in less-studied regions such as the African continent. Methodological protocols play an essential role in assuring interoperability among existing and new monitoring stations and networks. However, although the availability and accessibility of the body of existing methodological knowledge is crucial to fill existing observational gaps in a harmonised and resource-efficient way, there are very few efforts documented to systematically compile and assess it. This work aims to identify environmental observation methodologies which, on one hand, are applicable in Africa and, on the other hand, compatible with ongoing international and European monitoring initiatives. It draws from a systematic inventory of 140 environmental methodological protocols related to the measurement and estimation of the main climate forcing components within the atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial domains. In order to identify existing methodologies readily applicable for various observational purposes in under-studied regions, the feasibility of these protocols was determined based on a basic assessment of the financial and human resources needed for their implementation. Finally, a harmonised approach is proposed to enhance observational capacity in Africa with the differentiation of at least two types of sites. 'Basic' sites, where highly feasible environmental measurements can be performed to improve spatial coverage of main biomes, anthromes, and land use types, and advanced 'key sites', where a large set of variables measured at a high temporal resolution would enable a better understanding of driving processes in representative systems and managements across the continent, albeit requiring the application of less readily feasible methodologies. © 2020 The Author(s).

The main limitations of this technique have been increased fish quality deterioration and microbial contamination. Two fish solar dryers (FSD) were constructed under the SEEDFISH project along the Western Shore of Lake Malawi (WSLM) as a way of minimizing the effects of using OSD and provide a better way of drying fish in the area. The FSD though adopted, the fishing households have been seeking alternatives for its sustenance. This study estimates the households' willingness to pay (WTP) and their influencing factors while using contingent valuation (CV) approaches. A wide range of data collection methods (exploratory surveys, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations) was employed. A total of 200 fishing households were randomly interviewed. The results showed that 144 (72.4%) of the respondents were willing to pay because the FSD was seen as a way of mitigating the climate change impact, improving livelihoods, and reducing post-harvest losses. The mean annual aggregate WTP amount was estimated at MK3,648,750 (US4,865). Those households (27.6%) not willing to pay argued that they had a low level of income while others could not see any value of the FSD. The regression coefficients of age and gender of household head (GHH) were negative (β =-6.02 and Wald of 5.34, β = -6.92, Wald of 2.01) and significant (p<0.05) suggesting that young people were more WTP than their counterpart. Males also coded as 0 were more willing to pay than females. On the other hand, household literacy level (HLL), household involved in fish processing (HIVFP), household social trust (HST), household institutional trust (HIT), household level of income (HLI), household experienced fish post-harvest losses (HEFPL), household access to extension services (HAE) and household social network (HSN) were positive (β = 2.97, Wald of 7.11, β = 6.37 and Wald of 5.41, β = 3.03 and Wald of 6, β = 11.2, Wald 9.02, β = 2.42, Wald of 8, β = 0.93, Wald of 4,81 and β = 2.50, Wald 2.10) and significant (p<0.05) suggesting that those HIVFP, had high HLL, HLI, HST, HIT, HSN and HEFPL were more willing to pay than their counterpart.

The influence of this block is limited by the decomposition reaction СН3О2 → СН3 + О2(II); therefore, the standard calculations were performed for a wide range of compositions at a smaller value of the reaction rate constant k2∞, and additional calculations were performed at a larger value of this constant. For mixtures containing 5, 9, and 16% CH4, the calculations were performed without taking into account the CH3O2 radicals. All the calculated data (according to flame velocities and the structure of their preheating zones) were compared with one another and with the experimental values. Based on the results of standard calculations, the space profiles of temperature and substances were presented for mixtures containing 5, 9, and 16% CH4, and time profiles were additionally given for the case with 9% CH4. To characterize the structure of the combustion wave using these data, two small kinetic schemes were chosen, which are determined by the low-temperature kinetics of the HO2 and CH3O2 radicals. Analytical criteria were obtained based on these schemes; the calculations of self-ignition temperatures using these criteria (including the state of various points of the preheating zone) characterize the change in the activity of the system up to its coldest point. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","combustion wave; combustion wave velocity; Jacobi matrix determinant; methane; peroxide mechanism; preheating zone; self-ignition limit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088862121

This paper explains the detailed steps from the planning to the realization process and shows how building with wood could be linked to the entire process from the sales of building plots to the realization of projects. Additionally, based on EN 15978, life cycle assessment (LCA) results of the constructed buildings were conducted to calculate the realistic carbon storage and the global warming potential for all new erected buildings on the site. The case study area and living lab is a building site in Munich with 566 flats, which will be finished in 2020 and will be the largest urban timber neighborhood in Germany by then. All development activities are summarized under the concept of building an eco-city with low carbon emissions and a high standard for living for all groups of inhabitants. Eight buildings with different material selections ranging from wood-constructions to wood-concrete hybrid constructions and concrete constructions with different energy standards are environmentally assessed. Results show that about 12.5 million kg of CO2 are stored in the wooden structures over the estimated life cycle of 50 years within this neighborhood. This clearly demonstrates the potential that building with wood has for achieving climate targets. Further results show that heating energy demand and material choices have a significant influence on LCA results. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon storage; Greenhouse gas reduction; Life cycle assessment; Sustainable neighborhoods; Sustainable site development; Timber building","carbon storage; climate effect; concrete structure; demand analysis; global warming; heating; life cycle analysis; neighborhood; Sustainable Development Goal; timber; urban development; wood; Bavaria; Germany; Munich",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088840537

Based on the ""Poland's national energy and climate plan for the years 2021-2030"", Poland aims to achieve 21%-23% of RES share in gross final energy consumption by 2030. While coal is still the most important source of energy, new technological and organisational solutions for increasing RESs are being tested and implemented. Therefore, the creation of energy clusters based on the idea of urban and industrial symbiosis was first proposed by the Ministry of Energy in 2016. To date, there are 66 clusters in different regions in Poland, but only a few of them are active and innovative. One of them is located in the city of Zakopane, a mountain resort, which attracts about 3 million tourists annually and has developed the wide-ranging use of geothermal sources for energy supply and recreation. The paper aims to analyse the impact of the creation of energy clusters on the city's development, including economic, social, and environmental aspects. The ""willingness to pay"" (WTP) method was used to calculate the impact of air pollution on Zakopane and to compare it with the Polish average to estimate the significance of the transformation to RESs in this tourist city. The results from the studies are as follows: health cost per capita in Zakopane is between 252.07 and 921.30 euro.

We found that the projected climate change and intensive land use decreased their total biomass. Strikingly, this reduction was realized via two dissimilar pathways: climate change reduced mean body size and intensive land use decreased density. These findings highlight that two of the most pervasive global change drivers operate via different pathways when decreasing soil animal biomass.

We use these transmission projections to assess the change in burden in 2050 and 2070. We find disease burden changes heterogeneously across the region. In the least severe scenario, we find a 93.0%[95%CI(92.7, 93.2%)] chance that annual deaths will increase in 2050. This change in epidemiology will complicate future control efforts. Thus, we may need to consider the effect of changing climatic variables on future intervention strategies. © Gaythorpe et al.",,"Africa; Article; climate change; cross reaction; disease burden; disease transmission; endemic disease; geographic distribution; immunization; mortality rate; mosquito bite; nonhuman; risk assessment; sea surface temperature; seroprevalence; temperature; virus transmission; yellow fever; Aedes; animal; epidemic; global disease burden; human; mosquito vector; physiology; yellow fever; Aedes; Africa; Animals; Climate Change; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Global Burden of Disease; Humans; Mosquito Vectors; Yellow Fever",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088811170

The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to examine the effects of different acute hypoxic conditions on partial pressure of arterial oxygen ((Formula presented.)), arterial oxygen saturation of hemoglobin ((Formula presented.)), and regional cerebral saturation of hemoglobin (rSO2); and (b) to evaluate supplemental CO2 as a tool to improve oxygenation in acutely hypoxic individuals. We hypothesized that exposure to gas mixtures with added CO2 would improve oxygenation in hypoxic human subjects. Twenty healthy subjects were exposed to 5-min intervals of two gas mixtures: hypoxic gas mixture containing 8% oxygen, and a CO2-enriched mixture containing 8% oxygen plus either 3% or 5% CO2. Ten subjects received the 3% CO2-enriched mixture, and the remaining 10 subjects received the 5% CO2-enriched mixture. The order of exposure was randomized. Blood gases, pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO2, and cerebral oximetry were measured. Compared to the purely hypoxic gas group, (Formula presented.) was increased in the 3% and 5% CO2-enriched groups by 14.9 and 9.5 mmHg, respectively. Compared to pure hypoxia, (Formula presented.) was increased in the 3% and 5% CO2-enriched groups by 16.8% and 12.9%, respectively. Both CO2-enriched gas groups had significantly higher end-exposure rSO2 and recovered to baseline rSO2 within 1 min, compared to the pure hypoxic gas group, which returned to baseline in 5 min. These results suggest that in acutely hypoxic subjects, CO2 supplementation improves blood oxygen saturation and oxygen tension as well as cerebral oxygenation measures. © 2020 The Authors.

Our aim is to minimize an average aggregated system cost through joint optimization of electric vehicle's energy procurement price, load scheduling delays, photovoltaic sufficiency in terms of locally generated renewable energy mix, and battery degradation. Through subsequent modification and reformulation of the joint optimization problem, we utilize the concept of one-slot look-ahead queue stability to solve the problem by employing the Lyapunov optimization technique. We show that the joint optimization problem is separable into sub-problems, which are sequentially solved with asymptotic optimality and a bounded performance guarantee. Simulations are carried in different scenarios and under varying weather conditions. Results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve a daily electric vehicle's photovoltaic sufficiency up to 50.50%, a monthly bill reduction up to 72.61%, and a yearly reduced CO_2 emission level up to 6.06 kg, while meeting electric vehicle user's energy and delay requirements. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","charging station; energy storage; load scheduling; optimization; photovoltaic generation; photovoltaic sufficiency; Real-time","Electric automobiles; Energy storage; Optimization; Storage management; Vehicle-to-grid; Asymptotic optimality; Battery degradation; Dynamics of system; Energy procurement; Joint optimization; Optimization techniques; Performance guarantees; Renewable energies; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088777494

This is the sixth in a series of annual ‘State of the UK Climate’ publications and an update to the 2018 report (Kendon et al., 2019). It provides an accessible, authoritative and up-to-date assessment of UK climate trends, variations and extremes based on the most up to date observational datasets of climate quality. The majority of this report is based on observations of temperature, precipitation, sunshine and wind speed from the UK land weather station network as managed by the Met Office and a number of key partners and co-operating volunteers. The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. Time series of near-coast sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-level are also presented and in addition a short section on phenology which provides dates of first leaf and bare tree indicators for four common shrub or tree species. National and regional statistics in this report are from the HadUK-Grid dataset (Hollis et al., 2019). Temperature and rainfall series from this dataset extend back to 1884 and 1862, respectively. Details are provided in the relevant sections and appendices. The report presents summary statistics for the year 2019 and the most recent decade (2010–2019) relative to 1961–1990 and 1981–2010 averages. The period 2010–2019 is a non-standard reference period, but it provides a 10-year ‘snapshot’ of the most recent experience of the UK's climate and how that compares to historical records. This means differences between 2010 and 2019 and the baseline reference averages may reflect shorter-term decadal variations as well as long-term trends. These data are presented to show what has happened in recent years, not necessarily what is expected to happen in a changing climate. The majority of maps in this report show the year 2019 relative to the 1981–2010 baseline reference averaging period—that is, they are anomaly maps which show the spatial variation in this difference from average. Maps of actual values are in most cases not displayed because these are dominated by the underlying climatology, which for this report is of a lesser interest than the year-to-year variability. Throughout the report's text the terms ‘above normal’ and ‘above average’, and so on refer to the 1981–2010 baseline reference averaging period unless otherwise stated. Values quoted in tables throughout this report are rounded, but where the difference between two such values is quoted in the text (e.g., comparing the most recent decade with 1981–2010), this difference is calculated from the original unrounded values. Updates compared to State of UK Climate 2018. A section on phenology has been added The method used to calculate rainfall percentiles (fig. 31) has been revised Updated climate data to HadUK-Grid version 1.0.2.0, including data rescue projects that have improved or extended early monthly sunshine and rainfall series.

The hourly wind data of 10 years (2005-2015) that correspond to the wind potential of the site were analyzed, such as: dominant wind directions, probability distribution, Weibull parameters, mean wind speed and power potential. The site has a mean annual wind speed of 4.46 m/s at 10m height, and enough space to locate the wind turbines. A comparative study was carried out between four wind turbine technologies to improve the site's efficiency and select the appropriate technology: PowerWind 56/ 900 kW, Nordex N50/800 kW, Vestas V50/850 kW, NEG-Micon 44/750 kW. The estimate of the energy produced using WAsP software and the choice of the optimal architectural configuration for wind turbines installation was confirmed. A techno-economic and environmental study was carried out by HOMER software, to choose the model that produces the maximum annual net energy with a competitive cost in the global wind energy market, $ 0.068/kWh, and that provides clean energy with a reduced emission of polluting gases.

In this paper, we intend to fill this gap by using the Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model to discuss the nonlinear relationship between transportation infrastructure construction and air quality. The panel data includes 280 cities in China for the period 2000-2017. We find that the transportation infrastructure investment is positively correlated to the air quality when the GDP per capita is below RMB 7151 or the number of motor vehicle population per capita is below 37 (vehicles per 10,000 persons) where the model is in the lower regime, and that the transportation infrastructure investment is negatively correlated to the air quality when the GDP per capita is greater than RMB 7151 or the number of motor vehicle population per capita is larger than 37 (vehicles per 10,000 persons) where the model is in the upper regime. The empirical results of the three sub-samples, including eastern, western and central regions, are similar to that of the national level. Furthermore, increasing transportation infrastructure investment is conducive to improving air quality. Urban bus services, green area, population density, wind speed and rainfall are also conducive to reducing air pollution, but the role of environmental regulation is not significant. After adding the instrumental variable (urban built-up area), the conclusions are further supported. Finally, relevant policy recommendations for reducing air pollution are proposed based on the empirical results. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; PSTR model; Transportation infrastructure; Urban road area","air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; investment; panel data; pollution policy; transport vehicle; transportation infrastructure; urban transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088667630

The objectives of this paper were to examine the bias of technological change (BTC), input-biased technological change (IBTC), and output-biased technological change (OBTC), and their influencing factors in the sustainable development of China's regional transportation industry from 2005 to 2017. A slack-based measure (SBM) Malmquist productivity index was adopted to measure the BTC, IBTC, and OBTC by decomposing green total factor productivity. The results revealed that: (1) Continuous technological bias progress and input-biased technological progress existed in China's transportation development from 2005 to 2017, making an important contribution to green total factor productivity. The output-biased technological change was close to 1, indicating a slight impact on the sustainable development of the transportation industry; (2) The bias of technological progress in eastern regions was slightly greater than that in central regions, and obviously greater than that in western regions. Moreover, different provinces experienced different types of technological bias change, with four major types observed during the research period; (3) The input-biased technology of a majority of provinces tended to invest more capital relative to labor, using more capital comparing to energy, and consume more energy relative to labor, while the output-biased technology of most provinces tended to produce desirable outputs (value added in transportation) and reduce the byproduct of CO2 relatively; (4) Average years of education, green patents in transportation, industrial scale, and local government fiscal expenditure in transportation significantly contributed to promoting the bias of technological progress, which was inhibited by theR&amp;Dinvestment. This study provides further insight into the improvement of sustainable development for China's transportation, thereby helping to guide the government to promote green-biased technological progress and optimize the allocation of resources. © 2020 by the authors.","China; Sustainable development; Technological bias; Transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088664822

The impact of climate change and that of air pollution differ in space and time, but spatially-explicit, systematic evaluations of the effectiveness of alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies in mitigating both climate change and air pollution are lacking. In this work, we estimate the life cycle monetized damages due to greenhouse gas emissions and criteria air pollutant emissions for different types of passenger-moving vehicles in the United States. We find substantial spatial variability in the monetized damages for all fuel-vehicle technologies studied. None of the fuel-vehicle technologies leads simultaneously to the lowest climate change damages and the lowest air pollution damages across all U.S. counties. Instead, the fuel-vehicle technology that best mitigates climate change in one region is different from that for the best air quality (i.e. the trade-off between decarbonization and air pollution mitigation). For example, for the state of Pennsylvania, battery-electric cars lead to the lowest population-weighted-average climate change damages (a climate change damage of 0.87 cent/mile and an air pollution damage of 1.71 cent/mile). In contrast, gasoline hybrid-electric cars lead to the lowest population-weighted-average air pollution damages (a climate change damage of 0.92 cent/mile and an air pollution damage of 0.77 cent/mile). Vehicle electrification has great potential to reduce climate change damages but may increase air pollution damages substantially in regions with high shares of coal-fired power plants compared to conventional vehicles.

Low-lying coastal urban centers, populated deltas, and coastal protected areas are key societal hotspots of coastal vulnerability in terms of relative sea level change. Land deformation on a local scale can significantly affect estimations, so it is necessary to understand the rhythm and spatial distribution of potential land subsidence/uplift in coastal areas. The present study deals with the determination of the relative vertical rates of the land deformation and the sea-surface height by using multi-source Earth observation-synthetic aperture radar (SAR), global navigation satellite system (GNSS), tide gauge, and altimetry data. To this end, the multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MT-InSAR) technique was used in order to exploit the most recent Copernicus Sentinel-1 data. The products were set to a reference frame by using GNSS measurements and were combined with a re-analysis model assimilating satellite altimetry data, obtained by the Copernicus Marine Service. Additional GNSS and tide gauge observations have been used for validation purposes. The proposed methodological approach has been implemented in three pilot cases: the city of Alexandroupolis in the Evros Delta region, the coastal zone of Thermaic Gulf, and the coastal area of Killini, Araxos (Patras Gulf) in the northwestern Peloponnese, which are Greek coastal areas with special characteristics. The present research provides localized relative sea-level estimations for the three case studies. Their variation is high, ranging from values close to zero, i.e., from 5-10 cm and 30 cm in 50 years for urban areas to values of 50-60 cm in 50 years for rural areas, close to the coast. The results of this research work can contribute to the effective management of coastal areas in the framework of adaptation and mitigation strategies attributed to climate change. Scaling up the proposed methodology to a continental level is required in order to overcome the existing lack of proper assessment of the relevant hazard in Europe. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change impact; Coastal urban centers; GNSS; Land subsidence; Multi-temporal SAR interferometry; Natural protected areas; Relative sea level change; Satellite altimetry data; Sea-surface height","Climate change; Coastal zones; Conservation; Deformation; Environmental protection; Global positioning system; Hazards; Observatories; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Tide gages; Earth observation data; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Land subsidence/uplift; Methodological approach; Natural protected areas; Relative sea level rise; Relative sea-level changes; Satellite altimetry data; Sea level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088658684

Some scholars have put forward the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for CO2 emissions in China. This paper utilized the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 1997 to 2016 to verify the EKC hypothesis. To explore the real reasons behind the EKC, the index gasoline to diesel consumption ratio (GDCR) was introduced in this paper. The regression results showed that CO2 emissions and GDP form an inverted U-shaped curve. This means that the EKC hypothesis holds. The regression results also showed that a 1% GDCR increase was coupled with a 0.118186% or 0.114056% CO2 emission decrease with the panel fully modified ordinary least squares or panel dynamic ordinary least squares method, respectively. This means that CO2 emissions negatively correlate with GDCR. From the discussion of this paper, the growth rate reduction of CO2 emissions is caused by the economic transition in China. As changes of GDCR can, from a special perspective, reflect the economic transition, and as GDCR is negatively correlated with CO2 emissions, GDCR can sometimes be used as a new socioeconomic indicator of carbon dioxide emissions in China. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Environmental Kuznets curve; Gasoline to diesel consumption ratio","carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; fuel consumption; Gross Domestic Product; Kuznets curve; market transition; panel data; socioeconomic indicator; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088656981

Drawing on the smart-city concept and considering the different historical developments of Alpine resorts, the Smart Altitude Decision-Making Toolkit was developed using a combination of an energy audit tool, a WebGIS, and collaborative and innovative living labs installed in Les Orres (France), Madonna di Campiglio (Italy), Krvavec (Slovenia), and Verbier (Switzerland). This step-by-step Decision-Making Toolkit enables ski resorts to get feedback on their energy demand, an overview of the locally available sources of renewable energy, and insights regarding their potential for improving their energy efficiency by low-carbon interventions. The Decision-Making Toolkit is suitable for knowledge transfer between stakeholders within living labs and moreover provides the flexibility for tailor-made low-carbon strategies adapting to the unique assets and situatedness of ski resorts. © 2020 by the authors.","Living lab; Low-carbon economy; Mountain tourism; Renewable energy; Resort towns; Transformation knowledge","decision making; demand-side management; emission inventory; energy efficiency; GIS; greenhouse gas; historical record; innovation; interdisciplinary approach; knowledge; tourism development; Alps; France; Italy; Krvavec Mountain; Slovenia; Switzerland; Valais; Verbier",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088654765

LCE planning is an interminable process affected by a multitude of social, economic, environmental, and health factors. A major challenge for policy makers is to select a future clean energy strategy that maximizes sustainability. Thus, policy formulation and evaluation need to be addressed in an analytical manner including multidisciplinary knowledge emanating from diverse social stakeholders. In the current work, a comparative analysis of LCE planning is provided, evaluating different multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies. Initially, by applying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, the available energy alternative technologies are prioritized. A variety of stakeholders is surveyed for that reason. To deal with the ambiguity that occurred in their judgements, fuzzy goal programming (FGP) is used for the translation into fuzzy numbers. Then, the stochastic fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (SF-AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (F-TOPSIS) are applied to evaluate a repertoire of energy alternative forms including biofuel, solar, hydro, and wind power. The methodologies are estimated based on the same set of tangible and intangible criteria for the case study of Thessaly Region, Greece. The application of FGP ranked the four energy types in terms of feasibility and positioned solar-generated energy as first, with a membership function of 0.99. Among the criteria repertoire used by the stakeholders, the SF-AHP evaluated all the criteria categories separately and selected the most significant category representative. Finally, F-TOPSIS assessed these criteria ordering the energy forms, in terms of descending order of ideal solution, as follows: solar, biofuel, hydro, and wind. © 2020 by the authors.","Clean energy technology; F-TOPSIS; FGP; Fuzzy methodologies; Low-carbon energy (LCE); Multicriteria decision making (MCDM); Policy; SF-AHP; SWOT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088651387

The objective of this research was to investigate airflow properties downwind of a NVPB with a roofed outdoor exercise yard for roof slopes of 5°, 15°, and 25°. Air velocities downwind a 1:50 scaled NVPB model were measured using a Laser Doppler Anemometer in a large boundary layer wind tunnel. A region with reduced mean air velocities was found along the downwind side of the building with a distance up to 0.5 m (i.e., 3.8 times building height), in which the emission concentration might be high. Additional air pollutant treatment technologies applied in this region might contribute to emission mitigation effectively. Furthermore, a wake zone with air recirculation was observed in this area. A smaller roof slope (i.e., 5° slope) resulted in a higher and shorter wake zone and thus a shorter air pollutant dispersion distance. © 2020 by the authors.","Dispersion; Emission; Roof slope; Scaled model; Turbulence; Wind tunnel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088649806

Most transport means operate using fossil fuels, creating the urgent need for a rapid transformation of the sector. In this research, we examine the transport systems of Norway and Canada, two countries with similar shares of greenhouse gas emissions from transport and powerful oil industries operating within their boundaries. Our socio-technical analysis, based on the Sectoral Innovation Systems approach, attempts to identify the elements enabling Norway to become one of the leaders in the diffusion of electric vehicles, as well as the differences pacing down progress in Canada. By utilising the System Failure framework to compare the two systems, bottlenecks hindering the decarbonisation of the two transport systems are identified. Results indicate that the effectiveness of Norway's policy is exaggerated and has led to recent spillover effects towards green shipping. The activity of oil companies, regional and federal legislative disputes in Canada and the lack of sincere efforts from system actors to address challenges lead to non-drastic greenhouse gas emission reductions, despite significant policy efforts from both countries. Insights into the effectiveness of previously implemented policies and the evolution of the two sectoral systems can help draw lessons towards sustainable transport. © 2020 by the authors.","Canada; Climate policy; Electric mobility; Norway; Sectoral innovation systems; Socio-technical transitions; System failure framework; Systems of innovation; Transportation","electric vehicle; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; innovation; international agreement; planning legislation; policy development; spillover effect; transportation system; Canada; Norway",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088649336

Crevasse splays represent significant geomorphological features for understanding the fluvial morphodynamics in lowland areas dominated by avulsion processes. Within wide floodplains characterized by very low elevation ranges, the detection and accurate mapping of crevasse splay morphology and features, such as crevasse channels, levees, and deposit, can be very challenging considering floodplain extension, anthropic impact on the natural channels network, logistic difficulties, and in some cases, climate conditions that prevent field work. This research aims at improving the detection and mapping of crevasse splays in lowland areas through the combination of different remote sensing techniques based on optical multispectral imagery and topographic data derived from satellite earth observation missions. The Lower Mesopotamia Plain (LMP) offers a unique opportunity to study the avulsion processes because it presents numerous examples of crevasse splays, characterized by different sizes and states of activity. Furthermore, in this area, a strong correlation exists between the formation and development of crevasse splays and the expansion of agriculture and early societies since the Early Holocene. Different supervised classification (SC) methods of Landsat 8 satellite images have been tested together with topographic analysis of the microrelief, carried out based on two different 1-arcsec DEMs (AW3D30 and GDEM2). The results of this study demonstrate that the combination of multispectral imagery analysis and topographic analysis of the microrelief is useful for discerning different crevasse elements, distinguishing between active and relict landforms. The methodological approach proved helpful for improving the mapping of erosional and depositional landforms generated by the avulsion process and, in the study area, provided the best results for the active landforms. © 2020 by the authors.","Avulsion processes; Crevasse splays; Mesopotamian plain; Multispectral analysis; Relief analysis","Agricultural robots; Floods; Geomorphology; Image analysis; Landforms; Mapping; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Earth observations; Economic activities; Methodological approach; Multi-spectral imagery; Remote sensing techniques; Strong correlation; Supervised classification; Topographic analysis; Image enhancement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088648324

Shanghai was chosen as a typical case study, owing to its relatively high level of progress in terms of urbanization and its complex economic, social, and ecological development problems. In this indicator system, 23 indicators were screened, based on the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. Economic, social, and ecological development data for Shanghai from 2005 to 2018 were collected and analyzed using an entropy method. This was followed by the application of a weighted average method to determine the indicator weights and co-benefits index (CBI) for Shanghai. The results yield variations in the weights of the indexes. The weight of the tertiary industry production proportion in the GDP was the highest, owing to the government promotional policies, whereas the weight of the annual average temperature was the smallest, as global warming only becomes significant when the time span is much longer. In such a short time span (i.e., 14years), the change in the annual average temperature is relatively insignificant. The Co-benefit Index also varied over time; it showed a growing trend over the 14 years, increasing from 0.375 in 2005 to 1.365 in 2018, i.e., a 264% increase. This indicates that the efforts taken in Shanghai and their effects were positive, overall. Four suggestions were proposed, based on the results of the analysis: a) control the amount of total energy consumption and change the energy structure to reduce carbon and air pollution emissions; b) adjust the structure of industry, especially by increasing the proportion of tertiary industries; c) increase investments in environmental protection; and d) cooperate with regional partners to limit the occurrence of acid rain. The applicability of this approach and research prospects are also discussed. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Co-benefit index; DPSIR; Negative externalities in cities; Transition to the sustainable city","atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; economic development; energy conservation; environmental assessment; environmental economics; environmental indicator; environmental protection; government; greenhouse gas; investment; megacity; pollution policy; sustainability; urbanization; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088646220

While it may be common knowledge that the 2030 agenda cannot be achieved on a business-as-usual trajectory, this study seeks to determine to what ends the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have impacted CSR research. Highlighting linkages and interdependencies between the SDGs and evolution of CSR practice, this paper analyzes a final sample of 56 relevant journal articles from the period 2015-2020. With the intent of bridging policy and practice, thematic coding analysis has supported the identification and interpretation of key emergent research themes. Using threedescriptive categorical classifications (i.e., single-dimension, bi-combination of dimensions, sustainability dimension), the results of this paper provide an in-depth discussion into strategic community, company, consumer, investor, and employee foci. Furthermore, the analysis provides a timely and descriptive overview of how CSR research has approached the SDGs and which ones are being prioritized. By deepening the understanding of potential synergies between business strategy, global climate agendas and the common good, this paper contributes to an increased comprehension of how CSR and financial performance can be improved over the long-term. © 2020 by the authors.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Sustainability; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)","corporate social responsibility; global climate; policy approach; strategic approach; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088642388

In the present study, three key parameters related to the peat bogs' surface wetness dynamics in European Russia during the Holocene were investigated using modern statistical analysis. These parameters are: (i) the water table depth (WTD) in relation to the surface, which is reconstructed based on the community structure of the subfossil testate amoeba assemblages; (ii) the peat humification estimated as absorption of alkaline extract that directly reflects moisture at which the peat was formed; (iii) the Climate Moisture Index (CMI) and the Aridity Index derived from pollen-based reconstructions of the mean annual temperature and precipitation and classifying moisture conditions as the ratio between available annual precipitation and potential land surface evapotranspiration. All these parameters provide useful information about the paleoclimate (atmospheric moisture component) dynamics. High values of WTD and peat humification appear to comply with Gutenberg-Richter law. It is noteworthy that this law also seems to reproduce the high values of the modeled climate moisture and aridity indices. The validity of this new result is checked by replacing ""conventional time"" with ""natural time"". On this basis, a new nowcasting tool is developed to more accurately estimate the average waiting time for the extreme values of these climate parameters. This will help to understand climate variability better to address emerging development needs and priorities by implementing empirical studies of the interactions between climatic effects, mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable growth. © 2020 by the authors.","Aridity index; Climate moisture index; Gutenberg-Richter law; Nowcasting; Paleoclimate","atmospheric pollution; climate variation; community structure; data set; fossil assemblage; Holocene; humification; index method; nowcasting; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); protist; subfossil; Russian Federation; White tip die-back phytoplasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088639090

The current literature is collected and organized to provide an insight into the specific role of microbes toward plants and pollutants. Several aspects are discussed, such as important components of FTWs, common bacterial species, rhizospheric and endophytes bacteria, and their specific role in the pollutant removal process. The roots of plants release oxygen and exudates, which act as a substrate for microbial growth. The bacteria attach themselves to the roots and form biofilms to get nutrients from the plants. Along the plants, the microbial community also influences the performance of FTWs. The bacterial community contributes to the removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, toxic metals, hydrocarbon, and organic compounds. Plant-microbe interaction breaks down complex compounds into simple nutrients, mobilizes metal ions, and increases the uptake of pollutants by plants. The inoculation of the roots of plants with acclimatized microbes may improve the phytoremediation potential of FTWs. The bacteria also encourage plant growth and the bioavailability of toxic pollutants and can alleviate metal toxicity. © 2020 by the authors.","Floating treatment wetlands; Microbes; Plants; Pollutants; Water","bacterium; literature review; microbial community; microorganism; pollutant removal; remediation; wastewater treatment; wetland; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088637977

Non-state actors have responded by declaring their commitment to work together alongside nations as climate agreements struggle to deliver the necessary global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, conservation goals are not met, and security issues diversify. A principal constituent of the world's non-state actors are cities. With many cities now home to more than 10 million individuals and several cities of more than 20 million, the urban world has come to dominate the global economy as well as the resource needs and environmental burdens imposed upon the planet by our species. Urban economies are responsible for more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions and substantially affect the world's biodiversity by driving the extraction of resources and the degradation of global natural capital. Cities have become concentrators of diverse risk that complicate and broaden global security priorities. Cities are also crucibles of innovation in technology, business and governance and strong alliances between the world's cities have formed to address the challenges of climate change, biodiversity and more. This paper asserts the unique potential for cities to assume a greater role in global priorities, including climate change, biodiversity loss and a realignment of security priorities. The transformative changes required in these three domains calls for a renewal of the city as a semi-autonomous neo-state, an ecological city-state. © 2020 by the authors.","Cities; Climate change; Ecological city-state; Greenhouse gas emissions; Non-state actor","biodiversity; climate change; disaster management; environmental economics; global economy; urban area; urban economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088636066

For a better understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of vertical aerosol layers, the interannual and seasonal variations of nine selected aerosol parameters such as the AOD of the lowest aerosol layer (AODL), the base height of the lowest aerosol layer (HL), the top height of the highest aerosol layer (HH), the volume depolarization ratio of the lowest aerosol layer (DRL), the color ratio of the lowest aerosol layer (CRL), total AOD of all the aerosol layers (AODT), the number of aerosol feature layers (N), the thickness of the lowest aerosol layer (TL), the AOD proportion for the lowest aerosol layer (PAODL) for both day and night times are analyzed. The results show AODT increased slightly from 2007 to 2014 over Pakistan, and relatively high AODT exists over the Punjab and Sindh (southern region), which might be owing to the high level of economic development, frequent dust storms, and profound agricultural activities (anthropogenic emissions). AODT increases from north to south. The reason may be that the southern region is rapidly urbanized and is near the desert. The northern region is dominated by agricultural land, and cities are usually semi-urbanized. The highest AODT appears in summer compared to the other seasons, and during daytime compared to nighttime. The HL and HH vary significantly, owing to the topography of Pakistan. The N is relatively large over Punjab and Sindh compared to the other regions, which might be caused by relatively stronger atmospheric convections. The spatial distribution of the TL showed an inverse relationship with the topography as lower values are observed over elevated regions such as Gilgit-Baltistan and Jammu-Kashmir. The value of the PAODL indicates that 77% of the total aerosols are mainly concentrated in the lowest layer of the atmosphere over Pakistan. The higher values of DRL and CRL indicate non-spherical and large particles over Balochistan and Sindh, which might be related to the proximity to the desert. This study provides very useful information about vertically distributed aerosol optical properties which could help researchers and policymakers to regulate and mitigate air pollution issues of Pakistan. © 2020 by the authors.","Aerosol layers; Aerosols; AOD; CALIPSO; Pakistan","Aerosols; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Optical properties; Optical radar; Storms; Topography; Agricultural activities; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric convection; Cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations; Depolarization ratio; Distributed aerosol; Inverse relationship; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088632215

At the same time, the adaptive capacity of local governance is highly context sensitive, making a “one-size fits all” approach inappropriate. Thus, a versatile methodological approach for application in various local contexts is required. There are several indicator-based local governance assessment methods for evaluating the effectiveness of local governance for climate change adaptation. However, they fall short of identifying and prioritizing between key factors within local governance for enhancing adaptive capacity and driving positive change. Building on adaptation theory, the authors propose combining two methodological approaches, the Capital Approach Framework for evaluating the adaptive capacity of local governance and Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping for identifying leverage points, into one integrated modeling approach, which can be applied by local researchers. This paper describes the process and benefits of combining the methodological approaches, with an example provided as supporting information. Assisting decision-makers and policy planners from subnational governance in identifying leverage points to focus and maximize impact of capacity-enhancing measures would make a key contribution for successful implementation of the UNFCCC National Adaptation Plans. ©2020.

The most recent of these events occurred in 2018. Although it was monitored by several spacecraft in orbit and on the surface, many questions remain regarding its onset, expansion and decay. Here, we model the 2018 event with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Mars Global Climate Model in order to better understand the evolution of the storm. Our results highlight a mechanism for the expansion of the storm: the initial equatorial regional storm creates a zonal atmospheric temperature gradient causing strong equatorial eastward winds and thus rapid eastward transport of dust and subsequent lifting. The model shows rapid back and forth transfer of dust between western and eastern hemispheres reservoirs, which may also play an important role in the storm's development through teleconnections involving replenishment of surface dust. The model also shows that gigantic dust plumes occur during the storm's mature phase, injecting dust up to 80 km. Our analysis shows that their upward motion in the atmosphere is due to the ascending branches of Hadley cells, whose intensity is reinforced during the storm with increasing dustiness. We show that the global atmospheric warming during the storm cause vapor and water ice clouds to migrate to higher altitudes, in line with recent observations. Finally, we find that the choice of effective radius for the lifted dust particle size distribution impacts the intensity of the Hadley circulation and could explain some of the differences obtained between model results and observations. ©2020.

Yet few studies have accounted for natural and agricultural land impacts of low-carbon pathways and how environmental siting constraints affect electricity costs and technology choices. To address this gap, we developed an integrated land-energy planning framework to examine the land use trade-offs of renewable energy development required to achieve ambitious clean energy goals, using the state of California as a case study. Using high-resolution ecological and agricultural datasets for 11 Western U.S. states, we modeled environmentally-constrained onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, and geothermal potential and used an electricity capacity expansion model to build generation portfolios for 2050. Here we show that California can meet its targets, but the technology mix, spatial build-out, and system costs are sensitive to land protections and availability of out-of-state renewable resources. Results suggest that failure to consider land availability in energy planning could increase uncertainties, environmental impacts, and risks in meeting subnational climate targets. © 2020 The Author(s).

This area has suffered numerous earthquakes and presents a major seismic risk. Although the Sea of Marmara has been studied for many years, the link between geological morphostructures, the nature of fluids and biological communities is still rarely described. During the Marsite cruise (November 2014), dives with Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) VICTOR 6000 focused on detailed seafloor explorations of four different areas: the Central and Western highs and the Tekirdağ and Çinarcik basins. Based on 130 h of in situ videos, high-resolution seafloor mapping of seeps was conducted, emphasizing their significant geological and biological diversity from one seeping site to another, from one basin/high to another. Gas bubbles (CH4, CO2), shimmering water (brine, marine and fresh water) and oil, escape from the seafloor into the water column with low to strong fluxes. Black patches of reduced sediments, authigenic carbonate crusts and chimneys compose the seep environments with various types of bacterial mats and chemosynthetic fauna. Several venting sites discovered during previous cruises are still active 7–12 years later. The seeps are mostly, but not only, focalized along the Main Marmara Fault (MMF), at the southern border of the Tekirdağ Basin and along the Western High. Fluid emission is also occurring at secondary faults and at their intersection with the MMF. Our study emphasizes the location of seeps at the foot of slopes, gully outlets and crossroads. Sedimentary features, such as mass wastings, stratigraphic discontinuities or canyons, also interact with fluid emissions. The observed fauna is dominated by Bathymodiolinae, Vesicomyidae, Lucinidae-like empty shells and tubiculous worms resembling Ampharetidae polychatea. Most of the symbiont-bearing taxa encountered and previously sampled in the Marmara Sea, are characterized by thiotrophic symbioses. Vesicomyids and Idas sp. mussels are present at gas seeps, but also in areas where crude oil escapes from the seafloor. Moreover, other taxa unusually encountered at cold seeps such as large-sized amphipod and vagile worms were observed in the Çinarcik Basin. Idas-like mussels were observed in the western part of the Sea of Marmara, in the Tekirdağ Basin and possibly on the Western High active seep sites. There, the sampled fluids had high methane content (reaching 65 μmol/l) but not as high as on the Central High (363 μmol/l) and Çinarcik Basin (228 μmol/l) where no mussels were observed in the video records. Bottom waters oxygen levels in the Sea of Marmara showed a west to east decreasing gradient (57–8.5 μmol/l). These oxygen conditions, which fall under the limit of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ &lt;20 μm/l) in the eastern part, may impact benthic fauna and explain the absence of symbiotrophic bivalves at cold seep sites of the Çinarcik Basin, whereas densely aggregated amphipods, likely more tolerant to oxygen stress were observed in the seepage area. Finally, no specific fauna was observed near the CO2-rich seep sites. First observations suggest that seep fauna composition in the Sea of Marmara does not seem to be strongly influenced by the nature (e.g., oil, gas bubbling, brines) of fluid venting through seeps. The seep environments are highly variable and characterized by distinctive geological morphostructures. They sustain typical Mediterranean cold seep fauna, but also unusual communities likely related to the interaction of seeps with hypoxic conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chemosynthetic fauna; Cold seeps; Fluids; Methane; Sea of Marmara; Seismogenic faults","Bubble formation; Carbon dioxide; Crude oil; Earthquakes; Molluscs; Oxygen; Stratigraphy; Strike-slip faults; Authigenic carbonates; Biological community; Hypoxic condition; Methane content; North Anatolian Fault; Oxygen minimum zone; Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV); Seafloor mapping; Remotely operated vehicles; amphipod; benthic fauna; biodiversity; bivalve; bottom water; cold seep organism; cruise report; fluid expulsion; methane; North Anatolian Fault; remotely operated vehicle; seafloor mapping; venting; water column; Sea of Marmara; Turkey; Ampharetidae; Amphipoda; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bathymodiolinae; Bivalvia; Idas; Lucinidae; Vesicomyidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088571638

This study synthesizes 40 years of scientific evidence of what may be an important benefit of these commitments: the non-use value of biodiversity conservation. The synthesis investigates whether biodiversity values can be integrated into climate change damage estimates based on non-use valuation studies of different threats to biodiversity. In the absence of estimates of public willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid the adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change on biodiversity, we synthesize non-use values for biodiversity conservation from stated preference studies that account for a heterogeneous set of biodiversity threats. We test whether biodiversity non-use values are affected by the threats that policies aim to address, be it human activities or other threats. We estimate meta-regression models in which we explain the variation in these non-use values by accounting for the observed heterogeneity in good, methodology, sample, and context characteristics. We estimate meta-regression models using 159 observations from 62 publications. The models suggest that non-use values for biodiversity conservation addressing human impacts may be larger than those addressing other threats. We also find that non-use values are generally not sensitive to which biodiversity indicators, habitat types, or taxonomic groups are valued. We predict that the mean annual WTP for avoiding human-caused biodiversity losses ranges from 0.2 to 0.4% of GDP per capita. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art climate change damage functions in integrated assessment models may underestimate actual damage costs because they do not incorporate the premium that the public is willing to pay to avoid human-caused biodiversity losses. © 2020 The Author(s).

Two periods are considered: before and during the adoption of the main directives limiting human activities to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first period is from 5 February to 5 March, and the second is from 13 March to 13 April. Meteorological conditions in the two periods were compared and significant differences were not observed. Therefore, the comparison of air quality data is feasible. During the second period, an intercontinental transport of particulate matter occurred. Data collected during this event (4 p.m. on 30 March to 4 p.m. on 31 March) were excluded from the analysis. The main reduction of pollutant concentration is observed for NO2 (-48% of the period average). PM10 shows a lower reduction (-17%). The PM2.5 average period concentration was quite constant, while the 98° percentile was reduced by -21%. Ozone shows, on the contrary, an increase in concentration due mainly to an increase in solar irradiation during the 2nd period, but also due to the decrease of NOx concentration. The reduction or the increase of pollutant concentration depends on the category of the station: background, industrial, residential, and traffic. In addition to air quality, the reduction of anthropogenic emissions is also studied. All the information available on the reduction of emissions from transport, industry, heating, and other main emissive sectors were collected. The results give useful insights for the development of air quality management policies that could be adopted when the sanitary emergency will end to guarantee the sustainable development of the Campania region. © 2020 by the authors.","Air monitoring; Lockdown; NO2; O3; particulate matter; SARS-CoV-2","air quality; anthropogenic source; climate conditions; disease spread; human activity; infectious disease; meteorology; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; viral disease; Campania [Italy]; Italy; SARS coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088558221

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States","Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (SAG) is suggested as a potential way to reduce the climate impacts of global warming. Using simulations from the Geoengineering Large Ensemble project that employed stratospheric sulfate aerosols injection to keep global mean surface temperature and also the interhemispheric and equator-to-pole temperature gradients at their 2020 values (present-day climate) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario, we investigate the potential impact of SAG on the West African Summer Monsoon (WASM) precipitation and the involved physical processes. Results indicate that under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, during the monsoon period, precipitation increases by 44.76%, 19.74%, and 5.14% compared to the present-day climate in the Northern Sahel, Southern Sahel, and Western Africa region, respectively. Under SAG, relative to the present-day climate, the WASM rainfall is practically unchanged in the Northern Sahel region but in Southern Sahel and Western Africa regions, rainfall is reduced by 4.06% (0.19 ± 0.22 mm) and 10.87% (0.72 ± 0.27 mm), respectively. This suggests that SAG deployed to offset all warming would be effective at offsetting the effects of climate change on rainfall in the Sahel regions but that it would be overeffective in Western Africa, turning a modest positive trend into a negative trend twice as large. By applying the decomposition method, we quantified the relative contribution of different physical mechanisms responsible for precipitation changes under SAG. Results reveal that changes in the WASM precipitation are mainly driven by the reduction of the low-level land-sea thermal contrast that leads to weakened monsoon circulation and a northward shift of the monsoon precipitation. ©2020.

This paper describes a custom built sparse space-time autoregressive (SSTAR) model to infer and forecast contemporaneous and future dengue transmission patterns in Singapore and 16 administrative regions within Malaysia, taking into account connectivity and geographical adjacency between regions as well as climatic factors. A modification to forecast impulse responses is developed for the case of the SSTAR and is used to simulate changes in dengue transmission in neighbouring regions following a disturbance. The results indicate that there are long-term responses of the neighbouring regions to shocks in a region. By computation of variable inclusion probabilities, we found that each region's own past counts were important to describe contemporaneous case counts. In 15 out of 16 regions, other regions case counts were important to describe contemporaneous case counts even after controlling for past local dengue transmissions and exogenous factors. Leave-one-region-out analysis using SSTAR showed that dengue transmission counts could be reconstructed for 13 of 16 regions' counts using external dengue transmissions compared to a climate only approach. Lastly, one to four week ahead forecasts from the SSTAR were more accurate than baseline univariate autoregressions. © 2020 The Authors.","dengue; multivariate time series; penalized estimation; spatio-temporal statistics","Forecasting; Regression analysis; Transmissions; Auto-regressive; Climatic factors; Exogenous factors; Human population; Hyper-endemic; Inclusion probability; Space time; Univariate; Geographical regions; Article; climate; dengue; Dengue virus; forecasting; human; incidence; Malaysia; population; population size; Singapore; virus transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088539971

However, the effects of land use change on the production potential of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in subtropical wetland soils and the underlying controls are still largely unknown. In this study, we examined the soil CH4 and CO2 production potentials under five different land use types (natural mangrove, Gei Wai water channel, Gei Wai forest, reedbed, and freshwater pond) and their relationships with soil physico-chemical properties in a subtropical wetland in Hong Kong using aerobic and anaerobic laboratory incubation experiments. Our results showed an overall decreasing trend of CH4 and CO2 production potentials down the soil profile at all sites, which could be attributed to a reduction in the concentrations of soil organic matter (SOM), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N). Moreover, the soil CH4 and CO2 production potentials varied significantly in the surface soils among land use types, but were more similar across the sites in the deeper soils. The conversion of natural mangrove to other land use types significantly reduced both the aerobic and anaerobic CO2 production potentials in the top 10 cm soils, except for Gei Wai forest, which demonstrated significantly higher CO2 production rates (61.15-97.91 μg g-1 day-1). Meanwhile, the mean CH4 production potential in the surface soils of natural mangrove (0.05 μg g-1 d-1) was significantly lower than that in the Gei Wai forest and Gei Wai channel (0.26-0.27 μg g-1 day-1) but slightly higher than that in the freshwater pond and reedbed (0.00-0.02 μg g-1 day-1). The high soil CH4 and CO2 production potentials observed in the Gei Wai forest could be explained by the high soil concentrations of SOM, TKN and NH4+-N. On the other hand, the lower anaerobic CH4 and aerobic CO2 productions observed in the reedbed could be attributed to the lower concentrations of NH4+-N and available phosphorus. Our findings highlighted the significant impacts of land use types on the CH4 and CO2 production potentials of subtropical wetland soils, which had practical implications for wetland management for climate change mitigation. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide; Gas production potential; Greenhouse gas; Land use; Mangrove; Methane; Soil properties; Wetland","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Land use; Nitrogen; Tropics; Water; Wetlands; Available phosphorus; Climate change mitigation; Different land use types; Environmental characteristic; Greenhouse gas production; Soil organic matters; Soil physico-chemical properties; Total Kjeldahl nitrogens; Soils; ammonium; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); gas production; land use change; mangrove; methane; reedbed; soil organic matter; soil profile; subtropical region; wetland management; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088537478

Absolute cross sections have been estimated for electron emission in the energy range of 1 eV–300 eV, including the KLL-Auger electrons for various angles between 30° and 150°. The double differential cross sections for C60 have been compared with the state-of-the-art CDW-EIS model under CNDO approximation as well as with the data for the Ne target. The C60 spectra at all angles show a broad giant plasmon resonance in the low energy region, which is not present in the atomic target data. The angular distribution reveals the dipolar nature of the plasmon excitation. The C K-LL Auger emission from C60 reveals a large angular anisotropy compared to that for a hydrocarbon, e.g. methane target.

Several studies exist regarding climate change's impacts on European plants, yet none has investigated how climate change will affect the extinction risk of the entire endemic flora of an island biodiversity hotspot, with intense human disturbance. Our aim is to assess climate change's impacts on the biodiversity patterns of the endemic plants of Crete (S Aegean) and provide a case-study upon which a climate-smart conservation planning strategy might be set. We employed a variety of macroecological analyses and estimated the current and future biodiversity, conservation and extinction hotspots in Crete. We evaluated the effectiveness of climatic refugia and the Natura 2000 network of protected areas (PAs) for protecting the most vulnerable species and identified the taxa of conservation priority based on the Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) index. The results revealed that high altitude areas of Cretan mountains constitute biodiversity hotspots and areas of high conservation and evolutionary value. Due to the ""escalator to extinction"" phenomenon, these areas are projected to become diversity ""death-zones"" and should thus be prioritised. Conservation efforts should be targeted at areas with overlaps among PAs and climatic refugia, characterised by high diversity and EDGE scores. This conservation-prioritisation planning will allow the preservation of evolutionary heritage, trait diversity and future ecosystem services for human well-being and acts as a pilot for similar regions worldwide. © 2020 by the authors.","Continental island; Endemics; Environmental management; Extinction risk; Mediterranean flora; Natura 2000; Species distribution modelling","biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem service; endemic species; flora; macroecology; plant; protected area; species conservation; Aegean Islands; Crete [Greece]; Greece; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088528315

Previous work has not systematically investigated the structure, timing, and possible forcings of Holocene Great Basin sub-orbital hydroclimate changes, impeding our ability to understand the potential future controls on Southwestern aridity. The objective of this paper is to constrain the potential forcings on Holocene aridity and temperature, via comparison of new high-resolution speleothem data, an Aridity Index synthesizing hydroclimate records, and linkages of Southwestern paleoclimate to other regions. The high-resolution data from Leviathan Cave provide a paleoclimate record since 13,400 yr ago: A cool Younger Dryas was followed by two pronounced Middle Holocene aridity intervals between 9,850 and 5,310 yr B2k characterized by low growth rates and high δ18O and δ13C values. Subsequently, stalagmite δ18O values show near-modern levels for the last four millennia during which time growth rates were high and δ13C values were low in response to wetter conditions. The regional Aridity Index documents that Middle Holocene drying coincided with a warm Arctic and decreased sea ice extent, a warm western tropical Pacific, and a large sea surface temperature gradient across the tropical Pacific, all of which likely responded to northern hemisphere summer insolation forcing. Our data suggest that extreme Middle Holocene aridity is more severe than the short medieval droughts evident in the tree ring record, and such extreme aridity may represent a worst-case analog for future climate. © 2020.

This sensitivity has allowed us to explore the relationships between surface water and groundwater in the long term as their sediments record all these changes and go beyond the instrumental/observational period. The Lagunas Reales, in central Spain, is a semi-arid inland wetland endangered by both climate and human activity. The reconstruction of the hydroclimate and water levels from sedimentary facies, as well as the changes in the position of the surface water and groundwater via the record of their geochemical fingerprint in the sediments, has allowed us to establish a conceptual model for the response of the hydrological system (surface water and groundwater) to climate. Arid periods are characterized by low levels of the deeper saline groundwater and by a greater influence of the surface freshwater. A positive water balance during wet periods allows the discharge of the deeper saline groundwater into the wetland, causing an increase in salinity. These results contrast with the classical model where salinity increases were related to greater evaporation rates and this opens up a new way of understanding the evolution of the hydrology of wetlands and their resilience to natural and anthropogenic changes. © 2020 by the author.","Climate; Geochemistry; Holocene; Paleo-groundwater; Sedimentary facies; Spain; Wetlands","Climate models; Groundwater; Saline water; Sediments; Surface waters; Water levels; Wetlands; Anthropogenic changes; Ephemeral wetlands; Geochemical fingerprints; Ground water discharge; Holocene sediments; Hydrological system; Saline groundwater; Surface water and groundwaters; Climate change; arid region; climate change; discharge; facies; Holocene; human activity; hydrochemistry; reconstruction; salinity; sediment; semiarid region; sensitivity analysis; water budget; wetland; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088511610

The primary objective of this research was to carry out a comparative analysis of exhaust PM emitted by gasohol (gasoline blended with 10% ethanol, v/v)-fulled spark ignition (SI) engine with that of baseline gasoline-fuelled SI engine. To assess the PM toxicity, physical, chemical and biological characterizations of PM were carried out using the state-of-the-art instruments and techniques. Measurements of regulated and unregulated gaseous species were also carried out at part/full loads. The results showed that the gasohol-fuelled engine emitted relatively lower concentrations of unregulated gaseous species such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), isocyanic acid (HNCO), etc. Physical characterization of exhaust particles revealed that the gasohol-fuelled engine emitted a significantly lower number of particles compared to the gasoline-fuelled engine. The presence of harmful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and higher trace metal concentrations in PM emitted from the gasoline-fuelled engine was another important finding of this study. Biological characterizations showed that PM emitted from the gasohol-fuelled engine were less cytotoxic and had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation potential. Mutagenicity of PM emitted from the gasohol-fuelled engine was also lower compared to that from the gasoline-fuelled engine. Overall, this study demonstrated that utilization of gasohol in SI engines led to the reduction in emissions, and lowering of PM toxicity, in addition to partial replacement of fossil fuels with renewable fuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Blending; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Fuel additives; Gasohol; Internal combustion engines; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Sulfur dioxide; Toxicity; Trace analysis; Trace elements; Biological characterization; Chemical and biologicals; Ethanol-blended gasoline; Exhaust particulates; Instruments and techniques; Physical characterization; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Trace metal concentration; Gasoline; alcohol; fossil fuel; gasoline; isocyanate; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; reactive oxygen metabolite; renewable fuel; sulfur dioxide; trace metal; alcohol; Article; combustion; controlled study; cytotoxicity; diesel engine; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; mass spectrometry; morphological trait; mutagenicity; particulate matter; priority journal; surface area; air pollutant; exhaust gas; gas; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Ethanol; Gases; Gasoline; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088489261

Bioenergy crops provide one means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy production and two novel crops that could be used for this purpose are Sida hermaphrodita (L.) Rusby and Silphium perfoliatum L. This research examined the existing scientific literature available on both crops through a systematic review. The data were collated according to the agronomy, uses, and environmental benefits of each crop. Possible challenges were associated with high initial planting costs, low yields in low rainfall areas, and for Sida hermaphrodita, vulnerability to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. However, under appropriate environmental conditions, both crops were found to provide large yields over sustained periods of time with relatively low levels of management and could be used to produce large energy surpluses, either through direct combustion or biogas production. Other potential uses included fodder, fibre, and pharmaceutical uses. Environmental benefits included the potential for phytoremediation, and improvements to soil health, biodiversity, and pollination. The review also demonstrated that environmental benefits, such as pollination, soil health, and water quality benefits could be obtained from the use of Sida hermaphrodita and Silphium perfoliatum relative to existing bioenergy crops such as maize, whilst at the same time reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy production. Future research should examine the long-term implications of using Sida hermaphrodita and Silphium perfoliatum as well as improve knowledge on how to integrate them successfully within existing farming systems and supply chains. © 2020 by the authors.","Bioenergy crops; Cup plant; Virginia fanpetals; Virginia mallow",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088422633

In response, many temperate insects enter diapause, an alternative developmental program, including developmental arrest, that allows organisms to synchronize their life cycle with seasonal environmental variation. Geographic variation in diapause phenology contributing to local climatic adaptation is well documented. However, few studies have examined how the rapid evolution of a suite of traits expressed across the diapause program may contribute to climatic adaptation on a contemporary timescale. Here, we investigate the evolution of the diapause program over the past 35 years by leveraging a “natural experiment” presented by the recent invasion of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, across the eastern United States. We sampled populations from two distinct climatic regions separated by 6° of latitude (∼700 km). Using common-garden experiments, we identified regional genetic divergence in diapause-associated cold tolerance, diapause duration, and postdiapause starvation tolerance. We also found regional divergence in nondiapause thermal performance. In contrast, we observed minimal regional divergence in nondiapause larval growth traits and at neutral molecular marker loci. Our results demonstrate rapid evolution of the diapause program and imply strong selection caused by differences in winter conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

In order to achieve energy resilience in the urban environment, urban-scale energy models play a key role in supporting the promotion and identification of effective energy-efficient and low-carbon policies pertaining to buildings. In this work, a dynamic urban-scale energy model, based on an energy balance, has been designed to take into account the local climate conditions and morphological urban-scale parameters. The aim is to present an engineering methodology, applied to clusters of buildings, using the available urban databases. This methodology has been calibrated and optimized through an iterative procedure on 102 residential buildings in a district of the city of Turin (Italy). The results of this work show how a place-based dynamic energy balance methodology can also be sufficiently accurate at an urban scale with an average seasonal relative error of 14%. In particular, to achieve this accuracy, the model has been optimized by correcting the typological and geometrical characteristics of the buildings and the typologies of ventilation and heating system; in addition, the indoor temperatures of the buildings-that were initially estimated as constant-have been correlated to the climatic variables. The proposed model can be applied to other cities utilizing the existing databases or, being an engineering model, can be used to assess the impact of climate change or other scenarios. © 2020 by the authors.","Buildings energy balance; Place-based analysis; Residential buildings; Urban energy resilience; Urban hourly model; Urban variables","architectural design; climate conditions; emission control; energy balance; energy efficiency; optimization; typology; urban area; ventilation; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088377085

However, efforts to support farmer adaptation are hampered by the lack of scientific and context based evidences. Hence, this paper identified the major adaptation strategies to climate change (CC) and analysed the determinants of adoption of adaptation strategies to climate change in Eastern Tigray Region of Ethiopia. Three-stage sampling technique was used to select the study sites and sample households. Copies of 485 questionnaires were administered and complemented with data from focus group discussion and key informant interviews. Results of the descriptive analysis identified that use of soil and water conservation practices, planting trees, improved crop seeds, irrigation and use of non-farm income generating activities are the most utilized adaptation strategies to climate change. Results of the multinomial logistic regression (MNL) revealed that households' adaptation to climate change was found positively and significantly affected by education, livestock holding, cooperatives membership, extension services, farmers income and households perception to climate change. On the contrary, age of the household head, distance to market and agro-ecology were found negatively and statistically affecting smallholder farmers adoption of adaptation strategies to climate change. Thus, public policy on climate change adaptation need to take into account local people's resource base and their lifelong outlooks so as to reduce the potential drawbacks of climate change on farmers' livelihood. © 2020Climate change, Adaptation strategies, Determinants, Agriculture, Smallholder farmers, Ethiopia, Agricultural science; Environmental science; Social sciences. © 2020","Adaptation strategies; Agricultural science; Agriculture; Climate change; Determinants; Environmental science; Ethiopia; Smallholder farmers; Social sciences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088374368

However, it is well documented that increasing NG injection rates results in declining raceway flame temperatures (a quenching effect on the furnace, so to speak), with the end result of a functional limit on the maximum injection rate that can be used while maintaining stable operation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the BF raceway and shaft regions developed by Purdue University Northwest's (PNW) Center for Innovation through Visualization and Simulation (CIVS) have been applied to simulate multi-phase reacting flow in industry blast furnaces with the aim of exploring the use of pre-heated NG as a method of widening the BF operating window. Simulations predicted that pre-heated NG injection could increase the flow of sensible heat into the BF and promote complete gas combustion through increased injection velocity and improved turbulent mixing. Modeling also indicated that the quenching effects of a 15% increase in NG injection rate could be countered by a 300K NG pre-heat. This scenario maintained furnace raceway flame temperatures and top gas temperatures at levels similar to those observed in baseline (stable) operation, while reducing coke rate by 6.3%. © 2020 by the authors.","Blast furnace; Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Fuel injection; Natural gas; Numerical simulation; RAFT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088292512

Pleural drainage tubes attached to an underwater seal drain allow expulsion of aerosol and larger droplets via the vent from the bottle into the surrounding environment, potentially leading to infection of other patients and staff. Consequently, we chose to attach an antiviral filter to the venting port of an underwater seal drain bottle to mitigate this risk.

The present study focuses on the apple orchards of Himachal Pradesh, a state within the Himalayan Mountains, a major apple producers of India. In the study, it is found that the optimum apple growing conditions in the region have been consistently shifting and farmers are shifting their orchards to the higher altitudes. For example, orchards have shifted to 1500-2500 meters in the 2000s compared to the cultivated elevation of 1200-1500 meters during 1980s. As of 2014, apples are being cultivated at an elevation of more than 3500 meters, for example, the newly developed orchards of Leo village in upper Kinnaur and Keylong area of Lahul and Spiti districts. Chilling hours for different districts are calculated. The trend of temperature during the growth period, winter session and annual rainfall have been analysed using Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope test. Data catalogued from different time periods indicates that the northward shift (towards higher altitude) is due to changes in chilling hours, total annual rainfall and mean surface temperature during the apple growing season. The mean surface temperature in all the districts has increased by almost 0.5°C during last 2000-2014. These changes are directly related to global warming. While the changing climate is reducing the apple production in low altitudinal regions of the state, it is creating new opportunities for apple cultivation in higher altitudes as conditions are getting more favourable for apple growth in those higher regions. The associated socioeconomic changes are posing new societal issues for the local farmers. © 2020 Sahu et al.",,"agricultural worker; altitude; apple; Article; climate change; comparative study; cultivated species; environmental temperature; fruit growing; greenhouse effect; growing season; growth period; Himachal Pradesh; nonhuman; orchard; rainy season; social status; winter; climate change; growth, development and aging; human; India; Malus; temperature; Altitude; Climate Change; Farmers; Humans; India; Malus; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088206029

SUMMARY ANSWER: The key findings of our study demonstrate telehealth in rural Utah improved access of cancer care to patients, who benefited from substantial time and monetary savings along with substantial revenue retained by the health system. WHAT WE DID: The data on financial savings, travel hours, mileage avoided, carbon emissions reduced, and revenue retained by the patients with cancer treated with a real-time video-based telehealth program under the care of an oncologist at a tertiary medical center were collected from 2015 to 2018. WHAT WE FOUND: In our study, on average, patients saved 4 hours and 40 minutes and 332 miles roundtrip per encounter. In total, patients' savings were estimated to be $333,074, and the local hospital retained $3,605,500 in revenue over the 4-year study period. BIAS, CONFOUNDING FACTORS: The biases of the study include the single-institution experience. Intermountain Healthcare is a unique health care system with numerous urban and rural locations. Therefore, this study may not be applicable to a smaller or geographically less diverse health care system REAL-LIFE IMPLICATIONS: Telehealth improves access to care for patients in rural communities while concomitantly leading to monetary and time savings. The rural health care sites offering these services can have a significant return on investment with relatively low overhead. New Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regulatory changes for the COVID-19 pandemic greatly expand telehealth eligibility for patients with cancer. © 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

We implemented a full factorial mesocosm (378.5 L tanks) experiment investigating Crelated responses to three common wetland plants of eastern North America (Phragmites australis, Spartina pectinata, Typha latifolia), and four water quality treatments (fresh water control, N, road salt, sea salt). During the 2017 growing season, we quantified carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, above- and below-ground biomass, root porosity, light penetration, pore water chemistry (NH4+, NO3-, SO4-2, Cl-, DOC), soil C mineralization, as well as sediment microbial communities via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Relative to freshwater controls, N enrichment stimulated plant biomass, which in turn increased CO2uptake and reduced light penetration, especially in Spartina stands. Root porosity was not affected by water quality, but was positively correlated with CH4emissions, suggesting that plants can be important conduits for CH4from anoxic sediment to the atmosphere. Sediment microbial composition was largely unaffected by N addition, whereas salt amendments induced structural shifts, reduced sediment community diversity, and reduced C mineralization rates, presumably due to osmotic stress. Methane emissions were suppressed by sea salt, but not road salt, providing evidence for the additional chemical control (SO4-2availability) on this microbial-mediated process. Thus, N may have stimulated plant activity while salting treatments preferentially enriched specific microbial populations.

Photosynthesis shows diel changes, which have been largely attributed to external light/dark conditions, as well as internal gene expression and the post-translational modification of critical enzymes. Here we report diel fluctuations of magnesium (Mg) in rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplasts, which may function as a rhythm regulator contributing to the post-translational regulation of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in rice. We found that a chloroplast-localized Mg2+ transporter gene, OsMGT3, which is rhythmically expressed in leaf mesophyll cells, partly modulates Mg fluctuations in rice chloroplasts. Knockout of OsMGT3 substantially reduced Mg2+ uptake, as well as the amplitude of free Mg2+ fluctuations in chloroplasts, which was closely associated with a decrease in ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase activity in vivo and a consequent decline in the photosynthetic rate. In addition, the mesophyll-specific overexpression of OsMGT3 remarkably improved photosynthetic efficiency and growth performance in rice. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that OsMGT3-dependent diel Mg fluctuations in chloroplasts may contribute to Mg-dependent enzyme activities for photosynthesis over the daily cycle. Enhancing Mg2+ input to chloroplasts could be a potential approach to improving photosynthetic efficiency in plants. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"cation transport protein; magnesium; plant protein; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; chloroplast; circadian rhythm; metabolism; Oryza; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; Cation Transport Proteins; Chloroplasts; Circadian Rhythm; Magnesium; Oryza; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088178140

Due to its chemical composition, freshly poured concrete changes the pH of water coming in contact with the surface to very alkaline values, requiring neutralization treatment before disposal. Conventional methods include the use of mineral acid or CO2 pumps, causing high costs to building companies. In this paper, we present a micromotor based remediation strategy, which consists of carbonate particles half-coated with citric acid. To achieve this half coverage spray coating is used for the first time to design Janus structures. The motors propel diffusiophoretically due to a self-generated gradient formed as the acid coverage dissolves. The locally lower pH contributes to the dissolution of the carbonate body. These motors have been employed to study neutralization of diluted concrete wash water (CWW) at microscopic scale and we achieve visualization of the pH changes occurring in the vicinity of motors using anthocyanine as pH indicator dye. The effect of citric acid-carbonates hybrid on neutralization of real CWW on macroscopic scale has also been studied. In addition, all employed chemicals are cheap, non-toxic and do not leave any solid residues behind. © 2020 by the authors.

Here, we aimed to test the role of ‘climatic stability’ in determining latitudinal trends in range size and as a consequence on species richness of tropical woody plants. Using primary data from 156 (0.06 ha) plots comprising 20,400 occurrences of more than 400 species of tropical woody plants, we built a biome-wide species database that covers the entire latitudinal extent of the wet-evergreen forests of the Western Ghats (8o to 20o N), India. We consolidated this database using secondary data from other published species inventories. We then calculated the range sizes and climatic niche width of woody plants to test the predictions of the climatic stability hypothesis and examined the relationship between range position and climatic tolerance of species. Our results show a significant latitudinal gradient in species richness and turnover where local and regional species richness increase monotonically from higher latitudes to lower latitudes of the Western Ghats. We found strong support for Rapoport’s Rule with an increase in range size from lower to higher latitudes; our results are consistent with the predictions of the climatic stability hypothesis, where species at higher latitudes exhibited greater tolerance to temperature and rainfall seasonality. Contrary to earlier work, our findings suggest that Rapoport’s Rule and the climatic stability hypothesis can operate over regional scales, and even at lower latitudes. We suggest that latitude associated climatic seasonality through its influence on species ranges, can influence latitudinal patterns in species turnover as well as species richness.

Degradation of natural forests leads to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, impacting the livelihoods of surrounding communities. Efforts to address ongoing loss of natural forests, through mechanisms such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), require an understanding of the links between forest degradation and the livelihoods of local communities, which have rarely been studied in Vietnam. We combined information from livelihood surveys, remote sensing and forest inventories around a protected natural forest area in North Central Vietnam. For forest-adjacent communities, we found natural forests contributed an average of 28% of total household income with plantation forests contributing an additional 15%. Although officially prohibited, logging contributed more than half of the total income derived from natural forests. Analysis of Landsat images over the period 1990 to 2014 combined with forest inventory data, demonstrates selective logging was leading to ongoing degradation of natural forests resulting in loss of 3.3 ± 0.8 Mg biomass ha-1 yr-1 across the protected area. This is equivalent to 1.5% yr-1 of total forest biomass, with rates as high as 3% yr-1 in degraded and easily accessible parts of the protected area. We estimate that preventing illegal logging would incur local opportunity costs of USD $4.10 ± 0.90 per Mg CO2, similar to previous estimates for tropical forest protected areas and substantially less than the opportunity costs in timber or agricultural concessions. Our analysis suggests activities to reduce forest degradation in protected areas are likely to be financially viable through Vietnam's REDD+ program. © 2020 The Author(s).

Here, we show that heavy snow is also associated with below-normal East Sea SSTs, and we investigate the dynamical response of the atmosphere to this surface condition using observations and numerical modeling. The results indicate that anomalous southeasterly/easterly winds are induced by heavy snowfall-related cold SST anomalies, and consequently, the moisture flux is converged. The existence of the southeasterly winds and the accompanied moisture flux convergence appear to be instrumental in producing the heavy snowfall events. The anomalous southeasterly/easterly winds associated with heavy snowfall-related cold SST anomalies reduce the climatological northwesterly/westerly winds, leading to relatively warm and wet conditions over the east coast of Korea that are favorable for forming and intensifying snowfall events in the region. © 2020 The Author(s).

The United Nations have explicitly included the provision of transport infrastructure access, e.g. through all-season road access, in their Sustainable Development Goal agenda (SDGs, target 9.1). Yet, little is known about the number of people lacking access to roads worldwide, the costs of closing existing access gaps and the implications of additional roads for other sustainability concerns such as climate change mitigation (SDG-13). Here we quantify, for 250 countries and territories, the percentage of population without road access in 2 km. We find that infrastructure investments required to provide quasi-universal road access are about USD 3 trillion.

To reduce the uncertainty of estimation, three sensitivity experiments were designed and conducted for different emission scenarios. The first experiment uses the standard black carbon emissions of diesel vehicles without engaging in any emission control actions (referred to as CTRL), and the other two experiments were conducted using different DPF devices to reduce BC emissions by 65% (CASE1) and 39% (CASE2), respectively. The results show that the model simulation reasonably represents the measured BC concentrations. The highest BC concentrations occurred in large cities of the North China Plain (NCP) and present important seasonal variations. The results suggest that the reduction in diesel vehicle emissions has great benefits for reducing BC pollution not only in winter but also in other seasons. Sensitivity studies show that in CASE1, the average BC concentrations decreased about ~6% in January and by more than 10% in the other seasons. The greatest reduction exceeded 50%. In CASE2, the average BC concentrations decreased by about ~3.5% in January and by more than 7% in the other seasons. This study suggests that adding DPF to a diesel vehicle can have a significant influence on reducing BC concentrations in China. Thus, this study provides a practical basis by which diesel vehicle emissions can be reduced. © 2020 by the authors.","Black carbon reduction; Diesel vehicles; WRF-Chem model","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon; Diesel locomotives; Emission control; Particulate emissions; Vehicles; Black carbon emission; Diesel particulate filters; Emission scenario; High efficiency devices; North China Plain; Regional atmospheric chemistry modeling; Seasonal variation; Sensitivity studies; Diesel engines; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); diesel engine; emission control; seasonal variation; weather forecasting; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088130013

Linfen is a basin between mountains on the east and west, and there are many coking plants on the north and south sides of its urban area. The special topography and unfortunate industrial layout have frequently contributed to serious air pollution in Linfen. In order to investigate the pollution characteristics of atmospheric carbonyls in winter in urban Linfen, the carbonyl compounds were collected from the Municipal Committee site (MC) and the Yaowangtai site (YWT) from 16 to 25 January 2019, and their concentrations were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector (HPLC-UV). The results show that formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone were the most abundant compounds, accounting for more than 70% of the total mass concentration of carbonyls in urban Linfen. Levels of these three carbonyls increased during the morning and evening traffic rush hours. The mass concentration of formaldehyde at both sites reached peak values at around noon (10:00-14:00). In addition, the mass concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone were positively correlated with CO mass concentrations, whereas only formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were positively correlated with temperature. Therefore, atmospheric formaldehyde in urban Linfen's winter mainly came fromvehicle exhaust emissions and the secondary generation of photochemical reactions. Most of the acetaldehyde came from vehicle exhaust emissions, and photochemical reactions also partially contributed to it. For acetone, vehicle exhaust emissions were the main source.

The Effort Sharing Regulation illustrates the large extent to which the European Union (EU) relies on the use of hard law for addressing climate change, including binding enforcement provisions. The approach of the Effort Sharing Regulation is, in essence, simple: it consists of individual binding emission reduction targets for Member States, which are given various options to achieve compliance in a supposedly flexible, cost-effective way. In this sense, the effort sharing approach is a continuation of the regulatory approach put forward by the Kyoto Protocol. The Effort Sharing Regulation can also serve as an example for third countries to adopt binding emission reduction targets, and it can be considered whether it would be beneficial to link such binding targets of third countries with this EU mechanism. However, a closer look at the Regulation highlights the challenges for its implementation, and the correct use of flexibilities, together with the proper application of the monitoring and enforcement provisions will be key for a successful outcome. The reputation of the EU taking leadership for combating climate change hinges on demonstrating compliance and on taking effective enforcement action where needed. © 2020 The Authors.

While renewable energy reduces carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, many studies have emerged on the associated ecological and social impacts of this technology. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the nexus between wildlife conservation and energy development in the western US since 2010. We revisit pertinent ecological concepts presented in earlier reviews to assess how far the field has progressed in mitigating negative effects. Specifically, we examine: (i) recent trends in the literature on how wind and solar energy development impact wildlife in the US, (ii) how siting and design of development may maximize energy benefits while minimizing negative effects on wildlife, (iii) the availability and benefits of before-after control-impact studies, and ultimately (iv) how impacts of renewable energy development on wildlife may be mitigated. We also provide case studies on the desert tortoise and greater sage-grouse, two conservation-reliant umbrella species in the western US, to highlight efforts to mitigate the effects of solar and wind energy development, respectively. We recognize that many other species are affected by renewable energy development, but desert tortoises and sage-grouse are representative of the conflicts that need to be addressed. Our review concludes that mitigation can be improved via use of spatial decision support tools, applying novel wildlife deterrence and detection systems developed for existing installed facilities, and incorporating impact studies that provide managers with conservation metrics for evaluating different future development land-use scenarios. © 2020 The Author(s).

Proven farm-scale mitigation technologies are needed to lower these emissions and to provide management practices that are feasible and sustainable. In this research, we evaluate the performance of a unique approach that simultaneously mitigates emissions and improves air quality inside a barn equipped with a manure pit recharge system. Specifically, we tested the effects of summertime feeding rations (used by farmers to cope with animal heat stress) and manure management. To date, the pit recharge system has been proven to be effective in mitigating both ammonia (NH3; approximately 53%) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S; approximately 84%) emissions during mild climate conditions. However, its performance during the hot season with a high crude protein diet and high nitrogen loading into the pit manure recharge system is unknown. Therefore, we compared the emissions and indoor air quality of the rooms (240 pigs, ~80 kg each) equipped with a conventional slurry and pit recharge system. The main findings highlight the importance and impact of seasonal variation and diet and manure management practices. We observed 31% greater NH3 emissions from the pit recharge system (33.7 1.4 g head-1 day-1) compared with a conventional slurry system (25.9 2.4 g head-1 day-1). Additionally, the NH3 concentration inside the barn was higher (by 24%) in the pit recharge system compared with the control. On the other hand, H2S emissions were 55% lower in the pit recharge system (628 47 mg head-1 day-1) compared with a conventional slurry pit (1400 132 mg head-1 day-1). Additionally, the H2S concentration inside the barn was lower (by 54%) in the pit recharge system compared with the control. The characteristics of the pit recharge liquid (i.e., aerobically treated manure), such as the total nitrogen (TN) and ammonium N (NH4-N) contents, contributed to the higher NH3 emissions from the pit recharge system in summer. However, their influence on H2S emissions had a relatively low impact, i.e., emissions were still reduced, similarly as they were in mild climate conditions. Overall, it is necessary to consider a seasonal diet and manure management practices when evaluating emissions and indoor air quality. Further research on minimizing the seasonal nitrogen loading and optimizing pit recharge manure characteristics is warranted. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; Ammonia; Animal production systems; Emissions; High-crude protein diet; Hydrogen sulfide; Pit recharge system; Sustainability; Swine production; Waste management","Air quality; Ammonia; Farm buildings; Fertilizers; Hydrogen sulfide; Indoor air pollution; Mammals; Manures; Nitrogen; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Animal production systems; Conventional slurries; Hydrogen sulfide emission; Indoor air quality; Management practices; Manure management; Regional air quality; Seasonal variation; Quality control; agricultural emission; air quality; ammonia; hydrogen sulfide; manure; seasonal variation; waste treatment; Animalia; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088097220

Therefore, such an event could happen presently. Here, we simulate the climatic anomalies it may cause with respect to the current conditions, assuming the same target geology of carbonates and evaporates and a 1 Gt release of sulphate gases. We used a thermodynamic model, including water vapor, cloudiness (by greenhouse and albedo effects), and cryosphere feedback to calculate aerosol cooling. We found that it took nearly 4.5 years for solar radiation to recover its preimpact value-during the first year practically no solar radiation reached the surface. Recovery of the temperature took more than 45 years. The lowest temperatures occurred between 1.5 and 5 years after the impact, being the coldest at-14 °C below the preimpact temperature. July surface temperature anomalies occurred 1.5 years after the impact, becoming one of the largest, compared to preimpact temperatures. Most continents showed temperature anomalies of-45 °C. The least cold places were the polar regions with temperature anomalies between approximately-5 and 0 °C. As for the most remarkable climatic effect, we found that, for ~6 years, the ice extended over almost all the ocean surface and, after ~25 years, it covered nearly half of the surface, remaining so for beyond 45 years. The continental ice remained without reduction beyond 45 years. Sixty years after the impact, the surface oceanic and continental fractions covered by ice were 0.52 and 0.98, respectively. We also modeled the effect of smaller quantities of sulfur released after asteroid impacts, concluding that an instantaneous, large climatic perturbation attributed to a loading range may lead to a semi-permanent shift in the climate system. © 2020 by the authors.","Albedo-ice feedback; Asteroid impact; Chicxulub; Cloud feedback; Global climate models; Sudden climate change; Water vapor feedback","Asteroids; Ice; Solar radiation; Sulfur compounds; Aerosol cooling; Climatic anomalies; Climatic effects; Climatic response; Semi permanents; Surface temperature anomalies; Temperature anomaly; Thermodynamic model; Temperature; asteroid; climate effect; ice cover; low temperature; Mesozoic; paleoclimate; solar radiation; terrestrial environment; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088088769

Such counterarguments are less visible in the news media of most European countries. Why do many of these countries nevertheless fail to enact ambitious climate change policies? This paper suggests that influential organizations may block ambitious climate change policies in corporatist countries without an extensive media strategy or a strong denialist message. We draw from theories on the policy process, policy networks, influence strategies, and comparative politics to formulate hypotheses about the existence, influence, and strategies of organizations that oppose ambitious climate policy. We test these hypotheses using an original combination of media data and survey data on the national climate policy network in Finland, a corporatist European country that has long lacked ambitious climate policies. The findings show that a coalition that prioritizes economic competitiveness over climate change mitigation is influential and occupies a central position in the policy network. This pro-economy lobby does not question the validity of climate science or actively seek media visibility. Rather, it influences the policy process using other strategies, such as inside lobbying, and appears in the news media less often than other climate policy organizations. Our results suggest that opponents of climate change mitigation can be powerful despite a weak media presence. This implies that studies on climate politics should pay more attention to strategies of influencing beyond the media spotlight. © 2020 The Author(s)","Advocacy strategies; Climate change; Denialism; Interest groups; Media; Policy networks","climate change; competitiveness; economic conditions; environmental policy; strategic approach; Finland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088045564

Focusing on the industrial subsectors, this paper comprehensively analyzes the environmental and economic effects of the pilot ETS in China from the perspectives of economic development, technological optimization, and innovation-driven development by using the propensity score matching-difference in differences (PSM-DID) model based on 2005-2017 provincial panel data. This paper compensates for the limitations of existing studies on the effects of ETS on different subsectors; furthermore, the triple difference model (DDD) model is used to discuss the impacts of differences in environmental responsibility and economic potential among subsectors on policy effects. The empirical results show that: (1) The pilot ETS produces a 14.5% carbon reduction effect on the covered subsectors while reducing GDP by 4.8% without achieving a low-carbon economy. Thus, production decline is the main reason for carbon emission reductions. (2) Economic development factors have significant positive impacts on carbon emissions, while technological optimization and innovation-driven development are key factors for achieving reductions in carbon emissions. (3) The pilot ETS produces a 60.1% carbon emission inhibition effect and 23.2% GDP inhibition effect on the subsectors with greater environmental responsibility. Therefore, the Chinese government should fully simulate the impact of technological innovation and utilize resource endowment differences in the environmental and economic aspects of different sectors to achieve low-carbon economic development. © 2020 by the authors.","China; DDD; Emissions trading systems (ETS); Low-carbon economy; PSM-DID","carbon emission; corporate social responsibility; economic development; emission control; emissions trading; innovation; optimization; panel data; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088043379

Is it possible to catch these two rabbits under heterogenetic conditions of urbanization? To answer this, this study examines atmospheric environmental performance (SO2, NOx, and PMs) of 30 major cities in China using streaming data from 2011 to 2017. A non-radial SBM-DEA approach is adopted with a meta-frontier model to evaluate regional heterogeneity in atmospheric environmental management. Our results suggest that pollution prevention and regulation policies encouraged synergic development of most cities in the economy and atmospheric environment. On average, atmospheric environmental efficiency of the cities improved from 0.556 to 0.691. However, significantly unbalanced development exists in the regions, requiring customized policies. Eastern cities achieved continuing improvement owing to stringent air pollutant emission policies. Central cities showed a strong improvement but lacked momentum after they achieved certain targets. Western cities lagged behind in the studying period due to both technology gap as well as weak regulation. Furthermore, we identify heterogeneous paths for inefficient cities to enhance their performance using benchmark information. Economically developed eastern cities, such as Beijing, Fuzhou, are facing an over-supply issue. Reshaping their economic structure may be necessary to attain better environmental performance. Central cities face diversified issues.

The effect of ramping on the controlling switching waveform, due to slew in the RF switches, is analyzed first. This is followed by a novel technique for controlling and reducing the fundamental carrier component (due to the Fourier series 0 Hz term) that is always produced by TMAs. A new bespoke, steerable, TMA RF hardware test platform is presented, using three gain states to pragmatically implement the proposed carrier reduction technique. The platform implementation utilizes binary logic control interfaces to the TMA, rather than analog control interfaces. Laboratory measurements using the test platform demonstrate a 16.5 dB reduction (limited by PCB emissions) in the level of the fundamental carrier component relative to the steered first harmonic, from a possible reduction of 21.3 dB. The array gain for the first harmonic beam is 2 dBi. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Fourier series; microwave circuits; RF hardware platform; time-modulated antenna arrays (TMAs)","Fourier series; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Steerable antennas; Hardware verification; Harmonic levels; Laboratory measurements; Novel techniques; Platform implementations; Prediction and control; Reduction techniques; Switching waveforms; Harmonic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088028818

However, the emphasis on cities to help shift the global economy to LED has been on a single individual sector approach operating in silos rather than the inter and intra-specific outcomes of multiple sectors. Thus, there are uncertainties of adopting suitable pathways for cities' transition to LED, due largely to data paucity and policy incoherence, constrained further by barriers to integrating science, policy, and practice. Hence, the need for cities to take advantage of the benefits of multi-directional perspectives of multiple sectors acting together-the ""multi-vector"" approach, to confront key questions of climate compatible development (CCD) that support LED. Therefore, the paper extends the development narratives of the CCD approach to an ""enhanced"" climate compatible development (EnCCD) pathway with in-built questions and determinants to scope cities' transition to LED. The EnCCD suggests that the standalone intersection between mitigation and development to deliver LED will not result in cities' resilience unless (i) co-benefits, which are outcomes of mitigation and adaptation, and (ii) climate-resilient development, the product of adaptation and development, coevolved. Therefore, the EnCCD transforms the development policy focus of cities on separate, single-purpose sectors, such as energy or transport, into multi-sector portfolios having synergistic benefits of mitigation, adaptation, and development strategies. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate resilience; Co-benefits; Enhanced climate compatible development (EnCCD); Greenhouse gas emissions; Mitigation; Policy mainstreaming","adaptive management; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; emission control; global economy; greenhouse gas; high temperature; mitigation; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088022318

Within the framework of the European project RESCCUE (RESilience to cope with Climate Change in Urban arEas-a multi-sectorial approach focusing on water), climate projections for the city of Barcelona manifest meaningful increases in maximum rainfall intensities for the 2100 horizon. A better comprehension of these impacts and their conditions is consequently needed. A hydrodynamic modelling process was carried out on Barcelona Metro Line 3, as it was identified as vulnerable to pluvial flooding events. The Metro line and all its components are simulated in the urban drainage models as a system of computational link and nodes reproducing the main physical characteristics like slopes and cross-sections when embedded in the current 1D/2D hydrodynamic model of Barcelona used in the project RESCCUE. This study presents a risk analysis focused on ensuring transport service continuity in flood events. The results reveal that two of the 26 stations on Metro Line 3 are exposed to a high risk of flooding in current rainfall conditions, and 11 of the 26 stations on Metro Line 3 are exposed to a high risk of flooding in future rainfall conditions for a 20-year return period event, which affects Metro service in terms of increased risk. This research gives insights for stakeholders and policymakers to enhance urban flood risk management, as a reasonable approach to tackle this issue for Metro systems worldwide. This study provides a baseline for assessing potential flood outcomes in Metro systems and can be used to evaluate adaptation measures' effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.","1D/2D hydrodynamic model; Climate change; Flood risk assessment; Metro system; Subway; Urban mobility","climate change; climate effect; cross section; drainage; extreme event; flood control; flooding; metro system; railway; rainfall; thermodynamics; transportation system; underground construction; urban area; vulnerability; Barcelona",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088019189

This system consists of artificial soil based-vegetation and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) filters. Unlike the so-called passive removal method, which adsorbs fine PM only by the leaves of plants, the vegetation soil filter based on multi-layered different artificial soils adopts an active removal method in which air purification is performed in the soil itself, bypassing external air by using the air circulation fan in the soil. The ESP filter is designed and evaluated to have a high fine PM removal efficiency, even at high suction velocity, to remove large amounts of outdoor fine PM. Throughout the experimental measurements on the hybrid air purification system with vegetation soil and ESP filters, it is observed that the vegetation soil filter has a 78.5% reduction efficiency for PM2.5 and a 47% for PM10 at the inlet air velocity of 0.15 m/s. The ESP filter also has a 73.1% reduction efficiency for PM2.5 and 87.3% for PM10 at an inlet air velocity of 3 m/s. Based on the performance evaluations of the vegetation soil filter and the ESP filter, it is noted that each individual module will be applied to an air purification tower with vertical expansion and installed in a high concentration area of fine PM in a downtown area to contribute to the fine PM reduction in the community. © 2020 by the authors.","Air purification tower; Electrostatic precipitator (ESP) filter; Fine particulate matter (PM); Fine PM reduction rate; Vegetation soil filter","filter; installation; manufacturing; particulate matter; performance assessment; pollutant removal; purification; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088006923

Compared to baseline conditions, future climate conditions would shift substantially, and daily Ksoil-air values of HCH, DDE, DDD, and DDT under future climate scenarios would decline by approximately 23–91 (× 105), 5,542–21,703 (× 105), 78–309 (× 105), and 18,986–74,133 (× 105), respectively, under future climate scenarios than under baseline conditions when the SOM content was 0.5% or by approximately 9,167–360,45 (× 105), 128,533–508,592 (× 105), 31,513–123,038 (× 105), and 444,513–1738,367 (× 105), respectively, when the SOM level was 1.7%, or by approximately 2–13% under two levels of SOM.

Moreover, Ksoil-air showed daily, monthly, and seasonal temporal changes within whole years and high temporal yearly fluctuation. Daily and annual Ksoil-air values were lower under 0.5% SOM content than under 1.7% SOM content.

The local planning level (village or neighbourhood) ""pocket plan"" is a development challenge for spatial planners. The small coastal village Tuja in Latvia was taken as a pilot territory for ""pocket planning"" due to the unique location; biodiversity and ecosystems; significant natural, cultural, economic and social values; specific interests; and the needs of the involved local society. All these factors create a dynamic flow of data and information. Geographic information systems (GIS) are widely used as planning support systems. GISs for pocket plans must accommodate the special needs of communities in villages and neighbourhoods. Ensuring the availability of information in dynamic real time is an opportunity to build both community integration in specific environments and to understand the future plans of the territory. Access to a WEB-GIS (internet GIS) provides possibilities for every person with a mobile phone to use and update information. Static and statistical information is generally used for spatial planning. For pocket plans, the data and information flow has to be dynamic and has to interact with non-professional users. The special wishes and needs of every member of a community must be accommodated by a pocket plan for the well-being of the people and the sustainability of the surrounding territory. Small territory planning involves a very narrow circle of individuals or communities that identify spatial development needs for the future, which includes the socio-economic, cultural, historical, environmental and climate change scenarios. In order to assess the development opportunities and needs of such areas, the detection, accumulation and monitoring of reliable data is necessary. Methodically derived data (facts) provide objectivity and transparency. Currently, as information between the present and the past is able to circulate very fast, analysis of the current situation to forecast the future and show different constructed realities (scenarios) using a GIS is necessary. Therefore, to explore and determine a local needs-based and smart spatial planning approach, we must identify indicators that can be used for the short-term and long-term analysis of specific territories in coastal areas. © 2020 by the authors.","Coastal areas; Community development; GIS layers; Indicators of village/neighbourhood planning; Territory planning; Using GIS; Village development","biodiversity; climate change; coastal zone; GIS; integrated approach; local planning; neighborhood; planning process; rural development; spatial planning; sustainability; territorial planning; village; Latvia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087914118

Earth system models provide a means to quantify the link from emissions to global climate change. Using the concept of TCRE - the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions - we can estimate the remaining carbon budget to achieve 1.5 or 2 °C. But the uncertainty is large, and this hinders the usefulness of the concept. Uncertainty in carbon budgets associated with a given global temperature rise is determined by the physical Earth system, and therefore Earth system modelling has a clear and high priority remit to address and reduce this uncertainty. Here we explore multi-model carbon cycle simulations across three generations of Earth system models to quantitatively assess the sources of uncertainty which propagate through to TCRE. Our analysis brings new insights which will allow us to determine how we can better direct our research priorities in order to reduce this uncertainty. We emphasise that uses of carbon budget estimates must bear in mind the uncertainty stemming from the biogeophysical Earth system, and we recommend specific areas where the carbon cycle research community needs to re-focus activity in order to try to reduce this uncertainty. We conclude that we should revise focus from the climate feedback on the carbon cycle to place more emphasis on CO2 as the main driver of carbon sinks and their long-term behaviour. Our proposed framework will enable multiple constraints on components of the carbon cycle to propagate to constraints on remaining carbon budgets. © 2020 The Author(s).

Moro', Via Amendola 165/A, Bari, 70126, Italy","Lack of either spatial or temporal coverage in city-level carbon emissions analysis might curb our understanding of historical drivers and make future forecasting uncertain. To fill these gaps, we analyzed time-series energy-related industrial carbon emissions (EICEs) from manufacturing in over 99 cities nationwide in China during the period 2000-2015. We estimated these cities' EICEs reduction potential up until 2030 by improving scenario design, which imposed constraints separately on different city groups based on historical drivers. Results indicated distinct changes of EICEs around 2013 for the heavy manufacturing [HM], light manufacturing [LM] and high-tech development [HD] city groups and of emissions intensity for the energy production [EP] city group. The slowing economic growth would partly explain these transformations since 2013. Energy efficiency and industrial structure contributed most to these switches for the EP and HD city groups, respectively, while energy mix and energy efficiency were also major contributors for the HM and LM city groups. Given economic growth at a normal speed, EICEs will increase by 59%, 78%, 90% and 95% for the EP, HM, LM and HD city groups, respectively, from 2015-2030. Our scenarios show that energy efficiency improvement and industrial structure optimization will spur the EICEs to peak before 2030 and limit future EICEs increase by 6.4% and 33.4% in 2030 for the EP and HD city groups, respectively. This implies that energy efficiency improvement and industrial structure optimization are key emissions mitigation factors for the EP and HD cities. Equally important, our study found more unclean fuel structure with higher coal share in the HM and LM city groups than in the other groups. It is therefore imperative to improve their energy efficiency and optimize energy and industrial structures in the HM and LM cities. Results highlight the need to impose different constraints in scenario design and provide mitigation strategies at city level. © 2020 The Author(s).

It aimed to determine the hourly emission of exhaust gases to the atmosphere during such work and to identify the designs that can reduce it. The research was carried out with a cylinder woodchipper driven by a low-power (9.5 kW) combustion engine. There were three configurations of the tested drive unit: The factory setting (A) with a carburettor fuel supply system, modernized by us to include an electronic injection system (B). This system (B) was expanded with an adaptation system patented by the authors (P. 423369), thus creating the third configuration (C). The research was carried out when shredding cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera Ehrh. Beitr. Naturk. 4:17. 1789 (Gartenkalender 4:189-204. 1784)) branches with a diameter of 80 mm, which presented a large load for the machine. The machine was operated by one experienced operator. The average operating conditions during the tests were as follows: Branch delivery frequency of about 4 min−1 and mass flow rate of about 0.72 t h−1. During the tests with the use of PEMS (portable emissions measurement system, here Axion RS from Global MRV), we analyzed the emissions of compounds, such as CO, CO2, HC, and NOx, and determined the fuel consumption based on the carbon balance. The research showed that the use of an injection system (B) reduced fuel consumption from 1.38 to 1.29 l h−1 (by 6.7%) when compared to the carburettor system (A). Modernization of the injection system (B) with an adaptive system (C) reduced fuel consumption from 1.38 to 0.91 l h−1 (by 34%) when compared to the carburettor system (A). An hour of shredding with a cylinder chopper emits the following amounts of flue gases: design A (HC 0.013 kg h−1; CO 0.24 kg h−1; CO2 2.91 kg h−1; NOx 0.0036 kg h−1), design B (HC 0.0061 kg h−1; CO 0.20 kg h−1; CO2 2.77 kg h−1; NOx 0.0038 kg h−1), and design C (HC 0.017 kg h−1; CO 0.22 kg h−1; CO2 1.79 kg h−1; NOx 0.0030 kg h−1). The adaptive system entails significant reductions in non-HC emissions, which indicates that the system needs to be improved with respect to fuel-air mixture control for its enrichment of the low-to-high-speed change. The admissible emission limits for harmful compounds in exhaust gas for the tested group of propulsion units are in accordance with the provisions in force in the European Union from 2019 for the tested propulsion units during operation, with a full CO load about 6100 g h−1 and HC + NOx about 80 g h−1. The tested propulsion units emitted significantly less pollution under real operating conditions (because they did not work under full load throughout the entire test sample). © 2020 by the authors.","Actual operating conditions; Adaptive systems; Agriculture in urban areas; Exhaust emissions; Fuel consumption; PEMS; Small engine; Woodchipper","Air pollution control equipment; Carbon dioxide; Carburetors; Electronics industry; Exhaust gases; Fuels; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Propulsion; Speed regulators; Adaptation systems; Combustion engines; Delivery frequency; Electronic injection; Fuel supply systems; Operating condition; Portable emissions measurement systems; Real operating conditions; Adaptive control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087892139

In addition, other imperative control variables included in this study comprise technology factors (tractors (TRs) and tube wells (TWs), energy consumption (EC), and labor force (LF). This study used annual data covering the period 1983-2016. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach is applied to explore the cointegration between the underlying variables and used the granger causality test under the vector error correction model (VECM) context to determine the direction of causality among the variables. The findings of the ARDL bounds-testing approach suggest that there is a long-term relationship among formal credit, climate change (CO2 emissions), technology factors (tractors and tube wells), energy consumption, labor force, and agricultural production. The empirical results reveal that formal credit, technology use (tractors), and labor force have a positive and significant impact on agricultural production in both the short-run and long-run. CO2 emissions have a positive impact on agricultural production but are not significant in either case. Finally, a unidirectional relationship is established from formal credit to agricultural production; labor force to agricultural production; and electricity consumption and technology factors (tractors and tube wells) to CO2 emissions. The recent study claims that formal institutions should guarantee the redeployment of their services/amenities to those who call for them acutely, with the purpose of boosting their approach to monetary credit facilities and empower farmers to further the resilience that will capitalize on post-fruitage enrichments. Finally, considering that climatic change is a widespread fact with regional community trajectories, perhaps the global community may provide reassurance for loaning to smallholder agriculturalists through central and commercial banks by protecting the moneys that banks lend to the agriculturalists towards supporting climatic change espousal strategies. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural production; ARDL approach; CO2 emissions; Formal credit; Pakistan","agricultural production; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; credit provision; energy use; error correction; smallholder; time series analysis; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087892005

Many stakeholders expect companies to implement sustainability-oriented practices and report on these actions and their results. As a consequence, corporate accountability and,more specifically, corporate accounting and reporting, should focus not only on financial, social, and environmental performance, but also on sustainability-related aspects. Among these aspects, climate change is becoming increasingly important for companies, which must take action to counter the effects of their activities on climate change and inform their stakeholders about these actions and their effects. Given the initial state of research about climate change accounting and reporting, the authors focused on the sustainable development goal (SDG) no. 13, ""climate action"", in order to highlight the current state and the future directions of this area of inquiry. They used a mixed approach to perform a systematic literature review about sustainability accounting/reporting and climate change: (1) a qualitative analysis according to a qualitative analytical framework, and (2) a bibliometric (descriptive statistical) approach. The authors found that: (1) themain perspectives addressed in the selected articles relate to sustainability accounting and reporting in a broad sense; (2) there was a lack of contributions about management of climate change-related aspects, with specific reference to strategic and operational planning, accounting, and control of the actions implemented by the management of firms to counter climate change problems.

In this study, PAHs emitted from an asphalt mix plant were analyzed to investigate the effects on a suburban residential area. Black carbon, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and PAHs in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were analyzed in a village near the asphalt mix plant. The results of wind direction analysis revealed that the village was meteorologically affected by emissions from the asphalt mix plant. PAHs in PM2.5 ranged from 0.51 to 60.73 ng/m3, with an average of 11.54 ng/m3. Seasonal PAHs were highest in winter, followed in order by spring, autumn, and summer. The diagnostic ratios between PAHs indicate that the source of PAHs could be incomplete combustion of petrogenic origin. The maximum black carbon concentration in the intensive periods reaches up to 14.17 μg/m3 during mix plant operation periods. Seasonal ∑BaPTEF values based on Toxic Equivalence Factor were: winter (2.284 ng/m3), spring (0.575 ng/m3), autumn (0.550 ng/m3), and summer (0.176 ng/m3). The values are about 6.5 times higher than the concentration in another background area and more than three times higher than those in the capital city, Seoul, in the Republic of Korea. In conclusion, primary emissions from the point source can be considered the major contributor to pollution in the residential area. © 2020 by the authors.","Asphalt mix plant; Elemental carbon; Organic carbon; PAHs; Toxic equivalence factor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087883107

We show that these amounts represent a significant proportion of the fossil fuel CO2 emissions, up to 40% for instance in cities of Nordic countries, and will thus leave some ambiguity in the retrieval of fossil fuel CO2 emissions from satellite concentration observations. Auxiliary information such as biofuel use statistics and radiocarbon measurement could help reduce the ambiguity and improve the framework of monitoring fossil fuel CO2 emissions from space. © 2020 The Author(s).

Based on the calculations, it was shown that the energy efficiency of the decomposition of methane hydrate, i.e. the ratio of the energy obtained by burning the released methane to the energy spent on heating the formation decreases with increasing temperature of the coolant. The formation temperature distributions are also presented and the dependences of the position of the phase transition boundary on the system parameters are investigated. The problem is solved in a plane-one-dimensional formulation. According to the proposed scheme, a homogeneous porous layer of finite length, containing methane hydrate in the initial state, is considered. In this problem, we believe that the decomposition of hydrate into water and gas occurs at the boundary of phase transitions. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This study, therefore, examines approaches of a set of European Union (EU) member states (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (England) to pursue a more coordinated approach to CCA policy. It specifically addresses the co-ordination approaches that the selected countries use for the development and implementation of their national CCA policies in the immediate period following the publication of the EU's 2013 Adaptation Strategy. The analysis demonstrates that while useful coordination processes have been established in the analyzed EU member states, they have difficulty in challenging existing institutional hierarchies and decision rules. Consequently, longer-term opportunities for managing CCA conflicts and synergies among sectoral policies have to date been limited. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation strategy; Climate change adaptation; European union; European union member state; Policy coordination; Policy integration","adaptive management; climate change; decision analysis; environmental policy; European Union; governance approach; institutional framework; national planning; perception; policy implementation; strategic approach; Denmark; England; Finland; Germany; Italy; Netherlands; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087877315

They are complex systems and understanding the implications of potential actions by cities is critical for progress towards sustainability. In this paper the future implications of sustainability strategies are assessed for 10 European cities by comparing two scenarios for 2050: a business-as-usual (BAU) and a post-carbon/sustainability scenario (PC2050) (generated by city stakeholders). The effects of the scenarios are assessed using a mixed methodology: a semi-quantitative sustainability indicator analysis, energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (both production-based and consumption-based accounting (PBA and CBA)), land-use spatial modelling, and cost-benefit analysis. The paper highlights the clear benefits of PC2050 with improved sustainability indicator results, reduced land sprawl (which averages 16% in BAU) and positive cost-benefit results. Nonetheless, inequality and segregation are a common concern. In addition, whilst PBA indicates a significant decrease (average decrease from 4.7 to 1.3 tCO2eq per capita) CBA demonstrates rising overall emissions from an average of 11 to 14.8 tCO2eq per capita. This is linked to rising affluence and consumption trends despite local improvements in GHG emissions, which highlights a need for cities to address consumption-based emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Consumption-based accounting; Land-use change; Scenario analysis; Sustainability assessment","consumption behavior; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental economics; future prospect; land use planning; scenario analysis; sustainability; urban area; urban sprawl; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087876175

Therefore, the appropriate management of land-sea interaction (LSI)contexts should base on those planning approaches which can holistically support coastal development, such as Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and Climate Adaptation Planning (CAP). One of the main limiting factors for this integration is the fragmentation of existing databases and information sources, which compose the territorial knowledge framework. Investigations have sought to address the representation and assessment of ""wicked"" and interconnected coastal problems. The present research focuses on the production of the necessary information to fill sectorial knowledge gaps and to merge the available data into a single framework. The research methodology is based on remote sensing assessment techniques and is designed to be replicated in other coastal areas to integrate CAP and MSP. The output maps are a result of the empirical application of the integration of the assessment techniques and are meant to support local decision-making processes. The result aims at illustrating and highlighting the relationships between climate change impact vulnerabilities their spatial relation to marine resources and maritime activities. This can support effective actions aimed at environmental and urban protection, the organization of the uses of the sea and adaptation to climate impacts. The application of the assessment techniques is developed on a case study in the north Adriatic Basin. The Gulf of Trieste constitutes a representative case study for the Mediterranean Basin due to its transboundary nature. The relationship and the ongoing projects between Slovenia and Italy make the case study an interesting context in which to test and train the proposed integrated planning approach. Therefore, the study investigates local vulnerability to climate impacts, i.e., Urban Heat Island (UHI) and urban runoff, and the existing relationship between the urban fabrics and the marine environment. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation planning; Climate change; Climate impacts; Land-sea interaction; Maritime spatial planning; Remote sensing; Sustainable planning; Vulnerability assessment","adaptation; climate change; coastal development; decision making; heat island; land-sea interaction; marine environment; remote sensing; spatial planning; territorial planning; vulnerability; Adriatic Sea; Gulf of Trieste; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Slovenia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087872658

Their feeding strategies can be divided into endoparasites and ectoparasites that differ substantially, not only in their damage potential to host tissue and primary production, but also in their susceptibility to environmental changes. Climate change is predicted to increase variability of precipitation in many systems, yet the effects on belowground biodiversity and associated impacts on primary productivity remain poorly understood. To examine the impact of altered precipitation on endo- and ectoparasitic soil nematodes, we conducted a 2-year precipitation manipulation study across an arid, a semiarid, and a mesic grassland. Plant parasite feeding type abundance, functional guilds, and herbivory index in response to precipitation were evaluated. Responses of endo- and ectoparasites to increased precipitation varied by grassland type. There was little response of ectoparasites to increased precipitation although their population declined at the mesic site with increased precipitation. The abundance of endoparasites remained unchanged with increasing precipitation at the arid site, increased at the semiarid, and decreased at the mesic site. The herbivory index followed closely the trends seen in the endoparasites response by stagnating at the arid site, increasing at the semiarid, and decreasing at the mesic site.

We are all aware of the profound social and economic consequences of the pandemic (WHO, 2020)"". Such consequences are the result of counter-measures such as lockdowns, and world-wide reductions in production and consumption, amplified by cascading impacts through international supply chains. Using a global multi-regional macro-economic model, we capture direct and indirect spill-over effects in terms of social and economic losses, as well as environmental effects of the pandemic. Based on information as of May 2020, we show that global consumption losses amount to 3.8$tr, triggering significant job (147 million full-time equivalent) and income (2.1$tr) losses. Global atmospheric emissions are reduced by 2.5Gt of greenhouse gases, 0.6Mt of PM2.5, and 5.1Mt of SO2 and NOx. While Asia, Europe and the USA have been the most directly impacted regions, and transport and tourism the immediately hit sectors, the indirect effects transmitted along international supply chains are being felt across the entire world economy. These ripple effects highlight the intrinsic link between socio-economic and environmental dimensions, and emphasise the challenge of addressing unsustainable global patterns.

W.D. Clayton] is among the most troublesome weeds in subtropical climates where sugarcane (Saccharum spp. interspecific hybrids) is cultivated. Two R. cochinchinensis biotypes commonly infest sugarcane in Louisiana. The Louisiana-1 biotype is daylength neutral, but Louisiana-2 flowered when daylength decreased to 13 h. Coupled with biotype diversity, seedling emergence has been reported to occur earlier in the growing season, as sugarcane emerged from winter dormancy. Both R. cochinchinensis biotypes were established in a common garden experiment in Louisiana during periods of sugarcane development and field preparation to simulate discontinuous emergence. Plant height and raceme production were recorded weekly for each biotype and establishment timing; aboveground biomass was harvested in autumn. Louisiana's subtropical humid climate stimulated rapid plant growth that typically began in May and persisted through September. Without sugarcane competition, maximum R. cochinchinensis heights for Louisiana-1 and Louisiana-2 were 206 and 179 cm and growing degree days to 20-cm height in 2017 ranged from 546 to 832 and 865 to 1,160, respectively. Slower initial growth reported with Louisiana-2 would allow more time for growers to treat escaped plants with POST herbicides. Total raceme production, by autumn, was zero for Louisiana-2 established in June or later, but Louisiana-1 established in June produced up to 202 racemes. The present study demonstrated the importance of managing the Louisiana-2 biotype in March and April to limit seed production, but fields infested with Louisiana-1 were at greater risk for potential crop yield loss, because plants produced high quantities of seed when established over a wide period of time. © 2020 Weed Science Society of America.","Plant phenology; seed production; sugarcane; weed biology","aboveground biomass; biotype; climate change; fecundity; grass; growing season; growth; seedling emergence; seedling establishment; spatiotemporal analysis; subtropical region; weed; weed control; Louisiana; United States; Rottboellia; Rottboellia cochinchinensis; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087770215

We proposed and evaluated an integrated planning strategy as opposed to an established and largely separated planning workflow. Materials and methods: Ten patients with representative malignancies of the head and neck region underwent combined carbon-photon radiotherapy (RT) in our facilities. Clinical plans were created according to the separated workflow with independent optimization stages for both modalities. Experimental plans incorporated the existing carbon IBT dose distribution into the optimization stage of a step-and-shoot photon IMRT (bias dose planning). Results: Cumulative dose distributions showed statistically significant differences between the two planning strategies and were predominantly in favor of the integrated approach. As such, target irradiation was generally maintained or even improved in a subset of metrics, while normal tissue sparing was widely enhanced; for instance, in the ipsilateral temporal lobe with median Dmean of −16% (p &lt; 0.001). Maximum doses D1% (with adjustment for different fractionation) fell below thresholds for toxicity risk in a minority of instances, where they were previously exceeded. Integral dose did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that combination planning of carbon-photon RT for head and neck malignancies may benefit from a proposed bias dose method, yielding favorable dose distribution characteristics and a streamlined planning workflow with fewer plan revisions. Further research is necessary to validate these observations in terms of robustness and their potential for higher tumor control. © 2020 The Author(s)","Adenoid cystic; Carcinoma; Combined modality therapy; Computer-assisted; Head and neck neoplasms; Heavy ion radiotherapy; Radiotherapy; Radiotherapy planning; Radiotherapy, Intensity-modulated","adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; clinical target volume; cohort analysis; comparative study; dose volume histogram; dosimetry; female; head and neck cancer; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; ion therapy; male; maximum permissible dose; metric system; organs at risk; photon therapy; planning target volume; priority journal; process optimization; radiation dose distribution; radiation dose fractionation; radiation oncology; radiotherapy dosage; retrospective study; temporal lobe; threshold limit value; treatment planning; workflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087708265

In normal cases, light-weight carbonaceous materials harnessing excellent electrical conductivity have served as electrode candidates. However, they struggle with undermined areal and volumetric energy density of supercapacitor devices, thereby greatly impeding the practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate the in situ coupling of NiCoP bimetallic phosphide and Ti3C2 MXene to build up heavy NCPM electrodes affording tunable mass loading throughout 3D printing technology. The resolution of prints reaches 50 μm and the thickness of device electrodes is ca. 4 mm. Thus-printed electrode possessing robust open framework synergizes favorable capacitance of NiCoP and excellent conductivity of MXene, readily achieving a high areal and volumetric capacitance of 20 F cm−2 and 137 F cm−3 even at a high mass loading of ~ 46.3 mg cm−2. Accordingly, an asymmetric supercapacitor full cell assembled with 3D-printed NCPM as a positive electrode and 3D-printed activated carbon as a negative electrode harvests remarkable areal and volumetric energy density of 0.89 mWh cm−2 and 2.2 mWh cm−3, outperforming the most of state-of-the-art carbon-based supercapacitors.

While spatial heterogeneity plays an important role in environmental regulation in China, it is necessary to analyze the spatial heterogeneity influences of air pollution control policies and informal environmental regulation on air pollutant emissions in China. Based on the quantification of air pollution control policies, this paper incorporates the central government’s policy formulation and local government’s policy implementation into the intensity of air pollution control policy. This paper uses the panel data of China’s 30 provinces to examine the spatial impact of air pollution control policy and informal environmental regulation on air pollutant emissions. The results show that (a) air pollutant emissions represented by soot and dust emission intensity has a significant positive spatial spillover effect; (b) air pollution control policy and informal environmental regulation play significant inhibitory roles in air pollutant emissions; (c) informal environmental regulation has a negative moderating effect on the negative relationship between air pollution control policy and air pollutant emissions. Other implications for environmental management have also been discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

All possible isomeric structures have been taken into account. Because of these derivatives are push–pull conjugated dienes, they can behave either as nucleophilic or electrophilic species and could be used for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. We focus our attention to the static chemical reactivity of these derivatives to predict which atomic site is the most susceptible to undergo either a nucleophilic or an electrophilic attack. The calculated reactivity indices derived from density functional theory were used and various descriptors such as electrophilicity (ωk), nucleophilicity (Nk), and local reactivity difference index (Rk) are then calculated. The predictions were compared to the experimental and theoretical results. The natural bond orbital analysis was also studied. Linear and NLO properties have been investigated by the CAM-B3LYP functional. Indeed, we have been interested on the dipole moment µ, mean polarizability α , anisotropy polarizability | α| , the hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) first hyperpolarizability βHRS(- 2 ω; ω, ω) , and the depolarization ratio (DR). An inverse relationship has been obtained between the βHRS and the HOMO–LUMO gaps.

This study intends to evaluate the multi-criteria accessibility measure of residential areas to key destinations in Metro Manila, using the gravity method and applying it to understand its impact on household vehicle ownership and energy consumption. The main findings suggest that improving residential area access to key services and facilities (i.e., hospitals, schools, markets, and recreation centers) not only enhances the equitable development of society but also discourages household vehicle dependency. Additionally, the highest multi-criteria accessibility is observed for areas with the presence of high rail line density, specifically in the most populated part of Metro Manila because of many educational institutions, medical centers and hospitals, and markets and shopping malls are located around the train stations and along the rail lines. Furthermore, households living in an area with high multi-criteria accessibility are less likely to acquire and use vehicles. A 1% improvement of accessibility reduced the energy consumption by 38.470 MJ/month-vehicle, CO2 emission by 2.851 kg/month-vehicle, and vehicle kilometers traveled by 12.043 km/month-vehicle.

Among these, the Mg-doped ZnO system is of particular interest as it offers the opportunity to tune the UV emission by engineering its bandgap via doping control. However, both the doped system and its pristine congener, ZnO, suffer from being highly prone to parasitic defect level emissions, compromising their efficiency as light emitters in the ultraviolet region. Here, employing the process of femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in a liquid (fs-PLAL), we demonstrate the systematic control of enhanced UV-only emission in Mg-doped ZnO nanoparticles using both photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies. The ratio of luminescence intensities corresponding to near band edge emission to defect level emission was found to be six-times higher in Mg-doped ZnO nanoparticles as compared to pristine ZnO. Insights from UV-visible absorption and Raman analysis also reaffirm this defect suppression. This work provides a simple and effective single-step methodology to achieve UV-emission and mitigation of defect emissions in the Mg-doped ZnO system. This is a significant step forward in its deployment for UV emitting optoelectronic devices. © 2020 by the authors.

A sample containing only one fluorescent waveguide layer showed a highly directional emission spectrum with a Lorentzian line shape caused by the radiative decay of an excited planar waveguide mode into a traveling wave in a decoupling prism. Addition of another waveguide layer containing absorptive dye molecules was found to greatly modify the spectrum and generate a Fano line shape in the emission spectrum. The observed Lorentzian and Fano emission spectra could be well reproduced by electromagnetic calculations based on the Lorentz reciprocity theorem.

The purpose of this study was to establish direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between iron-reducing bacteria (IRB) and methanogens with Fe oxides to alleviate the inhibition of sulfate in anaerobic digestion. Effects of ferrihydrite on the digestion performances with various sulfate concentrations (1034 mg L-1, 1551 mg L-1, and 3171 mg L-1) were investigated in this study. Results showed that addition of ferrihydrite decreased methane production but enhanced sulfate reduction (P < 0.05) at low concentrations of influent sulfate since ferrihydrite alleviated the inhibition to cause sulfate reducing bacteria to outcompete methanogens for capturing electrons. When increasing the influent sulfate to 3171 mg L-1 with a COD/SO42- ratio of 0.54, ferrihydrite increased methane production (P < 0.05) because IRB enriched with ferrihydrite might couple with methanogens to cause DIET for methanogenesis. Ferrihydrite increased the secretion of humic acid-like substances of EPS to enhance electron transfer capacity. During the process, conductive iron minerals such as pyrite were formed to promote the DIET. Accordingly, microbial community analysis revealed that IRB (e.g. Clostridium) were enriched in the presence of ferrihydrite. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Electron transitions; Iron oxides; Methane; Methanogens; Pyrites; Wastewater treatment; Electron transfer capacities; High-sulfate wastewater; Humic acid-like substances; Iron reducing bacteria (IRB); Microbial communities; Microbial community analysis; Sulfate concentrations; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Sulfur compounds; anaerobic digestion; bioreactor; ferrihydrite; iron oxide; iron-reducing bacterium; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; performance assessment; sulfate; wastewater treatment; Clostridium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087588056

However, the negative impact of drought on crop yields still necessitates stakeholders to make informed decisions according to its severity. This research proposes an algorithm to combine a drought monitoring model, based on rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index/leaf area index (NDVI/LAI) satellite products, with a crop simulation model to assess drought impact on rice yields in Thailand. Typical crop simulation models can provide yield information, but the requirement for a complicated set of inputs prohibits their potential due to insufficient data. This work utilizes a rice crop simulation model called the Simulation Model for Use with Remote Sensing (SIMRIW-RS), whose inputs can mostly be satisfied by such satellite products. Based on experimental data collected during the 2018/19 crop seasons, this approach can successfully provide a drought monitoring function as well as effectively estimate the rice yield with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) around 5%. In addition, we show that SIMRIW-RS can reasonably predict the rice yield when historical weather data is available. In effect, this research contributes a methodology to assess the drought impact on rice yields on a farm to regional scale, relevant to crop insurance and adaptation schemes to mitigate climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

Operational agricultural drought assessment methods in India mainly depend on a single input parameter such as precipitation and are based on a sparsely located in-situ measurements, which limits monitoring precision. The overarching objective of this study is to address this need through the development of an integrated agro-climatological drought monitoring approach, i.e., combined drought indicator for Marathwada (CDI_M), situated in the central part of Maharashtra, India. In this study, satellite and model-based input parameters (i.e., standardized precipitation index (SPI-3), land surface temperature (LST), soil moisture (SM), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were analyzed at a monthly scale from 2001 to 2018. Two quantitative methods were tested to combine the input parameters for developing the CDI_M. These methods included an expert judgment-based weight of each parameter (Method-I) and principle component analysis (PCA)-based weighting approach (Method-II). Secondary data for major types of crop yields in Marathwada were utilized to assess the CDI_M results for the study period. CDI_M maps depict moderate to extreme drought cases in the historic drought years of 2002, 2009, and 2015-2016. This study found a significant increase in drought intensities (p ≤ 0.05) and drought frequency over the years 2001-2018, especially in the Latur, Jalna, and Parbhani districts. In comparison to Method-I (r ≥ 0.4), PCA-based (Method-II) CDI_M showed a higher correlation (r ≥ 0.60) with crop yields in both harvesting seasons (Kharif and Rabi). In particular, crop yields during the drier years showed a greater association (r > 6.5) with CDI_M over Marathwada. Hence, the present study illustrated the effectiveness of CDI_M to monitor agricultural drought in India and provide improved information to support agricultural drought management practices. © 2020 by the authors.

This is particularly true for extended deserts or mountainous areas with sparse rain gauges like Iran. However, there are discrepancies between these satellite-based estimations and ground measurements, and it is necessary to apply adjustment methods to reduce systematic bias in these products. In this study, we apply a quantile mapping method with gauge information to reduce the systematic error of the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS). Due to the availability and quality of the ground-based measurements, we divide Iran into seven climate regions to increase the sample size for generating cumulative probability distributions within each region. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are then employed with a quantile mapping 0.6° x 0.6° filter to adjust the values of PERSIANN-CCS. We use eight years (2009-2016) of historical data to calibrate our method, generating nonparametric cumulative distribution functions of ground-based measurements and satellite estimations for each climate region, as well as two years (2017-2018) of additional data to validate our approach. The results show that the bias correction approach improves PERSIANN-CCS data at aggregated to monthly, seasonal and annual scales for both the calibration and validation periods. The areal average of the annual bias and annual root mean square errors are reduced by 98% and 56% during the calibration and validation periods, respectively. Furthermore, the averages of the bias and root mean square error of the monthly time series decrease by 96% and 26% during the calibration and validation periods, respectively. There are some limitations in bias correction in the Southern region of the Caspian Sea because of shortcomings of the satellite-based products in recognizing orographic clouds. © 2020 by the authors.

Smoke forecasting systems have the potential to improve health outcomes by providing future estimates of surface aerosol concentrations (and health hazards) over a period of several days. In most operational smoke forecasting systems, fire emissions are assumed to remain constant during the duration of the weather forecast and are initialized using satellite observations. Recent work suggests that it may be possible to improve these models by predicting the temporal evolution of emissions. Here, we develop statistical models to predict fire activity one to five days into the future using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite fire counts and weather data from ERA-interim reanalysis. Our predictive framework consists of two-Poisson regression models that separately represent new ignitions and the dynamics of existing fires on a coarse resolution spatial grid. We use ten years of active fire detections in Alaska to develop the model and use a cross-validation approach to evaluate model performance. Our results show that regression methods are significantly more accurate in predicting daily fire activity than persistence-based models (which suffer from an overestimation of fire counts by not accounting for fire extinction), with vapor pressure deficit being particularly effective as a single weather-based predictor in the regression approach. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Daily fire forecasting; fire ignitions; moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS); smoke aerosols; vapor pressure deficit (VPD)","Air quality; Fires; Health hazards; Logistic regression; Poisson distribution; Radiometers; Smoke; Aerosol concentration; Forecasting system; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellites; Poisson regression; Poisson regression models; Satellite observations; Temporal evolution; Vapor pressure deficit; Weather forecasting; air quality; ecosystem health; forecasting method; MODIS; Poisson ratio; satellite altimetry; smoke; weather forecasting; wildfire; Alaska; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087543724

Air pollution has been associated with asthma in children. Air pollution has also been suggested to be distributed unequally within the cities, something that can lead to urban health inequalities. Aim: We aimed to estimate the number of childhood asthma cases attributable to three main air pollutants; Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Particulate Matter (PM 2.5), and Black Carbon (BC) in the city of Barcelona, Spain. We also aimed to describe the distribution of those impacts depending on the social deprivation index in Barcelona. Methods: We estimated the number of childhood asthma cases in Barcelona by applying a quantitative Health Impact Assessment (HIA) approach. Air pollution (NO2, PM2.5, and BC) exposure assessment was estimated using a land-use regression model. Two scenarios were assessed and compared the current levels of air pollution with 1) achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline on exposure levels for NO2 and PM2.5 (scenario 1); and 2) achieving the minimum reported levels in a previously published meta-analysis (scenario 2), from where we also obtained the exposure-response functions. The relative risk and population attributable fraction (PAF) for each scenario and pollutant were estimated. Using the asthma incidence rate in Spain the expected number of asthma cases in Barcelona attributable to NO2, PM2.5, and BC for each scenario was estimated. Results: The annual average levels of NO2, PM2.5, and BC at census levels were 56 μg/m3, 17.11 μg/m3, and 2.88 μg/m3, respectively. The number of asthma cases attributable to NO2 and PM2.5 (percentage of total cases) estimated in scenario 1 was 454 (18%) and 478 (19%) respectively. For scenario 2, the estimated number of cases attributable to NO2, PM2.5, and BC were 1230 (48%), 992 (39%) and 789 (31%) respectively. Although NO2 and BC showed differences between asthma cases and areas with different deprivation index, only BC differences were statistically significant between less and more deprived areas. Conclusions: This study estimated that up to 1230 (48%) of asthma cases in Barcelona could be attributable to air pollution each year. This study also found that in Barcelona, less socially deprived groups could be more affected by asthma-related to air pollution than those more socially deprived. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Asthma; Childhood; Health equity; Health impact assessment","black carbon; nitrogen dioxide; asthma; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; equity; guideline; health risk; meta-analysis; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; risk factor; World Health Organization; adolescent; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; asthma; attributable risk; child; disease association; disease burden; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental impact; female; health equity; health hazard; health impact assessment; high risk population; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; meta analysis (topic); particulate matter; practice guideline; priority journal; risk factor; social isolation; Spain; World Health Organization; adverse event; air pollutant; asthma; city; meta analysis; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asthma; Child; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Health Equity; Humans; Particulate Matter; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087517916

Estimates of global seagrass spatial distribution differ greatly throughout the published literature, ranging from 177 000 to 600 000 km2 with models suggesting potential distribution an order of magnitude higher. The requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement by outlining National Determined Contributions (NDC's) to reduce emissions is placing an increased global focus on the spatial extent, loss and restoration of seagrass meadows. Now more than ever there is a need to provide a more accurate and consistent measure of the global spatial distribution of seagrass. There is also a need to be able to assess the global spread of other seagrass ecosystem services and in their extension, the values of these services. In this study, by rationalising and updating a range of existing datasets of seagrass distribution around the globe, we have estimated with Moderate to High confidence the global seagrass area to date as 160 387 km2, but possibly 266 562 km2 with lower confidence. We break this global estimate down to a national level with a detailed analysis of the current state of mapped distribution and estimates of seagrass area per country. Accurate estimates, however, are challenged by large areas remaining unmapped and inconsistent measures being used. Through the examination of current global maps, we are able to propose a pathway forward for improving mapping of this important resource.

Therefore, to reduce cost and CO2 emissions, renewable energy such as photovoltaic (PV) power is widely used. However, such integration may have reliability issues due to intermittency and uncertainty of PV power. Hence, energy storage is further implemented to compensate for the variability of PV output. As a result, the critical problem is to find an optimized PV-storage control strategy and capacity considering the techno-economic aspects, cost, and reliability. Previous research has not provided convincing results due to the little attention paid to the practical operational constraints of existing DEs (time delay management, spinning reserve strategies, ramp rate, etc.), and rough hourly usage data in a time-series model. Besides, no applicable systematic evaluation method has been established. This paper develops a new model which fully considers the DE generator's operational characteristics. Furthermore, based on the recorded 1-min load and PV generation data in a real microgrid, a systematic evaluation method is proposed, which searches for the best results for both control strategies and capacities of all components. This method can be utilized for the integration of high renewable (PV) penetration into existing DE powered remote networks. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","capacity design; dispatch operation; Micro-grid; renewable energy","Digital storage; Energy resources; Microgrids; Photovoltaic cells; Search engines; Control strategies; Critical problems; Operational characteristics; Operational constraints; Remote communities; Renewable energies; Systematic evaluation; Time series modeling; Delay control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087487802

A PM2.5 sampling campaign was carried out from 9 to 28 December 2014 at eight receptor sites, two placed in the urban settlement and five included in the high spatial resolution fence monitoring network of the biggest European steel plant. The integration of collected data with meteorological parameters and source apportionment analysis by Positive Matrix Factorization and bivariate polar plots allowed to discriminate among emission sources and estimate their contributions. Evidence on the effect of distinct processes (homogenization, sintering) occurring inside the steel plant on airborne concentrations of PAHs and selected elements was provided. The impact of emissions from the steel plant “core” on the surrounding area was observed at receptor sites downwind to it. Moreover, the extent of the effectiveness of mitigation measures, partially applied at the moment of study’s beginning, was demonstrated by mean and peak pollutant concentrations at all receptor sites up to one order of magnitude lower than those documented prior to 2012. © 2020 by the authors.","Chemical characterization; Diagnostic ratios; Elements; PAHs; Particulate matter; Polar plots; Positive matrix factorization; Source apportionment; Steel plant","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; steel; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; concentration (composition); governance approach; industrial district; industrial emission; PAH; particulate matter; policy implementation; pollution control; source apportionment; urban area; air pollution control; Article; concentration (parameter); government; industrialization; Italy; particulate matter; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Italy; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087459231

After filling in jute/polypropylene bags, the major portion of this wheat is stacked in a room type warehouse under uncontrolled conditions. The aim of this study was to find the impact of the storage period, initial grain moisture, annual temperature variations, relative humidity, and fumigation on rheological changes in wheat stored in a hot steppe climate using the latest approach (mixolab). Findings: During this study, the gluten index (GI) (72.4%–97.1%) and falling number (FN) (455–593.1 s) values increased for most of the storage months and showed a strong negative temperature correlation. Significant variability was also noted during the storage period in mixolab behavior and a strong correlation was found with the storage temperature. The starch gelatinization (C3) (1.824–2.063 Nm) and C3-C2 (1.320–1.583 Nm) increased, while retrogradation (C5) (2.833–2.506 Nm) and cooling setback (C5-C4) (1.265–0.840 Nm) decreased over most of the month. Pasting properties (C4) showed a mixed pattern during storage (1.7965–1.536 Nm). The GI and FN were positively correlated with C3 and C3-C2, and negatively correlated with C5-C4. Fumigation showed significant effect on GI and FN of the grains, while the initial grain moisture (<11%) showed non-significant impact on most of the rheological characteristics during storage. Conclusions: Most of the rheological characteristics of wheat (GI, FN, and mixolab) changed significantly during the storage period, while the fumigation and initial grain moisture did not show any significant impact. Significance and novelty: The quality characteristics of stored wheat vary depending on the geographical region. For millers, it will be important to understand these variations to produce a consistent quality flour. © 2020 Cereals & Grains Association","falling number; fumigation; gluten index; mixolab; wheat storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087425836

In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including CO, NO, NO2, NOx, and O3 . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the ecological consequences of that warming event, across multiple trophic levels and taxa. We tested for evidence that observed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies were outside the envelope of natural climate variability in order to evaluate the risk of novel ecosystem configurations. We also tested for state changes in shared trends of climate (n = 11) and biology (n = 48) time series, using a Bayesian implementation of Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA). And we tested for evidence of novel ecological relationships during 2014–2019. We found that 3-year running mean SST anomalies during 2014–2019 were outside the range of anomalies from preindustrial simulations in CMIP5 models, indicating that the combined magnitude and duration of the warming event was outside the range of natural variability. A DFA model of climate variability also returned a shared trend in climate time series that was at unprecedented levels during 2014–2019. However, DFA models fit to biology data did not show shared trends of variability at unprecedented levels, and Hidden Markov Models fit to shared trends from the climate and biology models failed to find evidence of shifts to a new ecosystem state during 2014–2019. Conversely, we did find preliminary indications that community responses to SST variability strengthened during 2014–2019 after decades of a mostly neutral relationship. Tests for nonstationary patterns of shared variability suggest that covariance between SST and other ecologically-important climate variables remained weaker than during the 1970s Pacific Decadal Oscillation shift, suggesting the potential for muted ecological responses to the 2014–2019 event. Finally, we found that recent patterns of community variability appear to be highly dissimilar to those associated with the 1970s event, suggesting the potential for novel community states with continued warming. In summary, we find no evidence for wholesale ecosystem reorganization during 2014–2019, though nonstationary relationships among climate and community variables suggest the ongoing possibility of novel patterns of ecosystem functioning with continued warming. © 2020","Bayesian Dynamic Factor Analysis; Climate change; Climate variability; Ecosystem response; Gulf of Alaska; Nonstationary relationship","Biology; Climatology; Ecosystems; Hidden Markov models; Oceanography; Surface waters; Time series; Time series analysis; Community variability; Dynamic factor analysis; Ecological consequences; Ecological relationships; Multiple trophic levels; Natural climate variabilities; Pacific decadal oscillation; Sea surface temperature anomalies; Climate models; climate effect; climate variation; CMIP; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem function; ecosystem response; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; sea surface temperature; temperature anomaly; time series analysis; Gulf of Alaska; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087414862

However, most reported photocatalysts are only active in the ultraviolet region, which necessitates co-catalysts and sacrificial agents in the reaction systems, leading to an unsatisfied economy of the process in energy and atoms. In this research, a CuMox W(1-x) O4 solid solution was synthesized, characterized, and tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in the presence of amines. The results revealed that the yield of CH3 OH from CO2 was 1017.7 µmol/g under 24 h visible light irradiation using CuW0.7 Mo0.3 O4 (x = 0.7) as the catalyst. This was associated with the maximum conversion (82.1%) of benzylamine to N-benzylidene benzylamine with high selectivity (&gt;99%).

This specific behavior often limits the use of pollutants as a secondary carbon source by bacteria grown with preferred carbon source and the pollutants. Therefore, to develop an efficient bioremediation technology for removal/degradation of organophosphorus pesticide methyl parathion (MP) from agricultural soils, a soil bacterial strain (LMGR1) capable of degrading MP and p-nitrophenol was isolated and identified as a Cupriavidus oxalaticus based on biochemical (carbon utilization pattern) and molecular analysis (16S rRNA gene sequence), but the phylogenetic analysis revealed a distinct position, and the name was designated as Cupriavidus sp. LMGR1. The effect of preferred carbon source on degradation was also investigated. The bacterium assimilated the pesticide as a sole source of carbon and consumes about 100 mg L−1 of MP within 6 to 7 h of incubation. Furthermore, the methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH) enzyme (localized in the periplasm of bacterium) activity was induced by the carbon deficiency instead of substrate. Determination of kinetic parameters, i.e., Vmax and Km for MPH enzyme in the extracted periplasmic protein indicated significant higher affinity towards the substrate. The reduced MPH activity in the bacterium grown in presence of preferred carbon source indicated the role of carbon catabolite repression in regulation of pesticide degradation. Thus, the bacterium has prodigious capability to be used as a bioremediation agent, but the availability of preferred carbon source may affect its potential in field application. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bioremediation; Cupriavidus sp.

Since an increase in fossil fuel-based generation is foreboded by law, the lost nuclear power can only be replaced by renewable energy sources. The maritime climate and constant monsoons make wind power a feasible alternative energy source to Taiwan. With more than 300 potential wind farm sites under consideration, the government does not have enough information to determine the best sites in terms of power generation and capital investments. To explore such information, this study employs a lifecycle analysis to identify the economic components of these sites under the estimates of wind speed data and potential wind power generation obtained in our previous study. We also use a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of construction cost, maintenance cost, energy sale, and emission trade on the site selection decision. We show that variations in construction costs and energy prices have larger impacts than greenhouse gases prices. In addition, the results point out that most sites pass the cost-benefit examination, but site rankings may alter in the face of capital rationing and climate change. Some policy implications derived from the results are discussed in detail. © The Author(s) 2020.","Global circulation model; lifecycle analysis; power curve estimates; renewable energy","Climate change; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Life cycle; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Public policy; Regional planning; Sensitivity analysis; Site selection; Wind; Wind power; Economic components; Environmental concerns; Feasible alternatives; Life cycle analysis; Potential wind power generation; Regional development; Renewable energy source; Selection decisions; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087397267

Because of a fragile universality, both Reformed churches and global institutions find it difficult to agree on a concrete plan to address climate change. Theologically, this difficulty arrives not primarily from disagreement with the existence or causes of climate change but how Christian theological values translate concretely to acts of justice. This study proposes a way to ground these discussions on the concept of dangerous memory by resourcing the theology of Johann Baptist Metz. Dangerous memories allow stories of the suffering vanquished to be constitutive to the construction of caritas, which in turn serves as a suitable theological foundation for addressing differing approaches to engaging climate issues. Reading the Accra Confession as dangerous memory, then, provides a valuable resource to the Reformed community by allowing the testimonies of those affected adversely by climate change to substantially inform theological discourses on climate justice. © 2020 by the author.

However, fine-grained spatiotemporal analysis of these policies’ effectiveness is lacking. This paper collected the hourly meteorological and PM2.5 data for three typical emission scenarios in Hubei, Beijing–Tianjin– Hebei (BTH), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Then, this study simulated the PM2.5 concentration under the same meteorological conditions and different emission scenarios based on a reliable hourly spatiotemporal random forest model (exceeded 0.84). Finally, we investigated the fine-grained spatiotemporal impact of restricting factories, vehicles, and fireworks on PM2.5 concentrations from the perspective of hours, days, regions, and land uses, excluding meteorological interference. On average, restricting factories and vehicles reduced the PM2.5 concentration at 02:00, 08:00, 14:00, and 20:00 by 18.57, 16.22, 25.00, and 19.07 μg/m, respectively. Spatially, it had the highest and quickest impact on Hubei, with a 27.05 μg/m decrease of PM2.5 concentration and 17 day lag to begin to show significant decline. This was followed by YRD, which experienced a 23.52 μg/m decrease on average and a 23 day lag. BTH was the least susceptible; the PM2.5 concentration decreased by only 8.2 μg/m. In addition, influenced by intensive human activities, the cultivated, urban, and rural lands experienced a larger decrease in PM2.5 concentration. These empirical results revealed that restricting factories, vehicles, and fireworks is effective in alleviating air pollution and the effect showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The policymakers should further investigate influential factors of hourly PM2.5 concentrations, combining with local geographical and social environment, and implement more effective and targeted policies to improve local air quality, especially for BTH and the air quality at morning and night. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; COVID-19; Particulate matter; Public health; Random forest","air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; environmental impact; exhaust emission; industrial emission; policy approach; policy making; pollution policy; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; concentration (parameter); environmental impact assessment; fire and fire related phenomena; fireworks; human impact (environment); industry; motor vehicle; particle size; rural area; simulation; social environment; spatiotemporal analysis; tillage; urban area; air pollutant; comparative study; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; legislation and jurisprudence; meteorology; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; theoretical model; China; Hubei; Jingjinji; Yangtze Delta; explosive; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Explosive Agents; Manufacturing and Industrial Facilities; Meteorology; Models, Theoretical; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087392063

In this context, a methodology, based on a single measurement campaign using a Remote Sensing Device (RSD), is presented in this work to assess the reduction in vehicles emissions obtained from implementing I/M programs. As a case study, an RSD campaign was carried out in Mexico, specifically in Monterrey’s Metropolitan Area (MMA). Approximately 0.4% of the vehicles registered in this region were sampled under similar conditions to those found in I/M programs. The results obtained suggested that 39% of the vehicles would not comply with the current national regulations for circulating vehicles. Following a conservative scenario, the implementation of a vehicle I/M program in this urban center has the potential of reducing the current mass emissions of HC, CO and NO in approximately 69%, 42% and 28%, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

On January 23 in Wuhan, and later in all other cities of the country, there were taken measures to control the spread of the virus through quarantine measures. This article focused on East China and attempted to assess comprehensively the environmental impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study analyzed satellite observational data of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the period before the outbreak of the epidemic and during the implementation of preventive measures and control of COVID-19, as well as compared it with the data obtained in the same period of 2019. The results of the analysis showed that the COVID-19 lockdown improved air quality in the short term, but as soon as coal consumption at power plants and refineries returned to normal levels due to the resumption of their work, pollution levels returned to their previous level. The levels of CO and NO2 showed the most significant decrease (20 and 30%), since they were mainly associated with a decrease in economic growth and transport restrictions that led to a change in energy consumption and a reduction in emissions.

While compact cities aim to reduce land consumption, densification puts pressure on the remaining green areas, influencing ecosystem services provision and ultimately the life quality of the growing urban population. Supply of and demand for urban ecosystem services differ however greatly across the globe. In this study, we derive a set of urban typologies and their related ecosystem services bundles in both a temperate and a tropical city. We show that the supply of urban ecosystem services does not increase linearly with green area coverage, but is highly dependent on the urban form. While the surface sealed by infrastructures and the buildings themselves play a key role in influencing ecosystem services provision, we observe that the share of trees is particularly important for supporting regulating ecosystem services in built up neighborhoods. With a similar average surface-to-volume ratio, open midrise neighborhoods in Singapore provide more water flow regulation and air pollution control services than the same urban typology in Zurich. Microclimate regulation, in contrast, does not seem to be dependent on the context, but more on the amount of built up surface. Interestingly, we observe that open midrise neighborhoods synergistically support the supply of many regulating services in both case study areas, including microclimate regulation, water flow regulation and air pollution control. Large water and forest patches are unquestionably essential in both Singapore and Zurich to support bundles of ecosystem services, particularly also for recreational activities.

Although meteorological conditions have always been considered key factors in the accumulation and dilution of PM2.5 pollution, their exact contribution to particulate pollution in Northeast China is still highly uncertain. Applying multiple regression analysis to observational data, we identify the wind speed, temperature inversion, and height of the planetary boundary layer as the dominant meteorological factors affecting PM2.5 pollution (PM2.5 &gt; 75 µg m–3) in the major cities of Northeast China, with the wind speed and the planetary boundary layer playing the primary roles in Harbin and Shenyang, and Changchun, respectively. Heavy pollution (PM2.5 &gt; 150 µg m–3) in this region typically occurs when the wind speed is less than 20 knots, the planetary boundary layer is below 500 m, and the temperature inversion is greater than 6°C. These results suggest that reducing the PM2.5 pollution requires us to focus not only on anthropogenic emissions but also on special meteorological conditions that can affect the air pollution mechanisms in Northeast China. © The Author(s).","Fine particulate (PM2.5) pollution; Multiple regression method; Planetary boundary layer height; Temperature inversion; Wind speed","Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Climatology; Coal combustion; Pollution; Regression analysis; Wind; Anthropogenic emissions; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Multiple regression analysis; Particulate pollution; Planetary boundary layers; Temperature inversions; Particles (particulate matter); anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; boundary layer; climate conditions; coal combustion; environmental factor; health impact; particulate matter; pollution effect; Changchun; China; Harbin; Heilongjiang; Jilin; Liaoning; Shenyang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087327015

Recent research, however, provides useful insight into multiple factors complicating the understanding of nutrient trends in bay tributaries, which we review in this paper, as we approach a 2025 total maximum daily load (TMDL) management deadline. Improvements in water quality in many streams are attributable to management actions that reduced point sources and atmospheric nitrogen deposition and to changes in climate. Nutrient reductions expected from management actions, however, have not been fully realized in watershed streams. Nitrogen from urban nonpoint sources has declined, although water-quality responses to urbanization in individual streams vary depending on predevelopment land use. Evolving agriculture, the largest watershed source of nutrients, has likely contributed to local nutrient trends but has not affected substantial changes in flux to the bay. Changing average nitrogen yields from farmland underlain by carbonate rocks, however, may suggest future trends in other areas under similar management, climatic, or other influences, although drivers of these changes remain unclear. Regardless of upstream trends, phosphorus flux to the bay from its largest tributary has increased due to sediment infill in the Conowingo Reservoir. In general, recent research emphasizes the utility of input reductions over attempts to manage nutrient fate and transport at limiting nutrients in surface waters. Ongoing research opportunities include evaluating effects of climate change and conservation practices over time and space and developing tools to disentangle and evaluate multiple influences on regional water quality.

This problem is specific for many Russian thermal power stations. Two alternatives of reequipment are considered: replacement of obsolete steam-turbine power units with a natural gas-fired combined cycle unit (CCU) and conversion of coal-fired power units into integrated gasification combined-cycle units (IGCCU) with gas turbines operating on purified synthesis gas. Technical reequipment of the considered TPS was performed by replacing the coal-fired steam-turbine power units of phase I–II with a 420 MW CCU. The CCU core was a 288 MW Siemens SGT5-4000F gas turbine. A CCU on its basis was modelled in the THERMOFLEX code. The calculated results demonstrated high power and environmental effectiveness in replacement of coal-fired power units at TPSs with natural gas-fired CCUs, thereby cutting down coal equivalent consumption by 727 000 t.c.e. (or 24%). For conversion of a TPS to an IGCCU, the fuel saving could be as great as 543 000 t.c.e./year (18%) under comparable conditions. In this case, the atmospheric emissions (of dust and SO2) could be decreased many times (by 99%) due to implementation of an effective gas treatment process in the gasification system. Due to the huge coal reserves in Russia, the conversion of coal-fired TPSs to modern technologies with coal gasification may be a promising alternative for many TPSs during their reconstruction. In addition, it will contribute to improving the country’s energy security. In addition, this will improve the country’s energy security. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","coal gasification; combined-cycle unit; equipment revamping; fuel and energy balance; natural gas; thermal power station","Air purification; Coal; Coal gasification; Energy security; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Light weight rolling stock; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Proven reserves; Steam turbines; Thermoelectric power plants; Atmospheric emission; Coal-fired power unit; Combined cycle units; District power station; Environmental effectiveness; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Natural gas fired combined cycle; Thermal power stations; Fossil fuel power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087197847

The use of such baselines is under increasing scrutiny, raising a wider question around the appropriate use of reference scenarios in mitigation analysis. In this Perspective, we assess three critical issues relevant to the use of reference scenarios, demonstrating how different policy contexts merit the use of different scenarios.

Therefore, this study quantified soil GHG emissions using static chambers for two maize cropping seasons (one full year) of four different soil amendments in the central highlands of Kenya. The four treatments were (i) animal manure, (ii) inorganic fertilizer, (iii) combined animal manure and inorganic fertilizer, and (iv) a no-N control (no amendment) laid out in a randomized complete block design. Cumulative annual soil fluxes (February 2017 to February 2018) ranged from −1.03 ± 0.19 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1 from the manure inorganic fertilizer treatment to −0.09 ± 0.03 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1 from the manure treatment, 1,391 ± 74 kg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1 from the control treatment to 3,574 ± 113 kg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1 from the manure treatment, and 0.13 ± 0.08 to 1.22 ± 0.12 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 in the control and manure treatments, respectively. Animal manure amendment produced the highest cumulative CO2 emissions (P &lt; 0.001), N2O emissions (P &lt; 0.001), and maize yields (P = 0.002) but the lowest N2O yield-scaled emission (YSE) (0.5 g N2O–N kg−1 grain yield).

Despite local studies conducted, no accurate and comprehensive results about agricultural soils of Iran entirely and regarding the climate have been observed regarding heavy metal concentration. Therefore, the present study is aimed at determining a reliable heavy metal concentration in agricultural soils and evaluate the effect of climate on the average concentrations. To provide harmonized and comparable data, 711 soil surface samples were randomly taken from all of the agricultural soils of Iran during 2016–2018. Also, to evaluate the effect of climate, samples were divided into three parts according to major climates of studied area. Results revealed that the average concentration of Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, and V in agricultural soils was 0.31, 101, 27.9, 37.2, 702, 68.0, 28.2, 73.0, and 101 mg/kg, respectively. The concentration of Cr, Ni, Co, V, and Pb in, respectively, 28.4, 11.3, 8.72, 1.60, and 1.34% of soil samples was higher than the national standard in contrast to the concentration of the other element, which was lower. There were no significant differences between the average concentrations of heavy metals in agricultural soils with respect of climate, indicating the minimum effects of soil forming factors on soil heavy metals. Comparing the mean concentration of heavy metals in three major climatic zones of the country, it seems that geochemistry is the key factor controlling the concentration of metals in agricultural soils of Iran. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anthropogenic activities; Climatic regions; Geogenic factors; Soil contamination","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climatology; Heavy metals; Soils; Agricultural soils; Anthropogenic activity; Average concentration; Climatic regions; Heavy metal concentration; Mean concentrations; National standard; Soil heavy metals; Soil pollution; agricultural soil; climate effect; concentration (composition); geochemistry; heavy metal; human activity; soil pollution; soil surface; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086895102

An important challenge, however, is that the nature of real diversification landscapes - curves or surfaces which describe the propensity of species-level lineages to diversify as a function of one or more traits - remains poorly understood. Here, we present a novel, time-stratified extension of the QuaSSE model in which speciation/extinction rate is specified as a static or temporally shifting Gaussian or skewed-Gaussian function of the diversification trait. We then use simulations to show that the generally imbalanced nature of real phylogenetic trees, as well as their generally greater than expected frequency of deep branching events, are typical outcomes when diversification is treated as a dynamic, trait-dependent process. Focusing on four basic models (Gaussian-speciation with and without background extinction; skewed-speciation; Gaussian-extinction), we also show that particular features of the species selection regime produce distinct tree shape signatures and that, consequently, a combination of tree shape metrics has the potential to reveal the species selection regime under which a particular lineage diversified. We evaluate this idea empirically by comparing the phylogenetic trees of plant lineages diversifying within climatically and geologically stable environments of the Greater Cape Floristic Region, with those of lineages diversifying in environments that have experienced major change through the Late Miocene-Pliocene. Consistent with our expectations, the trees of lineages diversifying in a dynamic context are less balanced, show a greater concentration of branching events close to the present, and display stronger diversification rate-trait correlations. We suggest that species selection plays an important role in shaping phylogenetic trees but recognize the need for an explicit probabilistic framework within which to assess the likelihoods of alternative diversification scenarios as explanations of a particular tree shape.

Soil communities could aid the plants’ shift into novel areas by harbouring fewer soil-borne antagonists or more mutualists that influence the fitness and stress tolerance of the shifting species. Alternatively, they could contain novel antagonists or fewer mutualists. Thus, soil communities could positively or negatively affect plant range expansion, particularly if they influence plants’ responses to climate, such as freeze tolerance, that feedback to affect expansion. We used the northward range expansion of the black mangrove, Avicennia germinans, into a system dominated by marsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, in northern Florida, USA to study how the novel soil environment (i.e. S. alterniflora soil) affects mangrove fitness, susceptibility to cold stress and the colonization of mutualist fungi. We quantified abundance of root mutualistic fungi in mixed marsh-mangrove habitat and conducted a laboratory experiment to test effects of steam-sterilized and live soils from A. germinans and S. alterniflora on the growth, condition, fungal colonization and freeze tolerance of A. germinans seedlings. In the field, we found two times higher dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonization of A. germinans roots and three times higher fungal spore density in A. germinans soil compared to S. alterniflora roots and soil. In the laboratory experiment, seedlings in steamed S. alterniflora soil treatments had 50%–65% survival after freezing, compared to 0% survival in treatments with live S. alterniflora soil. A. germinans live soil mixed with S. alterniflora steamed soil yielded A. germinans roots with the highest DSE colonization and seedlings with greater shoot biomass and lower root:shoot ratios. S. alterniflora live soil lowered the freeze tolerance of A. germinans, decreased mangrove survival and depressed DSE colonization. Synthesis. S. alterniflora soil could impede A. germinans establishment in salt marsh communities. As climate warming gradually allows A. germinans to displace S. alterniflora, the rhizosphere could become increasingly hospitable to A. germinans. Our work suggests the soil community associated with resident species mediates climatic stressors to affect expansion success. © 2020 British Ecological Society","allelopathy; biotic resistance; dark septate endophyte fungi; global change ecology; invasion ecology; plant–soil (below-ground) interactions; plant–soil feedbacks; salt marshes","antagonism; climate change; cold tolerance; colonization; endophyte; fitness; freezing; grass; mangrove; mutualism; range expansion; root-shoot ratio; saltmarsh; soil microorganism; soil property; Florida [United States]; United States; Avicennia germinans; Fungi; Spartina; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086632102

In Brazil, São Paulo and Rio the Janeiro, the two most populated cities in the country, were the first to determine social distancing. In this study, the impact of the social distancing measures on the concentrations of the three main primary air pollutants (PM10, NO2 and CO) was analyzed. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (up to 100%) since it is related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO2 also showed reductions (9.1%–41.8%) while PM10 levels were only reduced in the 1st lockdown week. The decrease of pollutants was not directly proportional to the vehicular flux reduction, because it depends on other factors such as the transport of air masses from industrial and rural areas. The differences observed can be explained considering the fleet characteristics in the two cities and the response of the population to the social distancing recommendations. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Atmospheric pollutants; Brazil; COVID-19; Lockdown; Social distancing","Nitrogen oxides; Flux reduction; Health systems; Light-duty; Megacities; Pm10 levels; Primary air; Primary pollutants; Vehicular emission; Pollution; air pollution; atmosphere; Betacoronavirus; Brazil; chemistry; city; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; epidemic; exhaust gas; human; legislation and jurisprudence; pandemic; particulate matter; virus pneumonia; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; Betacoronavirus; Brazil; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086472983

But, much is still unknown about (1) whether changes in political landscapes influence public’s climate beliefs and (2) the psychological process through which climate beliefs influence pro-environmental sentiments and actions. Achieving a better understanding these influences are the dual purposes of this paper, we investigated during the unique setting of the 2016 US presidential elections. First, we explored to what extent the American public’s belief in the anthropogenic origins and negative impacts of climate change were influenced by the 2016 US presidential election and earliest administrative days of a climate-skeptical political leader, Donald Trump. We found Trump’s influence on public climate beliefs may have increased after his election in such a way that may have polarized public climate beliefs. Compared with pre-election levels, supporters’ climate beliefs grew weaker and, further, opponents’ climate beliefs grew stronger after his election. Second, we tested a novel conditional mediation model that proposes climate beliefs interact to exert their influence on climate actions via moral behavioral sentiments. Specifically, we found people’s origin and impact climate beliefs interact to influence climate actions by activating moral sentiments about their own environmental behavior (i.e., guilt, striving to be a better person), with the particularly weak moral sentiments reported by those with both weak belief in climate change’s anthropogenic origins and its negative impacts. Moral sentiments, in turn, predicted respondents’ willingness to save energy to reduce climate change and their support for the Paris Climate Agreement. These results suggest the election of climate-skeptical political leaders can impact the public’s climate beliefs. Moreover, climate beliefs interact to influence the moral sentiments people feel about their own behavior, and consequently, influence their climate-friendly behavioral intentions and policy preferences. © 2020, The Author(s).","Behavioral intentions; Climate beliefs; Elections; Elite influence; Policy support","Climate models; Anthropogenic origin; Behavioral intention; Climate agreement; Environmental behavior; Influence on climate; Presidential election; Psychological process; Save energy; Climate change; action plan; climate change; climate effect; election; international agreement; perception; political ideology; political repression; psychology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086326578

It synthesizes and compares detailed national and sectoral deep decarbonization pathways (DDPs) to 2050 compatible with the Paris Agreement objectives and domestic development priorities in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru. The first five countries analysed in detail the energy system and agriculture, forestry and land use (AFOLU) at a high level, while Peru focussed on a detailed analysis of AFOLU given its predominance in its GHG emissions. While economy-wide results were produced, this paper focuses on the electricity, passenger transport, and AFOLU results because of their current emissions, potential to grow, and identification of successful strategies for decarbonization (e.g. switching to clean electricity and other net-zero emissions fuels across the economy; urban planning, mode shifting, and electrification in passenger transport; and intensive sustainable agriculture, assignment of land use rights and their enforcement and afforestation in AFOLU). It also highlights where significant emissions remain in 2050, notably in industry, AFOLU, freight, and oil and gas production, all areas for future research. It derives insights for the design of domestic policy packages and identifies priorities for international cooperation. This analysis provides critical information for Long-Term Strategies, Nationally Determined Contributions and Global Stocktaking in the context of the Paris Agreement. © 2020","AFOLU; Decarbonisation.; Decarbonization; Development; Energy; Pathways","Agricultural robots; Decarbonization; Economics; Gas emissions; Gas industry; International cooperation; Land use; Petroleum industry; Reforestation; Urban transportation; Clean electricity; Current emissions; Domestic policies; Latin americans; Long-term strategy; Oil and gas production; Passenger transport; Sustainable agriculture; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086302376

To meet this need, we developed an empirical model based on published field data for predicting N2O emission from rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) fields managed with inorganic N fertilizer in the United States and Canada. Nitrous oxide emissions ranged widely on an area basis (0.03–32.9 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and a yield-scaled basis (0.006–4.8 kg N Mg−1 grain yr−1). We evaluated multiple modeling approaches and variables using three metrics of model fit (Akaike information criteria corrected for small sample sizes [AICc], RMSE, and R2). Our model explains 32.8% of the total observed variation and 50% of observed site-level variation. Soil clay content was very important for predicting N2O emission and predicting the change in N2O emission due to a change in N balance, with the addition of a clay fixed effect explaining 37% of site-level variation. Sites with higher clay content showed greater reductions in N2O emission for a given reduction in N balance. Therefore, high-clay sites are particularly important targets for reducing N2O emissions. Our linear mixed model is more suitable for predicting the effect of improved N management on N2O emission in maize fields than other published models because it (a) requires only input data readily available on working farms, (b) is derived from field observations, (c) correctly represents differences among sites using a mixed modeling approach, and (d) includes soil texture because it strongly influences N2O emissions. © 2020 The Authors.

Municipal solid waste generation potential and methane generation potential from landfills of each of the districts were estimated from 2019 to 2038. Economic viability analysis of landfill gas to energy project based on Net Present Value, Levelized Cost of Energy, and Payback Period was conducted. Besides, environmental impact analysis based on greenhouse gas emissions potential was evaluated. Key results indicate that the generation potential of municipal solid waste during the project period is 55,000 to 2,120,000 tons/year. Chaoyang district has the highest municipal solid waste generation potential, while lower municipal solid waste generation potential was observed in Mentougou district. It is also found that Chaoyang district had the highest electricity generation potential of 8,400,000 to 218,300,000 kWh/year. Findings of the economic feasibility analysis show that landfill gas to energy project is viable in all the districts. However, the project is highly viable in Chaoyang district with more positive net present value ($181,100,000), shorter payback period (1.3years), and lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0613/kWh). Greenhouse gas emission potential of landfill gas without energy recovery was the highest in all the districts. It was realized that landfill gas with energy recovery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 72.3% in all the districts. This paper will provide scientific guidance for investment in landfill gas to energy projects in Beijing municipality and other municipalities of China. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Economy; Electricity; Environment; Landfill gas; Municipal solid waste; Technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086119622

However, the process being highly endothermic, requires burning of fossil fuels to meet its heat demand leading to considerable CO2 emission. Therefore, in the present study, a novel eco-friendly scheme for propylene production has been proposed for the first time that integrates ODP−CO2 with chemical looping combustion (CLC) and it has the dual benefit of inherent CO2 capture as well as its utilization. Further, the process is made self-sustained by recovering surplus heat and generating steam for power generation. Steady state plant wide simulation model of integrated CLC-ODP−CO2 scheme is developed using ASPEN plus software. Rigorous sensitivity analysis has been performed to optimize the operating temperature, pressure and molar flowrates of oxygen carrier, CO2 and propane resulting a maximum propylene yield of 79.1 %.

Additionally, due to the high fuel price and the introduction of stringent emission regulations for diesel engines, the reduction of fuel consumption while persevering the existing performance is the current demand. In order to satisfy and maximize the above requirements, different hydraulic system architectures have been developed during the last decades. Both academia and industry have been investing considerable resources delivering numerous outcomes that require a classification. This review paper closes this gap by analyzing and classifying the working hydraulics of nonhybrid, valve-controlled mobile machines starting from the 1980s to the state of the art. Hydraulic layouts are addressed and categorized by both discussing their fundamentals and evolutions, and by pointing out their pros and cons in a way to provide the readers with a comprehensive overview of the systems currently available on the market and at the research stage.

However, we know little about the spatial variation of SOC accumulation and persistence along a topographic gradient and the controlling processes. Here, we assessed the spatial variation of SOC and its composition along a topographic gradient in a humid mountain forest. The variables associated with environmental factors, topographical traits, carbon input from plants, and soil physico-chemical properties were analyzed to assess their contributions. Results showed that both SOC and mineral-bound organic carbon (MOC) contents were comparable among the topographic positions (ridge, middle slope, lower slope and valley). However, particulate organic carbon (POC) content decreased significantly from ridge to valley. Our measured environmental variables explained 67%, 74% and 77% of the variations in SOC contents for 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm and 20–40 cm soils, respectively. Soil physico-chemical properties (including pH and soil reactive Fe/Al oxides) were the main driver on SOC and MOC variations. In contrast, the variation in POC was more explained by topographical traits and carbon input. We also observed significantly lower SOC stability for ridge soil than valley soil. The significant topographic patterns for SOC fraction and SOC stability suggested that the soil carbon cycling processes were dependent on landscape positions. Future carbon budget and carbon dynamic researches in the humid sloping landscapes should take into account the topographic effects, especially for the free and light carbon fractions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon fractions; Carbon stability; Carbon storage; Chemical association; Particulate organic carbon; Topographic position","carbon budget; environmental factor; landscape; montane forest; particulate organic carbon; physicochemical property; soil carbon; spatial variation; subtropical region; topography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086044258

Herein, ultrathin and small-size graphene oxide (USGO) nanosheets are constructed and employed as the electron mediator to elaborately exploit an efficient CsPbBr3-based all-solid-state Z-scheme system in combination with α-Fe2O3 for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction with water as the electron source. CsPbBr3 and α-Fe2O3 can be closely anchored on USGO nanosheets, owing to the existence of interfacial strong chemical bonding behaviors, which can significantly accelerate the photogenerated carrier transfer between CsPbBr3 and α-Fe2O3. The resultant improved charge separation efficiency endows the Z-scheme system exhibiting a record-high electron consumption rate of 147.6 µmol g−1 h−1 for photocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion concomitant with stoichiometric O2 from water oxidation, which is over 19 and 12 times higher than that of pristine CsPbBr3 nanocrystals and the mixture of CsPbBr3 and α-Fe2O3, respectively.

This alternative, I argue, involves epistemological issues of how to interrogate ‘the urban’ as assemblages that constitutively draw together the near and the faraway, as well as more practical issues of mobile, multisited, and comparative urban research methods. Empirically, I compare the ways in which urban actors stage global climate risks on the waterfronts of four world cities – Hong Kong, Rotterdam, Yokohama and Copenhagen – to argue that such a comparative tactic of variable ‘riskscapes’ helps situate Ulrich Beck's notion of urban cosmopolitan risk communities more thoroughly into urban studies. In such ways, I suggest, Beck's methodological cosmopolitanism is germane to studying ongoing and far ranging transformation in world political geography, in which transurban networks, communities, and governance arrangements come to complement nation-state centred institutions. Such conclusions must be tempered, however, by the deployment of Beck's equally strong impetus towards comparative attention to the varieties of second modernity; and doing so, I conclude, aligns well with ongoing transformations in urban studies itself. © 2019 Global Networks Partnership & John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CLIMATE RISKS; COMPARATIVE TACTICS; EAST ASIA; EUROPE; METHODOLOGICAL COSMOPOLITANISM; URBAN STUDIES","Computer networks; Social aspects; COMPARATIVE TACTICS; East Asia; EUROPE; METHODOLOGICAL COSMOPOLITANISM; Urban studies; Social sciences; adaptive management; climate change; comparative study; empirical analysis; global climate; methodology; mitigation; risk assessment; urban area; urban climate; China; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hong Kong; Honshu; Hovedstaden; Japan; Kanagawa; Kanto; Netherlands; Rotterdam; South Holland; Yokohama",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086010814

However, acclimation can produce trade-offs due to links between related physiological traits. Water loss and gas exchange are intrinsically linked by the need for respiratory surfaces to remain moist. As climates warm and dry, organisms may attempt to lower desiccation risk by limiting water loss but at a cost of inhibiting their ability to breathe. Here we used laboratory experiments to evaluate the trade-off between water loss and gas exchange in a fully terrestrial, lungless salamander (Plethodon metcalfi). We measured acclimation of resistance to water loss and metabolic rates in response to long-term exposure to temperature and humidity treatments. We then integrated the trade-off into a simulation-based species distribution model to determine the consequences of ignoring physiological trade-offs on energy balance and aerobic scope under climate change. In the laboratory, we found a close association between acclimation of resistance to water loss and metabolic rates indicative of a trade-off. After incorporating the trade-off into our simulations, we found that energy balance and aerobic scope were reduced by 49.7% and 34.3%, respectively, under contemporary climates across their geographic range. Under future warming scenarios, incorporating the trade-off lowered the number of sites predicted to experience local extirpation by 52.2% relative to simulations without the trade-off; however, the number of sites capable of supporting the energetic requirements for reproduction declined from 44.6% to 32.6% across the species' geographic range. These experiments and simulations suggest that salamanders can maintain positive energy balance across their geographic range under climate change despite the costs associated with trade-offs between water loss and gas exchange.","acclimation; climate change; gas exchange; mechanistic species distribution models; metabolism; trade-offs; water loss","acclimatization; animal; Caudata; climate change; ecosystem; energy metabolism; oxygen consumption; physiology; thermoregulation; Acclimatization; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Energy Metabolism; Oxygen Consumption; Urodela; Water Loss, Insensible",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086008563

The disease has spread in almost every part of the world and has been declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by World Health Organization (WHO). The corona virus outbreak has emerged as one of the deadliest pandemics of all time in human history. The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has forced several countries of the world to observe complete lockdown forcing people to live in their homes. India also faced the phase of total lockdown for 21 days (in first phase) to avoid the spread of coronavirus to the maximum possible extent. This lockdown impacted the pollution levels of environment and improved air and water quality in the short span owing to very less human activities. The present work scientifically analyzed the available data for primary air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO) from two major Indian cities, Lucknow and New Delhi. The analysis was based on air quality data for before lockdown and after lockdown (first phase of 21 days) periods of 21 days each. The results showed significant decline in the studied air pollution indices and demonstrated improvement of air quality in both the cities. The major impact was seen in the levels of PM2.5, NO2 and CO. The levels of SO2 showed less significant decline during the lockdown period. The results are presented with future perspectives to mitigate air pollution in near future by adopting the short and periodical lockdown as a tool. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Air quality; COVID-19; Lockdown; PM2.5","Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Viruses; Water pollution; Water quality; Air pollution index; Air quality data; Future perspectives; Human activities; New Delhi , India; Pollution level; Viral disease; World Health Organization; Pollution control; air pollutant; city; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; human activities; India; pandemic; particulate matter; virus pneumonia; Air Pollutants; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Human Activities; Humans; India; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085937266

We use the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and the Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) to quantify effects of three potential emission abatement policies in the USA. The policies impose emission fees designed to internalize externalities associated with ozone and particulate matter (PM) pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. A business as usual case is compared to policies in which fees are applied to energy sector emissions of health impacting pollutants: NOx, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and/or greenhouse gases: CO2 and CH4. Net policy benefits are calculated by summing the health and climate benefits and subtracting the increased energy system cost. For comparison with the detailed model results, benefits are also estimated by the simplified approach of multiplying emission changes by fixed estimates of health damages per ton of emissions. Annual net benefits in 2045 are $173 billion with health-related fees and $116 billion with climate-based fees. A combined policy, with fees on emissions of both greenhouse gases (GHG) and health impacting pollutants, has annual net benefits of $189 billion in 2045. Co-benefits are unevenly distributed. Health benefits of GHG fees are only 40% as large as health benefits from air quality fees. Climate benefits of health fees are 87% as large as those from climate-based fees. Thus, each policy has comparable climate benefits, but air quality and corresponding health improvements are smaller when not specifically targeted. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality; Damages; Energy; Health benefits","air quality; comparative study; future prospect; greenhouse gas; particulate matter; pollution policy; public health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085887129

However, it is still challenging to deliberately create high-density homogeneous topological defects in carbon networks due to the high formation energy. Toward this end, an efficient NH3 thermal-treatment strategy is presented for thoroughly removing pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N dopants from N-enriched porous carbon particles, to create high-density topological defects. The resultant topological defects are systematically investigated by near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure measurements and local density of states analysis, and the defect formation mechanism is revealed by reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Notably, the as-prepared porous carbon materials possess an enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, yielding a current density of 2.84 mA cm−2 with Faradaic efficiency of 95.2% for CO generation. Such a result is among the best performances reported for metal-free CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the edge pentagonal sites are the dominating active centers with the lowest free energy (ΔG) for CO2 reduction. This work not only presents deep insights for the defect engineering of carbon-based materials but also improves the understanding of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on carbon defects. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Alternative powertrain technologies include compressed (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) engines, hybrid electric diesel, battery electric (BE), and hydrogen fuel cell (HFC). Future policies, economic factors, and availability of fueling and charging infrastructure are input assumptions to the proposed modeling framework. Powertrain technology adoption, vehicle utilization, and resulting CO2 emissions predictions for a hypothetical, representative regional highway network are illustrated. A design of experiments (DOE) is used to quantify sensitivity of adoption outcomes to variation in vehicle performance parameters, fuel costs, economic incentives, and fueling and charging infrastructure considerations.

Case studies and experimental observations demonstrated that vegetation coverage and type of plants affect PM and air quality. Condensation of PM2.5 has an impressive effect on deteriorating air quality. Increasing vegetation coverage has a significant impact on reducing PM2.5. However, the requirement percent vegetation cover (PVC) is likewise a shadow for careful analysis to recommend the requirement percent and area of vegetation for different parts of the metropolitan. In this paper, we propose a four-phase intelligent algorithm for investigating PM2.5 and critical situations to detect unhealthy air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs). Our algorithm makes a decision based on fuzzy and neural network methods and recommends the percent density and area of vegetation. Our analysis of the weather condition is event-driven, considering rainfall as an event to examine the situation of each AQMS before and after rainfall. The experiments demonstrate reducing PM2.5 &gt; 150 to PM2.5 &lt; 50 using recommending PVC of approximately 20–74%. We achieved these results by periodically estimating and evaluating weather conditions in the autumn and winter as two critical seasons of the year. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality monitoring station (AQMS); Neural network; Percent vegetation cover (PVC) fuzzy system; Recommender algorithm; Vegetation density","air quality; algorithm; climate conditions; metropolitan area; particulate matter; rainfall; seasonal variation; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085701552

Organic amendments are sometimes used during wetland creation. To evaluate the effectiveness of adding organic amendments we used a combined numerical method to assign “scores” on five categories of evaluation metrics: plant growth, soil properties, carbon accrual, denitrification, and anaerobic processes (e.g. redox potential). We found that amendments identified as “topsoil” scored measurably higher and had consistently more positive values with fewer negative results compared to amendments identified as “allochthonous organic matter” (alOM). Organic amendments had about the same effect on soils with low soil organic carbon (<2.5%) compared to soils richer in organic carbon. Organic amendments are not uniformly effective, and in some cases may have negative side effects. For example, alOM often resulted in a loss of plant diversity. These outcomes along with site conditions should be evaluated before using organic amendments. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration","organic amendments; topsoil; wetland restoration","anoxic conditions; denitrification; environmental restoration; growth response; numerical method; plant community; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil property; wetland",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085685700

Suboptimal urban and transport planning has led to e.g. high levels of air pollution and noise, heat island effects and lack of green space and physical activity and thereby an increase in morbidity and premature mortality. How can better urban and transport planning improve public health? Methods: A narrative meta-review around a number of cutting edge and visionary studies and practices on how to improve public health through better urban and transport planning reported in the literature and from meetings over the past few years. Results: We describe the latest quantitative evidence of how cities can become healthier through better urban and transport planning. It focuses and provides evidence for important interventions, policies and actions that can improve public health, including the need for land use changes, reduce car dependency and move towards public and active transportation, greening of cities, visioning, citizen involvement, collaboration, leadership and investment and systemic approaches. Health impact assessment studies have recently provided new powerful quantitative evidence on how to make cities healthier and will be used as examples. At the same time these measures make also our cities more sustainable (i.e. carbon neutral) and liveable creating multiple benefits. Conclusion: Better urban and transport planning can lead to carbon neutral, more liveable and healthier cities, particularly through land use changes, a move from private motorised transportation to public and active transportation and greening of cities. © 2020 The Author","Air pollution; Carbon neutral; Cities; Green space; Healthy; Liveability; Noise; Physical activity; Sustainability; Temperature; Transport planning; Urban planning","Carbon; Economics; Land use; Motor transportation; Public health; Active transportations; Citizen involvement; Health impact assessment; Heat island effect; Physical activity; Premature mortality; Systemic approach; Transport planning; Urban transportation; carbon; carbon; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; morbidity; physical activity; traffic emission; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation policy; urban transport; climate resilience; environmental policy; green chemistry; health impact assessment; land use; leadership; priority journal; public health; quantitative analysis; Review; traffic and transport; urban area; air pollution; city; city planning; heat; urban health; Air Pollution; Carbon; Cities; City Planning; Hot Temperature; Urban Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085683193

Ideally, it is desired to charge EVs from a low- or no-carbon energy source to ensure that the emissions avoided from driving EVs outweigh incremental emissions resulting from the power sector. To that end, this paper quantifies the net carbon emissions associated with EV deployment in Saudi Arabia by considering the energy mix. A model characterizing the Saudi Power System was built, and a total of 18 scenarios were simulated using the marginal generation emission method. The scenarios varied driving ranges, EV efficiencies, and time of charging for passenger transportation. Situations representing best- and worst-case scenarios were also run. On average, for each 1 % of EV deployed, emissions would reduce by 0.5 %, while at the best-case scenario emissions reduce by 0.9 %. The worst-case scenario, however, results in a net increase in emissions. Further, given that the marginal generator for the most part in the various regions of the kingdom does not change, it was found that adopting a time-of-use pricing mechanism would not promote emission reduction. © 2020 The Author(s)","Carbon emissions; Electric vehicles; Power model; Saudi Arabia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085575344

However, one of the greatest challenges for this technology implementation is the opposition from the population living near the potential sites. Despite the Brazilian geological potential for carbon dioxide injection, research investigating social site characterization or CCS public perception is almost non-existent in Brazil. Thus, this research aims to address this gap and analyze social factors driving CCS perception of the population living near potential sites in the Recôncavo Basin, state of Bahia, this being one of the first steps for social site characterization. Fifty-seven interviews were carried out near 10 CCS potential injection fields, focusing on questions about climate change knowledge, people's previous relationship with oil exploration, trust in public and private stakeholders, belief in citizens’ influence and CCS perception. The results showed that the previous history of the community with oil companies is an important factor influencing people's perception of private companies in general and CCS projects in particular. Another relevant social factor is the sense of empowerment in some communities that may respond with riots and obstruction of the project if they feel harmed by the companies.

We characterized the aboveground and belowground communities in two boreal peatlands: a Sphagnum-dominated fen and a Carex-dominated fen. We link the plant and microbial communities by observing plant, litter and peat carbon and nitrogen values. The Sphagnum-dominated fen had greater plant diversity but provided low quality litter inputs (high carbon:nitrogen) that formed peat and that corresponded with greater fungi:bacteria and Gram-positive:Gram-negative bacteria microbial community compared to the Carex-dominated fen. The higher quality plant inputs in the Carex-dominated fen supported a 5 × greater microbial biomass that was also 2 × more active (as measure by CO2 production). In this approach we highlight that peatlands and their component plant and microbial communities play-out along a common resource-spectrum that dictates ‘fast’ vs ‘slow’ carbon and nutrient cycling (i.e., a plant–soil interaction spectrum) that can, in turn, affect carbon storage potential.

Most fires accidentally ignite from mismanaged swidden and pasture fires. We provide evidence that fire risk in the Brazilian Amazon, the world's largest remaining tropical forest, perpetuates low yield and environmentally degrading agricultural activities. Using a combination of household interviews and remotely sensed data on fire occurrence in Eastern Amazon municipalities of Paragominas and Santarém, we show that smallholders in consolidated farm-forest frontier regions are locked into a vicious cycle that inhibits their adoption of fire-free practices. Households that invest in more capital-intensive fire-free agricultural technologies experience greater revenue losses from escaped fires than non-fire users. Changes in revenues are as sensitive to these fire impacts as they are to changes in physical capital investments. To overcome this fire-poverty trap, a “big push” of coordinated local incentives is needed. Policies mitigating fire risk may achieve a triple-win that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, forest degradation, and fosters inclusive economic development. © 2020 The Authors","Brazilian Amazon; climate change mitigation; fires; land use policy; sustainable development; tropical forests","agricultural land; biodiversity; capital provision; carbon emission; disaster management; fire history; greenhouse gas; investment incentive; pasture; smallholder; tropical forest; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Para [Brazil]; Paragominas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085329080

We use an ensemble approach to quantify and attribute process-level uncertainty in C-cycle projections by analysing a 30-member ensemble representing published alternative representations of key N cycle processes (stoichiometry, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and ecosystem N losses) within the framework of one terrestrial biosphere model. Despite large differences in the simulated present-day N cycle, primarily affecting simulated productivity north of 40°N, ensemble members generally conform with global C-cycle benchmarks for present-day conditions. Ensemble projections for two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) show that the increase in land C storage due to CO2 fertilization is reduced by 24 ± 15% due to N constraints, whereas terrestrial C losses associated with climate change are attenuated by 19 ± 20%. As a result, N cycling reduces projected land C uptake for the years 2006–2099 by 19% (37% decrease to 3% increase) for RCP 2.6, and by 21% (40% decrease to 9% increase) for RCP 8.5. Most of the ensemble spread results from uncertainty in temperate and boreal forests, and is dominated by uncertainty in BNF (10% decrease to 50% increase for RCP 2.6, 5% decrease to 100% increase for RCP 8.5). However, choices about the flexibility of ecosystem C:N ratios and processes controlling ecosystem N losses regionally also play important roles. The findings of this study demonstrate clearly the need for an ensemble approach to quantify likely future terrestrial C–N cycle trajectories. Present-day C-cycle observations only weakly constrain the future ensemble spread, highlighting the need for better observational constraints on large-scale N cycling, and N cycle process responses to global change. © 2020 The Authors.

However, most of our understanding of how C:N ratios modulate microbial growth comes from short-term growth assays under controlled conditions. Methods: Four levels of N additions including control (CK, 0 kg·hm− 2·a− 1), low N (LN, 50 kg·hm− 2·a− 1), medium N (MN, 100 kg·hm− 2·a− 1), and high N (HN, 150 kg·hm− 2·a− 1) inputs were applied monthly in a pine forest (Pinus tabulaeformis). Three C management practices were further conducted in each N additions plot, namely aboveground litter and belowground root removal (LRR), aboveground litter removal (LR), and intact soils (non-removal, NR). Soil bacterial richness, diversity, community composition and soil properties were measured. Results: MN and HN significantly increased the relative abundance of copiotrophic taxa, but decreased that of oligotrophic taxa. Bacterial richness and diversity were not altered by N enrichment. LRR significantly increased the relative abundance of Gemmatimonadetes while decreased that of Actinobacteria. C management did not affect bacterial richness and community structure but LR significantly decreased bacterial diversity. Structural equation modeling showed that N addition induced the decrease in soil pH was responsible for the changes in the bacterial community structure. C management exhibited a direct negative effect on bacterial diversity and had an indirect positive effect on it via increasing soil moisture and microbial biomass C:N ratio. Conclusions: The findings highlight the contrasting impacts of N addition and C management on soil bacterial communities and emphasize the regulation of above- and below-ground C substrate supplies on the N responses of soil bacterial communities. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aboveground litter removal; Bacterial diversity; Bacterial richness; Community structure; Nitrogen addition; Root removal; Soil microbial biomass C:N ratio","bacterium; community response; community structure; coniferous tree; management practice; microbial community; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil moisture; soil nitrogen; species richness; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gemmatimonadetes; Pinus tabuliformis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085288502

To evaluate the effects of nutrient reduction on phytoplankton, long-term monitoring data for Lake Wuli from 1998 to 2017 were analyzed. After the restoration since 2003, nitrogen decreased significantly from 8 to 2 mg/l until 2008 and then remained stable until 2017, while total phosphorus declined progressively from 0.2 mg/l to approximately 0.08 mg/l during 2003 and 2017. Biological data indicated that phytoplankton biovolume decreased after restoration until 2010 and then increased slightly from 2010 to 2017, mainly due to increasing of cyanobacterial biovolume. The dominant taxa shifted from cryptophyta to cyanobacteria since 2009. The results of both nonmetric multidimensional scaling and random forest regression showed that changes in nutrients, especially decreases in nitrogen, were the main drivers for phytoplankton community variation and increasing of cyanobacterial biovolume to the total phytoplankton biovolume ratio in summer and autumn. In addition to nutrients reduction, climatic variables such as wind speed decrease also played vital roles in increasing of cyanobacterial dominance in Lake Wuli. Our study confirmed that phytoplankton community respond strongly to nitrogen reduction in the subtropics and that climate change mediates the response. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cyanobacterial bloom; Global warming; Lake restoration; NMDS; Shallow lakes","climate change; community dynamics; cyanobacterium; dominance; lacustrine environment; nitrogen; nitrogen fixation; nutrient dynamics; phytoplankton; pollution monitoring; water quality; China; Jiangsu; Taihu Lake; Wuli Lake; Cryptophyta; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085287835

However, reliable evaluations of C and N dynamics in secondary grasslands across regional climatic gradient remain challenging. Methods: We investigated natural 13C and 15N abundance in plants and soil as well as their associations with environmental factors (including climatic, plant and edaphic variables) from 20 sites across a 600 km climatic gradient in secondary grasslands of southern China. Results: The δ13C values in plants and soil declined with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) but increased as the mean annual temperature (MAT) increased. These changes were mostly attributed to the shift in plant functional group between C4 and C3.

Even low levels common to millions of Americans pose health risks. However, no study has tested protective measures such as in-home portable air cleaners (PACs) among at-risk cardiac patients. We conducted a pilot phase of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Air Filter Trial (CRAFT) - a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation patients at Michigan Medicine. Methods: During a routine visit, patients were provided with 2 PACs to run continuously for 5 d in both the bedroom and the main living space. PACs were randomized as active (with HEPA filter) versus sham. On day 4, subjects wore a personal PM2.5monitor for 24-hr without activity restrictions. After a 1-wk washout, patients crossed over to the opposite mode. Results: Patients (n = 20; 4 women) were elderly (70.8 ± 9.6 yr) nonsmokers with cardiovascular disease living near the facility (10.7 ± 6.0 mi). Compared with sham, active in-home PAC use significantly lowered personal-level 24-hr PM2.5exposures by 43.8% (-12.2 μg·m-3; 95% CI, -24.2 to -0.2). Sensitivity analyses corroborated the reductions in most patients. Conclusion: An inexpensive in-home PAC can effectively lower personal PM2.5exposures in cardiac patients. These benefits occurred even in a region with overall good air quality and if maintained over the long-term could translate into major reductions in cardiovascular events. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Understanding the changes that the electrification of transport will bring is crucial for developing sustainable policies for net zero goals and a just transition. A literature is emerging to analyse the impact of a large-scale penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), but generally limiting focus to the implications for the electricity network. In this paper, we aim to provide insight on the wider energy system impacts of the expected EV rollout in the UK, in terms of fuel changes, energy costs, CO2 emission reduction and network investments; and how different EV charging strategies increase or mitigate the impacts of the expected large-scale penetration of EVs. Results show that non-smart and/or decentralised charging will require considerably larger investments on the network to accommodate new EV demand. Network reinforcement costs are passed to the consumer via increased electricity prices and, albeit reduced, emissions shift from the transport to the power sector. These results show the importance of considering the whole energy system and the wider economy, to avoid carbon leakage and to maximise the effectiveness of policies. © 2020","Electric vehicles; Energy cost; Energy policy; Energy system models; Network investments","Carbon; Cost reduction; Economics; Emission control; CO2 emission reduction; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity networks; Electricity prices; Local pollutions; Network investment; Network reinforcements; Sustainable policies; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085261600

In recent years, machine learning has been one of the most advanced techniques in SM spatial downscaling. The performance of a machine learning technique in SM spatial downscaling varies with the algorithm and the underlying surface; however, despite the importance of machine learning for SM downscaling, there are still only few inter-comparisons, particularly over different surfaces. In this study, the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms in downscaling the ECV (the Essential Climate Variable Program initiated by the European Space Agency) SM dataset was validated over different underlying surfaces. Six machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian (BAYE), classification and regression trees (CART), K nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were implemented to establish the spatial downscaling models with reliable continuous in-situ SM observations over four case study areas, including the Okalahoma Mesonet (OKM) in North America, Naqu network (NAN) in the Tibetan Plateau, REMEDHUS (REM) network in northeast Spain, and OZNNET (OZN) in southeast Australia. The land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), albedo, digital elevation model (DEM), and geographic coordinates were the explanatory variables, and their contributions to the downscaling models over different surfaces were quantified. The conclusions of the experiments can be summarized as follows: (1) The RF achieved excellent performance with a high correlation coefficient and a low regression error. The BAYE and KNN also demonstrated favorable capabilities for SM downscaling; however, the robustness of their algorithms needed further improvements. Numerous abnormal values were obtained in the scale-down process by the ANN, CART, and SVM methods, suggesting their comparative inadequacy in SM downscaling. (2) Downscaled 1-km resolution SM in REM generally presented a close correlation with the in-situ measurements, and its bias was larger than that in the other three regions. Comparatively, the smallest bias with the second highest correlation was found in the OZN region. It was primarily deduced that regions that located in one single climate zone and had mild topography variation and medium vegetation coverage tended to produce high-accuracy results. (3) The feature importance index (FII) calculated by the RF model revealed that the DEM, daytime LST, and NDVI were dominant during reconstruction, particularly DEM in a study region with a large height difference. The specific FII of each independent variable varied remarkably across the different case study areas, probably owing to the complex hydrothermal as well as physical geography conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that the RF model outperforms the other models considered herein; furthermore, the effect of the FII of the variables over different underlying surfaces was demonstrated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Downscaling; ECV soil moisture; Machine learning; Underlying surface","Decision trees; Land surface temperature; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Object oriented programming; Soil moisture; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Surveying; Topography; Vegetation; Classification and regression tree; Correlation coefficient; Digital elevation model; Geographic coordinates; High spatial resolution; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning techniques; Normalized difference vegetation index; Learning algorithms; algorithm; comparative study; correlation; data set; digital elevation model; downscaling; machine learning; NDVI; soil moisture; spatial analysis; surface temperature; Australia; China; North America; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085258597

The lack of relevant information to anticipate coping measures has exacerbated impacts leading to climate adaptation failure in most parts. In this regard, the current research paper has collected important datasets with an objective to assess the impact of extreme drought events on household’s livelihoods for better understanding impacts, local people’s perception, and the changes on vegetation cover in order to support a robust adaptation strategy to drought. The study conducted a household survey and collected satellite data for comparative analysis. The first survey was conducted in 2013 to collect data from 465 household heads through a structured questionnaire. Supplementary focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted in 2018 to collect qualitative information from targeted respondents such as village leaders and members of other key groups including women and youth. Descriptive statistics and correlation coefficient matrix were used to characterize the impact on households’ main livelihoods and logistic regression to predict people’s perception on pasture depletion over the last 20 years. Satellite data were used to derive spectral vegetation of land covers and unsupervised classification indexes. Both individual survey and focus group discussions identified drought as the main climate constraint which reduced crop production, water and pastures. The logistic analysis revealed that if the respondent’s major occupation is livestock, the probability to perceive a depletion of pasture will increase by 28%. Concurrently, the satellite image observation in perfect agreement with the field survey showed 6.78% and 6.01% losses of water surface and vegetation cover respectively between 1986 and 2016 in the study area. These findings showed that logistic regression coupled with satellite information can inform on past and future impacts which are extremely crucial for sound adaptation planning in the Sahel region. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation strategy; Climate disturbance; Household survey; Logistic regression; Sahel region; Satellite imagery","adaptive management; assessment method; climate effect; coping strategy; drought; extreme event; field survey; household survey; livelihood; livestock farming; questionnaire survey; satellite imagery; strategic approach; vegetation cover; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; adolescent; Africa; agriculture; animal; climate; climate change; female; human; questionnaire; satellite imagery; Adolescent; Africa, Western; Agriculture; Animals; Climate; Climate Change; Female; Humans; Satellite Imagery; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085153608

Owing to their mass imbalance, they have sequestered huge amounts of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. Although recent syntheses have filled some knowledge gaps, the extent and remoteness of many peatlands pose challenges to developing reliable regional carbon accumulation estimates from observations. In this work, we employed an individual- and patch-based dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) with peatland and permafrost functionality to quantify long-term carbon accumulation rates in northern peatlands and to assess the effects of historical and projected future climate change on peatland carbon balance. We combined published datasets of peat basal age to form an up-to-date peat inception surface for the pan-Arctic region which we then used to constrain the model. We divided our analysis into two parts, with a focus both on the carbon accumulation changes detected within the observed peatland boundary and at pan-Arctic scale under two contrasting warming scenarios (representative concentration pathway—RCP8.5 and RCP2.6). We found that peatlands continue to act as carbon sinks under both warming scenarios, but their sink capacity will be substantially reduced under the high-warming (RCP8.5) scenario after 2050. Areas where peat production was initially hampered by permafrost and low productivity were found to accumulate more carbon because of the initial warming and moisture-rich environment due to permafrost thaw, higher precipitation and elevated CO2 levels. On the other hand, we project that areas which will experience reduced precipitation rates and those without permafrost will lose more carbon in the near future, particularly peatlands located in the European region and between 45 and 55°N latitude. Overall, we found that rapid global warming could reduce the carbon sink capacity of the northern peatlands in the coming decades. © 2020 The Authors.

This research assessed the technical, practical and financial feasibility of using grass harvested from road verges as a feedstock in farm-fed anaerobic digestion (AD) plants. The methane potential (191 mL CH4 gDM−1) and digestion characteristics of verge grass were similar to those of current farm feedstocks; indicating suitability for AD. Ensiling had no significant impact on the biomethane generated. Testing co-digestions of verge grass with current farm feedstocks showed enhanced methane yields, suggesting that verge grass could be a valuable addition to AD feedstock mixes. In a case study of the UK county of Lincolnshire, potential volumes and locations of verge grass biomass were estimated, with capacities and locations of existing AD plants, to assess the potential to supply practical grass volumes. Grass harvesting costs were modelled and compared with other feedstock costs. Finally, the attitudes of AD operators to using verge grass were investigated to understand whether a market for verge grass exists. In a small survey all operators were willing to use it as a feedstock and most were prepared to pay over the estimated harvesting cost. If verge grass was legally recognised as a waste product it could be attractive to AD operators especially where financial incentives to use waste feedstocks are in place. In rural areas, verge grass could be harvested and co-digested by existing farm-fed AD plants, potentially reducing the cost of road verge maintenance and increasing biodiversity. © 2020 The Authors","Anaerobic digestion; Biomass; Grass; Verge","Biodiversity; Feedstocks; Forestry; Harvesting; Methane; Roads and streets; Energy generations; Feedstock costs; Financial incentives; Grass biomass; Harvesting costs; Methane potential; Methane Yield; Waste products; Anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion; anoxic conditions; assessment method; biomass; grass; methane; England; Lincolnshire; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085149774

At the same time, their complex topography may help to buffer the effects of climate change and create climate refugia. Whether climate change can lead to critical transitions of mountain forest ecosystems and whether such transitions are reversible remain incompletely understood. We investigated the resilience of forest composition and size structure to climate change, focusing on a mountain forest landscape in the Eastern Alps. Using the individual-based forest landscape model iLand, we simulated ecosystem responses to a wide range of climatic changes (up to a 6°C increase in mean annual temperature and a 30% reduction in mean annual precipitation), testing for tipping points in vegetation size structure and composition under different topography scenarios. We found that at warming levels above +2°C a threshold was crossed, with the system tipping into an alternative state. The system shifted from a conifer-dominated landscape characterized by large trees to a landscape dominated by smaller, predominantly broadleaved trees. Topographic complexity moderated climate change impacts, smoothing and delaying the transitions between alternative vegetation states. We subsequently reversed the simulated climate forcing to assess the ability of the landscape to recover from climate change impacts. The forest landscape showed hysteresis, particularly in scenarios with lower precipitation. At the same mean annual temperature, equilibrium vegetation size structure and species composition differed between warming and cooling trajectories. Here we show that even moderate warming corresponding to current policy targets could result in critical transitions of forest ecosystems and highlight the importance of topographic complexity as a buffering agent.

Nitrate is the main source of N available to plants in agricultural soils and in many natural environments. Sustaining agricultural productivity is of paramount importance in the current scenario of increasing world population, diversification of crop uses, and climate change. Plant productivity for major crops around the world, however, is still supported by excess application of N-rich fertilizers with detrimental economic and environmental impacts. Thus, understanding how plants regulate nitrate uptake and metabolism is key for developing new crops with enhanced N use efficiency and to cope with future world food demands. The study of plant responses to nitrate has gained considerable interest over the last 30 years. This review provides an overview of key findings in nitrate research, spanning biochemistry, molecular genetics, genomics, and systems biology. We discuss how we have reached our current view of nitrate transport, local and systemic nitrate sensing/signaling, and the regulatory networks underlying nitrate-controlled outputs in plants. We hope this summary will serve not only as a timeline and information repository but also as a baseline to define outstanding questions for future research. © 2020 ASPB.",,"anion transport protein; nitrate transporters; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; plant protein; transcription factor; crop; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; plant root; signal transduction; transport at the cellular level; Anion Transport Proteins; Biological Transport; Crops, Agricultural; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plants; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085123539

Adverse effects of extreme weather on mortality have been well explored and expounded in numerous epidemiological studies. The relationship between moderate temperature and mortality is, however, underexplored. This study quantitatively investigated the temperature-dependent mortality burden in China. Data on daily average temperature and mortality in 15 Chinese cities during 2010–2016 were collected for this study. The association between temperature and city-specific mortality was investigated with a quasi-Poisson regression combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model across lag 0–21 days. The results were then included in a multivariate meta-analysis to derive the pooled estimates of the effect of temperature on mortality at the multi-city level. Mortality fractions attributable to cold and heat (i.e., at temperatures below and above the minimum mortality temperature (MMT)) were calculated. Additionally, temperature ranges were further divided into 1 °C intervals of ambient temperature, and the attributable fractions were calculated for each range. The MMT varied from the 71th to 93th percentiles of temperature in the 15 Chinese cities, centering at the 78th percentile at the multi-city level. In total, 12.65% of non-accidental mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature, of which cold and hot temperatures corresponded to attributable fractions of 11.38% and 1.27%, respectively. The results of temperature stratifications suggested that moderately cold temperatures provided the highest contribution to mortality caused by temperature. Specifically, the highest attributable fractions were at 7 °C, 7 °C, 8 °C, 8 °C, 4 °C, 4 °C, 5 °C, 7 °C, 7 °C, 4 °C, 5 °C, 5 °C, 6 °C, 11 °C, and 12 °C, for Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, Urumqi, Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Xining, Lanzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hefei, Chengdu, Kunming, and Guangzhou, respectively. Cold temperature was responsible for a higher proportion of deaths than heat. Moderate cold temperature contributed to most of the total health burden. Finally, the cumulative total counts of deaths caused by moderate cold were the largest. Although moderate cold conferred a slightly lower relative risk than extreme cold, it was more common than extreme cold. Taken together, our results show that the effects of moderate cold temperature on health should receive more attention. Furthermore, our findings could help improve the prediction of climate change effects on human health and support the development of response strategies for the changing climate. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Attributable fractions; China; Moderately cold temperature; Non-accidental mortality; Public health","air temperature; ambient air; climate change; climate effect; epidemiology; health impact; mortality; public health; temperature effect; China; China; city; cold; heat; human; mortality; risk factor; temperature; Beijing; China; Cities; Cold Temperature; Hot Temperature; Humans; Mortality; Risk Factors; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085122055

This study describes, using two different study designs (a case-crossover design and a time-series analysis), the association of air pollutants and respiratory disease hospitalizations. The study has been conducted on 5 cities in Poland on a timeline of almost 4 years. DLNM and regression models were both used for the assessment of the short-term effects of air pollution peaks on respiratory hospitalizations. Both case-crossover and time-series studies equally revealed a positive association between air pollution peaks and hospitalization occurrences. Results were provided in the form of percentage increase of a respiratory visit/hospitalization, for each 10-μg/m3 increment in single pollutant level for both study designs. The most significant estimated % increases of hospitalizations linked to increase of 10 μg/m3 of pollutant have been recorded in general with particulate matter, with highest values for 24 h PM2.5 in Warsaw (6.4%, case-crossover; 4.5%, time series, respectively) and in Białystok (5.6%, case-crossover; 4.5%, time series, respectively). The case-crossover analysis results have shown a larger CI in comparison to the results of the time-series analysis, while the lag days were easier to identify with the case-crossover design. The trends and the overlap of the results occurring from both methods are good and show applicability of both study designs to air pollution effects on short-term hospitalizations. © 2020, The Author(s).","Air-pollution; Case-crossover; Hospitalizations; Lag effect; Respiratory diseases; Time series","atmospheric pollution; health care; hospital sector; particulate matter; respiratory disease; urban area; Bialystok [Poland]; Mazowieckie; Poland [Central Europe]; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]; air pollutant; air pollution; city; hospitalization; human; particulate matter; Poland; respiratory tract disease; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Hospitalization; Humans; Particulate Matter; Poland; Respiratory Tract Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085117220

Specifically, the Gas Switching Combustion (GSC) system is integrated with a Humid Air Turbine (HAT) power cycle and a slurry fed entrained flow (GE-Texaco) gasifier or a dry fed (Shell) gasifier with a partial water quench. The primary novelty of the proposed GSC-HAT plant is that the reduction and oxidation reactor stages of the GSC operation can be decoupled allowing for flexible operation, with the oxygen carrier serving as a chemical and thermal energy storage medium. This can allow the air separation unit, gasifier, gas clean-up, CO2 compressors and downstream CO2 transport and storage network to be downsized for operation under steady state conditions, while the reactors and the power cycle operate flexibly to follow load. Such cost-effective flexibility will be highly valued in future energy systems with high shares of variable renewable energy. The GSC-HAT plant achieves 42.5% electrical efficiency with 95.0% CO2 capture rate with the Shell gasifier, and 41.6% efficiency and 99.2% CO2 capture with the GE gasifier. An exergy analysis performed for the GE gasifier case revealed that this plant reached 38.9% exergy efficiency, only 1.6%-points below an inflexible GSC-IGCC benchmark configuration, while reaching around 5%-points higher CO2 capture rate. Near-zero SOx and NOx emissions are achieved through pre-combustion gas clean-up and flameless fuel combustion. Overall, this flexible and efficient near-zero emission power plant appears to be a promising alternative in a future carbon constrained world with increasing shares of variable renewables and more stringent pollutant (NOx, SOx) regulations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CO2 capture; efficiency; exergy; flexible power production; gas switching combustion; humid air turbine","Carbon dioxide; Compressed air motors; Cost effectiveness; Exergy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Heat storage; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Precombustion; Wind turbines; Air separation unit; Electrical efficiency; Exergy efficiencies; Humid air turbine cycles; Humid air turbines; Near-zero emissions; Steady-state condition; Variable renewable energies; Gas industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085116021

Overarching policymaking to date has included the use of biomass to deliver sector specific aims (e.g. climate change, energy, etc.) however, this is mostly planned without adjusting support across the most challenging stages of biomass value chains and exploiting specific advantages related to their geographic settings (e.g. domestic feedstocks, local markets, etc.). Policies to date have, therefore, resulted in fragmented, suboptimal biomass use and debates for sustainability and resource efficiency. This opinion paper arose from the project Strategic Initiative for Resource Efficient Biomass Policies Funded by the EU Commission. It discusses the development of a dedicated Biomass Policy Framework which applies the principles of value chain analysis in policy design to enable the market uptake of sustainable, domestic, resource efficient biomass solutions. Firstly, it explains how to provide context by identifying value chains which can offer competitive advantages for biomass mobilization, market infrastructures, rural and economic development within their geographic setting. Then the work builds on the context and prioritized value chains and further rationalizes policy needs and aims within individual value chain stages. This is done by identifying policy-related challenges and gaps that constrain sustainable and resource efficient deployment of the selected value chains. Also, it suggests policy interventions that will overcome challenges, resolve gaps and as a result mobilize local biomass and improve market uptake. Finally, it discusses the contrasting paradigms for biomass policy formation within single sector target setting and the value chain approach of the Biomass Policy Framework and uses the case of low carbon biomass heat to illustrate the strengths of the suggested approach.

Due to China's large size and imbalanced development, the achievement of such targets depends on the performances of China's provinces. Under such a circumstance, this study aims to identify the driving forces and predict the trajectories of China's overall and provincial energy-related CO2 emissions. The generalized Divisia index decomposition analysis results show that investment sale expansion is the major driver of CO2 emission growth in China and most Chinese provinces, which is partly offset by the efficiency gains. Our dynamic scenario simulation results show that most Chinese provinces will achieve their CO2 intensity reduction targets but have difficulties in achieving their CO2 emission peak targets. Further integration of both efficiency and technology improvement is one effective approach toward peaking CO2 emissions.

In order to explore regional potential features, 20 global climate models (GCMs) were statistically downscaled to reproduce temperature and precipitation at a resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° across China, which illustrated agreeable performance in comparison with observation. Taking temperatures as inputs, the Hargreaves model was implemented to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET). This model was typically recalibrated to keep accuracy in further usage, which resulted in normalized root mean squared error being less than 5%. The indicator defined by the ratio of annual precipitation to annual PET, namely dry/wet index (IDW), was projected in potential dynamic of dry/wet division. IDW was consistently expected in an increasing trend under RCP4.5 relative to the baseline period of 1986–2005. Regards RCP8.5, IDW was diagnosed in a decreasing trend in northern Xinjiang and most central-southern regions, but an increasing trend in most northern regions, implying dry tendency in current wet condition in southern parts while wet tendency in dry condition in northern parts. The possible contribution of precipitation and PET could unveil regional differential change in IDW. It was highlighted that the area exposed to extreme dry, and dry was likely to decrease, but the exposure to wet and extreme wet tended to increase in the future. These can provide a better knowledge of potential change of climate and water resource, supporting adaptive strategies in response to climate change. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Climatic division; Dry/wet index; Potential evapotranspiration; RCP scenarios","air temperature; climate change; climate classification; climate modeling; downscaling; dry season; evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; wet season; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085091786

Here we report a highly dispersed CuFe nitrogen–carbon framework as an efficient catalyst coated on carbon paper to form gas diffusion electrode for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Such a electrode not only surmounts the disadvantage of single Cu or Fe electrode but also exhibits high selectivity, low overpotential and high energy efficiency for CO production. The as-fabricated electrode effectively converts CO2 into CO with a low overpotential of 90 mV and high Faradaic efficiency over 90% at low applied potential range from −0.3 to −0.6 V (maximum 95.5% at −0.4 V, all potentials are converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode) with a high CO current density of 2.1 mA cm−2 at −0.5 V, as well extremely high energy efficiency of 78.3% at −0.4 V. It also exhibits robust stability during long-time electrolysis, with about 95% CO selectivity retained after 20 h electrolysis.

We find that global urban extent has expanded by 9,687 km2 per year. This rate is four times greater than previous reputable estimates from worldwide individual cities, suggesting an unprecedented rate of global urbanization. The rate of urban expansion is notably faster than that of population growth, indicating that the urban land area already exceeds what is needed to sustain population growth.

Among other effects, this has given rise to public debate and engagement around notions of climate crisis and emergency. The Loss and Damage (L&D) policy debate has emphasized these aspects over the last three decades. Yet, despite institutionalization through an article on L&D by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the Paris Agreement, the debate has remained vague, particularly with reference to its remit and relationship to adaptation policy and practice. Research has recently made important strides forward in terms of developing a science perspective on L&D. This article reviews insights derived from recent publications by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others, and presents the implications for science and policy. Emerging evidence on hard and soft adaptation limits in certain systems, sectors and regions holds the potential to further build momentum for climate policy to live up to the Paris ambition of stringent emission reductions and to increase efforts to support the most vulnerable. L&D policy may want to consider actions to extend soft adaptation limits and spur transformational, that is, non-standard risk management and adaptation, so that limits are not breached. Financial, technical, and legal support would be appropriate for instances where hard limits are transgressed. Research is well positioned to further develop robust evidence on critical and relevant risks at scale in the most vulnerable countries and communities, as well as options to reduce barriers and limits to adaptation. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate risk; Limits to adaptation; Loss and Damage; Transformation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085064713

The effectiveness and efficiency of agricultural abatement options depend on regional climate and natural conditions, changes in the global economy, global agricultural markets and regional agricultural production. Thus, the assessment of abatement options requires consideration of the global scale, the market scale and the regional producer scale. We investigate two abatement options discussed controversially in literature. Both have been partially applied to reduce environmental pollution from agriculture: a tax on nitrogen and the obligatory set-aside of agricultural land. Our study provides an assessment of the ecological effectiveness and the economic efficiency of both abatement options under different global scenarios. In our policy analysis we combine three applied policy simulation models to develop an integrated economic model framework. This model framework considers the global, the national and the regional scale and consists of the global general equilibrium model DART-BIO, the partial-equilibrium model CAPRI and the regional supply model RAUMIS. In the different global scenarios, the results show that both abatement options create relatively high marginal abatement costs and that the maximally reached abated greenhouse gas emissions represent only 15% of the quantity required to fulfill the policy targets. Compared to the obligatory set-aside option, the nitrogen tax is in both scenarios the more efficient policy. With respect to impacts on production and environment, a nitrogen tax is less forecastable than the obligatory set-aside option. Our study illustrates the relevance of considering global economic and market change in the assessment of producer-targeting environmental policies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Environmental policies; Global scenarios; Greenhouse gas abatement; Integrated modelling","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Commerce; Efficiency; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Taxation; Agricultural markets; Agricultural productions; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Environmental pollutions; General equilibrium models; Greenhouse gas abatements; Marginal abatement costs; Partial equilibrium model; Economic analysis; abatement cost; agricultural market; environmental policy; global change; greenhouse gas; numerical model; policy analysis; policy making; regional climate; set-aside; tax system; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085012412

This review discusses the development of a biorefinery model using sustainable feedstocks such as microalgal biomass, with multiple benefits. As a case study, it demonstrates the development of a microalgal biorefinery to produce lipid for biofuel and carotenoids like lutein for healthcare applications, along with CO2 mitigation. However, there has been a question mark regarding the economic viability of microalgal biorefinery, mainly for low biomass and product yields and discrete downstream processing steps. To provide sustainable solutions for these technological challenges, process intensification strategies can be implemented to enhance the yields of biomass-derived biofuels and value-added products. This article investigates the design aspects of photo-bioreactors to enhance biomass productivity and CO2 sequestration. Despite efforts made by researchers to improve product yields, there is ample scope to improve the economic viability of lutein and lipid production by integrating upstream and downstream operations to reduce the cost associated with the process. The future of algal biorefineries will rely on the development of rationally integrated genome and process-scale engineering strategies to improve further the production of lipid and carotenoids.

Escalating climate and global changes present an imminent threat to Pacific communities, particularly for food security, livelihoods, health and safety, cultural identity and biodiversity conservation. A participatory community-based climate change adaptation planning process was used to engage with communities on Rendova Island in Western Province, Solomon Islands to identify local adaptation priorities. The methodology recognized that local community members are the managers of the resources they use daily, have direct knowledge of the status of key local resources and have direct influence over ongoing resource governance. The study focused on two objectives: (1) identifying community priorities and documenting them in adaptation plans intended for local implementation, and (2) evaluating whether community adaptation priorities addressed key vulnerabilities identified independently using a semi-quantitative vulnerability assessment. The adaptation priorities identified by the communities encompassed: governance, leadership and planning; farming and livestock; sustainable livelihoods; natural resource management; and youth capacity building. The community adaptation priorities were found to address the key climate change vulnerabilities identified in the semi-quantitative assessment and also addressed additional drivers of social vulnerability and adaptive capacity. This finding reiterates the importance of fully inclusive and participatory vulnerability assessments and community-identification of adaptation priorities coupled with scientific climate projections to comprehensively assess the complexity of social-ecological systems. The climate change adaptation priorities have informed ongoing local actions and are intended to be used by communities, government and NGOs to focus local effort, funding and project development. A review of the suitability of the adaptation priorities by similar villages on neighbouring islands would determine the utility of scaling-up and applying these adaptations to other rural communities in the Solomon Islands, and possibly more widely in other Pacific communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation priorities; Climate change adaptation; Community-based adaptation; Participatory planning; Social-ecological systems; Solomon Islands","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Food supply; Health risks; Natural resources management; Rural areas; Adaptation to climate changes; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change adaptation; Community identification; Natural resource management; Quantitative assessments; Social-ecological systems; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change; adaptive management; capacity building; climate change; global change; government; local adaptation; nongovernmental organization; planning process; village; agricultural worker; article; capacity building; climate change; ecosystem; funding; human; juvenile; leadership; livestock; local adaptation; manager; natural resource; non-governmental organization; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; rural population; scale up; Solomon Islands; acclimatization; adolescent; ecosystem; island (geological); Melanesia; Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]; Acclimatization; Adolescent; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Humans; Islands; Melanesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084982192

As NH3 is an indirect greenhouse gas, NH3 measurements are crucial to improving greenhouse gas emission inventory estimates. Moreover, NH3 emissions have wider implications for environmental and human health. Only a few studies have measured NH3 emissions from pastures in the tropics and subtropics and none has compared emissions to inventory estimates. The objectives of this study were to (1) measure NH3 emissions from dairy pastures in tropical and subtropical regions; (2) calculate NH3 emissions factors (EF) for each campaign; and (3) compare measured EF with those based on the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1, 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Tier 1, and the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme/European Environmental Agency (EMPE/EEA) Tier 2 inventory estimates. Pasture NH3 emissions were measured on 3 dairy farms in Costa Rica. On each dairy, NH3 emissions were measured twice during the wet season and once during the dry season using a micrometeorological integrated horizontal-flux mass-balance method. Emissions were measured from excreta (dung and urine) deposited by grazing cattle and the subsequent application of organic (slurry) or synthetic fertilizer (ammonium nitrate or urea). Measured EF for all campaigns [from grazing cattle excreta and any subsequent slurry or fertilizer application; 4.9 ± 0.9% of applied nitrogen (mean ± SE)] were similar to those of the EMEP/EEA Tier 2 approach (6.1 ± 0.9%; mean ± SE) and 4 times lower than 2006 IPCC and 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC Tier 1 default estimates (17.7 ± 1.4 and 18.2 ± 0.9%, respectively; mean ± SE). Measured EF for excreta deposited on pasture and excreta both deposited on pasture and slurry application [3.9 ± 2.1 and 4.2 ± 2.1% (mean ± 95% CI), respectively] were 5 times lower than default EF assumed by 2006 IPCC and 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC methodology (both 20 and 21%, respectively), whereas EMEP/EAA estimates were similar [6.0 and 4.6 ± 0.3% (mean ± 95% CI), respectively]. This suggests an overestimation of EF from excreta deposited on pasture and slurry applications in tropical and subtropical regions by IPCC methodologies. Furthermore, rainfall, which is not included as a parameter in the current EMEP/EEA Tier 2 methodology, appeared to reduce NH3 emissions, suggesting that accounting for this in the inventory methodologies could improve inventory estimates. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","dairy; NH3 emission; pasture; tropical","ammonia; fertilizer; nitrogen; agriculture; animal; bovine; climate change; Costa Rica; dairying; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; metabolism; season; tropic climate; Agriculture; Ammonia; Animals; Cattle; Climate Change; Costa Rica; Dairying; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrogen; Seasons; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084973089

Glacial comminution can produce fresh mineral surfaces that provide easily leached cations to the rivers and thus could potentially modify the riverine Mg isotopic behavior. However, the mechanism controlling riverine Mg isotopes under glacial environment is poorly constrained. Here we investigated Mg and Sr isotopic compositions of river and spring waters, bedrocks and sediments within the glacial-covered Muztag catchment in the northeastern Pamir Plateau. The δ26Mg and 87Sr/86Sr values of dissolved loads along the mainstream increased from −1.56‰ and 0.713050 at the glacier margin to −1.12‰ and 0.713855 at the downstream, respectively, both showing strong negative correlation with elevation. The lower δ26Mg but higher molar Ca/Mg and Ca/Na ratios of glacial river waters than those of non-glacial rivers indicate a preferential dissolution of carbonates under glacial environment, further supported by a negative liner correlation between δ26Mg and carbonate weathering proportion. In contrast, the high δ26Mg but low Ca/Mg and Ca/Na ratios at the downstream reflect an increased input of silicate weathering. Saturation state modelling suggests little chance of secondary mineral formation and limited impact on the Mg isotopic behavior in glacial rivers, characterized by low ionic concentrations and short water residence time. These observations, together with complied data from other glacial rivers, suggest preferential carbonate weathering under glacial environment could directly release low Mg isotopes to river water, different from the process of Mg isotopic fractionation by secondary mineral formation. Our findings would provide insight in carbonate weathering regulating riverine Mg isotopic evolution and its potential influence on global carbon cycle, in particular under present warming scenario. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonate weathering; Eastern pamir; Fractionation and source; Glacial catchment; Mg isotopes","Carbonation; Catchments; Dissolution; Glacial geology; Groundwater; Isotopes; Minerals; Molar ratio; Rivers; Runoff; Silicates; Weathering; Carbonate weathering; Glacial environments; Ionic concentrations; Isotopic fractionations; Preferential dissolution; Secondary mineral formation; Sr isotopic compositions; Water residence time; Magnesium; bedrock; calcium; carbonate; catchment; chemical weathering; dissolution; isotopic composition; leaching; magnesium; secondary mineral; sodium; strontium isotope; Pamirs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084957020

Understanding and using climate change information to advance the implementation of climate-friendly policies further compounds this challenge. A rich scholarly literature focusing on climate change adaptation endorses that investing in mechanisms that narrow the gap between climate change information production and its use is crucial to increase adaptive capacity. Based on this assumption, this paper investigates the extent to which two collaborative projects that functioned as boundary organisations in Brazil (CiAdapta project) and Australia (Climate Change Adaptation for Natural Resource Management in East Coast Australia) increased access to information, and enabled the continual and continuous usefulness of produced knowledge for climate change adaptation. Considering the distinction between usable and useful information, we applied six criteria to guide the data analysis and extract key lessons from each project. Our findings confirm that face-to-face interactions are more likely to result in research having the societal impact that is being increasingly required by research and funding bodies. Our findings also indicate that two key systemic changes are critical for the long-term influence of boundary organisations for advancing climate change adaptation. These include changes to the science, knowledge production process; and shift in the political culture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Boundary organisation; Cities; Knowledge co-production; Natural resources management","access to information; article; Australia; Brazil; city; climate change; data analysis; funding; human; natural resource; organization; seashore",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084928347

We integrate the concept of expressive partisanship with research on social support for energy policy by arguing that there are potentially two types of expressive partisans—ideological and identitarian expressive.

Despite progress, major gaps still exist for the continuous provision of climate services for the Colombian agricultural sector. These gaps include lack of capacities in farming communities and technical assistants to understand and use seasonal forecast information, as well as the systematic provision of agro-climatic information. Here, we describe a user-centered digital agro-climatic forecast system that addresses several of these gaps. The system, named, “Pronosticos AClimateColombia,” and available at https://pronosticos.aclimatecolombia.org, formalizes the processing of climate and crop information from quality control, forecasting, and tailoring to crop-specific decision-making processes. The design, development and evaluation process captured user needs through regular engagement with key stakeholders ranging from the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Meteorological Service (IDEAM), as well as farmer organizations and farmers in a range of agricultural areas. We describe the process of design, testing and deployment of the system, in which forecast generation is performed as a series of automated steps, with agro-climatic forecasts issued on the 7th day of every month with a rolling lead-time of six months. We show that the constant gathering of user requirements and feedback resulted in users expressing substantial interest in using the system, though with some limitations on the level of understanding of the provided information. The limitations indicate a need for improved capacity at the local level. This underscores the importance of cyclical, continuous, feedback and discussion processes for climate services. © 2020 The Authors","Agro-climate services; Climate variability; Crop modeling; Maize; Rice","Agricultural robots; Crops; Decision making; Feedback; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Quality control; Service industry; Agricultural productions; Agricultural sector; Climate variability; Climatic informations; Decision making process; Farmer organization; Farming communities; Seasonal forecasts; Forecasting; agricultural production; decision making; environmental risk; farming system; quality control; risk assessment; Colombia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084858060

Observations show a significant reduction in global land monsoon precipitation during the second half of the 20th century. Understanding the cause of this change, especially possible anthropogenic origins, is important. Here, we compare observed changes in global land monsoon precipitation during 1948–2005 with those simulated by 5 global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project-phase 5 (CMIP5) under different external forcings. We show that the observed drying trend is consistent with the model simulated response to anthropogenic forcing and to anthropogenic aerosol forcing in particular. We apply the optimal fingerprinting method to quantify anthropogenic influences on precipitation and find that anthropogenic aerosols may have contributed to 102% (62–144% for the 5–95% confidence interval) of the observed decrease in global land monsoon precipitation. A moisture budget analysis indicates that the reduction in precipitation results from reduced vertical moisture advection in response to aerosol forcing.

However, increasing population is driving urban sprawl in traditionally low-density areas, enhancing the synergies between global and local climate change. Here we show that local climate mitigation can reduce the impacts of climate change, with the analysis of a new development area in Sydney, 50 km from the coast. With meso-scale climate modelling, we computed that by 2050 the peak summer temperature will increase by 0.8 °C and the daily average summer temperature by 1.6 °C. Mitigation with cool materials, greenery, and irrigation will lower the peak and average daily temperatures respectively by 2.2 °C and 1.6 °C with respect to the unmitigated future climate scenario. Mitigation techniques when applied in the whole Sydney area yield to cooling energy needs reductions by 6.7–8.6 kWh/m2 (13.4–19.3%) for typical residential, office, and school buildings, with a negligible heating penalty, compared to an unmitigated future scenario. Combined adaptation and mitigation can reduce the future cooling energy needs by 31.3 kWh/m2 (70%), 29.3 kWh/m2 (57.3%), and 20.9 kWh/m2 (59.4%) for typical residential, office, and school building, respectively. Our study indicates that the consolidated and widely available mitigation technologies alone cannot counteract the energy impact of both global and local climate change.

Moreover, increasing demand and fixed available quantity of natural resources are making the problem more complex and challenging. It has been identified that; the concept of the circular economy can provide the solution to the problem. This study examines the economic, environmental, and social feasibility of circular economy in municipal solid waste (MSW) management. This study proposes a concept for the utilization of collected organic MSW by converting it into biogas and then use it as a fuel in a thermal power plant (TPP) to reduce the burden on coal mines. A mixed-integer non-linear programme (MINLP) model is formulated for the minimization of the total cost which is the sum up of (i) functioning cost, (ii) transportation cost, (iii) hiring cost, (iv) environmental cost, (v) social cost, and (vi) penalty cost. The proposed system is validated by a case study on a city Bilaspur, India. Developed model is evaluated for two scenarios: (i) present scenario, in which desegregated MSW is collected from sources and dispose it to landfill, and TPP gets its fuel only from coal mine; and (ii) proposed scenario, in which collected organic MSW is sent to biogas plant and from there, biogas is transported to TPP as a fuel. The model is solved for both the scenarios and identifies that the proposed system is performing better. It is reducing the total cost of the present system by around INR 30,462,326 per day which is consists of a reduction in functioning, transportation, environmental and social cost by INR 225580, 30120443, 113905 and 2397. In addition to that, it is also reducing the carbon emission by 186.43 tonnes daily. Further, sensitivity analysis is performed by varying the collection efficiency and TPP capacity parameter for testing the fitness of the model globally and in different cities. From the analysis, it is identified that the model is globally implementable and best suited for cities having low TPP capacity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Clean energy; India; MINLP; PSO; Solid waste","Biogas; Coal industry; Coal mines; Environmental management; Fuels; Integer programming; Linear programming; Natural resources; Nonlinear programming; Population statistics; Sensitivity analysis; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste management; Carbon emissions; Circular economy; Collection efficiency; Environmental costs; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Social optimizations; Thermal power plants; Transportation cost; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084793614

The reuse activities occurring in NYC are reported, accounting for the quantities of reuse of various products, such as furniture, appliances and automobile accessories, amongst others. The quantities of products are translated to reuse mass and net CO2-eq emissions saved as a consequence of reuse. This quantitative assessment employs the Reuse Impact Calculator (RIC), based on the Waste Reduction Model (WARM). The RIC is a novel calculator used to quantitatively assess the environmental impact of material reuse. It uses the information about the material to be reused from the WARM database and estimates the emissions and energy savings based on the product’s final destination, that is, reuse, landfill, recycle or composting. A close monitoring of reuse activities in NYC shows 45 × 106 kg of reuse occurring for different products that would otherwise be directed to landfills. The net emissions reduced annually by reuse is approximately 122 × 106 kg of CO2-eq. This article compares the NYC reuse activities with that occurring in some select cities of the world. It is shown that the maximum recycle potential is saturated at 66%, and only auxiliary strategies like reuse can achieve the zero waste to landfill ambitions. Furthermore, this work discusses the role of reuse in the circular economy, wherein the resource utilization is maximized by increasing the shelf life of the product, and thereby enabling a maximum reuse potential. © The Author(s) 2020.","circular economy; emissions reduction; landfills; Reuse; Reuse Impact Calculator; Waste Reduction Model","Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Mathematical instruments; Recycling; Circular economy; Material reuse; New York city; Quantitative assessments; Resource utilizations; Shelf life; Waste reduction; Zero waste; Land fill; polyethylene; carbon dioxide; environmental impact; landfill; numerical model; quantitative analysis; strategic approach; waste management; analytic method; Article; environmental factor; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; health care policy; health care utilization; landfill; New York; priority journal; recycling; social work; waste; waste disposal; waste management; zero waste approach; city; solid waste; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; Cities; New York City; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084789590

Despite the ambitious pledges, several emerging countries still lack an actual progress towards the envisioned goals, often due to the scarcity of accurate data. Here, we propose a practical methodology for bridging the gap between the wind energy targets and their implementation. We illustrate our new methodology by focusing on Saudi Arabia, which endeavors to play a leading role in the renewable energy sector and pledges to install 16GW of wind capacity by 2030. We propose a blueprint for the optimal wind farms buildout, combining novel high-resolution model simulations, a unique set of observations, land-use restrictions and a thorough cost assessment. The most suitable technological option is selected among multiple turbine models for each potential site. Our findings suggest that Saudi Arabia is well positioned to become a role model for wind energy development within the Middle East, with 26% of the electricity demand that could be met by wind power. The average levelized cost of energy of the proposed buildout is 39 USD MWh−1, which confirms the competitiveness of wind resources in Saudi Arabia. We identify the area close to Gulf of Aqaba as the most cost-effective region for wind harvesting, with turbines characterized by moderate specific rating (350 W m−2) at relatively low hub height (75 m).

To date, much sustainability education is prescriptive, rather than participatory, and most integrated art–science programming aims for content learning, rather than societal change. What this means is that learners are more often taught “what is” than invited to imagine “what if?” In order to envision and enact sustainable alternatives, there is a need for methods that allow community members, especially young people, to critically engage with the present, imagine a better future, and collaboratively act for sustainability today. This manuscript introduces a methodological framework that integrates the arts and sciences to facilitate: (1) transdisciplinary learning, focusing on local sustainability challenges; (2) participatory process, bringing experience-based knowledge into conversation with research-based knowledge; and (3) collaborative sustainability action, inviting community members to envision and enact sustainable alternatives where they live. The transformative potential of this framework is examined through international case studies from countries representing the richest and poorest in the Western hemisphere: a multi-site research study and after-school program for climate change education and action in collaboration with children in the Western US; and a multi-cycle research study and community arts center course for environmental photography and youth-led water advocacy in Southern Haiti. Despite many shared characteristics, case studies diverge in important ways relative to the sustainability challenges they sought to address, the specific context in which activities took place, and the manner in which art–science integration was practiced. Across cases, however, art–science integration facilitated participants’ learning, connection, and action for sustainability. Framed by the shared aims of transdisciplinary approaches, this manuscript discusses methodological hurdles and practical lessons learned in art–science integration across settings as well as the transformative capacity of alternative pedagogical and research practices in building a sustainable future. © 2020, The Author(s).","Art–science integration; Community engagement; Sustainability science education; Transdisciplinary research; Transformative learning; Youth-led participatory action research",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084685094

Mountain areas can already benefit from high shares of hydro-power generation, but, at the same time, rely on oil products for transport and for the heating sector in remote areas where natural gas infrastructures are not available. This research work evaluates potential scenarios for the electrification of transport and heating sectors, by coupling the simulation tool EnergyPLAN with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to analyse economic and environmental aspects. Results show that the largest benefits are expected from the electrification of the heating sector. Indeed, a CO2 emissions reduction up to 30% can be reached by acting on the transport sector alone, while up to 65% combining it with measures on heating, industry and agriculture sectors and additional electricity generation from photovoltaic systems. Moreover, the use of heat pumps can lead to significant CO2 emissions decrease with only to a slight increase in the overall annual costs thanks to lower variable costs that partly compensate the higher required initial investment and electricity storage deployment.

These reforms are, however, different from those implemented in the western world for post-oil transition. This paper analyzes post-reformed state control over energy assets and energy transactions to provide an institutional view on the rationality of GCC's unique reform approach. Our study shows persistent but re-programmed state dominance over the energy sector, with energy assets owned either by national oil companies, non-oil state-owned enterprises, or public-private-partnership (PPP) agents with state ownership; and energy transactions governed either by state regulation or PPP contracts in the absence of any market mechanism. This institutional setting may allow the authority to sustain the legacy rentier social contract by expanding state-controlled rent source from oil to non-oil revenue and replacing low-power energy subsidy with high-power state-provided jobs as the rent for transfer. This institutional motivation will ultimately jeopardize market-based reforms and large-scale carbon regulation in the region.

Most of the energy consumption in the glass manufacturing process is attributable to the significant heat required to melt raw materials. An electric boosting system which can transfer extra heat (5%–20% of total energy) to the glass melt in addition to the energy from natural gas combustion can be implemented in a glass furnace. Electric boosting is thermally efficient, reduces direct pollutant emissions, and prolongs furnace superstructure lifespan. However, a high level of electric boost is not always economically desirable, considering the volatility of electricity prices. Balancing between natural gas and electricity consumption in a demand response strategy can reduce the energy cost and mitigate strain on the electrical grid. In this paper, a physics-based model is developed to describe the dynamic behavior of a prototype electric boosting glass furnace.

This paper proposes the idea of implementing an Integrated Energy System (IES) with UHS and other hydrogen related technologies, called Hydrogen Penetrated Energy System (HPES), and presents an intelligent planning procedure applicable to the HPES. Depleted oil/gas fields and salt caverns are selected as the study objects to explore the ability of UHS to achieve seasonal peak shaving, facilitate the renewable energy, and improve the energy system efficiency. Firstly, three regions in China are analysed in terms of geological conditions, resource endowment and load characteristics, to illustrate the feasibility of building a HPES in each of the analysed region. A two-stage planning method for the HPES is proposed and a detailed UHS model is established where the process of cushion gas accumulation is emulated and the influence of the diurnal temperature range is considered. Comprehensive case studies are subsequently carried out for typical cities or regions in Eastern, Northern and North-eastern China and the results demonstrate that the HPES can lower the cost, improve the energy efficiency and reduce the level of carbon dioxide emission to some extent. A lateral comparison also shows that the combination of salt cavern UHS and offshore wind power has a broad application prospect in the east coast of China, and the investment in the HPES scheme for Jintan can be recovered within 8 to 9 years. In addition, compared with the benchmark scheme without UHS and large penetration of renewables, the HPES scheme for Jintan can improve the primary energy efficiency by 22.26% and 27.75% in the first decade and second decade, reduce the carbon dioxide emission by more than 96%, and consume an average level of 95.85% of the offshore wind power. Although the investment payback period of HPES cases in north and northwest China is relatively long (20 years or more), significant return and benefits can be obtained in the long term. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Hydrogen Penetrated Energy System (HPES); Two-stage planning; Typical scenarios; Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS)","Carbon dioxide; Caves; Global warming; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Offshore oil well production; Salt deposits; Wind power; Carbon dioxide emissions; Diurnal temperature ranges; Geological conditions; Hydrogen storage facilities; Integrated energy systems; Primary energy efficiencies; Renewable energy generation; Seasonal energy storages; Energy efficiency; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy storage; feasibility study; hydrogen; planning method; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084529363

We evaluate the feasibility of BECCS in the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB), a landscape with diverse land use, ownership, and bioenergy potential. We develop land-use change scenarios and a switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) crop functional type to use in a land-surface model to simulate second-generation bioenergy production. By the end of this century, average annual switchgrass production over the UMRB ranges from 60 to 210 Tg dry mass/year and is dependent on the Representative Concentration Pathway for greenhouse gas emissions and on land-use change assumptions. Under our simple phase-in assumptions this results in a cumulative total production of 2,000–6,000 Tg C over the study period with the upper estimates only possible in the absence of climate change. Switchgrass yields decreased as average CO2 concentrations and temperatures increased, suggesting the effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 was small because of its C4 photosynthetic pathway. By the end of the 21st century, the potential energy stored annually in harvested switchgrass averaged between 1 and 4 EJ/year assuming perfect conversion efficiency, or an annual electrical generation capacity of 7,000–28,000 MW assuming current bioenergy efficiency rates. Trade-offs between bioenergy and ecosystem services were identified, including cumulative direct losses of 1,000–2,600 Tg C stored in natural ecosystems from land-use change by 2090. Total cumulative losses of ecosystem carbon stocks were higher than the potential ~300 Tg C in fossil fuel emissions from the single largest power plant in the region over the same time period, and equivalent to potential carbon removal from the atmosphere from using biofuels grown in the same region. Numerous trade-offs from BECCS expansion in the UMRB must be balanced against the potential benefits of a carbon-negative energy system. © 2020 The Authors.

The current barrier to this technique is the low efficiency of C-C coupling through dimerization of adsorbed *CO or coupling of *CO with its hydrogenated derivatives over the Cu catalyst. Tandem catalysts, which integrate Cu with another CO-generation catalyst (e.g., ZnO), can enhance the C-C coupling kinetics by increasing the local concentration of the key intermediate of CO. However, the degree of enhancement is strongly dependent on the spatial manipulation of supplementary CO transport. Herein, inspired by the reactant species concentration profile in a plug flow reactor, Cu/ZnO tandem electrodes are designed by spatially adding a ZnO catalyst layer on top of the Cu catalyst layer, in which the ZnO catalyst layer fed CO concentration progressively decreases over the Cu catalyst layer. Such a spatial management of CO transport dramatically increases the CO utilization efficiency, leading to an enhancement of Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2+ products by 1.2 and 3.4 times, respectively, compared to the bare Cu electrode, while by 1.3 and 1.8 times, respectively, compared to the Cu&amp;ZnO mixed electrode. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","C2+ products; CO transport; Cu/ZnO; Ethylene; Tandem reaction","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; II-VI semiconductors; Zinc oxide; CO concentrations; Current barriers; Electrochemical reductions; Faradaic efficiencies; Partial currents; Plug flow reactor; Renewable electricity; Spatial management; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084518930

Past studies on these interactions have focused on the information needs of decision-makers, but less is known about why and how climate researchers choose to engage with decision-makers. Understanding the experiences, beliefs and constraints on both sides of the ‘knowledge-action gap’ is critical for implementing robust climate adaptation strategies. This study thus examines the perspectives and experiences of researchers regarding practitioner engagement, drawing from an original survey of California's climate research community (N= 991) and supplemental interviews. Given a history of support for climate research and climate change adaptation, analysis of the California case is useful as a means of characterizing the relationship between climate research and practitioner engagement. We find that most scientists want to engage more with practitioners but are constrained by several factors, including resource limitations and the challenge of building relationships. Additionally, we find that the level of interest and frequency of engagement with stakeholders varies significantly across academic disciplines. We demonstrate that building capacity within research organizations and integrating stakeholder engagement in funding criteria and professional development can help foster relationship-building between scientists and decision-makers. The analysis suggests that the social structure of climate research warrants further examination of the ways that climate researchers relate to practitioners at present. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Climate services; Co-production; Science production; Sociology of science","climate change; decision making; limiting factor; questionnaire survey; social structure; stakeholder; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084507490

Globally, industrial primary energy use and conversion for electricity and heat are responsible for 46% of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, the introduction of the Energy Efficiency Directive in 2012 has led to an increase in the number of Energy Efficiency Obligations - EEOs (also known as White Certificates or energy efficiency resource standards across Europe). 12 EU Member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, UK) have active EEOs with another four due to start shortly (Croatia, Greece, Latvia and the Netherlands) considering their introduction. Due to this fact, in Poland, pro-efficiency investments are gaining in popularity. Industrial plant Bulten Poland S.A. dealing the production of fasteners for the automotive industry has a heat treatment department, which is the most energy-intensive part in the manufacture of screw products. It results in significant carbon footprint (total CO2 emission from gas usage at the heat treatment department is at the level of 3,885 Mg/year). For this reason, to increase energy efficiency and simultaneously reduce CO2 emission, waste heat recovery has been introduced on the Aichelin hardening line. The heat recovery has been located on the oil bath and at the exhaust pipe from the gas burners. The recovered waste heat is captured by the buffer in the form of a water tank. The water is injected into the central heating system and used in the heating season to maintain appropriate temperatures in the halls and offices. Furthermore, the possibility of installing cogeneration unit has been investigated as a way to minimize carbon footprint of the production. The work presents an analysis of improving the energy efficiency and reduce of CO2 emission by implementing solutions such as: heat recovery and use a cogeneration unit. Estimated CO2 savings are at the level of 1,350 Mg/year which gives about 35% of total emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cogeneration; Energy efficiency; Heat recovery; Manufacturing; Thermal utility; Waste heat","Automotive industry; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cogeneration plants; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat treatment; Industrial plants; Investments; Magnesium compounds; Manufacture; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Water tanks; Central heating system; Efficiency investments; Energy efficiency improvements; International community; KYOTO protocol; Primary energy use; Total emissions; White certificates; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; cogeneration; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; European Union; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; Kyoto Protocol; Austria; Bulgaria; Croatia; Denmark; France; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Latvia; Luxembourg; Malta [Southern Europe]; Netherlands; Poland [Central Europe]; Slovenia; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084490246

Nevertheless, retrofitting solutions based merely on reducing operational energy use can increase embodied energy use, mainly due to altering the existing trade-off between the two. Considering this trade-off is vitally important, especially for retrofitting buildings located in cold climate regions, as reduction of operational energy use to meet standards of energy-efficient buildings may require a deep retrofitting that can considerably increase the embodied energy and thus be unfavorable from a Life Cycle Energy (LCE) perspective. This article presents a case study in which multi-objective optimization was used to explore the impact of a wide range of retrofitting measures on the aforementioned trade-off for a building in Sweden located in a subarctic climatic zone. The studied building was a typical 1980s multi-family residence. The goal was to explore and compare the optimal retrofitting solution(s) for the building, aiming to achieve Swedish energy-efficient building standards (i.e. new-build and near-zero energy standards). The results of the optimization indicated that (1) use of additional insulation in walls and roof, (2) replacement of existing windows with more energy-efficient ones, and (3) change of traditional mechanical extract ventilation to heat recovery ventilation are the primary and optimal retrofitting measures to fulfill the new-build Swedish energy standard and achieve highest LCE savings. However, to fulfill more far-reaching operational energy savings, application of additional retrofitting measures was required, increasing the embodied energy use considerably and resulting in lower LCE savings compared to the optimal retrofitting solution that only reached the Swedish new-build energy standard. The LCE difference between the optimal retrofitting solutions that fulfilled the new-build standard and the strictest near-zero (passive house) standard was 1862 GJ, which is equivalent to almost four years of operational energy use for the original building. This indicates that there is a limit to the reduction of operational energy use when retrofitting existing buildings, beyond which additional reductions can considerably increase the embodied energy and thus be unfavorable in terms of LCE use. © 2020 The Authors","Building retrofit; Embodied energy; Life cycle energy; Multi-objective optimization; Operational energy; Retrofitting measures","Artificial life; Building codes; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Heating; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Retrofitting; Ventilation codes; Waste heat; Zero energy buildings; Additional insulation; Building retrofits; Energy efficient; Energy efficient building; Energy standards; Life cycle energies; Operational energy; Optimal retrofitting; Energy efficiency; building; energy efficiency; exploration; life cycle analysis; optimization; trade-off; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084475658

The 2009 Red River spring flood is selected as a case study and this approach is tested with the regional climate model, Global Environment Multiscale (GEM) version 4.8 with 10 km resolution, and Canadian Digital Surface Model (CDSM) elevation (~ 20 m). To investigate the impacts of fluvial inundation on regional climate, the sensitivity experiments using different initial conditions for soil moisture are conducted with 1 km resolution through a three-step one-way nesting approach. Generally, new approach can capture the development–decay of fluvial inundation, similar to MODIS observation. The reasonable statistic values (probability of detection, 0.71; false alarm ratio, 0.26) are found on April 15–22 when occurred the largest MODIS-observed fluvial inundation. In sensitivity experiments, the increase of soil moisture by flooding can induce the decrease of albedo, leading to the increase in absorbed solar radiation energy at surface. Most of the absorbed energy is used by the latent heat flux, inducing the temperature cooling and moisture increase. These changes are larger in daytime than nighttime and are statistically significant in only 2 months (May–June) from the flooding, which contribute to the improvement of temperature simulation. The significant decrease and increase of precipitation in northeastern and southeastern regions away from the flooded region, respectively, are noted post-flooding. These changes are closely associated with the decrease and increase of moist static energy by moisture divergence and convergence, respectively. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate modeling; flooding; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sensitivity analysis; soil moisture; Red River [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084465672

Although ensemble forecasts provide invaluable information regarding the uncertainty in a prediction, they themselves often misrepresent the weather that occurs. Given their widespread use, the need for high-quality wind-speed forecasts is well-documented. Several statistical approaches have therefore been proposed to recalibrate ensembles of wind-speed forecasts, including a heteroscedastic truncated regression approach. An extension to this method that utilises the prevailing atmospheric flow is implemented here in a quasigeostrophic simulation study and on Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) reforecast data, in the hope of alleviating errors owing to changes in the synoptic-scale atmospheric state. When the wind speed depends strongly on the underlying weather regime, the resulting forecasts have the potential to provide substantial improvements in skill relative to conventional post-processing techniques. This is particularly pertinent at longer lead times, where there is more improvement to be gained over current methods, and in weather regimes associated with wind speeds that differ greatly from climatology. In order to realise this potential, an accurate prediction of the future atmospheric regime is required. © 2020 The Authors.

As synthetic hydrocarbons have the same chemical properties as their fossil substitutes, existing infrastructures and well-established application technologies can be retained while CO2 emissions in energy conversion, transport, industry, and residential and services can be reduced. However, the conversion processes, especially the generation of hydrogen necessary for all e-fuels, are associated with energy losses and costs. To evaluate the techno-economic hydrogen production potential and the impact of its utilization on the rest of the energy system, a supply curve of electricity-based hydrogen in a greenhouse gas emission-free European energy system in 2050 was developed. It was found that hydrogen quantities of the order of magnitude envisaged in the 1.5 °C scenarios by the European Commission's long-term strategic vision (1536–1953 TWhH2) induce marginal hydrogen production costs of over 110 €2020/MWhH2 and electrolyzer capacities of more than 615 GWel. Although the generation of these amounts of hydrogen using electrolysis provides some flexibility to the electricity system and can integrate small amounts of local surplus electricity, an additional 766 GWel of wind power and 865 GWel of solar power must be installed to cover the additional electricity demand for hydrogen production. It was furthermore found that the most important techno-economic properties of electrolyzers used in an energy system dominated by renewable energies are the ability to operate flexibly and the conversion efficiency of electricity into hydrogen. It is anticipated that the shown analysis is valuable for both policy-makers, who need to identify research, subsidy and infrastructure requirements for a future energy system, and corporate decision-makers, whose business models will be significantly affected by the future availability of electricity-based fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost of hydrogen; Electricity system flexibility; Electrolysis; Energy system modeling; Power-to-Gas; Sector coupling","Decision making; Electrolytic cells; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen fuels; Service industry; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Application technologies; Climate protection; Electricity demands; Electricity system; European Commission; Hydrogen production costs; Renewable energies; Synthetic hydrocarbons; Hydrogen production; alternative energy; electricity generation; electrokinesis; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; policy making; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084458129

Carbon capture and storage is a technique that enables separation and storage of CO2 from gas mixtures before emission. Among various carbon capture methods, hydrate-based carbon capture is recognised as a promising technology due to its high CO2 storage capacity and low cost. This paper reviews recent research progress of hydrate-based carbon dioxide capture and sequestration, which is expatiated based on three stages. It discusses: (i) the influence of operating conditions on gas–water mass transfer in the mixing stage; (ii) the effects of thermodynamic promoters to tune the phase equilibrium and kinetic promoters to prompt hydrate formation and separation in the hydrate formation and capture stage; (iii) influencing factors of CH4–CO2 replacement and long-term CO2 sequestration in the sequestration stage. Further, research challenges, namely the phase equilibrium in high-pressure regions, low gas uptake and CO2 gas selectivity, contradictory experimental findings, and overlooked technical issues, are summarised.

To explore the necessity of ECAs in the near future, this paper introduces the fictitious sulphur emission permit allocated to shipping carriers for our considered region. We propose an ECA location problem, which determines the location of ECAs in order to minimize the impact of sulphur emissions on human health, while satisfying the constraint on the fictitious sulphur emission permit. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed for our investigated problem. Numerical experiments are carried out by using our proposed model applied to China and Africa, where the sulphur emissions at different sites are estimated via the fuel consumption calculated by collecting data from liner carriers. Results show that, for the case of China, the Bohai Rim, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta have a high probability for establishing ECAs.

Using an Aethalometer (AE31), equivalent black carbon (eBC) was monitored for 5.5-year after the APPC at Wuhan, a megacity in Central China, to identify its levels, sources, and variations trends. eBC varied in the range of 0.03–12.3 μg m−3, with the highest and lowest values in January (1.98 ± 1.70 μg m−3) and July (0.87 ± 0.61 μg m−3), respectively. The Kolmogorov-Zurbenk (KZ) filter and multiple-linear-regression were adopted to isolate the impacts of source emission control strategies and meteorological conditions on eBC variation. A long-term linear trend showed that emission-related reduction (7.79% yr−1) rather than meteorology-related reduction (4.51% yr−1) dominated the decreasing of eBC in the past years. Combining the KZ filter and Aethalometer model, the trends of eBC from fossil fuel combustion (eBCff) and biomass burning (eBCbb) were calculated. eBCbb and eBCff both showed decreasing trends with the reduction rates of 7.78% yr−1 and 7.76% yr−1, respectively. Backward trajectory analysis indicated that the air masses transported to the observational site from different regions in China all showed decreasing trend (1.64–18.7% yr−1) for eBC due to both the reduction from eBCbb (5.74–16.0% yr−1) and eBCff (7.38–19.7% yr−1), suggesting the positive role of pollution control measures in migrating air pollution across China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control; Black carbon; KZ filter; Source apportionment; Trend analysis","Air pollution; Carbon; Computational complexity; Fog; Fossil fuels; Linear regression; Air pollution prevention; Backward trajectory analysis; Biomass-burning; Black carbon aerosol; Control strategies; Fossil fuel combustion; Meteorological condition; Multiple linear regressions; Emission control; black carbon; fossil fuel; action plan; aerosol; air mass; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; black carbon; climate conditions; emission control; megacity; observational method; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; trend analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; biomass; China; circadian rhythm; combustion; meteorology; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084389373

However, previous studies have not explored the heterogeneous impacts of high-tech industry on CO2 emissions in regions with different levels of high-tech industry development, and not distinguished the direct and indirect impacts. Based on STIRPAT model, this study investigates the impacts of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions in China between 2005 and 2016. Adopting the K-medians cluster method, effects in regions with high, middle, and low levels of high-tech industry development are considered. Indirect effects of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions by affecting industry structure upgrades and economic growth are explored. Empirical results illustrate a positive U-shaped nonlinear link between the level of high-tech industry development and CO2 emissions at the national level and regional (high, middle, and low) level. In terms of indirect impacts, high-tech industry development attenuates the reduction of CO2 emissions due to industry structure upgrades, and promotes economic growth to increase CO2 emissions slightly. The indirect impact intensity gradually decreases as the level of high-tech industry development decreases across three regions. Reasonable implications of our findings are proposed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emissions; Heterogeneous effect; High-tech industry; Nonlinear relationship; STIRPAT model","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; high technology industry; industrial development; numerical model; China; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; industrialization; industry; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Industrial Development; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084370462

To do so we investigated the effects of grain size and enhanced reactivity along grain boundaries on global dissolution kinetics. Variations of permeability and porosity were calculated, and exponential relationships were observed in fractured rocks. Our model employed a reactive transport framework based on the Darcy-Brinkman equation to simulate calcite dissolution in carbonate rocks composed of microporous grains and, included fluid transport along grain boundaries. The model includes fluid flow, solute transport by advection–diffusion, heterogeneous reaction between fluid and minerals and grain detachment with subsequent grain transport in macropores. The migration of solid particles due to dissolution was based on cluster analysis and local movement, and the results show that grain detachment can lead to significant decreases in permeability due to the clogging of transport pathways. Microporous media with smaller grain sizes (fine grains in this study) showed a higher average reaction rate than those with coarser grains. In addition, as the overall rates of geochemical processes are commonly affected by the presence of texture heterogeneities such as fractures, a single fracture (macropore) introduced into a microporous matrix composed of permeable grains and grain boundaries was modelled as a large channel connecting the inlet and outlet of the simulation domain. It was found that macropore clogging by grain detachment temporary decreased permeability, lowering the long-term global reaction rates. We also observed that increases in flow rate can reduce detachment and fracture clogging by reducing local dissolution along grain boundaries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Grain boundary; Grain detachment; Mineral dissolution; Pore-scale reactive transport","carbonate rock; chemical composition; dissolution; grain boundary; grain size; porous medium; sediment chemistry; trace element",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084369477

One of the key reasons for this limitation is the lack of understanding of the dose-response relations for the species in the Arctic region. The present study addresses this knowledge gap. It proposes a new approach to develop dose-response curves for Arctic aquatic species. The application of the approach is demonstrated using the estimation of mortality risk in Boreogadus saida (polar cod) due to exposure from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The proposed approach considers the toxicity mechanism in Arctic species (i.e. polar cod) and regional environmental factors, and models these as a belief-based Bayesian Network (BN). The BN model integrates diverse ecotoxicology biomarker data types and predicts the cell death probability due to exposure to a toxicant (PAH in crude oil). The input data and results from the model were verified using data available in the literature. Seasonal sea ice played a major role in containing PAH exposure and subsequent risk to polar cod. However, the physiological factors, such as presence of higher Phase II activity, and higher oxyradical scavenging ability, had greater impact on PAH risk mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic, polar cod; Bayesian network; Boreogadus saida; Ecotoxicity; Toxicity mechanism","Bayesian networks; Biomarkers; Cell death; Oil spills; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Risk perception; Sea ice; Dose-response curves; Dose-response relations; Ecotoxicological; Environmental factors; Physiological factors; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Scavenging ability; Toxicity mechanisms; Risk assessment; biological marker; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; reactive oxygen metabolite; biological marker; cytochrome P450 1A1; Bayesian analysis; biomarker; demersal fish; ecotoxicology; mortality; oil spill; PAH; pollution exposure; risk assessment; aquatic species; Arctic; Article; Bayesian network; Boreogadus saida; cell death; controlled study; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; hazard assessment; mortality; prediction; risk assessment; sea ice; seasonal variation; teleost; animal; Arctic; Bayes theorem; ecotoxicology; risk assessment; water pollutant; Arctic; Boreogadus saida; Animals; Arctic Regions; Bayes Theorem; Biomarkers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Ecotoxicology; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084367275

The two events were supposed to be correlated, also based on the limited information available about the new virus. Despite that clear indications about the role of particulate matter (PM) in the virus mechanism dispersion cannot be found in literature, some researchers supposed that PM can act as virus carrier, promoting its diffusion through the air. This paper, for the first time, analyses the PM10 situation in Lombardy (from 10th February to March 27, 2020), several days before the sanitary emergency explosion. The data of the detected infection cases are reported and discussed parallelly. As a comparison, the situation of Piedmont, located near to the Lombardy is also presented. Data are reported for Brescia, Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano, Monza-Brianza, Pavia (Lombardy), Alessandria, Vercelli, Novara, Biella, Asti, and Torino (Piedmont). The results show that it is not possible to conclude that COVID-19 diffusion mechanism also occurs through the air, by using PM10 as a carrier. In particular, it is shown that Piedmont cities, presenting lower detected infections cases in comparison to Brescia and Bergamo in the investigated period, had most sever PM10 pollution events in comparison to Lombardy cities.

The index-flood method, a popular approach for RFFA, is based on the assumption that the flood records within a homogeneous region are identically distributed, except for a site-specific index flood. Because of rapidly changing land-use patterns, human interventions, and climate change, recent studies proposed extension of the index-flood method to account for nonstationarity in flood records. This work compared index-flood-based nonstationary RFFA techniques, in both synthetically generated and real-world homogeneous regions, with sites marked by significant trends in flood records. From the data used in the analysis, it is evident that two recently proposed transformation-based approaches are more suitable compared to other methods, and can capture time-varying behavior of floods effectively. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Annual maximum flood; Design flood quantiles; Generalized extreme value distribution; Index-flood method; Nonstationary; Regional flood frequency analysis; Uncertainties","Catchments; Climate change; Flood control; Frequency estimation; Land use; Metadata; Homogeneous regions; Human intervention; Land use pattern; Non-stationarities; Regional flood frequency analysis; Site-specific; Transformation based; Ungauged sites; Floods; catchment; estimation method; flood frequency; frequency analysis; hydrological modeling; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084281614

We explored the extent of hydrocarbon gas emissions from 20 active, inactive, plugged and abandoned oil/gas wells in Indiana (USA), where it is estimated that there are more than 80,000 well sites throughout the state. After this initial survey, using a static flux tent, we quantified fugitive CH4 emissions from an active gas well to approximately 2 L h−1. To evaluate the potential for microbial mitigation of hydrocarbon emissions to the atmosphere, we conducted laboratory microcosm experiments to quantify the CH4 oxidizing potential of soils collected from sites with varying distances to the leaking gas well. Soils in close proximity to the well (0.5 m) efficiently consumed nearly all (97%) of the added CH4, while only 14% of added CH4 was consumed by soils that were more distant from the well (20 m). These results suggest that fugitive CH4 emissions enrich methanotrophic bacteria in soils immediately adjacent to the well. Consistent with this view, we found that prolonged exposure of soils to elevated concentrations of CH4 enhanced the methanotrophic activity. Together, these findings prompted us to design a “methanotrophic soil mound” to assess the feasibility of mitigating point sources of CH4 by harnessing the natural methanotrophic capacity of soil microbial communities. We found that a methanotrophic soil mound from a landfill could sustainably mitigate the CH4 emission from the artificial source, providing a promising low-cost solution to ameliorate fugitive CH4 emissions from abandoned oil and gas wells to the atmosphere. The effectiveness of microbe-based remediation is limited in cold climates and arid environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abandoned well; Gas well; Hydrocarbon emission; Methane leakage; Methanotrophic soil mound; Methanotrophy","Bacteria; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Methane; Natural gas wells; Soil pollution; Soils; Artificial sources; Elevated concentrations; Hydrocarbon emission; Hydrocarbon-gas emissions; Laboratory microcosm; Methanotrophic bacteria; Oxidizing potentials; Soil microbial community; Abandoned wells; anthropogenic source; bacterium; carbon emission; concentration (composition); experimental study; gas well; greenhouse gas; landfill; leakage; methane; microbial activity; mitigation; oil well; oxidation; soil pollution; Indiana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084264036

In this paper, the latest available PM2.5 monitoring data in 2015–2017 and exposure-response relationship model are used to quantitatively analyze the health effect damages due to PM2.5 pollution. The way of disease cost, adjusted human capital, and willingness to pay were adopted to estimate the economic loss of health effect damages. The results show that health effect damages of PM2.5 pollution in 2015–2017 were 11.9251 million, 11.4292 million, and 11.1012 million, respectively, accounting for 7.41%, 7.05%, and 6.94% of the total population of this area. The health effect economic loss was 97.398 billion RMB, 93.516 billion RMB, and 94.485 billion RMB, accounting for 1.73%, 1.53%, and 1.41% of the GDP. Chronic bronchitis and premature death due to PM2.5 are the main sources of health effect economic loss. Elderly people and infants are vulnerable groups of PM2.5 pollution. Affected by economic growth level, population density, and economic structure, Heze, Zhengzhou, Handan, and Liaocheng were greatly affected by PM2.5 pollution, and their health effect damages was larger. The health effect damages and health effect economic loss due to PM2.5 pollution in this area show a downward trend, indicating that air pollution reduction measures have played a positive role. However, the whole effect is still large.

However, agricultural land per capita is decreasing. One of the main reasons for this in the EU and globally is the building of houses or infrastructure on agricultural land. There is a possibility that the Swedish agricultural sector will grow in the future and supply more regions than its own territory with food due to, e.g., climate change. Although appropriate regulations exist to support local decision makers in protecting agricultural land in Sweden, the potential to provide such protection is not fully utilised. This paper aims to contribute to explaining why Swedish municipalities build on agricultural land through an analysis of the values behind the arguments for preserving and exploiting agricultural land at the municipal level and the implications of these values for the preservation of agricultural land in Sweden. Assuming value pluralism, we analyse 30 municipal comprehensive plans through a framework of nine realms of value. We find that municipalities deploy at least eight of the nine realms of value to motivate the preservation of agricultural land, but the economic realm is more dominant among arguments to exploit agricultural land. Most plans do not consider food security. Municipalities could become better prepared to handle unexpected events if they worked with longer-term future scenarios. Further research is needed regarding how different values are weighed against each other in actual exploitation issues. © 2020","Food security; Incommensurability of values; Realms of value; Rural planning; Value pluralism","agricultural land; exploitation; food security; land management; local planning; valuation; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084232331

Statistically significant reduction of black carbon and NOX concentrations, and a decline in the black carbon fraction in PM1 was observed at the Atzmaut monitoring station, suggesting that the measures taken to reduce air pollution as part of the Haifa low emission zone were successful. Regarding NOX concentrations, the reported results for Haifa after the first year of the low emission zone policy (12.9%) are better than those previously reported in Western Europe (mostly 0–7%). As for black carbon, the concentration reduction (10.6%) is less than that reported in Western Europe (mostly 14–60%). Yet, traffic volumes in general and, the fraction of diesel vehicles in the total fleet in particular, differ considerably among different cities. Comparison of trends of black carbon and NOX showed good correlations on both daily (0.96) and half-hourly (0.92) basis. Trends of black carbon, benzene, PM2.5 and PM1 agreed relatively nicely on a daily basis (correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.52 and 0.54, respectively) but only partially on a half-hourly basis (correlation coefficients of 0.52, 0.31 and 0.37, respectively).

The biomass used as an energy resource produces electricity through a biomass gasifier that feeds a microturbine. Considering the types of biomass consumed by the gasifier, the items such as net present cost and cost of energy have been analyzed for the different types of control. Sensitivity studies indicate the increase in the cost of the system by increasing the minimum state of charge in the batteries. However, this increase reduces biomass consumption and CO2 emissions.

Daily samples (24-h sampling) of particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) were collected during the dry season (March–April) in the years 2017 and 2018 from two sampling sites: one in a suburban area of Chiang Mai Province (CM) that is regularly impacted by forest fires during the dry season, and one near an agricultural residue burning source located in Nan Province (NN). Daily average PM2.5 concentrations measured in Chiang Mai from both years (around 38–42 μg/m3) were about 2 times lower when compared to the same time period prior to the implementation of the zero-burning policy (2012–2015) with an average PM2.5 of 67.1 ± 34.1 μg/m3. Comparisons made during La Niña years (which are usually less affected by open burning), i.e. in 2012 (56 μg/m3), make it clear that a drop in PM2.5 values was influenced by the implementation of the zero-burning policy that was enforced for a period of about 60 days in an attempt to control open burning practices in upper Northern Thailand. Based on the patterns of PM2.5 concentrations observed during the dry season, it was determined that the policy could reduce open burning activities during the periods of the policy implementation. However, the zero-burning policy has also contributed to prolonging the smoke haze situation from a 2-month period (mid Feb –mid Apr) to a 3-month-long period (mid Feb–mid May). Moreover, health risks from the inhalation of PM2.5 bound PAHs is of great concern. PM2.5 concentrations at the two study sites were not significantly different, but average concentrations of 16 PAHs at the NN station for both years (̴ 5 ng/m3) were higher than those at the CM station (̴ 2 ng/m3). Therefore, exposure to PM2.5 at Nan area was more hazardous than at Chiang Mai. The ratio of some PAHs, i.e. BaA/(BaA + CHR) and IND/(IND + BPER), were used to determine the potential pollutant sources during the dry season, and it was found that PM2.5 at both sampling sites probably originated from similar source origins, i.e. wide-spread biomass burning (major source) and traffic emissions (minor source). In addition, not only are fine particulate matters a concern, but their chemical composition, particularly the levels of carcinogenic compounds that are bound to the PMs, are also believed to be a significant cause of these adverse health effects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Carcinogen; Climate impact; Open burning; PAHs; PM2.5; Zero-burning policy","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Deforestation; Drought; Health; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Smoke; Adverse health effects; Aerodynamic diameters; Average concentration; Carcinogenic compounds; Chemical compositions; Environmental issues; Fine particulate matter; Policy implementations; Health risks; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; ambient air; biomass burning; cancer; climate change; episodic event; hazardous waste; haze; health risk; PAH; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution policy; smoke; suburban area; traffic emission; air pollutant; ambient air; Article; biomass; cancer risk; chemical composition; climate; combustion; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dry season; economic aspect; environmental policy; haze; health hazard; inhalation; particulate matter; priority journal; smoke; suburban area; Thailand; Chiang Mai [Northern Region]; Nan; Northern Region [Thailand]; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084222908

CAM species show an inverted pattern of stomatal opening and closing across the diel cycle, which conserves water and provides a means of maintaining growth in hot, water-limited environments. Recent genome sequencing of the constitutive model CAM species Kalanchoë fedtschenkoi provides a platform for elucidating the ensemble of proteins that link photosynthetic metabolism with stomatal movement, and that protect CAM plants from harsh environmental conditions. We describe a large-scale proteomics analysis to characterize and compare proteins, as well as diel changes in their abundance in guard cell-enriched epidermis and mesophyll cells from leaves of K. fedtschenkoi. Proteins implicated in processes that encompass respiration, the transport of water and CO2, stomatal regulation, and CAM biochemistry are highlighted and discussed. Diel rescheduling of guard cell starch turnover in K. fedtschenkoi compared with that observed in Arabidopsis is reported and tissue-specific localization in the epidermis and mesophyll of isozymes implicated in starch and malate turnover are discussed in line with the contrasting roles for these metabolites within the CAM mesophyll and stomatal complex. These data reveal the proteins and the biological processes enriched in each layer and provide key information for studies aiming to adapt plants to hot and dry environments by modifying leaf physiology for improved plant sustainability. © 2020 The Authors.

In this work, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to analyze and predict ambient PM2.5 in eight regional core cities in China to resolve the clashes, and the conclusions are listed as follows. Gaseous air pollutants (SO2, NO2, O3 and CO) are way more momentous than meteorological conditions in shaping PM2.5. PM2.5 level is dominated by the ups and downs of gaseous air pollutants, indicating the predominance of secondary inorganic aerosols and the existence of thermodynamic equilibrium between PM2.5 and gaseous air pollutants. The secondary PM2.5 tends to be generated within one hour. We quantitatively demonstrate that the primary emissions change and long-range transport are ubiquitously and conspicuously insignificant throughout the main cities of China and reductions of the gaseous air pollutants are most essential for regulating PM2.5. Furthermore, the phenology of local flora as the minor cause and lopsided thermodynamic equilibrium shift triggered by temperature change as the major cause elicit the severity of PM2.5 in wintertime--for every Celsius degree of temperature drop, PM2.5 increases by 5.9 μg/m3. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Insignificance of long-range transport; Machine learning; Secondary inorganic aerosols; Thermodynamic equilibrium","Aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Accurate prediction; Long range transport; Meteorological condition; Multi layer perceptron; Primary emissions; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Temperature changes; Thermodynamic equilibria; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; long range transport; particulate matter; prediction; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; air temperature; ambient air; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric transport; China; city; flora; geographic distribution; measurement accuracy; meteorology; multilayer perceptron; particulate matter; phenology; prediction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; secondary inorganic aerosol; thermodynamics; winter; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084220500

Herein, Si-nanowires (SiNWs) decorated with reduced graphene oxide:carbon quantum dots (rGO:CQDs) nanocomposite (NC), as core–shell heterojunction building blocks for broadband (ultraviolet (UV)–near infrared (NIR)) photodetectors (PDs), are demonstrated. The SiNWs and CQDs are synthesized by wet-chemical etching and facile pyrolysis methods, respectively. Photogenerated carriers are transported through rGO because of its high electron mobility and favorable band alignment with CQDs and Si. Further, to minimize the recombination of photogenerated carriers, and enhance the response in the visible region, plasmon-enhanced AuCQDs are incorporated in the shell matrix. The optimized heterostructure (rGO:AuCQDs/undoped CQDs/SiNWs) is sensitive to a broad wavelength range covering the UV to NIR (360 to 940 nm) region, manifests the excellent responsivity of 16 A W−1 at 360 nm, detectivity (D*) of 2.2 × 1013 Jones, and noise equivalent power as low as 2.8 fW Hz−1/2.

Quantitatively assessing the impact of VOCs on ozone (O3) formation could provide valuable information for the management of emission reduction and photochemical pollution control. In this study, we first figured out the ozone pollution episodes during 2018 at Dianshan Lake (DSL), which is located in the suburban area of Shanghai and is adjacent to three provinces of the YRD region. Then we analyzed continuous variation of O3 precursors and meteorological parameters. The online measurements show that the average volume mixing ratio of total VOCs (TVOC) was 15.41 ± 11.39 ppbv during the ozone pollution episodes, with the largest contribution from alkanes. To further identify the sources of VOCs, VOC concentration-weighted trajectories (CWT) were analyzed, and the results suggested that Zhejiang province could be the most important source region of VOCs at DSL. Analysis using an observation-base model showed that NOx and alkenes exhibited the most significant negative and positive influences on O3 formation, respectively. As for individual species, toluene and isoprene, whose S-weighted concentrations were 6.67 × 10−2 and 5.94 × 10−2 ppbv, respectively, were the key factors promoting the formation of O3 at DSL. To control the increase of O3, considering the policy feasibility, the abatement ratio of VOCs/NOx should be no less than 0.72. The findings advanced our knowledge of VOCs and their impact on O3 formation and will be helpful in formulating emission control strategies for coping with O3 pollution in YRD region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Observation-based model (OBM); Ozone formation; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs); Yangtze River Delta","Digital subscriber lines; Emission control; Hydrocarbons; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Control strategies; Emission reduction; Meteorological parameters; On-line measurement; Photochemical pollution; Photochemical smog; Secondary organic aerosols; Zhejiang Province; Air pollution; acetylene; alkane; butane; carbon monoxide; ethane; ethylbenzene; ethylene; hexane; isoprene; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; para xylene; propane; propylene; sulfur dioxide; toluene; volatile organic compound; aerosol; emission control; ozone; pollutant source; smog; suburban area; urban pollution; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric pressure; China; coping behavior; flame ionization detection; humidity; meteorology; photolysis; pollution control; priority journal; suburban area; temperature; China; Lake Dianshan; Shanghai; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084207453

The Texas High Plains is a semi-arid region that faces major challenges from climate change risks and dwindling groundwater supply from the exhaustible Ogallala Aquifer for sustaining irrigated agriculture. The overall goal of this study was to assess the impacts of climate change on yield and water use of grain sorghum and identify optimum climate change adaptation strategies for three study sites in the Texas High Plains. Future climate data projected by nine Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of greenhouse gas emissions (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) were used as input for the DSSAT CSM-CERES-Sorghum model. The climate change adaptation strategies were designed by modifying crop genotype parameters to incorporate drought tolerance, heat tolerance, high yield potential, and long maturity traits. Irrigated and dryland grain sorghum yield and irrigation water use were projected to decrease at varying percentages at the study sites in the future. On an average (of 9 GCMs), irrigated grain sorghum yield is expected to decrease by 5–13 % and 16–27 % by mid-century (2036–2065) and late-century (2066–2095), respectively under RCP 8.5 compared to the baseline (1976–2005). The irrigation water use is expected to decrease by 7–9% and 14–16 % by the mid-century and late-century, respectively. Among the adaptation strategies, an ideotype with high yield potential trait (10 % higher partitioning to the panicle, radiation use efficiency, and relative leaf size than the reference cultivar) resulted in maximum grain sorghum yield gains in the future under both irrigated (6.9 %–17.1 %) and dryland (7.5 %–17.1 %) conditions, when compared to the reference cultivar. Enhancing drought tolerance by increasing root density at different soil depths also resulted in a significantly higher irrigated grain sorghum yield than the reference cultivar. A longer maturity cultivar will likely increase irrigation water use and, therefore, is not recommended for water limited conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Drought tolerance; DSSAT CSM CERES-Sorghum; Genetic adaptation; Heat tolerance; Long maturity; Yield potential","alternative agriculture; climate change; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; drought; genotype; high yielding variety; semiarid region; sorghum; strategic approach; water use efficiency; Ogallala Aquifer; Texas; United States; Sorghum bicolor bicolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084153148

Using WRF-FLEXPART atmospheric diffusion model, this paper simulated the pollutant diffusion processes of two steel industries from Oct. 2018 to Mar. 2019 in Caofeidian district, and then analysed the pollutant diffusion characteristics, the impacts of atmospheric circulation and local circulation on pollutants diffusion, the contribution of steel industry emissions on air quality nearby emission sources and air quality observation stations. According to the statistics, the emissions of particulate matter from Jingtang (JT)and Wenfeng (WF) steelworks are 669 and 69tonsduring the period of Oct. 2018–Mar. 2019, respectively. Under the influence of East Asian winter monsoon circulation, most of the pollutants emitted from JT and WF are diffused and transported to the Bohai Sea. The contribution of emissions from JT and WF on the concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of less than 2.5(PM2.5) in Caofeidian is relatively small, with the daily maximums of local contribution rate on PM2.5 concentration from JT and WF reaching about 15% for both.

We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Methods: Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 per protocol. Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings. The incidence of COVID-19 per million population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking. Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored. Findings: Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR. The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower (p<0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5). The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%). We observed 11 COVID-19 clusters in recreational ‘mask-off’ settings compared to only 3 in workplace ‘mask-on’ settings (p = 0.036 by Chi square test of goodness-of-fit). Conclusion: Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19. © 2020 The British Infection Association","Community; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Face mask; SARS-COV-2","BCG vaccine; Article; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; France; Germany; health care facility; health care system; Hong Kong; human; incidence; infection control; Italy; major clinical study; outpatient department; pandemic; population density; respiratory tract disease; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Singapore; social distance; South Korea; Spain; tuberculosis; United Kingdom; United States; virus transmission; workplace; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; protective clothing; public health; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Clothing; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084140912

Radiation heat transfer, gas-phase chemistry and soot formation are strongly coupled and highly dependent on temperature. Thus, it is of primary importance that simplified radiative models are able to reproduce detailed simulations at conditions found in flames of interest. In this work, the capabilities of the superposition WSGG radiation model is compared to the LBL spectral integration for a set of laminar non-premixed counterflow flames of ethylene burning with oxygen-rich oxidizer. The numerical solutions for both thermal radiation approaches are fully coupled with detailed chemistry and a discrete sectional model for soot formation. The role of thermal radiation and the importance of radiation absorption on soot formation were explored through systematic replacement of N2 by CO2 on either the fuel or on the oxidizer. In addition, the validity of the simplified optically thin approximation for modeling such flames was also discussed. The spectral superposition WSGG model is able to accurately describe general flame structure and soot predictions respective to the LBL integration for both the reference flame and for the cases of CO2 addition in the fuel and in the oxidizer mixtures. For the CO2 addition flames, the WSGG model tends to overestimate the radiation emission on high temperature regions and to overestimate the radiation absorption on low temperatures towards the reactant with CO2 addition. However, these discrepancies were not sufficient to significantly influence the flame structure. Some non-negligible discrepancies are observed only at very small strain rates. Finally, the evaluation of the soot spectral radiation coefficient (Cκ,s) reveled an important influence on the soot volume volume fraction for low levels of CO2 addition. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","CO2 addition; Laminar counterflow flame; LBL integration; Radiative transfer; Soot sectional method; WSGG model","Carbon dioxide; Dust; Ethylene; Flame research; Heat radiation; Soot; Strain rate; Counterflow flames; Detailed chemistry; Gas phase chemistry; Numerical solution; Radiation absorption; Radiation emissions; Radiation modeling; Spectral radiation; Radiation effects; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; oxygen; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Article; flame; heat loss; heat transfer; low temperature; oxidation; priority journal; radiation; radiation absorption; radiation response; refraction index; simulation; soot; temperature; thickness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084136916

In spite of sharp divisions in terms of how to understand and operationalize L&D, most approaches draw on classic environmental governance, with discrete analogic interventions implemented by States and international actors. L&D is mainly envisioned as an “international court of climate justice” that identifies the culprits (emitters), quantifies harm, and compensates victims. While digital technologies and algorithmic governance have colonized many germane policy fields and virtually all economic sectors, in the L&D field a substantive discussion on the use of information and communication technologies, algorithms, and user-generated data has been conspicuously absent. By taking the prospect of a “digitalization” of L&D seriously, this advanced review identifies the seeds of emerging digitalized approaches to L&D through an overview of literature. We focus on examples in three key domains associated with L&D—insurance, disaster responses and risk management, and human displacement. These empirical cases are used to investigate the modes of governance that accompany the digital tools through which L&D could be implemented, and the profound changes in climate politics and justice that would accompany a digitalization/algorithmization of L&D.

However, the fundamental question of what factors make a forest susceptible to deer damage remains unanswered, hampering efforts to mitigate against damage. Previous research has assumed that deer density consistently increases forest damage. However, the effect of deer density is likely to be contingent on a range of other drivers, such as climate and landscape structure. Mitigation measures are expensive, so a sound understanding of these contingencies is required to inform the targeting of appropriate management to forests most at risk of damage. Using records of forest damage from Britain's National Forest Inventory, which comprises over 15,000 plots spanning environmental gradients, we applied a multiscale approach to identify the drivers of forest susceptibility to damage by deer. Damage likelihood was dependent on drivers operating at multiple spatial scales and their interactions. Broadleaved stands with low tree densities and old trees were consistently found to be at high risk across Britain. The statistical influence of surrounding forest cover within 500 m of a site was modified by regional deer density and climate, in addition to landscape-level perennial cover. The effect of deer density on damage was therefore not straightforward, but context dependent. Synthesis and applications. We predict the likely outcome of afforestation initiatives on the likelihood that a forest site will be damaged by deer, with important implications for management and landscape planning in Britain. The complex interactive effects uncovered are difficult to interpret. We therefore provide an interactive Deer Damage Tool (R Shiny application; https://spake.shinyapps.io/DEERDAMAGETOOL/) for practitioners to visualize how afforestation is likely to influence the probability of deer damage in different forests and regions across Britain. © 2020 The Authors.

Towards this end, we investigated the PM2.5-associated metals in two densely populated regions of China, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions, across land-use gradients. Using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, we performed an integrated source apportionment to quantify the contributions of the major source categories underlying metal-induced health risks with information on the bioaccessibility (using simulated lung fluid) and speciation (using synchrotron-based techniques) of metals. The results showed that the particulate trace metal profiles reflected the land-use gradient within each region, with the highest concentrations of anthropogenically enriched metals at the industrial sites in the study regions. The resulting carcinogenic risk that these elements posed was higher in the YRD than in the PRD. Chromium was the dominant contributor to the total excessive cancer risks posed by metals while manganese accounted for a large proportion of non-carcinogenic risks. An elevated contribution from industrial emissions was found in the YRD, while traffic emissions and non-traffic combustion (the burning of coal/waste/biomass) were the common dominant sources of cancer and non-cancer risks posed by metals in both regions. Moreover, the risk-oriented source apportionment of metals did not mirror the mass concentration-based one, suggesting the insufficiency of the latter to inform emission mitigation in favor of public health. While providing region-specific insights into the quantitative contribution of major source categories to the health risks of PM2.5-associated trace metals, our study highlighted the need to consider the health protection goal-based source apportionment and emission mitigation in supplement to the current mass concentration-based framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioaccessibility; Health risk; Land-use gradient; PM2.5; Source apportionment; Trace metal","Air pollution control; Coal combustion; Diseases; Factorization; Industrial emissions; Land use; Metals; Particles (particulate matter); River pollution; Trace elements; Densely populated regions; Emission mitigation; Fine particulate matter; Particulate trace metals; Positive matrix factorization models; Simulated lung fluid; Source apportionment; Synchrotron based techniques; Health risks; chromium; coal; trace metal; metal; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health risk; particulate matter; pollution control; source apportionment; speciation (chemistry); trace metal; air pollution; Article; biomass; cancer risk; carcinogenicity; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; ecotoxicity; environmental factor; health hazard; human; particulate matter; public health; waste disposal; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; China; Guangdong; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Metals; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084093336

An online survey was conducted with 503 users of the bicycles in China at year 2018, and the data were analyzed with the partial least sequenced structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). We find that shared electric bicycle’s service quality has a positive effect on attitude toward shared electric bicycle and behavior intention, which, in turn, influence low-carbon commuting of shared electric bicycle’s behavior. However, the residual effects of past behavior has no effect on further behavior of shared electric bicycles. Moreover, we also find that perceived behavioral control positively affect shared electric bicycle’ intention and positively moderate the relationship between attitude and behavioral intention. Based on our findings, we discuss the policy implications and further studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Perceived behavioral control; Residual effects of past behavior; Service quality; Shared electric bicycle; TPB model","atmospheric pollution; climate change; electric vehicle; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; China; attitude; behavior; China; cycling; questionnaire; Attitude; Bicycling; China; Intention; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084072613

To achieve the goal, the dynamic panel data model was employed to explore the nonlinear relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions for 166 cities in China taking the period 2005–2015, and the Gini coefficient of urban population size distribution in 15 urban agglomerations were calculated to analyze whether the spatial agglomeration of cities contributed to environmental protection. The results show that there is an inverted U-shaped curve between urbanization and carbon emissions; high-level urbanization development helps reduce carbon emissions; the spatial agglomeration of cities can contribute to carbon reduction to a certain extent based on the empirical results of the spatial agglomeration promotes the early arrival of the inflection point in the inverted U-shaped relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions; and the improvement of urban agglomeration level can present an abatement effect on carbon emissions at a lower urbanization level, which enhances the positive environmental effect of urbanization development compared with the decentralized urban distribution model. Furthermore, there is a significant U-shaped relationship between spatial agglomeration and carbon emissions, which indicates that the scientific planning of urban clusters will achieve economies of scale and agglomeration effect, thereby reducing carbon emissions.

However, the interactions and niche partitioning of DAMO bacteria and archaea in freshwater wetland soils, in addition to the interactions among microorganisms that couple methane and nitrogen cycling is still unclear, despite that these factors may govern the fate of methane and nitrogen in wetlands. Here, we evaluated the vertical distribution of DAMO bacteria and archaea in soil layers along with the potential interactions among populations in the methane-coupled nitrogen cycling microbial community of Tibetan freshwater wetlands. A combination of molecular biology, stable isotope tracer technology, and microbial bioinformatics was used to evaluate these interrelated dynamics. The abundances and potential methane oxidation rates indicated that DAMO bacteria and archaea differentially occupy surface and subsurface soil layers, respectively. The inferred interactions between DAMO bacteria and nitrogen cycling microorganisms within their communities are complex, DAMO bacteria apparently achieve an advantage in the highly competitive environment of surface soils layers and occupy a specific niche in those environments. Conversely, the apparent relationships between DAMO archaea and nitrogen cycling microorganisms are relatively simple, wherein high levels of cooperation are inferred between DAMO archaea and nitrate-producing organisms in subsurface soils layers. These results suggest that the vertical distribution patterns of DAMO bacteria and archaea enable them to play significant roles in the methane oxidation activity of different soil layers and collectively form an effective methane filtration consortium. © 2020 The Authors","Alpine wetland; ANME-2d; Methane filtration; NC10; Niche differentiation","Denitrification; Methane; Molecular biology; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Soils; Trace analysis; Water; Wetlands; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Competitive environment; Methane oxidation activity; Methane oxidation rates; Microbial communities; Stable isotope tracers; Subsurface soil layers; Vertical distributions; Bacteria; carbon 13; fresh water; methane; methane; denitrification; experimental study; filtration; isotopic composition; methane; microbial community; niche; nitrogen cycle; stable isotope; vertical distribution; wetland; archaeon; Article; bioinformatics; controlled study; denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation; denitrifying bacterium; ecological niche; filtration; microbial community; microbial interaction; molecular biology; nitrogen cycling; nonhuman; organisms by metabolism; priority journal; quantitative analysis; soil; wetland; anaerobic growth; archaeon; genetics; Methylococcaceae; oxidation reduction reaction; Tibet; wetland; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Methane; Methylococcaceae; Oxidation-Reduction; Tibet; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084068964

The aim of this study was to evaluate the resilience and nutritional quality of 11 highbush blueberry cultivars and two new selections (from the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Ltd breeding program) in Mediterranean hot summer climate conditions by measuring plant yield, seasonality, fruit sensorial traits, and phytochemical content in the fruits. RESULTS: The new blueberry genotype PFR005 showed a high level of adaptability to these environmental conditions, with the highest total plant yield, whereas PFR075 was the best genotype for nutritional characteristics. Among the cultivars, ‘Cosmopolitan’ showed the maximum average fruit weight, ‘Blueray’ and ‘Hortblue Poppins’ demonstrated a good sensorial profile, while the best cultivars from the nutritional point of view were ‘Hortblue Poppins’, ‘Hortblue Petite’, and ‘Early Blue’. Conclusion: New cultivars and new genotypes able to satisfy the needs of different users, have been identified. The integration of germplasm evaluation with a tailored breeding program will help to create new cultivars that will be useful for the expansion of blueberry cultivation in hot Mediterranean summer climate conditions, which up to now have limited this crop. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","fruit quality; phenolic acids; phytochemicals; plant yield; Vaccinium; vitamin C","blueberry; chemistry; climate; fruit; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; heat; nutritional value; season; Southern Europe; Blueberry Plants; Climate; Fruit; Genotype; Hot Temperature; Mediterranean Region; Nutritive Value; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084060969

Although the country has its own institutional framework on disaster risk reduction, a number of issues limit LGUs’ potential to perform its role. This study focused on building institutional resilience of LGUs towards building climate risk resilience in Aurora, Philippines by engaging key actors in the formulation of Local Climate Change Action Plans (LCCAP). The study adopted the shared learning process from the Climate Resilience Framework (CRF) to strengthen partnership and implement capacity building activities, aimed at developing the Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment (CDRA) and LCCAP beyond compliance. An institutional capacity assessment was administered through a survey involving 87 members of the Technical Working Group (TWG) from eight municipalities and provincial government. Institutional capacity was measured using 70 indicators representing access rights and entitlements, information flows, decision-making processes, application of new knowledge, capacity to anticipate risk, capacity to respond, as well as capacity to recover and change. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Both Spearman Correlation and Cramer's V determined the interrelationship between socio-demographic variables and institutional characteristics. Results revealed that the LGUs performed better in risk response and management. A strong correlation between expertise and position vis-à-vis all resilient institution metrics was also observed, while gender is moderately correlated with all parameters except access rights and entitlements. Three key areas, not adequately articulated in current literature, need to be improved to enhance institutional resilience towards climate and disaster risks, namely: staffing and human resource; access to financial support from other sources; and development of knowledge management systems. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Institutional resilience; Local climate change action plan; Local government units; Shared learning process","capacity building; climate change; decision making; disaster management; hazard assessment; local government; risk assessment; article; capacity building; climate resilience; collaborative learning; decision making; demography; disaster; female; gender; government; human; knowledge management; male; Philippines; risk assessment; city; climate change; disaster; Philippines; Aurora [Central Luzon]; Cities; Climate Change; Disasters; Humans; Philippines; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084052040

As the economic center of the Shandong province and part of the first batch of open coastal cities in China, Qingdao has been frequently plagued by volatile organic compound (VOC) pollution along with its rapid economic development and urbanization in recent years. In this study, a high spatiotemporal resolution VOC emission inventory for Qingdao was established for the year 2016 using updated source-specific emission factors and the latest activity data for different sources. The anthropogenic sources considered in this study are classified into seven major sources and 46 subcategories. The results indicated that a total of 151.5 kt of VOCs were emitted in Qingdao in 2016. The three largest emission sources, industrial process, on-road mobile, and solvent use sources accounted for 49.9% 20.1%, and 14.1% of the total VOC emissions, respectively. Spatially, the Huangdao District (57.9 kt), the Chengyang District (15.4 kt), and Pingdu City (15.1 kt) were the top three emitters of VOCs. The high concentration of VOCs was mainly distributed in the central areas of Qingdao city and the emissions distribution was highly consistent with its road network. The maximum monthly VOC emissions occurred in June (14.4 kt) and the minimum monthly VOC emissions occurred mainly in February (9.5 kt). The uncertainties in the emission inventory were quantified using a Monte Carlo simulation provided by the Oracle Crystal Ball software. There exist relatively high uncertainties in the on-road mobile (-84.79%, 252.07%), biomass burning (-65.38%, 134.77%) and industrial process (-36.08%, 133.62%) sources. For the complicated species and different reaction rates of ozone formation, the control of the amount of VOCs emitted and the highly reactive VOCs are equally important. Based on the emissions of individual VOC species and the corresponding maximum incremental reactivity (MIR), the ozone formation potential (OFP) profiles of Qingdao City were constructed. The results indicated that alkenes/alkynes and aromatics contributed the most to the OFP and that m/p-xylene, ethylene, propylene, formaldehyde, toluene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, 1-butene, o-xylene, and 1-pentene were the top 10 individual VOC species contributing to the OFP. The contribution of industrial process and on-road mobile sources accounted for 37.5% and 24.5% of the total OFP in Qingdao City, respectively. Both the large VOC emission and OFP indicate that the focus of VOC emission control should be on industrial process and on-road mobile sources in Qingdao City. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","formation potential; Ozone; Qingdao City; Spatial and temporal allocation; VOC emission inventory","Air quality; Butenes; Computer software; Emission control; Ethylene; Intelligent systems; Mobile power plants; Monte Carlo methods; Ozone; Reaction rates; Roads and streets; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality modeling; Anthropogenic sources; Emission inventories; Maximum incremental reactivities; On-road mobile sources; Ozone formation potentials; Spatio-temporal resolution; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Organic solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084051679

However, participation in PES projects is voluntary, uncertain and some people's participation is more important than others. In this article, we use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine factors that determine local peoples’ participation in state (Rwoho and Kasagala) and private (‘Undisclosed’ and Hoima) forestry carbon projects in Uganda. We find that such determinants vary within and between projects. For example, older people with more land parcels were more likely to participate in private projects compared to their counterparts in state projects. In plantation forests, participation was motivated by access to forest products (timber and charcoal), while the desire to conserve water sources was important for participants adjacent to natural forests. While expected carbon payments were important in one state project, they were less significant in the others. Non-participation was linked to high entry costs, distrust for forest managers in state projects and non-ownership of natural forests. In all case studies, non-participation was mainly associated to limited project information. To gain broad participation, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and other PES mechanisms must critically identify and consider community specific needs, expectations and concerns in their design and implementation. This requires willingness to diagnose community concerns and allow adjustments. © 2020 The Author(s)","Capital assets: REDD+, Uganda; Community participation; Forestry carbon; Payment for environmental services",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084036494

The average effectiveness of RFMs was in the range of 0.7–83.5%, 3.5–68.1%, 0.8–46.1%, and 0.4–32.2% in reducing ambient PNC, PM10, PM2.5, and PM1, respectively. Considering all metrics, the highest effectiveness was observed always for Biomask, followed by 3 M 9332, due to their well-designed physical characteristics (e.g., adjustable nose clip for any face/nose shape, and size, soft inner material in the nose panel to provide a secure seal against leakage, adjustable or elasticated straps/ear loops to better adjust on any face). Biomask reduced ambient PM10 with a mean value of 94.6 μg m−3 (minimum–maximum: 51.7–100.3 μg m−3), whereas it filtered on average just 29.0 μg m−3 (25.7–43.5 μg m−3) of ambient PM2.5 and 18.2 μg m−3 (14.7–21.8 μg m−3) of PM1. A fuzzy analytical hierarchy process to find the most important design-related factors of RFMs affecting their effectiveness, which showed the exhalation valve and its diaphragm (20.4%), nose clip (19.7%), and cheek flaps (18.6%) are ranked as the main design-related variables. The fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution indicated that Biomask and 3M 9332 had scores of 1 and 0.97, the highest scores compared with other RFMs. This study provides crucial evidence-based results to elucidate the effectiveness and design-related factors of RFMs in real-environmental circumstances. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Effectiveness; Particulate matter air pollution; Real-world condition; Respirator face mask; Tehran","aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; developing country; environmental monitoring; exposure; human; Iran; mask; mechanical ventilator; particle size; particulate matter; procedures; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Developing Countries; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Iran; Masks; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Ventilators, Mechanical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084033567

An improved understanding of direct versus indirect effects of warming on ecosystem processes is needed for robust predictions of the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics. To explore potential direct and indirect effects of warming on C dynamics in arctic tundra heath, we established a warming (open top chambers) and dominant plant species (Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup) removal experiment at a high and low elevation site. We measured the individual and interactive effects of warming, dominant species removal and elevation on plant species cover, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), temperature, soil moisture and instantaneous net ecosystem CO2 exchange. We hypothesized that ecosystems would be stronger CO2 sinks at the low elevation site, and that warming and species removal would weaken the CO2 sink because warming should increase ecosystem respiration (ER) and species removal should reduce gross primary productivity (GPP). Furthermore, we hypothesized that warming and species removal would have the greatest impact on processes at the high elevation where site temperature should be most limiting and dominant species may buffer the overall community to environmental stress more compared to the low elevation site where plants are more likely to compete with the dominant species. The instantaneous CO2 flux, which reflected a weak CO2 sink, was similar at both elevations. Neither experimental warming nor dominant species removal significantly changed GPP or instantaneous net ecosystem CO2 exchange even though species removal significantly reduced ER, NDVI and LAI. Our results show that even the loss of dominant plant species may not result in significant landscape-scale responses of net ecosystem CO2 exchange to warming. They also show that NDVI and LAI may be limited in their ability to predict changes in GPP in these tundra heaths systems. Our study highlights the need for more detailed vegetation analyses and ground-truthed measurements in order to accurately predict direct and indirect impacts of climatic change on ecosystem C dynamics.

Some antioxidants (flavonoids and carotenoids), and byproducts of membrane rupture (lipofuscins) and chlorophyll degradation (pheophytins), are chloroplasts’ fluorescent metabolites directly involved in plant response to environmental stressors and pollutants and may act as a biomarker of stress. Here we hypothesized that climatic variations and air pollutants induce alterations in the emission profile of chloroplasts’ fluorescent metabolites in Tillandsia usneoides (Bromeliaceae). To test this hypothesis, an active biomonitoring study was performed during 2 years in five polluted sites located at the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (São Paulo State, Brazil), aiming to identify target chloroplasts’ fluorescent metabolites acting as biomarkers of environmental stress. In situ identification and quantification of the intensity of the fluorescence emission from target metabolites (flavonoids, carotenoids, lipofuscins, and pheophytins) were performed by the observation of fresh leaf sections under confocal laser scanning microscopy. Changes in the profile of fluorescence emission were correlated with local climate and air pollution data. The fluorescence emissions of flavonoids and carotenoids varied seasonally, with significant influence of rainfall and NO2. Our results expand the use of T. usneoides as a bioindicator by using alterations in the fluorescence emission profile of chloroplast metabolites.

Therefore, it is important to study the coupling degree and coupling path between these two factors in various provinces in China, and thereby promote the development of China’s low-carbon economy. We first calculate carbon emission efficiency using the Super-SBM model, then analyze an extended coupling model between carbon emission efficiency and industrial structure upgrading, and finally design the coupling paths using the framework of distribution dynamics. There are three main findings. First, the coupling degree of nearly half the provinces is at the level of mild-to-moderate imbalance recession. And in terms of specific coupling characteristics, nearly half the provinces belong to the type “low-level coordination,” with a low development degree and high coordination degree. Second, there is an obvious dynamic imbalance between China’s carbon emission efficiency and industrial structure upgrading, and the “low-level trap” of regional carbon emission efficiency is more serious than that of regional industrial structure upgrading. Finally, if the government prioritizes provinces with low carbon emission efficiency, carbon emission efficiency and the coupling efficiency with industrial structure can be improved, which would not only improve the coupling degree within each region but also alleviate the disharmony between regions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission efficiency; Coupling coordination degree model (CCDM); Coupling path; Cure; Upgrading industrial structure","carbon emission; efficiency measurement; emission control; environmental economics; industrial development; industrial structure; state role; China; carbon; China; economic development; industry; productivity; Carbon; China; Economic Development; Efficiency; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083982118

The policy prescription has relied almost exclusively on a single approach: reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other GHGs. Since 1990, global CO2 emissions have increased 60%, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have raced past 400 ppm, and temperatures increased at an accelerating rate. The one-prong strategy has not worked. After reviewing emission mitigation's poor performance and low-probability of delivering on long-term climate goals, we advance a three-pronged strategy for mitigating climate change risks: adding adaptation and amelioration—through solar radiation management (SRM)—to the emission mitigation approach. We highlight SRM's potential, at dramatically lower cost than emission mitigation, to play a key role in offsetting warming. We address the moral hazard reservation held by environmental advocates—that SRM would diminish emission mitigation incentives—and posit that SRM deployment might even serve as an “awful action alert” that galvanizes more ambitious emission mitigation. We conclude by emphasizing the value of an iterative act-learn-act policy framework that engages all three prongs for limiting climate change damages. © 2020 by the Southern Economic Association","adaptation; carbon pricing; catastrophic risk; climate change; decision-making under uncertainty; geoengineering; greenhouse gases; mitigation; solar radiation management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083958438

Bangladesh, one of the world's top rice-consuming countries, has a large number of rice parboiling industries. Local rice parboiling industries, known as ‘Chatal mills’, are responsible for huge energy consumption in the rice processing sector because rice parboiling step ingests 95% of total energy and water in local rice processing industries. However, these local rice parboiling industries use an ancient parboiling system with low efficiency and little safeguards against mishaps. In most of the local rice parboiling industries, the parboiling step has an efficiency of around 15-20%, which results in enormous harmful emissions, huge wastage of energy and high cost of operation. In this study, a safer and more efficient rice parboiling boiler (improved boiler) has been designed as well as trialed successfully in a local rice parboiling factory. Water and energy requirement is significantly less in the improved boiler compared to the conventional ones. The improved boiler saves fuel and water up to 43% and 38% respectively compared to the traditional boiler. The increasing energy efficiency subsequently reduces the stack emission such as the particular matter (PM) by 24.8%, carbon monoxide (CO) by 71.0% and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by 44.7%. Moreover, adopting the improved boiler also could save up to 705,600 Ton of greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) each year in Bangladesh. Hence, improved fuel economy and eco-friendliness of the improved boiler make it a sustainable choice for local rice parboiling industry. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Cleaner Production; Energy efficiency; Fuel saving; GHG saving; Rice parboiling boiler; Water saving","Boilers; Carbon monoxide; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Greenhouse gases; Sulfur dioxide; Harmful emissions; High costs; Parboiled rice; Processing industry; South Asia; Stack emissions; Total energy; Water and energies; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083897109

Objectives: This study investigated the independent and co-pollutant association of long-term exposures to ambient air pollutants on asthma-associated outcomes in a cohort of schoolchildren in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Methods: A total of 590 grade-4 schoolchildren residing in four informal settlements were studied. Spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric-oxide (FeNO) measurements were conducted, including a standardized questionnaire administered to caregivers at baseline and 12-months follow-up. Annual NO2 and PM2.5 levels were estimated for each child's home using land-use regression modelling. Single- and two-pollutant models were constructed to assess the independent and co-pollutant association of both air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) on new cases of asthma-associated outcomes adjusting-for host characteristics, indoor exposures and study area. Results: The annual average concentration of PM2.5 and NO2 were 10.01μg/m3 and 16.62μg/m3 respectively, across the four study areas, and were below the local Standards of 20μg/m3 and 40μg/m3, for both pollutants, respectively. In the two-pollutant-adjusted models, an interquartile range (IQR) increase of 14.2μg/m3 in NO2 was associated with an increased risk of new onset of ocular-nasal symptoms (adjusted odds ratio–aOR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01–2.60), wheezing (aOR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.18–10.92), more than two or more asthma symptom score (aOR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.02–2.86), and airway inflammation defined as FeNO &gt; 35 ppb (aOR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.10–8.71), independent of PM2.5 exposures. Conclusion: This study provided evidence that ambient NO2 levels below local standards and international guidelines, independent of PM2.5 exposure, increases new cases of asthma-associated outcomes after 12-months. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Ambient air pollution; Childhood asthma; Land-use regression; Lung function; Under-researched community","nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; bioaccumulation; child health; health risk; nitrogen dioxide; particle size; particulate matter; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; symptom; air pollutant; air pressure; air quality; air temperature; airway obstruction; ambient air; Article; asthma; chest tightness; child; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); dyspnea; female; follow up; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; human; humidity; informal sector; land use; long term exposure; lung function test; lung volume; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; particulate matter; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory tract inflammation; rhinitis; risk assessment; school child; smoking; South Africa; spirometry; wheezing; adverse event; air pollution; analysis; environmental exposure; epidemiology; particulate matter; prospective study; toxicity; Cape Province; South Africa; Western Cape; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Prospective Studies; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083895299

The vulnerability to primary copper supply restrictions amplifies for countries dependant on imports, notably many EU Member States. Recycling of post-consumer scrap can provide a valuable source of essential material to the European industry. However, a considerable fraction of collected and processed copper old scrap is exported, while the remaining fraction is either not recovered or lost due to nonfunctional recycling undermining the implementation of a circular economy. In this work, material flow analysis, regression analysis, and life cycle assessment are combined to explore the possible evolution of four scenarios of copper demand in Europe to year 2050 and the potentials for greenhouse gas emissions reduction under material circularity conditions. The results show that for three of the four scenarios, secondary production would not comply with the carbon dioxide emissions reduction target of 50% below 2000 levels neither in case of combined aggressive recycling, moderate decarbonization of electricity, and energy efficiency improvements. In particular, for the scenario that describes a “business as usual” approach, the modelled future domestic demand can only be met by increasing primary inputs and, despite strong efforts to improve recycling at end-of-life, the fraction of old scrap in total metal demand seems likely to achieve 65% at best. Should that scenario ensue, the GHG emissions embodied in EU copper demand might result in an emissions gap of more than 15 TgCO2eq or about +260% the carbon dioxide reduction target. In contrast, the lowest environmental impacts are associated with a scenario emphasizing green technology and more equitable lifestyles. In that scenario, the secondary copper flows will gradually approach the expected demand, laying the foundation for achieving a circular economy with considerable potential for preserving natural capital and mitigating climate change. This possible future, however, requires dramatic changes in the current pattern of material production and consumption, as we discuss. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Global warming; Life cycle assessment; Material flow analysis; Scenario analysis; Sustainable development goals","carbon dioxide; copper; demand analysis; energy efficiency; European Union; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; natural capital; recycling; secondary production; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083891446

For the therapeutic load of these ADDS, a promising strategy is the design of pH-sensitive prodrugs based on the construction of conjugates between adamantane and doxorubicin (Ad-Dox), which stands out as an excellent model system to obtain novel supramolecular materials. Construction of these prodrugs involves a modification of three zones of doxorubicin which in principle does not affect the action mechanism: the carbonyl group C13 (hydrazone linker), the primary alcohol neighboring the carbonyl (ester linker) and the 3′ amino group of daunosamine sugar (amide linker). These modifications are aimed to improve the efficacy and reduce the systemic toxicity of the drug chemotherapy by controlling its release in cancer cells. In this work, we performed 2D NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the conformational changes of three constructed prodrugs. Our results demonstrated that ring A and the daunsamine sugar of the hydrazone and amide linkers conserve the half-chair state 9H8, while the ester linker disrupts this conformation. Our study also showed that the hydrazone-linked compound (Ad-h-Dox) does not modify the conformation of the original drug and maintains cytotoxic activity. Moreover, the inclusion complex (IC) of Ad-h-Dox with β-cyclodextrin (βCD) generated a highly soluble platform in water, whereas the ester-linked compound (Ad-e-Dox) causes the loss of biological activity. This study proves that Ad-h-Dox prodrug can be an optimum prodrug and act as a building block for a more complex drug transport system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Doxorubicin; Inclusion complex; Molecular dinamic simulation; pH sensitive assembly","adamantane; amide; beta cyclodextrin; doxorubicin; ester; hydrazone derivative; water; adamantane; amine; antineoplastic agent; beta cyclodextrin derivative; daunosamine; doxorubicin; drug carrier; hexosamine; prodrug; Article; conformational transition; controlled study; correlation spectroscopy; differential scanning calorimetry; drug conformation; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug solubility; heteronuclear single quantum coherence; human; human cell; in vitro study; MCF-10A cell line; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; molecular dynamics; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; nuclear Overhauser effect; rotating frame overhauser effect spectroscopy; thermogravimetry; cell membrane permeability; cell survival; chemistry; conformation; drug effect; drug formulation; drug release; molecular dynamics; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Adamantane; Amines; Antineoplastic Agents; beta-Cyclodextrins; Cell Membrane Permeability; Cell Survival; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Drug Compounding; Drug Liberation; Hexosamines; Humans; Hydrazones; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Prodrugs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083877620

These forward-looking studies require a base case scenario in order to assess the impacts of a policy. In this article, we hypothesise how a baseline is ‘rolled forward’, and specifically, how this process can materially alter the apparent performance of an energy or climate change policy. In the literature, we find a variety of methods are used to update databases and project forward base case scenarios, some which scale an entire economy to a general trend of growth, whereas others account for sectoral differences. We extend a global electricity-detailed model (GTAP-E-Power) to examine our hypothesis. We evaluate impacts of a world-wide carbon tax policy ($50/t of carbon dioxide equivalent) using three different baselines, with varying levels of specificity relating to macroeconomic projections and sectoral developments and constraints. Results show the impact on sectors and the overall economy in all countries are highly diverse when different baselines are used. For example, fossil-based power output in the United States declines between 36.7 and 65.5% while Real GDP in China declines between −0.66 and −1.54% for an identical policy, depending on which baseline methodology is used. Above all, we find that stronger development of renewable energy and technology in the baselines results in lower costs of a climate change mitigation policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Baseline projection; Carbon tax; Climate change policy; Computable general equilibrium (CGE); GTAP-E-Power; Partial equilibrium (PE)","Carbon dioxide; Carbon taxes; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Detailed modeling; Forward looking; General trends; Power out put; Renewable energies; Climate change; baseline conditions; climate change; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy planning; environmental economics; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; hypothesis testing; pollution tax; trend analysis; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083875851

Current understanding about hydrocarbon generation in unconventional plays, such as oil shales and gas shales, is still evolving, especially in sedimentary basins where hydrocarbon generation is influenced by magmatism. This is the case for the Permian oil shales of the Irati Formation in the Paraná Basin, southern South America. The Irati shales are considered an atypical petroleum system due to thermal effects of the Paraná Large Igneous Province (LIP) emplaced during the Early Cretaceous. In this context, the focus of this study was to characterize the thermal conditions of hydrocarbon generation in the Irati Formation as well as the composition of related aqueous diagenetic fluids. The kerogen from the Irati organic-rich shales has an aromaticity around 30% (ƒar ≈ 30%), as determined by carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR), and vitrinite reflectance (Ro) of around 0.6%. Fluid inclusions in calcite and quartz veins present aqueous fluids with salinity of 0–5 wt% of NaCl equivalent and homogenization temperatures greater than 250 °C. Hydrocarbon fluid inclusions were classified as black oil through their vapor fraction volumes (Fv = 1.6–9.1%) and homogenization temperatures (Th) in the 60–80 °C range. Methane (CH4) or carbon dioxide (CO2) fluid inclusions were absent within the analyzed calcite and quartz veins. The PVT model for trapped fluid inclusions suggests a shallow hydrocarbon petroleum system (≈2.5 km depth) active during the Early Cretaceous, synchronous with the Paraná LIP. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Calcite and quartz veins; Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM); Hydrocarbon fluid inclusions; Kerogen aromaticity; Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); Oil shale; Paraná basin; Vitrinite reflectance","Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Mineralogy; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Oil shale; Petroleum geology; Quartz; Sodium chloride; Homogenization temperatures; Hydrocarbon exploration; Hydrocarbon fluid inclusion; Hydrocarbon generation; Large igneous provinces; Organic-rich shales; Southern south america; Vitrinite reflectance; Petroleum prospecting; emplacement; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon generation; large igneous province; natural gas; organic compound; Permian; petroleum hydrocarbon; shale; Parana Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083873402

Ride-sharing, which refers to the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travel in a car, and prevents the need for others to drive to a location themselves, is a critical solution to this issue. Before being introduced into one place, it needs a potential analysis. However, current studies did this kind of analysis based on home and work locations or social ties between people, which is not precise and straight enough. Few pieces of research departed from real mobility data, but uses time-consuming methodology. In this paper, we proposed an analysis framework to bridge this gap. We chose the case study of Tokyo area with over 1 million GPS travel records and trained a deep learning model to find out this potential. From the computation result, on average, nearly 26.97% of travel distance could be saved by ride-sharing, which told us that there is a significant similarity in the travel pattern of people in Tokyo and there is considerable potential of ride-sharing. Moreover, if half of the original public transit riders in our study case adopt ride-sharing, the quantity of CO2 is estimated to be reduced by 84.52%; if all of the original public transit riders in our study case adopt ride-sharing, 83.56% of CO2 emission reduction can be expected with a rebound effect because of increase of participants from public transit. Ride-sharing can not only improve the air quality of these center business districts but also alleviate some city problems like traffic congestion. We believe the analysis of the potential of ride-sharing can provide insight into the decision making of ride-sharing service providers and decision-makers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Potential emission reduction; Ride-sharing; Users matching","Air quality; Automobile drivers; Behavioral research; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Deep learning; Digital storage; Emission control; Urban transportation; Analysis frameworks; Business district; CO2 emission reduction; Critical solution; Emission reduction potentials; Potential analysis; Service provider; Transportation method; Traffic congestion; air quality; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decision making; emission control; fuel consumption; GPS; research work; traffic congestion; Tokyo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083862149

There is, however, a lack of investigations for long-term trends in the composition, sources and evolution processes of PM1 (particulate matter with diameter less than 1 μm) after the implementation. To evaluate the effectiveness of these control measures, we present a year-long real-time measurement of the chemical composition of PM1 at an urban site in Beijing from November 2014 to November 2015, and the results are compared with previous studies from 2008 to 2013 to gain insights into the variations of the chemical composition and sources of PM1 in Beijing. Large seasonal differences were observed in the mass concentrations of PM1 species and general declining trend was observed in the last seven years. Specifically, the annual averages of mass concentrations in 2014–2015 decrease by 16–43% (PM1), 23–43% (organic aerosol, OA), 38–68% (sulfate), 26–51% (nitrate), 18–33% (ammonium) and 27–38% (chloride) compared to those from 2008 to 2013. During winter and summer, the seasonal mass concentrations of sulfate and nitrate show more significant declines especially in summer 2008 (79% and 81%) and summer 2011 (76% and 77%). The nitrate-to-sulfate ratio is higher in 2014–2015 (1.5 ± 0.6) than that in 2013 (1.0 ± 0.3), largely due to significant reduction in SO2 emissions, suggesting that nitrate is becoming more important than sulfate in particulate pollution in Beijing. OA is the dominant PM1 fraction (&gt;45%) in all seasons and the mass concentrations/contributions of both primary and secondary OA show different seasonality. As for the more oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) and less oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), the contributions of MO-OOA are much higher than those of LO-OOA (27–62% vs. 6–26%) in both high-pollution and low-pollution days. Aqueous-phase processes are found to facilitate the formation of MO-OOA while photochemical oxidation formation is a major contributor of LO-OOA in winter, and photochemical oxidation plays a major role in the formation of MO-OOA in summer and fall. The current study provides a comprehensive seasonal comparison of chemical composition and formation of PM1 in Beijing and a pacesetter in tackling PM pollution for other equally polluted megacities, after implementation of more stringent control measures after 2013. © 2020 The Authors","Fine particles; Haze pollution; Secondary formation; Sources","Air pollution; Chlorine compounds; Nitrates; Oxidation; Particles (particulate matter); Sulfur compounds; Urban growth; Air pollution in chinas; Air pollution prevention; Chemical compositions; Formation mechanism; Particulate pollution; Photochemical oxidation; Real time measurements; Seasonal differences; Air pollution control; ammonia; chloride; nitrate; sulfate; chemical composition; formation mechanism; haze; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution control; seasonality; source apportionment; urban area; aerosol; air pollution; air pollution control; airborne particle; Article; chemical composition; China; concentration (parameter); oxidation; oxygenation; particle size; particulate matter; photooxidation; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; urban area; winter; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; season; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083857183

Magnetometry was used to assess the pollution level by measuring the fine fractions (0.071 mm and < 0.071 mm) of sediments collected from the surface layer of the riverbank. The magnetic methods (e.g., mass magnetic susceptibility χ, temperature-dependence magnetic susceptibility, and hysteresis loop parameters) were supplemented by microscopy observations and chemical element analyses. The results showed the local impact of Warsaw’s activity on the level of HM pollution, indicated by the maximum concentrations of magnetic particles and HM in the city center. The sediment fraction < 0.071 mm was dominated by magnetite and by a large amount of spherical-shaped anthropogenic magnetic particles. The pollution from the center of Warsaw was transported down-river over a relatively short distance of approximately 11 km. There was a gradual decrease in the concentrations of magnetic particles and HM in areas located to the north of the city center (down-river); furthermore, χ and concentrations of HM did not decrease to the values observed for the area to the south of Warsaw (up-river). The study showed two possible sources of sediment pollution: traffic-related and heat and power plant emissions. The influence of an additional source of pollution cannot be excluded as the amount of spherules in the sediments at the center was extremely high. The present study demonstrates that magnetometry has a practical application in detecting and mapping HM pollution in river systems. © 2020, The Author(s).","Heavy metals; Magnetic methods; Magnetic spherules; River sediments","anthropogenic source; assessment method; concentration (composition); fluvial deposit; heavy metal; magnetic method; magnetic susceptibility; river bank; river system; sediment pollution; sediment-water interface; Mazowieckie; Poland [Central Europe]; Vistula River; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]; heavy metal; China; city; environmental monitoring; magnetism; Poland; river; sediment; water pollutant; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Magnetic Phenomena; Metals, Heavy; Poland; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083843695

The current research is an effort to assess the possible impact of climate change on precipitation, temperature, and consequently climate zones over Iran, based on the Köppen–Geiger climate classification scheme. To this end, monthly mean values of precipitation totals and air temperature from 149 synoptic stations during 1971–2015 as well as output from 17 Earth System Models of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) under two emission scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, over the twenty-first century were taken into consideration. The results obtained by the ensemble mean of the 17 CMIP5 models under RCP8.5 scenario indicated that the annual mean temperature is expected to increase significantly by 1.9 and 3.3 °C for the periods of 2041–2070 and 2071–2100, respectively. For precipitation, results showed that the annual mean precipitation over the country is expected to decrease under both RCP scenarios relative to the baseline period (1971–2015) between − 5.4% by 2041–2070 under RCP4.5 and − 9.5% by 2071–2100 under RCP8.5. Monthly precipitation regimes are expected to change across the country, especially in the Caspian Sea coastal regions and in Alborz mountain ranges. The Köppen–Geiger climate classification map of Iran is derived for the period 1971–2015 and compared to existing global Köppen–Geiger climate classification maps. Also, computing climate types of Köppen–Geiger climate classification based on averages from three climatic periods (1971–2015, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100) showed that the area of arid-desert and arid-steppe climate classes (BW and BS) and the area of moderate and snow climate classes (Ds and Cs) are expected to increase and decrease, respectively. The results of this study could impact on strategic planning in agriculture and water resources, and thus consequently affecting the economy of Iran. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"air temperature; classification; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; coastal zone; precipitation (climatology); Caspian Sea; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083834631

The Ecosystem Approach develops plans for moving towards a more optimal mix. This requires stakeholders to understand the value of ecosystem services and how these values change with land-use and management. We investigate whether process-based modelling and economic valuation can help stakeholders to do this. We do this by applying these tools to a plan to improve ecosystem services delivery in a catchment. To be used in decision-support, analytical approaches need to be relatively inexpensive and rapid, and our analysis was deliberately constrained in this way. Two 25-year future scenarios were developed and compared against a baseline scenario. The first Designated Site scenario was based on enhancing the condition of nationally important nature conservation sites. The second, Ecosystem Services scenario, represented implementing the ecosystem services delivery plan. We modelled the change between the scenarios with an internationally recognised process based ecosystem services toolkit (the Land Use Capability Indicator, LUCI tool) and used the model outputs to inform economic valuation methods. Our selection of which ecosystem services to model and value were initially identified through a participatory approach. However those we could quantify was limited by evidence and data availability. We assessed changes in water quality (phosphorus load), sediment generation, carbon storage and flood regulation. We were able to put economic values on only carbon sequestration and flood regulation. Both the modelling results and the experience of applying the linked modelling-valuation approach are examined in the discussion to consider the limitations to the current usefulness of linking process based modelling to economic valuation for informing land management policy. We explore the origin and nature of these limitations and the key bottlenecks that need to be overcome, applicable to its use in other sites, regions and countries. This includes the availability of suitable coefficients and/or underlying data/evidence to parameterise the model, and the compatibility of model outputs with available economic valuation evidence (for value transfer). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Catchment management; Economic valuation; Ecosystem Approach; Ecosystem service; Process based modelling","catchment; ecosystem approach; ecosystem service; land management; land use; modeling; policy approach; stakeholder; valuation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083829242

Clay minerals are the important storage space for shale gas. In this work, the isotherm adsorption curves of CH4 and CO2 on montmorillonite at 288 K, 308 K and 328 K were obtained using gravimetric apparatus. The selectivity factor of CO2 over CH4 (SCO2/CH4) and Henry's constants (KH) of CH4 and CO2 were calculated. More importantly, the thermodynamics parameters of CH4 and CO2, including Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), surface potential (Ω), isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) and entropy change (ΔS), were thoroughly analysed. The results indicate that all SCO2/CH4 values are obviously greater than one, and injecting CO2 into a clay-rich shale reservoir to enhance the shale gas recovery is feasible. CH4 has smaller KH than CO2, which shows that CH4 has a weaker affinity on the montmorillonite surface. Low temperature helps to enlarge KH and promote the adsorption of CH4 and CO2. Increasing the pressure causes the increase in ΔG and Ω of CH4 and CO2. The higher ΔG and Ω of CO2 compared to CH4 reveal that the CO2 adsorption on montmorillonite is more favourable and spontaneous. When the loading increases, the Qst values of CH4 and CO2 reduce. CH4 has a smaller Qst than CO2, which suggests the stronger interaction of CO2 with montmorillonite. CH4 and CO2 have decreasing ΔS with the loading. Under larger surface coverage conditions, the disorder of the adsorbed molecules is larger, and most of the injected molecules are trapped as a free state in the pore space. The higher ΔS of CO2 illustrates that CO2 molecules constitute a much more stable rearrangement than CH4 molecules. The temperature has a slight effect on the ΔS of CH4 and CO2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Methane; Montmorillonite; Thermodynamics","Adsorption; Adsorption isotherms; Clay minerals; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; High pressure effects; Molecules; Shale gas; Temperature; Gibbs free energy changes; Gravimetric apparatus; Isosteric heat of adsorption; Isotherm adsorption; Montmorillonite surface; Selectivity factors; Thermodynamics analysis; Thermodynamics parameters; Carbon dioxide; adsorption; carbon dioxide; gravimetry; methane; montmorillonite; shale gas; temperature effect; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083817040

However, links between education and climate change risks can involve both synergies and trade-offs, and the balance of these effects remains ambiguous. Increases in educational attainment could lead to faster economic growth and therefore higher emissions, more climate change and higher risks. At the same time, improved attainment would be associated with faster fertility decline in many countries, slower population growth and therefore lower emissions, and would also be likely to reduce vulnerability to climate impacts. We employ a multiregion, multisector model of the world economy, driven with country-specific projections of future population by level of education, to test the net effect of education on emissions and on the Human Development Index (HDI), an indicator that correlates with adaptive capacity to climate impacts. We find that improved educational attainment is associated with a modest net increase in emissions but substantial improvement in the HDI values in developing country regions. Avoiding stalled progress in educational attainment and achieving gains at least consistent with historical trends is especially important in reducing future vulnerability. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Climate models; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Adaptive capacity; Climate change risks; Educational attainments; Historical trends; Human development index; Level of educations; Population growth; Social and environmental; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083797162

However, the range of nitrogen concentrations in legumes is wide, likely related to the range of nitrogen fixation strategies. We evaluated how carbon and nitrogen allocation to roots, stems and leaves is influenced by the type of strategy of nitrogen fixation regulation. We grew herbaceous annual legumes (Medicago truncatula, Hymenocarpos circinnatus and Vicia palaestina) under two nitrogen availability treatments (none/sufficient), with and without bacterial inoculation. We found facultative downregulation of the rate of nitrogen fixation when nitrogen was available in H. circinnatus, and an obligate similar fixation rate in both nitrogen treatments in M. truncatula and V. palaestina. Uninoculated plants invested more biomass in roots and contained lower nitrogen concentrations. However, nitrogen concentration in the entire plant and in the leaves was lower and more plastic in the species with a facultative fixation strategy, whereas species with an obligate fixation strategy also maintained high nitrogen concentrations. Our results suggest a suite of functional traits associated with the strategies of allocation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. This suite of traits probably shapes successional and functional niches of different leguminous species in specious plant communities. © 2020 The Authors.

Within this policy void, many state governments are stepping up and taking action on adaptation planning. Yet we know little about why some states adopt State Adaptation Plans (SAPs), while others do not. This article investigates factors that predict the emergence of SAPs, both in terms of policy adoption and policy intensity (goal ambitiousness). Applying the diffusion of innovation theory, I consider the relative influence of internal state characteristics, regional pressures, and test for conditional effects between government ideologies and severity of the problem. The results show interesting differences between predictors that influence policy adoption and ambitiousness. States are more motivated to adopt a policy when faced with greater climate vulnerability, have more liberal citizenry, and where governments have crossed policy hurdles by previously passing mitigation plans. The intensity of policies and goal setting, moreover, is more likely to be driven by interest group politics and diffuse through policy learning or sharing information among neighboring states in Environmental Protection Agency regions. These findings support an emerging scholarship that uses more complex dependent variables in policy analysis. These variables have the potential to differentiate symbolic from substantive policies and capture finer information about predictors of importance. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization","adaptation; adaptation planning; climate change; diffusion of innovation theory; policy innovation and diffusion; policy intensity; policy stringency; SAPs; state politics","climate change; climate effect; environmental policy; environmental protection; innovation; policy implementation; political ideology; state role; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083787321

In response to this, the Beijing government has implemented comprehensive emission reduction measures in recent years. To assess the effectiveness of these measures, the seasonal and long-term trends in chemical compositions of PM2.5 in Beijing have been studied based on daily samples collected from July 2015 to April 2016 and literature investigation (2000–2014). Results show that the concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium in PM2.5 have significant seasonal variations, which are related to the changes in meteorological conditions and emission intensities. In addition, the long-term data display that the concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium have significantly decreased between 2013 and 2016, which are consistent with the reduction in PM2.5 levels (~ 11.2 μg/m3 per year). The declines could not be interpreted by the meteorological factors. It suggests that the air pollution control measures in Beijing (2013–2016), especially the decreasing consumption of coal, can effectively decrease the mass concentration of fine particles. To further improve the air quality, similar measures should be adopted in the areas around Beijing. These air pollution control measures taken in Beijing can provide invaluable guidance for mega-cities in China and other developing countries to decrease their PM2.5 concentration and reduce health risk from particulate pollution. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Beijing; PM2.5; Pollution control; Water-soluble ions","ammonium; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; health risk; long-term change; megacity; nitrate; particulate matter; pollution control; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfate; Beijing [China]; China; ammonium derivative; sulfate; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ammonium Compounds; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083785374

Our empirical results reveal that China’s economy can be divided as three decoupling stages and exhibited a distinct tendency toward strong decoupling with a turning point in 2008. Thus, we discuss the impact of 2008 economic crisis on carbon emissions based on decomposition results. The empirical results of our study show the following five conclusions. (1) Most sectors in China are in weak decoupling state due to the inhibition of energy intensity on carbon emissions. (2) Different factors contribute differently to reducing emissions in different sectors, economic output has the most prominent effect, followed by energy intensity and population scale. (3) China’s current carbon emission reduction measures benefit more on energy efficiency. (4) The economic crisis has greatly reduced energy efficiency and has no significant impact on other factors. (5) If all industries adjust their energy mix, carbon emissions in China can be reduced by almost 17% every year. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emissions; Decoupling theory; LMDI method; Multisector","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic conditions; emission control; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon dioxide; China; industry; Carbon Dioxide; China; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083781292

The currently approved restoration plan is for quarry-made excavations to be restored back to agricultural land. However, the site has been identified as being important for nature, so different restoration strategies should be considered. To better understand how these compare in terms of ES provision, which had not previously been done at mineral extraction sites in Spain, we used an established toolkit: the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessments (TESSA). We compared the agriculture-focused restoration plan and two nature-focused alternative scenarios, one without public access (conservation scenario) and the other with public access (compromise scenario). Monetary estimations of the value of agricultural production, climate change mitigation, and recreation were calculated in three scenarios. Results indicated that the compromise scenario provided the greatest annual value (€91,409), mainly due to its potential visitors, surpassing both agricultural (€68,504) and conservation (€48,556) scenarios. Considering the higher costs associated with restoring sites to agricultural production, nature conservation may be an attractive option for extraction companies. The use of TESSA at this site has provided valuable information to quarry managers to help guide their decision-making. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration","aggregate extraction; biodiversity; cultivated goods; recreation; restoration costs; travel cost method","agricultural production; decision making; ecosystem service; environmental planning; environmental restoration; nature conservation; protected area; public access; quarry; strategic approach; Madrid [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083771930

In response, multiple regional climate mitigation initiatives have emerged. In Peru, indigenous networks have created their own Indigenous Amazonian REDD (RIA), an initiative aiming to strengthen property rights for native peoples. At roughly the same time, the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Program (PNCB), a conditional payment scheme aiming to encourage sustainable forest management. However, these initiatives must still overcome fragmented institutional governance of forests at the regional scale and continued challenges related to indigenous tenure security. This article examines how indigenous federations and the Peruvian government are attempting to implement these initiatives in the Amazonian region of Madre de Dios to examine how challenges play out in practice. These cases illustrate the institutional gaps between national policies, regional capacities, and local needs and expectations. However, it also demonstrates how an innovative institutional partnership at the subnational scale may be overcoming some of these challenges. © 2020 The Authors.

NATEM shows that imposing different renewable penetration constraints for electricity generation has limited impacts outside the electricity sector. In particular, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to increase over time. Conversely, the imposition of a carbon tax has broader impacts on Canadian energy systems and on GHG emissions that are almost stabilized. However, the level of the carbon tax envisions by the EMF 34 study (increasing to a maximum level of $130 per tonne by 2050) is not high enough, in a Canadian context, to trigger a decrease of GHG emissions over time as mandated by Canadian climate policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Low-carbon energy system; Prospective analysis; Renewable electricity; TIMES optimization Model","Carbon; Emission control; Gas emissions; Broader impacts; Carbon abatement; Climate policy; Electricity generation; Electricity sector; Energy systems; International energy agency; Maximum levels; Greenhouse gases; electricity generation; energy management; energy policy; pollution tax; renewable resource; scenario analysis; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083730452

The consequences are particularly pronounced in authoritarian regimes, where marginal population groups may be subjected to technocratic development plans in the name of global climate goals and social safeguards are difficult to monitor. Purpose: The article examines the implications of climate-related interventions for ethnic minority communities in the highlands of Vietnam, as they are caught in the conflicting development logics between the international donor community, vowing to defend their interests, and the Vietnamese government administration. Approach: The study builds on a comprehensive household survey on REDD+ activities and livelihoods in two districts (three communes) in upland Lao Cai province in northern Vietnam. The survey was supplemented with in-depth interviews with villagers, extensive talks with governments (People's Committees) at provincial, district and commune level, and various observations and interviews across the province. Findings: The study finds that embeddedness is of key importance. However well-intended climate-related interventions may be, they cannot alter crucial conditions of social organization and governance. In the highlands of Vietnam, climate-related funding tends to be aligned with a long series of government programmes for their transformation and the assimilation of ethnic minorities that have continued since 1975. Despite the international focus on “social safeguards”, ethnic minority people lose access to forest resources while most are trapped in poverty. The findings add to a growing literature that is critical of REDD+. Policy implications: Current economic growth priorities have negative social and cultural impacts of such magnitude that they go beyond acceptable trade-offs, and also threaten the very objective of climate-mitigation projects. Both the basic safeguard instruments (a rights-based approach, the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process, and a broad range of stakeholder engagements) and the global standards enshrined in the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure (VGGT) are in practice set aside by the authoritarian state. This tends to be commonly available knowledge, and it would seem that international donors observing the mandate of global climate deals have become insensitive to rights. In order to secure continued backing to global climate-related funding mechanisms, however, improved monitoring is urgently needed. © The Author 2019.

Exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity were evaluated on a scale from 1 to 5 to identify characteristics that cause the mangrove vulnerability. Mangroves in sites with different characteristics had different vulnerabilities, despite having similar exposure. The best-conserved mangroves had low vulnerability and were in good health because of their sensitivity, whereas mangroves affected by human activity were more vulnerable in terms of sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Overall, Mahahual had the highest vulnerability (3.0) because of its low tidal range (~5 cm), changes in precipitation (−25 mm year−1), poor ecological conditions (low basal area without positive changes), low resilience of adjacent ecosystems (poor condition of coral reefs and seagrass meadows), and poor mangrove protection. This vulnerability assessment method identifies factors that affect vulnerability and can be used to develop management strategies that decrease mangrove vulnerability to climate change by reducing sensitivity and increasing the adaptive capacity of the ecosystem and the surrounding communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Ecosystems; Forestry; Sea level; Tides; Adaptive capacity; Ecological conditions; Management strategies; Mangrove ecosystems; Positive changes; Seagrass meadows; Vulnerability assessments; Yucatan peninsula; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; coral reef; human activity; management practice; mangrove; precipitation (climatology); sea level change; seagrass meadow; sensitivity analysis; vulnerability; Yucatan Peninsula; Anthozoa; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083663084

Fuel economy improvements on laboratory tests gradually became real improvements on the road as newer, more efficient vehicles replaced older less efficient ones. Fleet-wide fuel economy gains produced large fuel savings. In this paper, we show that fuel economy gains measured on laboratory test cycles, adjusted for on-road conditions and weighted by the distribution of vehicles by age and their relative use, closely match estimates by the Federal Highway Administration based primarily on traffic counts and motor fuel tax records. Adjusting for the rebound effect of fuel economy on vehicle miles traveled, we estimate the fuel savings, CO2 emissions reductions and dollars saved on fuel due to fuel economy improvements over the past 43 years. Through the end of 2018, estimated cumulative fuel savings amount to approximately 2 trillion gallons of gasoline. We estimate that roughly one-fifth of the savings can be attributed to gasoline price increases over the period and four-fifths to fuel economy and greenhouse gas (ghg) standards. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CAFE standards; Energy efficiency; Fuel economy; ghg regulations; Light-duty vehicles; Rebound effect","Automotive fuels; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Highway administration; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Federal Highway Administration; Gasoline prices; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Laboratory test; Light duty vehicles; Rebound effect; Road condition; Vehicle-miles traveled; Fuel economy; energy conservation; energy management; energy market; energy use; fuel consumption; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083659477

In order to better develop the green economy, this paper studies a supply-chain system under policy intervention, which is composed of strategic customers, the government, two manufacturers which respectively produce electric vehicles and fuel vehicles. The paper aims to research the impacts of pricing time on profitability and stability. The different timing patterns of pricing divide into two game structures, namely Stackelberg pricing game and simultaneous pricing game. With the adjustment of parameters, the state of the system is switched between stability and instability, so some effective methods are lead-in to analysis it. Analytic results reveal how subsidy and carbon emission constraint affect supply-chain system operation, since the whole market operation lasts for a long term, subsidy may always have negative impact on the system's stability, which may drive the system operation to be uncontrollable. By comparison, Stackelberg pricing strategy with characteristics of time-delay is more adaptable for system operational management, which makes the system more flexible to adjust supply-chain system status in time. © 2020","Dynamic complexity; Information entropy; Policy intervention; Simultaneous pricing model; Stackelberg pricing model","Automobile manufacture; Carbon; Commerce; Costs; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Fuel economy; Inventory control; Supply chains; Carbon emission reductions; Environmental issues; Market operation; Operational management; Policy intervention; Stability and instability; Supply chain systems; System's stabilities; System stability; carbon emission; competition (economics); environmental economics; environmental management; pollution tax; price dynamics; pricing policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083648502

In these situations, methanotrophs that are resistant to climate change and deserted conditions could be applied. Methylococcus, as one of the most extensively studied methanotrophs is highly resistant to salinity, a strain of which was isolated in this study from Hoz-e Soltan Salt Lake in Iran as an example influenced by climate change. Isolated strain was identified. To determine the ability of the bacteria for decrease of methane gas, the culture medium was analyzed by gas chromatography. Results showed that isolated strain is able to grow in salt proportion of 3.3% and acidic pH of 3.5 in vitro, reducing more than 75% of total methane gas within 10 days. In addition to nitrogen fixation ability of the strain, positive results obtained regarding drought tolerance and heat shock in this study confirmed that Methylococcus strains may be able to withstand environmental conditions of foreseeable future.

Current CO2R catalyst design remains inefficient because of a gap between existing practical design paradigms and theoretical studies in catalysis. This review attempts to mitigate this gap through a critical discussion of the correlations between recent strategies to develop transition metal-based catalysts and the underlying rationales and mechanisms. These strategies include surface engineering, the introduction of heterogeneous atoms, and dimension control, and can be implemented by tactics such as controlling catalyst surface facets, surface tethering, alloying, inducing strains, oxide derivation, molecular scaffolding, and nanostructuring. How these tactics are able to tailor the electronic structure, adsorption geometry, density of active sites, and local environment of catalyst to achieve an efficient and selective CO2R is described. This review concludes with a discussion of the key research needs in this field such as the surface proton formation and transfer involved in CO2R, the roles of mass-transfer or electrode kinetics in CO2R catalysis, development of robust, standardized catalyst testing protocols, and application of machine learning and high-throughput experiment to accelerate catalyst screening processes. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Kratie province, in particular, has suffered from climate-induced disasters, including floods, droughts, storms, lightning, and heatwaves. To date, climate change interventions in the province have primarily focused on impacts on agriculture. However, enhancing the climate resilience of micro businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector is also crucial since the provincial economy increasingly depends on the interlinkage between agriculture, tourism and related enterprises. This article examines how climate change has impacted micro businesses in Kratie Town, and how they responded to the impacts. This study is based on semi-structured interviews with micro entrepreneurs randomly selected in the town. Results show that businesses have been predominantly affected by floods and storms. Business exposures and locations, types of business, production and supply chains, and client bases determined different impacts of and responses to these climate-related hazards. Businesses adopted primarily temporary and reactive responses rather than long-term systematic measures. Strengthening adaptive infrastructure, both physical and informational, will improve businesses’ capability to prepare for and cope with these disasters. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptation; Cambodia; Climate change; Disaster resilience; Impact; Micro business","business; climate change; disaster management; hospitality industry; microenterprise; natural disaster; questionnaire survey; tourism; agriculture; article; Cambodia; climate resilience; controlled study; disaster; economic aspect; flooding; human; randomized controlled trial; semi structured interview; tourism; Cambodia; city; climate change; Cambodia; Kracheh; Cambodia; Cities; Climate Change; Disasters; Floods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083501678

A total of 25 mg of resveratrol was supplemented into 300 mg of either HC or HF diet. Methane production, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, molar proportion of VFA, metabolites of resveratrol and prokaryotic community composition were measured after 12 and 24 h of in vitro fermentation. Resveratrol reduced methane production (ml per mg of dry matter degraded) by 41% and 60% under both HC and HF diets (P < 0.001), respectively, and this result could be associated with the lower abundance of Methanobrevibacter (P < 0.001) in response to resveratrol. The molar proportion of propionate was significantly higher in the resveratrol group only under the HC diet (P = 0.045). The relative abundance of 10 bacterial genera was affected by the three-way interaction of treatment, diet and time (P < 0.05). Resveratrol was partly converted to dihydroresveratrol after 24 h of fermentation, and its degradation could be associated with microbes belonging to the order Coriobacteriales.

However, it remains unclear how thermal stratification and mixing process control the exchange of CO2 between surface water and the Earth's atmosphere. To address this issue, we examine the temporal characteristics of some physicochemical parameters, partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), the δ13CDIC, and CO2 emission from a typical karst groundwater-fed reservoir (Dalongdong reservoir). During the 23 month study (2016–2018) thermal stratification limited CO2 emission, in part from photosynthetic uptake of CO2, from early April to late October, while mixing processes stimulated CO2 emission of CO2 generated from organic matter remineralization in bottom water from October to April. The Dalongdong reservoir is an atmospheric source of CO2 for most of the study period; however, during periods of stratification, approximately 0.37 ± 0.44 Gg CO2 (1 Gg = 109g) dissolved into the water from the atmosphere, while approximately 6.24 ± 3.73 Gg CO2 was lost to the atmosphere during periods lacking stratification. Limited emissions during stratified period may thus represent a negative feedback to CO2 contributions to global warming, which has increased lengths of stratified periods. These study results are important to optimize sampling monitoring strategies to reduce errors of regional CO2 emission estimation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 emission; Groundwater-fed reservoir; Mixing period; Thermal stratification","Biogeochemistry; Earth atmosphere; Feedback; Global warming; Groundwater; Importance sampling; Mixing; Process control; Reservoirs (water); Surface waters; Thermal stratification; Tropics; Water quality; Biogeochemical cycle; Karst groundwater; Monitoring strategy; Physico-chemical composition; Physicochemical parameters; Remineralization; Temporal characteristics; Thermal structure; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; ground water; organic matter; bottom water; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; estimation method; karst; optimization; photosynthesis; physicochemical property; water quality; Article; atmosphere; carbon footprint; China; partial pressure; physical chemistry; priority journal; seasonal variation; temperature measurement; water supply; water temperature; environmental monitoring; lake; season; China; Carbon Dioxide; China; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Lakes; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083464155

This target represents a discontinuity with the one enshrined in the previous Directive (RED I), as it is binding only for the EU as a whole but not for individual Member States. Such a policy shift paves the way to new legal challenges for the deployment of renewable energy. Yet, the contextual approval of the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union also provides the European Commission with an enforcement toolkit to respond to Member States’ ambition and delivery gaps in their National Energy and Climate Plans.

This study aimed at quantifying the intervention effects of the AMHP2012 on extreme heat-related occupational injuries and subsequent insurance payouts in Guangzhou, China. Data on occupational injuries and insurance payouts were collected from March 1, 2011, to February 28, 2013, from the occupational injury insurance system of Guangzhou. A quasi-experimental design with before-after control was adopted. Interrupted time series analysis was performed to quantify the change of occupational injuries and insurance payouts after policy implementation. The distributed lag non-linear model was used to explore whether injury claims and insurance payouts due to extreme heat decreased. A total of 9851 injury claims were included in the analysis. After policy implementation, the risk of occupational injuries and insurance payouts decreased by 13% (RR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.75, 0.99) and 24% (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.94), respectively. The attributable fraction of extreme heat-related occupational injuries decreased from 3.17% (95%eCI: 1.35, 4.69) to 1.52% (95%eCI: −0.36, 3.15), which contributed to 0.86 million USD reduction of insurance payouts. Both males and females, low-educated, young and middle-aged workers, workers at small or medium-sized enterprises, engaging in manufacturing, and with both minor and severe injuries were apparently associated with decreased rates of extreme heat-related occupational injuries. The AMHP2012 policy contributed to the reduction of extreme heat-related occupational injuries and insurance payouts in Guangzhou, China, and this research provided novel evidence for decision-makers to better understand the necessity of implementing health protection policies among laborers under climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Extreme heat; Injury claim; Insurance payout; Policy evaluation","decision making; health policy; heating; injury; insurance system; occupational exposure; policy implementation; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; adult; age; Article; China; descriptive research; educational status; extreme hot weather; female; human; injury severity; insurance; male; middle aged; occupational accident; priority journal; quasi experimental study; sensitivity analysis; city; heat; occupational accident; occupational exposure; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; China; Cities; Extreme Heat; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Injuries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083424168

N-vacancy engineered graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) is identified as an efficient electrocatalyst to boost CH4 formation owing to the three-coordinating to two-coordinating transition of the carbon atoms that surround N vacancies. The defected g-C3N4 (DCN) exhibits a 44% faradaic efficiency with a CH4 partial current density of 14.8 mA/cm2 at −1.27 VRHE in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte, exceeding all the reported carbon-based materials and even being comparative to Cu-based electrocatalysts. Creation of more unsaturated carbon atoms enables the harmonic energy overlap near band gap edge between DCN and *CO, accounting for an improved strength of *CO on DCN, a lower energy barrier and an enhanced CO2RR to form CH4. This strategy holds the promise for tuning atomic configuration to enhance activity of catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon active sites; Carbon dioxide reduction; Carbon nitride; Density functional theory; N-vacancy","Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Energy gap; Potassium compounds; Tuning; Atomic configuration; Carbon based materials; Electro reduction; Faradaic efficiencies; Harmonic energy; Lower energy barriers; New approaches; Partial currents; Carbon nitride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083423011

Global climate change and other anthropogenic impacts have had a strong impact on the equilibrium of these ecosystems and causing the denominated “coral reef crisis”. One consequence of coral reef crisis is the phase shift in reef communities, where scleractinian corals responsible for the bioconstruction of the coralline building are replaced by macroalgae or soft corals. In Todos os Santos Bay (TSB) there is a rare case of phase shift caused by the soft coral Palythoa cf. variabilis. When in population outbreak, this coral species becomes dominant and leads to loss of scleractinian coral cover. Palythoa genus establishes a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium, that is changed in phase shift coral reefs, but other alterations remain unknown. In this study, the metabolism (oxidative damage, antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes, electron transport chain activity and photosynthetic pigments) of P. cf. variabilis from reefs in different conservation states was studied to identify and relate if changes that may occur in the biochemical and metabolism of the coral might trigger the population outbreak, identify parameters recognizing if corals are in stress and assess if one or more parameters can reflect the level of stress organisms are experiencing. The results obtained evidenced a clear distinction in the biochemistry and metabolism of corals from conserved sites and sites in phase shift, and these changes may be the trigger for population outbreak. Some of the parameters were able to discriminate the level of stress corals are experiencing and may allow to recognize the most at-risk coral reefs that need immediate intervention and prevent the entry into or revert P. cf. variabilis outbreak and phase shift in coral reefs. Actions like these can be of vital importance for the preservation of TSB coral reefs and possibly for other threatened reefs worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Oxidative stress; Phase shift; Soft coral","antioxidant; enzyme; pigment; anthropogenic effect; antioxidant; biochemistry; climate change; community composition; conservation status; coral reef; coralline alga; global climate; macroalga; marine ecosystem; soft coral; Article; bay; biochemical analysis; biochemistry; biotransformation; cell metabolism; chemical parameters; community; coral; coral reef; environmental protection; genus; global climate; marine environment; nonhuman; oxidative stress; Palythoa cf. variabilis; photosynthesis; priority journal; respiratory chain; species conservation; animal; Anthozoa; case report; climate change; ecosystem; Bahia; Brazil; Santos Bay; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Todos os Santos Bay; Alcyonacea; algae; Anthozoa; Dinophyceae; Palythoa; Palythoa variabilis; Scleractinia; Symbiodinium; Animals; Anthozoa; Bays; Climate Change; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083419828

In this research, seasonal surveys and a bi-weekly time series survey were conducted in the Qihe River Basin, one of the most densely populated agricultural basins in the DRR. Hydrochemical compositions (NO3 − and Cl−), dual isotopes (δD-H2O, δ18O-H2O, δ15N-NO3 −, and δ18O-NO3 −), and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo isotope mixing model were jointly applied to unravel the sources, migrations, and transformations of the nitrate (NO3 −) in the basin. It was revealed that the mixing between different sources was the main process controlling the isotopic compositions of the riverine NO3 − in the upper-middle reaches. In contrast, denitrification occurred in the lower reaches. For the first time, the sources of NO3 − were quantified at a basin scale in the DRR. Overall, the river transported 484.2 tons/year of NO3-N to the reservoir, of which 32.6%, 36.4%, 28.0%, and 3.0% was from soil organic nitrogen, chemical fertilizer, residential sewage and atmospheric precipitation, respectively. The NO3-N fluxes of the different sources were regulated by the monsoon climate and anthropogenic activities. For example, high precipitation and intense fertilization resulted in severe nonpoint source pollution. Denitrification thrived in soils and reservoirs in wet seasons. Temperature could regulate the migration, nitrification and denitrification processes. Based on the results, we suggest that the management strategies dealing with nitrogen pollution issue in the DRR should follow the specific spatiotemporal characteristics of NO3 − sources, migration and transformation mechanisms. © 2020","Dynamics; Isotope; MCMC mixing model; Nitrate; Source","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Denitrification; Flood control; Isotopes; Markov chains; Mixing; Nitrates; Nitrogen fertilizers; Reservoirs (water); Sewage; Surveys; Atmospheric precipitation; Danjiangkou Reservoir region (DRR); Nitrification and denitrification; Non-point source pollution; South-to-North water diversion project; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Transformation mechanisms; River pollution; denitrification; hydrological modeling; isotopic composition; monsoon; nitrate; nonpoint source pollution; pollutant source; river system; spatial variation; temporal variation; China; Danjiangkou Reservoir; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; China; environmental monitoring; river; water pollutant; China; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrates; Nitrogen Isotopes; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083383237

A lot of researches had been focused on the wetland cooling effect, especially in mitigating urban heat island effect. However, the intensity and influencing factors of wetland cooling effect currently cannot be thorough explained. In this study, we assessed the cooling effect of wetlands with different types in rural area of Northeast China by using split-window algorithm (SWA) to estimate land surface temperatures (LST) from Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor. We used correlation analysis to examine the relationships between characteristics of wetlands and cooling effect. Our results showed that paddy fields had the largest cooling effects than lakes followed by marshes for human disturbance. Size and shaped complexity were important characteristics to determine wetland cooling effects. Although our results suggested that larger size of wetlands might have higher intensity and spatial extent of cooling effects, small size of wetlands might have large or almost similar amount of cooling effects with the larger ones. Our findings have important implications for land managers and policy makers to design effective plans for conservation and climate change adaptation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"cooling; heat island; land surface; regional climate; rural area; semiarid region; surface temperature; wetland; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083373130

Developing countries are the most vulnerable to climate change, yet planning rarely considers how broader community development interventions can enhance resilience and support development. One solution is resilience assessment. However, few assessment frameworks exist that are sufficiently simple to empower communities to build resilience and take ownership of adaptation efforts. This article provides an example of a 27-question framework applied with two Cambodian communes (communities) to assess and understand trends in resilience over time. It is structured around community development outcomes of economic development, environmental quality, infrastructure that matches demands, community self-reliance and capacity to adapt to climate change; it also assesses how inputs and planning contribute to these outcomes. Longitudinal analyses reveal improvements over time driven primarily by commodity values. However, the sustainability of some of these improvements is questionable given volatile commodity markets and land degradation. Oversensitivity in the assessment is acknowledged as awareness increases over time, which can be conflated with poor performance. Maladaptive pathways may be unavoidable without building resilience by attending to broader community development issues, e.g. psychological wellbeing and education on alternative livelihoods. This article makes a significant contribution to community resilience by providing a simple resilience assessment framework that has demonstrably empowered communes to adapt to change. It is novel in the use of assessment design and process principles that build reflection on the drivers of resilience and development. Critical issues remain in the power dynamics of aid dependence, weakening of family bonds and patron-client relationships that affect resilience building in Cambodia. © 2020","Agrarian change; Climate change; Community resilience; Rapid assessment","climate change; community development; community organization; developing world; environmental planning; environmental policy; ownership; vulnerability; agricultural worker; article; awareness; Cambodia; climate resilience; developing country; economic development; education; human; human experiment; psychological well-being; Cambodia; climate change; psychological resilience; Cambodia; Cambodia; Climate Change; Resilience, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083368260

The δ13CTPM values corrected to modern atmospheric CO2 show cyclic fluctuations (−27.8‰ to −23.3‰), reflecting a temporal variation of water availability and/or a related taxonomic turnover of plant communities in the hinterland of Jinju Lake. Based on a transfer function for estimating mean annual rainfall (MAR) from the measured δ13CTPM values, the middle Albian climate of the basin was found to vary from sub-humid to humid conditions (MAR: 500–1500 mm). This variability suggests that Albian climate change at middle latitudes occurred more frequently than previously interpreted. The temporal increase in aridity observed in the basin (35–38°N) has not been detected in the isotopic records of the Cretaceous Hokkaido section (42–45°N) in Japan. This difference implies the possibility of a periodic northward shift or expansion of the northern hemisphere subtropical high pressure belt. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Albian; Carbon isotope; Paleoclimate; Precipitation; Terrestrial plant matter","Albian; aridity; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; climate variation; isotopic composition; Northern Hemisphere; paleoclimate; plant; rainfall; temporal variation; water availability; Jinju; Kyongsang Basin; South Korea; South Kyongsang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083336516

However, relevant comprehensive estimates lack in China. Here, we measure the energy potential of China's domestic biomass resources (including crop residues, forest residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge) from 2000 to 2016 and draw the spatial-temporal variation trajectories at provincial resolution. Scenario analysis and life cycle assessment are also applied to discuss the greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. Results show that the collectable potential of domestic biomass resources increased from 18.31 EJ in 2000 to 22.67 EJ in 2016 with overall uncertainties fluctuating between (−26.6%, 39.7%) and (−27.6%, 39.5%). Taking energy crops into account, the total potential in 2016 (32.69 EJ) was equivalent to 27.6% of China's energy consumption. If this potential can be realized in a planned way to displace fossil fuels during the period 2020–2050, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions mitigation would be in the range of 1652.73–5859.56 Mt CO2-equivalent, in which the negative greenhouse gas emissions due to the introduction of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would account for 923.78–1344.13 Mt CO2-equivalent. Contrary to increasing bioenergy potentials in most provinces, there are declining trends in Tibet, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhejiang. In addition, Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia would have the highest associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. This study can provide valuable guidance on the exploitation of China's untapped biomass resources for the mitigation of global climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy potential; Biomass resources; China; GHG mitigation Potentials; Spatial-temporal variation; Uncertainty analysis","Agricultural wastes; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Energy utilization; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Sewage sludge; Bioenergy potential; Biomass resources; Emissions mitigation; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-carbon futures; Spatial temporals; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083336421

The current solutions for mitigating this is either improving U-value and solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) with additional layers, utilizing shading device or changing the transparency of the glazing system with adjustable properties. These solutions address the problem of energy consumption to a certain extent but cannot effectively manage and take advantage of the solar radiation effectively. Moreover, shading solutions obstruct the view to the outside and have negative impact on daylighting. This paper introduces Water-filled glass (WFG) technology, a transparent glazing system that utilizes water infill to improve thermal performance of the building envelope. The impact of WFG on cooling and heating energy demand is evaluated by studying different glazing configurations for WFG in different climates. Besides, the overall performance of WFG is compared with conventional double glazing with Low-E as base-case (with and without shading). The significance of this evaluation is that a comprehensive climate-based assessment considering absorption and insulation-based options for WFG is presented here for the first time: the paper evaluates different options of glazing system in combination with active systems in building via advance dynamic simulation over a typical year for all major Köppen-Geiger climates (13 cities). Additionally, as a novel approach, the simulation results presented here identify climates where improving SHGC is more ideal for thermal performance than improving U-value even if it occurs by compromising the latter and distinguishes absorption-based and insulation-based scenarios respectively. The results show that absorption-based energy model is a viable option, which results in energy savings between 3 and 84% in value of US$0.99-24.25/m².a depending on climate. The discussion includes simulation and comparison with identical spaces using standard technology that follows the local building code and conventions. The climate-based evaluation of water-filled glass can improve energy consumption of buildings and offer a sustainable strategy for glass envelopes by absorbing and reusing heat where transparency becomes an asset instead of being a liability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Building sustainability; Dynamic facade; Energy-efficiency; Glass buildings; Solar control; Water-filled glass","Building codes; Climate models; Energy utilization; Glass; Glazes; Solar buildings; Thermal insulation; Transparency; Building envelopes; Hybrid buildings; Indoor comforts; Local building codes; Solar heat gain coefficient; Standard technology; Sustainable strategies; Thermal Performance; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083325294

Olhos D'Água da Amazônia is cited as a leading project success − with over one thousand small-to-medium-sized crop and livestock producers in the municipality of Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso State receiving more from the Amazon Fund than all but two other municipalities. To secure property rights, aid environmental planning, and raise farmers' productivity and output diversity, the project helped farmers register in Brazil's environmental cadaster and receive property certificates. Furthermore, Olhos D'Água supported milk and honey production and paid farmers to conserve riverine forest sites. We estimate causal effects of Olhos D'Água, versus a counterfactual estimate of what would have happened without the project, using a synthetic-control method. We build from the pool of blacklisted municipalities weighted averages (synthetic controls) that best match pre-treatment outcomes for Alta Floresta. Project effects are estimated as post-treatment differences between Alta Floresta and the synthetic controls. We find that the project increased new CAR registrations, and INCRA certifications, and may have moderately increased honey and milk production. Alta Floresta's annual forest losses remained historically low but we find no clear causal effect of the project on deforestation rates.

However, it remains unknown how much energy is stored in the vegetation biomass of China's terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, the shortage of biomass has limited the development of China's bioeconomy and bioenergy industry, requiring us to seek more multi-source and sustainable biomass supplies. In view of this, through comprehensive investigations and systematic data integration (including biomass data, calorific value data, land cover data, climate data, etc.), we explored the gross biomass energy (BE) reserves and their spatiotemporal pattern based on a total of 14 vegetation types that account for 76.24% of China's land area. The theoretical potential of gross BE in China was estimated as 535.91 EJ in 2010, which was equivalent to 18.29 Gt standard coal. BE showed a trend of continuous increase from 1980 to 2060 and is expected to peak in 2030. Importantly, BE (per land area or per capita) was significantly negatively correlated with provincial development levels in China. Our findings indicate that China has abundant BE reserves, which have potential as feedstocks for the production of different forms of energy in the context of sustainable development. Furthermore, more advanced low-cost technologies, such as coal and biomass co-gasification, are expected to promote the transformation and upgradation of energy systems in China in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biomass energy; Ecosystem management; Energy; Pattern; Policy","Bioeconomy; Climate change; Coal industry; Data integration; Ecosystems; Energy conservation; Energy security; Planning; Vegetation; Bioenergy industry; Climate change mitigation; Low cost technology; Spatiotemporal patterns; Sustainable energy; Sustainable energy supply; Terrestrial ecosystems; Vegetation biomass; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083098372

So far, only few studies have taken this approach, and, in particular, no such assessments exist for Germany, the most populated country of Europe. Methods: We assess temperature-related mortality in 12 major German cities based on daily time-series of all-cause mortality and daily mean temperatures in the period 1993–2015, using distributed-lag non-linear models in a two-stage design. Resulting risk functions are applied to estimate excess mortality in terms of GMT rise relative to pre-industrial levels, assuming no change in demographics or population vulnerability. Results: In the observational period, cold contributes stronger to temperature-related mortality than heat, with overall attributable fractions of 5.49% (95%CI: 3.82–7.19) and 0.81% (95%CI: 0.72–0.89), respectively. Future projections indicate that this pattern could be reversed under progressing global warming, with heat-related mortality starting to exceed cold-related mortality at 3 °C or higher GMT rise. Across cities, projected net increases in total temperature-related mortality were 0.45% (95%CI: −0.02–1.06) at 3 °C, 1.53% (95%CI: 0.96–2.06) at 4 °C, and 2.88% (95%CI: 1.60–4.10) at 5 °C, compared to today's warming level of 1 °C. By contrast, no significant difference was found between projected total temperature-related mortality at 2 °C versus 1 °C of GMT rise. Conclusions: Our results can inform current adaptation policies aimed at buffering the health risks from increased heat exposure under climate change. They also allow for the evaluation of global mitigation efforts in terms of local health benefits in some of Germany's most populated cities. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Future projections; Germany; Global mean temperature; Temperature-related mortality","adaptive management; air temperature; future prospect; global warming; health risk; mortality; time series analysis; urban area; vulnerability; adaptation; all cause mortality; Article; cause of death; climate change; climate warming; cold; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; Germany; greenhouse effect; health hazard; heat; human; observational study; priority journal; time series analysis; vulnerable population; city; climate change; epidemiology; Europe; Germany; mortality; temperature; Germany; Cities; Climate Change; Europe; Germany; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Mortality; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083090859

This study applied an environmentally extended multiregional input–output approach to estimate household carbon footprints for 12 different income groups of China’s 30 regions. Subsequently, carbon footprint Gini coefficients were calculated to measure carbon inequality for households across provinces. We found that the top 5% of income earners were responsible for 17% of the national household carbon footprint in 2012, while the bottom half of income earners caused only 25%. Carbon inequality declined with economic growth in China across space and time in two ways: first, carbon footprints showed greater convergence in the wealthier coastal regions than in the poorer inland regions; second, China’s national carbon footprint Gini coefficients declined from 0.44 in 2007 to 0.37 in 2012. We argue that economic growth not only increases income levels but also contributes to an overall reduction in carbon inequality in China. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Economic analysis; Emission control; Coastal regions; Economic growths; Gini coefficients; Income groups; Income levels; Space and time; Two ways; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083051781

Despite their importance, studies investigating biogeographical patterns of the atmospheric microbiome between urban and suburban areas are limited. Urban and suburban locations (including their microbial communities) vary considerably depending on climate, topography, industrial activities, demographics and other socio-economic factors. Hence, we need more location-specific data to make informed decision affecting air quality, human health, and the implication of a changing climate and policy decisions. The objective of this study was to describe how the atmospheric microbiome varies in composition and function between urban and suburban sites. We used high-throughput sequencing to analyze microbial communities collected at different times from PM2.5 samples collected by active sampling method (using a pump and an impactor) and dust settling of TSP collected by passive sampling method (no pump and no impactor) from an urban and suburban site. We found diverse communities unique in composition at both sites with equivalent functional potential. Taxonomic composition varied significantly with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Other phyla in greater relative abundance at the urban site. In contrast, Cyanobacteria, Tenericutes, Fusobacteria, and Deinococcus, were enriched at the suburban site. Community diversity also demonstrated a high degree of temporal variation within site. We identified over one-third of the communities as potentially pathogenic taxa (urban: 47.52% ± 14.40%, suburban: 34.53% ± 14.60%) and determined the majority of organisms come from animal-associated host or are environmental non-specific. Potentially pathogenic taxa and source environments were similar between active- and passive- sampling method results. Our research is novel it adds to the underrepresented set of studies on atmospheric microbial structure and function across land types and is the first to compare suburban and urban atmospheric communities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric microbiome; Bioaerosol; Microbial community; Phylogenetic diversity; PM2.5","Air quality; Atmospheric structure; Ecosystems; Microorganisms; Topography; Community diversity; High-throughput sequencing; Industrial activities; Microbial communities; Microbial structures; Socio-economic factor; Taxonomic composition; Urban and suburban areas; Urban growth; aerosol; air quality; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; microbial community; particulate matter; suburban area; urban area; Actinobacteria; air quality; article; atmosphere; Bacteroidetes; climate; clinical article; cyanobacterium; Deinococcus; Fusobacteria; high throughput sequencing; human; microbial community; microbiome; Mollicutes; nonhuman; Pennsylvania; Proteobacteria; structure activity relation; animal; atmosphere; microflora; Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; United States; Actinobacteria; Animalia; Bacteroidetes; Cyanobacteria; Deinococcus; Firmicutes; Fusobacteria; Mollicutes; Proteobacteria; RNA 16S; Animals; Atmosphere; Humans; Microbiota; Philadelphia; Proteobacteria; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083028816

It is necessary not only to accelerate the process of industrialization, but also to rationally allocate carbon emission reduction tasks. This paper takes the northwestern provinces of China as a case study based on the calculation of the industrial carbon emissions of each province from 2006 to 2017. The Gini coefficients such as the industrial economy contribution coefficient, industrial employment contribution coefficient, and carbon carrying coefficient are constructed to evaluate the equity of regional industrial carbon emissions. The results show that the carbon pressure index in the northwestern provinces is increasing, carbon emissions are growing much faster than the carbon carrying capacity, and the differences among the provinces are obvious. The industrial economy contribution, the industrial employment contribution, and the carbon carrying Gini coefficients fluctuate significantly. Carbon emissions inequity has not been suppressed with the socio-economic development, and the “Matthew effect” is even more prominent. Evaluating the equity of carbon emissions allocation will help to rationally allocate carbon emission reduction tasks among provinces and achieve national emission reduction targets. Accordingly, recommendations are provided for formulating a differentiated carbon management policy, strengthening provincial cooperation, determining the provincial ecological function position, and improving the equity of regional carbon emissions allocation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon carrying coefficient; Equity; Industrial carbon emission; Industrial economy contribution coefficient; Industrial employment contribution coefficient","carbon; carbon emission; carrying capacity; developing world; economic conditions; emission control; employment; environmental economics; equity; industrial emission; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; calculation; carbon footprint; China; ecological phenomena and functions; economic development; employment; environmental policy; industrial area; industrialization; China; environmental protection; industry; China; Carbon; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083013266

Compared with typical carbon materials such as fullerene C60, carbon nanotubes, reduced graphene oxide, and carbon nanohorns; HMCSs showed fewer effects on cell cycle distribution and lower toxicity to cells. Ten different drugs were incorporated into the HMCSs, and the maximum loading efficiency reached 42.79 ± 2.7%. Importantly, microwaves were found to improve the photothermal effect generated by HMCSs when combined with 980-nm laser irradiation. The cell killing and tumor growth inhibition efficiencies of HMCSs and drug-loaded HMCSs under co-irradiation with laser and microwaves were significantly improved compared with those under laser irradiation alone. After local administration HMCSs were only distributed in tissue at the injection site. HMCSs showed almost no toxicity in mice after local injection and could be completely removed from the injection site. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","980-Nm laser and microwave co-irradiation; Fluorescent carbon dots; Hollow mesoporous carbon spheres; Improved cancer therapy; Low cytotoxicity","Drug delivery; Efficiency; Fluorescence; Graphene; Irradiation; Mammals; Mesoporous materials; Nanohorns; Toxicity; Tumors; Carbon material; Carbon nanohorn; Co irradiations; Efficient strategy; Maximum loading; Mesoporous carbon; Photothermal effects; Tumor treatment; Microwave irradiation; antineoplastic agent; bovine serum albumin; carbon nanoparticle; cisplatin; curcumin; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; fluorouracil; graphene oxide; hollow mesoporous carbon sphere; methylene blue; paclitaxel; quercitrin; sodium copper chlorophyllin; talaporfin; unclassified drug; carbon nanotube; drug; nanoparticle; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer inhibition; cell cycle; cell killing; controlled study; cytotoxicity; in vivo study; injection site; microwave irradiation; mouse; nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line; nasopharynx tumor; nonhuman; nude mouse; phototherapy; photothermal therapy; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; sustained drug release; animal; laser; microwave radiation; neoplasm; Animals; Lasers; Mice; Microwaves; Nanoparticles; Nanotubes, Carbon; Neoplasms; Pharmaceutical Preparations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083012110

Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable regions to extreme climatic events in developing world especially in Southeast Asia. Pakistan has detrimentally affected by the climatic variations due to its high exposure to extreme climatic events. Several studies have reported the farm households’ perception, adaptation and mitigation about climate change but there is inadequate knowledge available on the awareness of farm households about climate change in Pakistan. To fill this research gap, the purpose of research aims to examine the Pakistani farm household's awareness level of climate change and its associated factors. By using structured questionnaire in data of 400 study participants were collected from four districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan through a household's survey. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized for collection of primary data. A probit model approach was employed to analyze the farm households’ awareness of climate change and its associated socioeconomic and demographic variables. Results of our study exposed that 73 % farm households were aware of climate change. Socio economics and demographic variables such as age of farm households, education level, farming experience, land ownership status, extension and information sources access were pointedly related to farm households’ awareness of climate change. Further, results of our study showed that the evaluation of farm households’ adaptation behavior suggests that farm households are active in using several adaptation strategies such as crop diversification and use of irrigation etc. It is expected that the findings of the present research will be helpful to guide governmental agencies and policymakers and contribute to the construction of sustainable adaptation measures in Pakistan and other regions in the framework of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Awareness level; Climate change; Pakistan; Perception","adaptive management; agricultural research; alternative agriculture; climate change; climate effect; crop production; farmers attitude; perception; questionnaire survey; vulnerability; Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083008232

Despite its important contributions to the global carbon cycle, transitions in plankton community composition between the winter and spring have been scarcely examined in the North Atlantic. Phytoplankton composition in early winter was compared with latitudinal transects that captured the subsequent spring bloom climax. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), imaging flow cytometry, and flow-cytometry provided a synoptic view of phytoplankton diversity. Phytoplankton communities were not uniform across the sites studied, but rather mapped with apparent fidelity onto subpolar- and subtropical-influenced water masses of the North Atlantic. At most stations, cells < 20-µm diameter were the main contributors to phytoplankton biomass. Winter phytoplankton communities were dominated by cyanobacteria and pico-phytoeukaryotes. These transitioned to more diverse and dynamic spring communities in which pico- and nano-phytoeukaryotes, including many prasinophyte algae, dominated. Diatoms, which are often assumed to be the dominant phytoplankton in blooms, were contributors but not the major component of biomass. We show that diverse, small phytoplankton taxa are unexpectedly common in the western North Atlantic and that regional influences play a large role in modulating community transitions during the seasonal progression of blooms. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"algal bloom; annual cycle; community composition; cyanobacterium; diameter; diatom; flow cytometry; phytoplankton; seasonality; species diversity; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); algae; Bacillariophyta; Cyanobacteria; biomass; cyanobacterium; diatom; genetics; phytoplankton; season; Biomass; Cyanobacteria; Diatoms; Phytoplankton; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082978293

Thus, the concept of urban carbon metabolism was introduced in this paper and correspondingly input-output analysis (IOA) and ecological network analysis (ENA) were combined to conduct the carbon metabolism analysis. Concretely speaking, the urban IO table was compiled based on the provincial one and then the direct and embodied urban carbon flows were accounted. Subsequently, the carbon metabolic network model was established, through which the characteristics of the metabolic network were further analyzed to better reveal the contributors and influencing factors of carbon emissions. Dongguan, a city famous as the “factory of the world”, was chosen as the case. The results indicate that the total direct and embodied carbon flows were mainly concentrated in manufacture. Manufacture was found to be major factors affecting other compartments through indirect interplay. A trophic hierarchical structure was found, where compartments can be classified into primary producers, secondary producers, primary consumers and secondary consumers according to their metabolic characteristics in use of energy.

Taking Hubei as the study area, this study explored the effects of cropland expansion on carbon storage in both 2000–2010 and 2010–2030 in different scenarios by using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model and the LAND System Cellular Automata model for Potential Effects (LANDSCAPE). The results showed that cropland expansion led to a massive loss of carbon storage (1.76 Tg C) during 2000–2010, which is expected to continue during 2010–2030 in different scenarios. The loss is predicted to be 3.70 Tg C in the Business-As-Usual scenario and be 0.88 Tg C in the Requisition–Compensation Balance of Cropland Policy scenario. Noticeably, the loss of carbon storage due to cropland expansion was 1.12 times more than that due to urban expansion during 2000–2010. For the period of 2010–2030, the loss of carbon storage caused by cropland expansion is predicted to be 3.89 times more than that caused by urban expansion in the Business-As-Usual scenario, while the losses caused by cropland expansion and urban expansion are predicted to be almost equal in the Requisition–Compensation Balance of Cropland Policy scenario. The main cause of carbon storage loss due to cropland expansion is that it leads to the considerable loss of forest and wetland. This study highlights the importance of considering the loss of carbon storage caused by cropland expansion when conducting cropland protection policies and land use planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon storage; Cropland expansion; Cropland protection policies; Ecosystem services; Land use model","agricultural land; automation; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; global climate; land use planning; scenario analysis; trade-off; urbanization; carbon storage; China; compensation; cropland; forest; review; wetland; carbon sequestration; China; crop; ecosystem; environmental protection; China; Hubei; carbon; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082943411

Building stock energy models have been developed to support decisions of public authorities in renovation strategies. However, the burdens of renovation interventions and their temporal distribution are mostly overlooked, leading to potential overestimation of environmental benefits. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) provides a holistic estimation of environmental impacts, but further developments are needed to correctly consider spatio-temporal aspects. We propose a spatio-temporal LCA framework to assess renovation scenarios of urban housing stocks, integrating: 1) a geospatial building-by-building stock model, 2) energy demand modelling, 3) product-based LCA, and 4) a scenario generator. Temporal aspects are considered both in the lifecycle inventory and the lifecycle impact assessment phases, by accounting for the evolution of the existing housing stock and applying time-adjusted carbon footprint calculation. We apply the framework for the carbon footprint assessment of housing renovation in Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg). Results show that the renovation stage represents 4%–16% of the carbon footprint in the residual service life of existing buildings, respectively after conventional or advanced renovations. Under current renovation rates, the carbon footprint reduction would be limited to 3–4% by 2030. Pushing renovation rates to 3%, enables carbon reductions up to 28% by 2030 when combined with advanced renovations. Carbon reductions in the operational stage of buildings are offset by 8–9% due to the impacts of renovation. Using time-adjusted emissions results in higher weight for the renovation stage and slightly lower benefits for renovation. © Elsevier Ltd","Building stock renovation; Carbon footprint; Geographical information systems; Life cycle assessment; Time-adjusted emission accounting; Urban energy planning","Carbon footprint; Emission control; Energy utilization; Housing; Carbon footprint reductions; Environmental benefits; Existing housing stocks; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Lifecycle impact assessment; Residual service life; Temporal distribution; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082867941

Its range is only partially known, and potential effects of future climate change on its distribution have yet to be assessed. Using ecological niche models and future climates information, we assessed the geographic and environmental potential distribution of A. alpinus for the years 2050 and 2070, analyzing effects of habitat loss and the importance of existing protected areas (PAs) across the species’ range. Our ecological niche models predicted a distributional range of ~ 59,000 to ~ 64,400 km2 for the species, extending from northern Peru to northern Bolivia. However, habitat loss led to an important reduction (&gt; 57%) in the current potential suitable areas. On average, the climate change reduced the potential distributional areas by ~ 49% and ~ 61% for 2050 and 2070, respectively. Synergistic effects of climate change and habitat loss are predicted to pose an even greater risk, leading to a net reduction in future potential distributions of over 75%. We also observed a shift of ~ 230 m increase in elevation between the range under present conditions and scenarios for 2050 and 2070. Although PAs were more suitable climatically than surrounding areas, for future scenarios, we observed an important reduction (on average over 25%) of proportion of PAs within the estimated distributional areas, as well as a significant (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in mean habitat suitability values within PAs.

This paper explores the role of climate finance in the process of Madagascar’s planned transition to renewable energy sources as envisioned in the country’s New Energy Policy in order to demonstrate the different experience in developing countries when compared to hegemonic transition narratives. Drawing upon qualitative interviews with energy finance providers and focus groups in recently electrified rural communities, this paper reveals that Madagascar’s transition is dependent on the financial resources mobilized by the government’s technical and financial partners. Climate finance emerges as a critical lever to implement environmental legislation. The interview findings were correlated with census data to evaluate how current financing strategies are directly connected to energy justice issues, namely the equality in access to affordable and clean energy. Through an analysis of projected energy finance flows and key financiers’ financing strategies, this paper exposes a shift from grant-based climate finance to financial instruments with clear return profiles, such as concessional loans and private capital, and finds that the choice of financial instrument impacts the provision of complementary social services in rural electrification schemes. Grants are linked to higher investments into complementary social services, while private financiers focus on innovation and scale. Purely private financed electrification projects were found to negatively impact social cohesion by increasing the inequality in access to energy. This study concludes that if only commercially viable energy projects were to be financed going forward, up to 19 million Madagascans might be excluded from future electrification efforts. Consequently, this paper urges researchers to consider social justice implications when evaluating climate finance strategies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate finance; Development finance; Energy finance; Energy transition; Madagascar; Rural electrification","Developing countries; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Energy finances; Energy transitions; Environmental legislations; Financing strategies; Madagascar; Qualitative interviews; Renewable energy source; Rural electrification; Investments; alternative energy; census; conceptual framework; developing world; electrification; energy policy; environmental justice; environmental legislation; financial system; instrumentation; questionnaire survey; rural population; strategic approach; Madagascar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082854043

Its warm climate application helps to reduce the year-round domestic water heating and air-conditioning loads. This paper reports the application of the dynamic simulation model of this new design. The validated model was used to evaluate its energy performance at different tropical and subtropical cities worldwide.

The changes in potential marine fish production and socio-economic conditions were modelled for these two deltas under long-term changes in environmental conditions (sea surface temperature and primary production) to the end of the 21st century. Our results show that an increased temperature (by 4 °C) has a negative impact on fisheries productivity, which was projected to decrease by 5%. At the species level, Bombay duck, Indian mackerel and threadfin bream showed an increasing trend in the biomass of potential catches under the sustainable fishing scenario. However, under the business as usual and overfishing scenarios, our results suggest reduced catch for both states. On the other hand, mackerel tuna, Indian oil sardine, and hilsa fisheries showed a projected reduction in potential catch also for the sustainable fishing scenario. The socio-economic models projected an increase of up to 0.67% (involving 0.8 billion USD) in consumption by 2050 even under the best management scenario. The GDP per capita was projected to face a loss of 1.7 billion USD by 2050. The loss of low-cost fisheries would negatively impact the poorer coastal population since they strongly depend upon these fisheries as a source of protein. Nevertheless, adaptation strategies tend to have a negative correlation with poverty and food insecurity which needs to be addressed separately to make the sector-specific efforts effective.

However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991–2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r=0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r=0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r=0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r=0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic vegetation; Classification tree; Floodplain; Image classification; Landsat; Macrophytes","Aquatic organisms; Banks (bodies of water); Biodiversity; Biomass; Catchments; Climate change; Ecosystems; Floods; Hydrogeology; Image classification; Productivity; Rain; Runoff; Vegetation; Water; Wetlands; Aquatic vegetation; Classification trees; Flood plains; LANDSAT; Macrophytes; Rivers; aquatic plant; biodiversity; catchment; climate change; disturbance; floodplain; freshwater environment; growth; image classification; Landsat; macrophyte; rainfall; river discharge; satellite data; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082742365

Although the industrial EC resulted in 84% of color removal in a very short time of 8 min, the wastewater was still characterized by an extremally high absorbance which corresponded to 100 mg/L of RB5. Moreover, EC resulted in the occurrence of burdensome by-products, of which one was identified in this study as an aniline derivative. The by-products contributed to high residual COD and TOC after EC (2120 mg/L and 1052 mg/L, respectively). Consequently, the catalytic ozonation was used by us as a second, the polishing, step of the treatment. The catalytic ozonation was found efficient in the removal of the residual color and colorless by-products. The wastewater after catalytic ozonation was colorless and the final COD and TOC decreased to 1283 and 695 mg/L, respectively. The average oxidation state (AOS), spectra analysis, and the toxicity assay showed catalytic ozonation efficient in the by-products oxidation. Consequently, the catalytic action of activated carbon (AC) was proved for the ozonation of textile wastewater. Ultimately, the recycling of purified wastewater into dyeing resulted in a very good color quality of textile samples (DECMC values below limiting value equal to 1.0). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","By-products removal; Catalytic ozonation; Industrial textile wastewater; Toxicity assessment","activated carbon; aniline derivative; ozone; sodium chloride; coloring agent; ozone; adsorption; Article; catalysis; chemical oxygen demand; EC50; electrocoagulation; mineralization; oxidation; ozonation; textile industry; total organic carbon; waste water; waste water management; waste water recycling; electrocoagulation; industrial waste; sewage; textile; textile industry; waste water; water pollutant; Gossypium hirsutum; Coloring Agents; Electrocoagulation; Industrial Waste; Ozone; Textile Industry; Textiles; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082741036

This formation has a complex history of alteration, involving pervasive hydrothermal circulation, hydrocarbon generation/migration, and mineral authigenesis. Several previous studies have focused on the description of these secondary effects, and the identification of primary geochemical signals in the carbonaceous phases. Migration and infiltration of organic-rich fluids appear to have had only limited effect on the primary carbon isotope record (δ13Corg). However, the structural variability of carbonaceous material (CM) appears to have been strongly affected, with a range of reported structures including carbon onion-shaped nanostructures and mineral-templated graphite films. Here we present a systematic Raman spectroscopy-based study of the structural variability of CM in a drill core representing the middle and upper strata of the Zaonega Formation. The Raman spectra of CM show a systematic difference in structural order between the bulk carbonaceous matrix (Matrix-CM) and the CM occurring near mineral contacts (Contact-CM), indicating that mineral templating was an important process affecting structural order in the formation. The templating effect was observed on the surface of a wide range of minerals. The difference in structural order between Matrix-CM and Contact-CM can be traced throughout the ca. 400 m stratigraphy. The structural order varied with the degree of alteration and hydrothermal circulation, from highly ordered structures directly above a large gabbro intrusion at the bottom of the stratigraphy to less ordered structures higher up in the sequence. This trend directly correlates with the δ18O trend of secondary calcite, and can be attributed to the decreasing influence and temperature regime of hydrothermal circulation upward in the stratigraphy. The results presented here suggest that organic-rich hydrothermal fluids can locally strongly enhance graphitization of carbonaceous materials, and cause sample-scale heterogeneities in the structural order of organic materials. This has implications for the interpretation of carbonaceous materials in other ancient rocks experiencing circulation of organic-rich hydrothermal fluids. © 2020 The Authors","Carbonaceous material; Hydrothermal fluids; Proterozoic; Raman spectroscopy","authigenesis; hydrocarbon generation; hydrocarbon migration; hydrothermal circulation; hydrothermal fluid; Proterozoic; Raman spectroscopy; Arkhangelsk [Russian Federation]; Onega Basin; Russian Federation; Allium cepa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082691750

While recent attempts to engineer synthetic methanol auxotrophs have proved successful, these studies focused on scarce and expensive co-substrates. Here, we engineered E. coli for methanol-dependent growth on glucose, an abundant and inexpensive co-substrate, via deletion of glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (pgi), phosphogluconate dehydratase (edd), and ribose 5-phosphate isomerases (rpiAB). Since the parental strain did not exhibit methanol-dependent growth on glucose in minimal medium, we first achieved methanol-dependent growth via amino acid supplementation and used this medium to evolve the strain for methanol-dependent growth in glucose minimal medium. The evolved strain exhibited a maximum growth rate of 0.15 h−1 in glucose minimal medium with methanol, which is comparable to that of other synthetic methanol auxotrophs. Whole genome sequencing and 13C-metabolic flux analysis revealed the causative mutations in the evolved strain. A mutation in the phosphotransferase system enzyme I gene (ptsI) resulted in a reduced glucose uptake rate to maintain a one-to-one molar ratio of substrate utilization. Deletion of the e14 prophage DNA region resulted in two non-synonymous mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd) gene, which reduced TCA cycle carbon flux to maintain the internal redox state. In high cell density glucose fed-batch fermentation, methanol-dependent acetone production resulted in 22% average carbon labeling of acetone from 13C-methanol, which far surpasses that of the previous best (2.4%) found with methylotrophic E. coli Δpgi. This study addresses the need to identify appropriate co-substrates for engineering synthetic methanol auxotrophs and provides a basis for the next steps toward industrial one-carbon bioprocessing. © 2020 International Metabolic Engineering Society","Escherichia coli; Glucose; Methanol; Methanol-dependence; Synthetic methylotrophy","Acetone; Carbon; Enzymes; Escherichia coli; Genes; Glucose; Metabolites; Molar ratio; Substrates; Amino acid supplementation; Fed-batch fermentation; Isocitrate dehydrogenase; Metabolic flux analysis; Metabolite production; Phosphotransferase system; Synthetic methylotrophy; Whole genome sequencing; Methanol; amino acid; genomic DNA; glucose; glucose 6 phosphate isomerase; hydrolyase; isocitrate dehydrogenase; isomerase; phosphogluconate dehydratase; phosphotransferase; ribose 5 phosphate isomerase; unclassified drug; Escherichia coli protein; glucose; glucose 6 phosphate isomerase; isocitrate dehydrogenase; methanol; Article; auxotrophy; bacterial growth; carbon metabolism; cell density; citric acid cycle; controlled study; Escherichia coli; fed batch fermentation; gene mutation; glucose transport; metabolic engineering; metabolite; molecular weight; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; phenotype; priority journal; prophage; protein expression; substrate concentration; supplementation; whole genome sequencing; biomass; Escherichia coli; gene deletion; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolic engineering; metabolism; procedures; Biomass; Citric Acid Cycle; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Deletion; Glucose; Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Metabolic Engineering; Methanol; Prophages",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082687674

Long-term drought forecasting is of great importance for the development of risk management strategies. Recently, large-scale climate drivers (e.g. El Niño-Southern Oscillation) have been demonstrated as useful in the application of drought forecasting. Machine learning-based models that use climate drivers as input are commonly adopted to provide drought forecasts as these models are easy to develop and require less information compared to physical-based models. However, few machine learning-based models have been developed to forecast drought conditions during growing season across all Australian cropping areas. In this study, we developed a growing season (Apr.-Nov.) meteorological drought forecasting model for each climate gauging location across the Australian wheatbelt based on multiple lagged (past) large-scale climate indices and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used as the response variable to measure the degree of meteorological drought. Results showed that the RF model could provide satisfactory drought forecasts in the eastern areas of the wheatbelt with Pearson's correlation coefficient r > 0.5 and normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) < 23%. Forecasted drought maps matched well with observed drought maps for three representative periods. We identified NINO3.4 sea surface temperature and Multivariate ENSO Index as the most influential indices dominating growing season drought conditions across the wheatbelt. In addition, lagged impacts of large-scale climate drivers on growing season drought conditions were long-lasting and the indices in previous year could also potentially affect drought conditions during current year. As large-scale climate indices are readily available and can be rapidly used to feed data driven models, we believe the proposed meteorological drought forecasting models can be easily extended to other regions to provide drought outlooks which can help mitigate adverse drought impacts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate drivers; Drought forecasting; Machine learning; Random forest","Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Correlation methods; Decision trees; Drought; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mean square error; Oceanography; Random forests; Risk management; Surface waters; Weather forecasting; Meteorological drought; Multivariate enso indices; Pearson's correlation coefficients; Physical-based models; Risk management strategies; Root mean square errors; Sea surface temperature (SST); Standardized precipitation index; Climate models; climate effect; drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental stress; forecasting method; growing season; machine learning; seasonal variation; article; climate; correlation coefficient; drought; forecasting; growing season; human; physical model; precipitation; random forest; response variable; sea surface temperature; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082677598

Many researchers have focused on the impacts of precipitation on hydrologic simulations, but few studies integrated both temperature and precipitation data for historical and forecast periods in hydrologic models and evaluated the weather data accuracy at national scale. This study evaluated four extracting methods (mean (MN), median (MD), centroid (CT), and area-weighted (AW) approaches) for summarizing weather data for sub-watersheds defined in a hydrologic model. Firstly, an optimized extracting method was used to develop a real-time HUC-12 (12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code) level dataset for the Conterminous United States. The hydrologic model with the CT weather data performed the best, followed by MN, AW, and then MD. Secondly, per this method, a real-time dataset including historical and forecast data at HUC-12 level across the conterminous United States was created. Last, continuous daily forecast data at national scale displayed that large forecast overestimations were usually observed in large forecast precipitation events over 20 mm. Simultaneously, there were large underestimations in small forecast precipitation events less than 5 mm. Forecast maximum temperature showed a more substantial bias than that minimum temperature, with the largest underestimation for the lower forecast maximum temperature less than 15 °C. With regard to data stability of the historical observed temperature data, provisional and early temperature data from Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) in the most recent seven months are as reliable as the stable data that is subject to quality control measures before it replaces the provisional and early data. However, forecast data often included bias in the extreme weather conditions, such as heavy precipitation and scorching temperature. Forecast data, which is updated multiple times each day, was frequently subject to an opposite bias (trending toward less extreme values) in the presence of strong frontal systems presumably due to the exact location and speed of the front being difficult to predict. Fully processed weather data from this work will be published online to facilitate hydrologic modeling efforts in the US and inform users about the uncertainty in the forecast data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Accuracy; Climate; Forecast; NEXRAD; PRISM; SWAT","Climate models; Codes (symbols); Extreme weather; Forecasting; Precipitation (meteorology); Prisms; Quality control; Uncertainty analysis; Accuracy; Climate; Extreme weather conditions; Hydrologic simulations; Minimum temperatures; NEXRAD; Precipitation events; SWAT; Weather forecasting; accuracy assessment; air temperature; data quality; data set; forecasting method; high temperature; hydrological modeling; optimization; precipitation (climatology); prediction; real time; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082665226

This study uses a process-based modelling approach to assess long-term effects of spatial and temporal climate variability on Eucalyptus productivity for 36 sites across Brazil. The attainable stem wood mean annual increment (MAI, m3 ha−1 yr−1) was simulated by the APSIM Next Generation Eucalyptus model, considering three soil types (clay, sandy-clay and sandy-loam) and twenty-seven rotations of seven years, using weather data from 1980 to 2013. Spatial and temporal (inter-annual and inter-seasonal) climate variability strongly affected Eucalyptus MAI across Brazilian regions. Average Eucalyptus MAI ranged from 38 m3 ha−1 yr−1 (Imperatriz, MA, Northeast region) to 69 m3 ha−1 yr−1 (Borebi, SP, Southeast region), while its coefficient of variation ranged from 3.2% (Antônio Olinto, PR, South region) to 17.2% (Bocaiúva, MG, Southeast region). Our results suggest an average increment of about 0.91 m3 ha−1 yr−1 for each increase of one degree in latitude. Eucalyptus growth was mostly driven by water deficit combined with high temperatures at tropical sites, while the tree growth was more affected by low winter temperatures at subtropical sites. The results of the present study have value for understanding how Eucalyptus plantations change their growth in response to changing climate. Gauging the effects of climate variability on Eucalyptus growth may assist in forest planning by estimating the area to be cultivated, machinery sizing, climate risk, and guiding the tree breeders in choosing appropriate genotypes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","APSIM model; Latitude; Temperature; Water deficit; Weather seasonality","Forestry; Machinery; Productivity; Risk perception; Temperature; Tropics; Coefficient of variation; Eucalyptus plantations; Genotype x environment interaction; Latitude; Mean annual increments; Process-based modelling; Seasonality; Water deficits; Climate change; climate variation; evergreen forest; genotype-environment interaction; latitudinal gradient; machinery; plantation forestry; seasonality; temperature profile; water stress; Brazil; Imperatriz; Maranhao; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082549157

The results show that the Pb concentration are 68.8, 105.4, 41.7, 49.7, 75.6, 81.7, 131.9, 67.5, 109.3, 164.1, 74.8, 66.4, 99.8, 58.4, 114.0, 59.6, 103.7, 55.4 and 80.4 for Beijing, Chengdu, Daqing, Harbin, Jilin, Jinan, Kunming, Lanzhou, Luoyang, Panzhihua, Qingdao, Yinchuan, Guangzhou, Tangshan, Xi'an, Guangyuan, Nanjing, Taiyuan and Tianjin, respectively. The Pb pollution level of urban street dust varies among cities in the range of 1.72–5.56 times higher than soil background values. The allometric function can fit the change in Pb concentration with particle size well. The medium-sized (38–120 μm) particles contributed 60.2%–80.4% to the Pb load and should be highlighted when selecting street dust management techniques. Influenced by the distribution of Pb ore, the Pb concentration of urban street dust in China shows obvious regional differences, with value in the south 112% higher than that in the north. Among all kinds of mining types, metal-related mining activities discharge a large amount of Pb dust in the process of crushing and smelting, thus contributing most to the Pb load. The Pb load was also affected by transportation. The relationship between Pb load and gross domestic product (GDP) was described with the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model, which indicated that the Pb emissions of most cities were still increasing. Finally, the human health risk assessment model with adjusted parameters showed that the Pb risk of all cities was below the threshold. Despite all this, given the EKC law of Pb emission, long-term follow-up assessments are needed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","GDP; Lead distribution; Mining; Transportation; Urban street dust","Air pollution; Dust; Economics; Health; Health risks; Lead smelting; Mining; Particle size; Risk assessment; Transportation; Environmental Kuznets curves; Gross domestic products; Human health risk assessment; Long-term follow-up; Management techniques; Mining activities; Regional differences; Urban street dusts; Urban transportation; lead; metal; heavy metal; concentration (composition); dust; Gross Domestic Product; health risk; Kuznets curve; lead; mining; particle size; risk assessment; transportation system; urban area; adult; allometry; Article; child; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; crushing; dust; environment; environmental exploitation; follow up; gross national product; health hazard; human; lead distribution; mining; particle size; risk assessment; smelting; soil; traffic and transport; urban area; urban street dust; city; dust; environmental monitoring; gross national product; risk assessment; China; Beijing; China; Cities; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Gross Domestic Product; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082521307

ZnO.Fe2O3 were fabricated by facile co-precipitation approach for photocatalytic treatment of organic dyes. The structural features, phase purity, crystallite size and morphology of individual and mixed metal oxides were analysed by X-rays diffraction patterns (XRD) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. Electrical behaviour of CuO, ZnO, Fe2O3 and mixed metal oxides CuO. ZnO.Fe2O3 was explored by current-voltage (I-V) measurements. Functional groups present in the synthesized metal oxides were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) which ensures the existence of M-O functional groups in the samples. The optical bandgap analysis was carried out by UV–visible spectroscopic technique which revealed that the blend of three different transition metal oxides reduced the bandgap energy of mixed metal oxides. The reason behind this reduced bandgap energy is formation of new electronic state which arises due to the metal-oxygen interactions. Moreover, the nanocomposites of CuO.ZnO.Fe2O3 with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were prepared to study the effect of the carbonaceous materials on the rate of photodegradation. These carbonaceous nanomaterials have plethora properties which can bring advancement in sector of photocatalytic treatment of wastewater. The photocatalytic experiments were performed using methylene blue (MB) as standard dye for comparative study of metal oxides and their composites with rGO and CNTs. The percentage degradation of methylene blue (MB) by nanocomposite CuO.ZnO.Fe2O3/rGO is 87% which is prominent among all samples.

Results revealed that the average removal efficiencies of ammonium (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) were improved by 2.6%–5.2% and 2.5%–7.0%. Meanwhile, N2O emissions were reduced by 56.0%–67.5% after biochar addition. Increased nitrogen removal efficiency and decreased N2O emissions resulted from the increase of biochar addition ratio. Biochar addition changed the microbial community diversity and similarity. The relative abundance of functional microorganisms such as Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira, Thauera and Pseudomonas, increased due to biochar addition, which promoted the nitrogen cycle and N2O emission reduction. High gene copy number and enzyme activity involved in nitrification and denitrification process were obtained in biochar CWs, moderating N2O emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Constructed wetland; Enzyme; Microbial community; Nitrous oxide","Efficiency; Emission control; Enzymes; Genes; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Storm sewers; Wetlands; Bio chars; Constructed wetlands; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Nitrification and denitrification; Nitrous oxide; Pollutant removal performance; Subsurface flow constructed wetlands; Enzyme activity; ammonia; nitrogen; biochar; charcoal; nitrous oxide; ammonium; biochar; denitrification; emission control; enzyme; enzyme activity; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; pollutant removal; relative abundance; subsurface flow; Article; constructed wetland; controlled study; denitrification; enzyme activity; gene function; heavy metal removal; hydraulic retention time; microbial community; microcosm; nitrification; nitrifying bacterium; Nitrosomonas; Nitrospira; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; priority journal; Pseudomonas; Thauera; water pollutant; water quality; water sampling; microflora; pollutant; wetland; Nitrosomonas; Nitrospira; Pseudomonas; Thauera; Charcoal; Denitrification; Environmental Pollutants; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082517471

Objective: To investigate the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and dementia and to assess the role of CVD in that association. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data for this cohort study were extracted from the ongoing Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), a longitudinal population-based study with baseline assessments from March 21, 2001, through August 30, 2004. Of the 5111 randomly selected residents in the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm 60 years or older and living at home or in institutions, 521 were not eligible (eg, due to death before the start of the study or no contact information). Among the remaining 4590 individuals, 3363 (73.3%) were assessed. For the current analysis, 2927 participants who did not have dementia at baseline were examined, with follow-up to 2013 (mean [SD] follow-up time, 6.01 [2.56] years). Follow-up was completed February 18, 2013, and data were analyzed from June 26, 2018, through June 20, 2019. Exposures: Two major air pollutants (particulate matter ≤2.5 μm [PM2.5] and nitrogen oxide [NOx]) were assessed yearly from 1990, using dispersion models for outdoor levels at residential addresses. Main Outcomes and Measures: The hazard of dementia was estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. The potential of CVD (ie, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) to modify and mediate the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and dementia was tested using stratified analyses and generalized structural equation modeling. Results: At baseline, the mean (SD) age of the 2927 participants was 74.1 (10.7) years, and 1845 (63.0%) were female. Three hundred sixty-four participants with incident dementia were identified. The hazard of dementia increased by as much as 50% per interquartile range difference in mean pollutant levels during the previous 5 years at the residential address (hazard ratio [HR] for difference of 0.88 μg/m3 PM2.5, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.33-1.78]; HR for difference of 8.35 μg/m3 NOx, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.01-1.29]). Heart failure (HR for PM2.5, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.54-2.43]; HR for NOx, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.17-1.75]) and ischemic heart disease (HR for PM2.5, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.32-2.12]; HR for NOx, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.07-1.71]) enhanced the dementia risk, whereas stroke appeared to be the most important intermediate condition, explaining 49.4% of air pollution-related dementia cases. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with a higher risk of dementia. Heart failure and ischemic heart disease appeared to enhance the association between air pollution and dementia, whereas stroke seemed to be an important intermediate condition between the association of air pollution exposure with dementia. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Central Asia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, but the understanding of the impacts of climate change on yields is incomplete for this region. We used fixed-effect panel regressions to quantify the impacts of climate trends on wheat and barley yields from 1980 to 2015 in the northern part of Kazakhstan, which is a globally important cereal-producing region. Our results suggest large spatial variations in the impacts of climate change on yields. Compared with the counterfactual situation without climate trends, the observed changes in climate reduced wheat and barley yields by 1.9% and 4.8%, respectively, in the primary cereal-producing region in the west of the study area. These negative impacts were partly compensated for by positive effects in the eastern part of the study region. Extreme heat events had little impact on wheat and barley yields. Suitable adaptation strategies include switching to more drought-resistant crops or to extensive livestock production in areas where climate change has negatively affected crop yields, and the expansion of cereal production in areas that have benefited from climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Central Asia; Climatic change; Crop productivity; Heat extremes; Northern Kazakhstan; Panel regression; Statistical analysis","adaptation; barley; climate change; crop production; drought resistance; livestock farming; regression analysis; semiarid region; spatial variation; statistical analysis; wheat; Central Asia; Kazakhstan; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082406143

Organic carbon degradation and sulfidization along continental shelves are expected to play a significant role in global carbon-sulfur-iron (C–S–Fe) cycles. Here we report sediment pore-water chemistry and iron-sulfur speciation in two short cores SSK-42/9 and 10 collected off Malvan from the seasonally hypoxic shelf region off the west coast of India (WCI) at water depths of 30 and 13 m respectively. Concentration profiles of pore-water SO4 2−, NH4 +, DIC, ΣHS− and depth-integrated sulfate reduction rates (JSO4) suggest a variable influence of sedimentation rates, the composition of organic matter (marine and terrestrial) and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) on the pore-fluid chemistry. Chromium reducible sulfur (CRS) and organic-bound sulfur (OBS) are the detectable solid-phase sulfur species in the studied sediment cores. Sulfur content and isotope ratios of chromium reducible sulfur (CRS) and organic-bound sulfur (OBS) phases produced via HS−/Sx 2− pathways (sulfidization and sulfurization) show contrasting profiles in SSK42/9 and 10, apparently influenced by the availability of reactive iron, the relative significance of early and late diagenetic processes, source of OBS (detritus of marine origin and sulfurized organic molecules) and diffusion of ΣHS− produced via AOM across the SMTZ. The marked influence of AOM-driven sulfate reduction and the diffusion of isotopically enriched hydrogen sulfide across the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) is apparent from the δ34SCRS profiles in SSK-42/10. Sediment TOC/TS ratios recorded in this study are significantly less than that of average modern marine surface sediments (2.8:1) underlying oxygenated water and this is attributed to the enhanced sulfidization and burial of iron-sulfur minerals in the seasonally hypoxic regions. Since the inner shelf of WCI experiences seasonal alternation from normoxia to hypoxia which may have a profound influence on the benthic community structure, nature, and depth of bioturbation/bioirrigation, we propose that the impact of these processes need to be studied at a significantly higher resolution for better understanding C–S–Fe biogeochemical cycle. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon remineralization; Pyrite burial; Reactive iron; Seasonal hypoxia; Sulfate reduction; Sulfur diagenesis","Biogeochemistry; Chromium; Hydraulic structures; Methane; Pyrites; Sediments; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Water; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Chromium reducible sulfurs; Concentration profiles; Organic carbon burial; Remineralization; Seasonal hypoxia; Sulfate reduction; Sulfate-methane transitions; Organic carbon; carbon; diagenesis; hypoxic conditions; iron; porewater; pyrite; reduction; remineralization; sediment chemistry; shelf sediment; speciation (chemistry); sulfate; sulfur; India; Maharashtra; Malvan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082382353

Nation states were given special responsibility to facilitate these by ensuring access to information and opportunities to participate in decision-making processes. Since then the need for public participation has featured prominently in calls to climate action. Using text analysis to produce a corpus of abstracts drawn from Web of Science, a review of literature incorporating public participation and citizen engagement in climate change adaptation since 1992 reveals lexical, temporal, and spatial distribution dynamics of research on the topic. An exponential rise in research effort since the year 2000 is demonstrated, with the focus of research action on three substantial themes—risk, flood risk, and risk assessment, perception, and communication. These are critically reviewed and three substantive issues are considered: the paradox of participation, the challenge of governance transformation, and the need to incorporate psycho-social and behavioral adaptation to climate change in policy processes. Gaps in current research include a lack of common understanding of public participation for climate adaptation across disciplines; incomplete articulation of processes involving public participation and citizen engagement; and a paucity of empirical research examining how understanding and usage of influential concepts of risk, vulnerability and adaptive capacity varies among different disciplines and stakeholders. Finally, a provisional research agenda for attending to these gaps is described.

At the local scale, carbon stock and dynamics can be determined by the environment and ecosystem diversity. Also, during forest regeneration, which is a temporal process, it is expected that those factors that influence carbon also change over time. Here we examine how carbon stock and dynamics are influenced by forest age, environment and functional diversity during forest regeneration. Using the relative effects of the different drivers of carbon dynamics, we attempt to discern the mechanisms (mass effect or niche complementarity) that explain those processes. Location: We carried out this study in Atlantic Forest of different ages during natural regeneration in southern Brazil. Methods: We measured environmental characteristics (soil physical and chemical attributes and canopy openness), estimated functional diversity and above-ground carbon and its dynamics over time. We examined univariate and multivariate predictors of carbon stock and dynamics using structural equation models. Results: We found that age had the strongest influence on carbon stock, while environmental characteristics, functional and taxonomic diversities were much less important or unimportant. Our results suggest that the influence of time on tropical forest carbon dynamics overlaps and outweighs the effects due to environmental limits and mechanisms mediated by diversity (mass effects, niche complementarity). Conclusions: Natural regeneration can be an effective strategy for restoring carbon sequestration and methods that use manipulation of regenerating forests with the hope of improving the process are unlikely to bring additional advantage in terms of carbon sequestration. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science","Atlantic Forest; carbon dynamics; environmental characteristics; functional diversity; natural regeneration; restoration; structural equation model; taxonomic diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082321549

Indeed, the largest source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is related to electricity and heat production, with residential and commercial buildings being responsible for 60% of global electricity demand. At the same time, the agri-food system is also very energy and carbon intensive and it is responsible for a considerate amount of GHG emissions. Individual behaviours related to electricity, heat, and food consumption may have strong impacts on GHG emissions opening interesting opportunities for climate change mitigation among end-users. In this direction, this paper aims at investigating the impact (if any) of two important 2015 events on consumer behaviour and awareness about the climate and environmental impacts of their everyday choices. Indeed, in current society, media coverage of events has shown to be relevant in affecting consumer perceptions and behaviour. The events analysed are: the release of Pope Francis' encyclical ‘Laudato si’ - On Care For Our Common Home’ about environmental issues and climate change; and the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) with the signature of the Paris Agreement. Data were collected via interviews with a sample of consumers in the context of Milan, a large European city. Data were analysed by means of descriptive statistics and ordinal regression models. Results indicate that such events have had an effect, mostly on people that have a positive attitude towards such events but were not so much aware about the related discussions beforehand. Policy implications highlight the role of opinion leaders in engaging the segments of population that are not already proactive on the matter, which is indeed the target of well-aimed policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral change; Climate Change awareness; Consumer awareness; COP21; Electricity consumption; Encyclical; Food choice; International events; Interviews; Media coverage; Pro-environmental behaviour; Public opinion; Sustainability","Electric power utilization; Environmental impact; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Office buildings; Public policy; Regression analysis; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Behavioral changes; Change awareness; Consumer awareness; COP21; Electricity-consumption; Encyclical; International events; Interviews; Media coverage; Pro-environmental behaviour; Public opinions; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082199032

The central premise is that FDI decisions by Multinational Enterprises (MNE) are influenced, among other factors, by risk and uncertainty indicated by equity market returns and volatilities in the destination (host) countries. This is because of the events on the stock markets in general, and their volatilities, in particular, signal the vitality of the investment climate of the target country. Including capital market variables among the determinants of FDI is important for assessing the cost of capital and for evaluating direct investment and asset allocation decisions. Secondary time-series data (quarterly) were used on incoming US FDI from 1994 to 2018 along with data on independent variables such as exchange rates, inflation, market size, equity market returns, and equity market volatilities. Thus, the paper endeavors to contribute to the International Business literature by highlighting the role played of equity returns and volatilities in FDI decisions and therewith attempts to integrate finance (capital markets) with International Business/Strategic Decision making. Several different regression specifications (OLS, Fixed, and random-effects and VAR) were utilized to analyze the data, and capital market variables (stock returns and volatilities) were found to influence the location of production facilities by a multinational enterprise (MNE). In other words, the share of production capacity optimally located abroad, as well as M&A decisions, are influenced by capital market returns and volatilities. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Equity returns and volatilities; FDI decisions; M&A; Supply chains",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082193727

Consequently, solid waste generation has turned into a problem of significant proportions in many countries with severe degradation of land, air, and water quality and adverse effects on environment and public health. New waste-to-energy (WtE) systems using municipal solid waste (MSW) to produce energy (based on emerging technologies beyond traditional incineration), can serve as a useful bridge towards sustainable waste management. In this paper, a quantitative Waste to Energy Recovery Assessment (WERA) framework is used to stochastically analyze the feasibility of WtE in selected cities in Asia. Future policy measures of feed-in tariffs, payments for avoided pollution, and higher waste collection fees are assessed to evaluate if WtE systems can be made self-sustaining investments. The results show that WtE systems can generate up to 290 GWh of electricity in Karachi, and up to 60 GWh in Delhi from municipal waste feedstock from which recyclables (such as paper and plastics) have been removed. Net Present Value (NPV) estimation shows that hybrid WtE technology systems can be feasible in Karachi and Delhi with policy support, however Jakarta's case is challenging due to higher costs. Future investments for waste systems should use holistic evaluations that incorporate key social benefits and costs – not only of energy generation but also of emissions reductions and impacts on public health – and identify necessary policy support for ensuring viable and sustainable solutions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-benefit analysis; Environment policy; Green growth; Monte Carlo simulation; Municipal solid waste; Recycling; Stochastic simulation; Waste-to-energy","computer simulation; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; energy resource; environmental policy; Monte Carlo analysis; municipal solid waste; numerical model; policy approach; recycling; tariff structure; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082181238

With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5 changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5 concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79 μg/m3 in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively. In high-pollution days with PM2.5 greater than 75 μg/m3, the reductions of PM2.5 in Case 3 were 7.78, 9.51, 11.38, 13.42, 13.64, 14.15, 14.42, 16.95 and 22.08 μg/m3 in Shanghai, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, Beijing, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Tianjin, Zhengzhou and Wuhan, respectively. The reductions in emissions of PM2.5 precursors were ~2 times of that in concentrations, indicating that meteorology was unfavorable during simulation episode. A further analysis shows that benefits of emission reductions were overwhelmed by adverse meteorology and severe air pollution events were not avoided. This study highlights that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution in China, especially when meteorology is unfavorable.

However, the downscaling of PB as a guide remains a challenge at the local scale. This study aims to establish absolute environmentally sustainable indicators (AESIs) and a threshold based on five processes of the Earth system, namely, climate change, ocean acidification, biogeochemical flow (phosphorus and nitrogen cycles), land system change, and freshwater use, for local AES assessment. A case study of Taiwan was conducted. This work also introduced the dynamic concept into developing dynamic normalization factors (DNFs) and dynamic weighting factors (DWFs) for AESIs to support decision-making. DNFs were defined as desired targets in the future; they were developed on the basis of the thresholds of AESIs at the global and national levels in a different timeline. DWFs were defined as weights for assessing the distance of a current situation from the desired targets; they were evaluated on the basis of the distance-to-target approach. The territorial perspective was adopted as a downscaling method to develop 11 AESIs and thresholds based on the PB framework for the AES assessment of Taiwan. Results showed that the nationally determined contribution target of the carbon pathway is not ambitious compared with the annual and cumulative boundaries of climate change and ocean acidification. Phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers are two of the three subcategories in biogeochemical flow with very high risks. Phosphorus flow from a freshwater system to the oceans and forest cover was evaluated as moderate risk. Meanwhile, annual freshwater use was determined as low risk. However, when spatial and temporal factors were considered, annual freshwater use was assessed as high risk during the dry season in Southern and Central Taiwan. DNFs and DWFs are more suitable at the local level than at the global level when applying normalization and weighting to reflect a real situation. This study not only provided a new concept for local policy makers to rethink environmental sustainability, but also explored various AES tools at the local scale to connect the local situation with global issues to support decision-making. © 2020","Absolute environmental sustainability; Dynamic normalization factor; Dynamic weighting factor; Planetary boundary","Acidification; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Decision making; Earth (planet); Nitrogen fertilizers; Phosphorus; Risk assessment; Water; Distance to targets; Downscaling methods; Environmental sustainability; Normalization factors; Ocean acidifications; Planetary boundary; Sustainable indicators; Weighting factors; Sustainable development; assessment method; boundary layer; climate change; decision making; dry season; forest cover; ocean acidification; policy making; sustainability; threshold; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082173595

Rewriting algorithms are proposed to reduce the chunk fragmentation. Typically, the backup software aggregates files into larger 'tar' type files for storage. We observe that, in tar type datasets, a large number of Persistent Fragmented Chunks (PFCs) are repeatedly rewritten by state-of-the-art rewriting algorithms in every backup, which severely impacts restore performance. We found that the existence of PFCs is due to the traditional strategy of storing PFCs along with other chunks in the containers to preserve the stream locality, rendering them always stored in the containers with low utilization. We propose DePFC to reduce PFCs. DePFC identifies and removes PFCs from the containers preserving the stream locality, and groups them together, to increase the utilization of containers holding them for the subsequent backup, thus preventing them from being rewritten again. We further propose an FC Buffer to avoid mistaken rewrites of PFCs and grouping PFCs that cause restore cache thrashing together. Experimental results demonstrate that DePFC improves restore performance of state-of-the-art rewriting algorithms by 44.24-89.42 percent, while attaining comparable deduplication efficiency, and FC Buffer further improves restore performance. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","chunk fragmentation; Data deduplication; restore performance; storage system","Containers; Digital storage; Large dataset; Tar; Backup software; chunk fragmentation; Data de duplications; Redundancy elimination; restore performance; Rewriting algorithm; State of the art; Storage systems; Restoration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082170965

For the first time, the impact of increasing the local proton concentration of cobalt porphyrin was examined by synthesizing new cobalt porphyrins 2, Co(o-OCH3)TPP and cobalt porphyrin 3, Co(o-OH)TPP. Cobalt porphyrins coated on carbon paper converted carbon dioxide and water into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in an aqueous electrolyte at near neutral pH. Increasing the local proton availability of the commercial cobalt porphyrin 1, accelerates hydrogen generation under heterogeneous conditions across the range of potentials tested (−0.85 to −1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and demonstrates high Faradaic efficiencies (ca. 90%) at low over-potentials (ca. 540 mV). The culmination of this work can help identify key parameters that facilitate generation of sustainable reagents for catalytic hydrogenation under practical and scalable conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Catalytic hydrogenation; Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction; Heterogeneous electrocatalysis; Local proton source; Modified ligand porphyrin","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Electrocatalysis; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Hydrogenation; Ligands; Porphyrins; Catalytic hydrogenation; CO2 reduction; Electrochemical reductions; Faradaic efficiencies; Heterogeneous conditions; Hydrogen generations; Proton concentrations; Proton source; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082138668

The assessment of how much distortion a bulk use of power electronics devices can inject into the grid is necessary before stating emission limits and planning levels for supraharmonics. To address this issue, the development of suitable models that can predict the supraharmonic emission from a low-voltage installation as a whole is required. This article presents a comparison of models for the summation of supraharmonics. An improved model for the summation of supraharmonics is proposed, which is validated experimentally. It is shown that by using the proposed model, predictions of supraharmonic propagation can be accomplished. Furthermore, it is demonstrated experimentally that, with the increasing number of supraharmonic emitting devices, the supraharmonic current distortion injected into a grid by an installation increases up to a maximum value and then decreases due to the capacitive nature of power electronics appliances existing in low-voltage networks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","High-frequency distortion; Power quality; Summation; Supraharmonics","Electric power transmission networks; Electronic assessment; Installation; Power electronics; Power quality; Comparison of models; Current distortion; Emission limits; High frequency HF; Low voltage network; Power electronics devices; Summation; Supraharmonics; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082135782

This paper systematically reviews the literature on the relationship among environmental regulation, green technology, and carbon intensity, and assumes that green technology is a potential mediator of the impact of environmental regulation on carbon intensity. The advanced SBM model and the factor analysis method were performed to measure the relationships. To explore the mediating effect of green technology, the two-step econometric model and the nonlinear mediating effect model were applied to a panel dataset of 30 provinces in China spanning the period 2005–2016. The results show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and green technology, and a U-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and carbon intensity. Green technology has a significant negative impact on carbon intensity. This proves that green technology is an important mediating variable on the relationship between environmental regulation and carbon intensity. Moreover, the current environmental regulation intensity lies before the inflection point of both the inverted U-shaped and the U-shaped curves. The effects of environmental regulation on green technology and carbon intensity in developed and developing regions follow an inverted U-shaped, and a U-shaped curve, respectively. Furthermore, the mediating effect in developing regions is significantly larger than that in developed regions. Finally, policy implications are given to reduce carbon intensity. © 2020","Carbon intensity; Environmental regulation; Green technology; Nonlinear mediating effect; Two-step econometric model","Carbon; Environmental technology; Global warming; Public policy; Carbon intensity; Developing regions; Econometric model; Factor analysis method; Green technology; Inflection points; Mediating effect; Policy implications; Environmental regulations; carbon emission; developing world; environmental economics; environmental gradient; factor analysis; global warming; green economy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082018984

The objective and accurate prediction of carbon emissions can serve as a reference and advance indicator for the implementation of a government's environmental strategy. In this paper, based on a Gaussian vector basis kernel function and a global polynomial kernel function combined with the characteristics of grey prediction models, a new multi-kernel GMC(1,N) model is established that is more comprehensive and suitable for nonlinearity. It can enable more flexible improvements in prediction modelling accuracy. In this study, this new model is used to simulate the carbon dioxide emissions in Chongqing, China (one of the four municipalities under the direct control of the central government), from 2009 to 2015. Raw coal and cleaned coal, which have the most significant impact on carbon emissions, are selected to analyse the effectiveness of the model. The results show that the proposed model offers better simulation and prediction accuracy than four other models considered for comparison. Moreover, the carbon dioxide emissions of Chongqing in 2016–2020 are expected to be similar to those of the previous years. Therefore, to prevent a strong rebound of carbon emissions, it will be necessary to increase energy conservation and emission reduction efforts and to reduce energy consumption, especially coal consumption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Forecasting; Grey system theory; Kernel function; Multi-kernel nonlinear multivariable grey model","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Global warming; System theory; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Environmental problems; Environmental strategy; Grey system theory; Kernel function; Multi-variable grey models; Reduce energy consumption; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082004801

It is marked by more pronounced seasonality and reduced greenhouse gases (GHGs) than the present state, as well as by the presence of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and glacial meltwater perturbation. This paper performs experiments under pre-industrial and different early-Holocene regimes with AWI-ESM (Alfred Wegener Institute–Earth System Model), a state-of-the-art climate model with unstructured mesh and varying resolutions, to examine the sensitivity of the simulated Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to early-Holocene insolation, GHGs, topography (including properties of the ice sheet), and glacial meltwater perturbation. In the experiments with early-Holocene Earth orbital parameters and GHGs applied, the AWI-ESM simulation shows a JJA (June–July–August) warming and DJF (December–January–February) cooling over the mid and high latitudes compared with pre-industrial conditions, with amplification over the continents. The presence of the LIS leads to an additional regional cooling over the North America. We also simulate the meltwater event around 8.2k. Big discrepancies are found in the oceanic responses to different locations and magnitudes of freshwater discharge. Our experiments, which compare the effects of freshwater release evenly across the Labrador Sea to a more precise injection along the western boundary of the North Atlantic (the coastal region of LIS), show significant differences in the ocean circulation response, as the former produces a major decline of the AMOC and the latter yields no obvious effect on the strength of the thermohaline circulation. Furthermore, proglacial drainage of Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway leads to a fast spin-down of the AMOC, followed, however, by a gradual recovery. Most hosing experiments lead to a warming over the Nordic Sea and Barents Sea of varying magnitudes, because of an enhanced inflow from lower latitudes and a northward displacement of the North Atlantic deep convection. These processes exist in both of our high- and low-resolution experiments, but with some local discrepancies such as (1) the hosing-induced subpolar warming is much less pronounced in the high-resolution simulations; (2) LIS coastal melting in the high-resolution model leads to a slight decrease in the AMOC; and (3) the convection formation site in the low- and high-resolution experiments differs, in the former mainly over northeastern North Atlantic Ocean, but in the latter over a very shallow subpolar region along the northern edge of the North Atlantic Ocean. In conclusion, we find that our simulations capture spatially heterogeneous responses of the early-Holocene climate. © The Author(s) 2020.","early-Holocene; freshwater perturbation; ice sheet","climate forcing; climate modeling; convection; Holocene; last deglaciation; Laurentide Ice Sheet; meltwater; overturn; seasonality; simulation; western boundary current; Agassiz; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Barents Sea; British Columbia; Canada; Labrador Sea; Lake Ojibway; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081975544

Electric heating, as a kind of clean heating method, has been promoted to replace coal-fired heating. However, owing to the power structure dominated by coal power in China, electric heating may cause more carbon emissions than that of coal-fired heating if the scale of the former exceeds relative limit. It is essential to study the electric heating area development limit to ensure carbon reduction compared with that of coal-fired heating. In this paper, based on the analysis of carbon emissions from coal-fired heating and electric heating, a calculation model for the substitutable value of electric heating instead of coal heating is established under carbon constraints. The model reveals that the substitutable value is related to the total heating area and the power structure. The Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network forecasting model is constructed to forecast total central heating area in urban areas of northern China from 2020 to 2035. The baseline scenario (BS), low carbon scenario (LCS) and enhanced low carbon scenario (ELCS) are set to forecast the power structure in northern China. The results show that under the BS, the substitutable value of electric heating instead of coal heating can reach 15.058 billion square meters by 2035. Under the LCS and ELCS, the substitutable value will be even greater by 2035, 18.726 and 25.080 billion square meters, respectively.

They can account for more than 40% of total energy consumption in any typical commercial building and in specific industrial building installations depending on the product and process. With climate change driving rapidly rising demand for commercial and industrial cooling, especially in emerging economies, energy efficiency policies for chillers are crucial to moderate future electricity demand and thereby minimize greenhouse gas emissions. However, most developing and emerging economies lack energy efficiency policies for this significant and growing cooling equipment sector. India recently announced new energy efficiency policies for chillers, projected to avoid 28 TWh of electricity consumption and 23 million tons of CO2 emissions cumulatively through 2030. This article presents a case study of the unique challenges and solutions required to design a new energy efficiency policy for chillers in India. First, the energy consumed in chiller systems is sensitive to building occupancy, load changes, seasonal variations, operation and maintenance, and climatic conditions. In order to address these sensitivities, the chiller testing standard in India factors local weather and temperature conditions into energy performance ratings to account for these sensitivities. Further, every large chiller is a customized product, therefore developing a viable policy and implementation process required collaboration with international and national experts in standardization, manufacturers, building consultants, and testing laboratories.

In recent years, empirical and processed-based mathematical models have been developed to investigate such changes in plant communities. In the study reported here, a robust set of understory vegetation response functions (expressed as version 2 of the Probability of Occurrence of Plant Species model for the United States [US-PROPS v2]) was developed based on observations of forest understory and grassland plant species presence/absence and associated abiotic characteristics derived from spatial datasets. Improvements to the US-PROPS model, relative to version 1, were mostly focused on inclusion of additional input data, development of custom species-level input datasets, and implementation of methods to address uncertainty. We investigated the application of US-PROPS v2 to evaluate the potential impacts of atmospheric nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition, and climate change on forest ecosystems at three forested sites located in New Hampshire, Virginia, and Tennessee in the eastern United States. Species-level N and S critical loads (CLs) were determined under ambient deposition at all three modeled sites. The lowest species-level CLs of N deposition at each site were between 2 and 11 kg N/ha/yr. Similarly, the lowest CLs of S deposition, based on the predicted soil pH response, were less than 2 kg S/ha/yr among the three sites. Critical load exceedance was found at all three model sites. The New Hampshire site included the largest percentage of species in exceedance. Simulated warming air temperature typically resulted in lower maximum occurrence probability, which contributed to lower CLs of N and S deposition. The US-PROPS v2 model, together with the PROPS-CLF model to derive CL functions, can be used to develop site-specific CLs for understory plants within broad regions of the United States. This study demonstrates that species-level CLs of N and S deposition are spatially variable according to the climate, light availability, and soil characteristics at a given location. Although the species niche models generally performed well in predicting occurrence probability, there remains uncertainty with respect to the accuracy of reported CLs. As such, the specific CLs reported here should be considered as preliminary estimates. Critical loads of atmospheric nitrogen and sulfur deposition were determined for maintaining understory vegetation diversity. Critical load exceedance was found at all model application sites. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Climate change; Critical load; Forest understory; Nitrogen","Air pollution; Biodiversity; Deposition; Ecosystems; Forestry; Nitrogen; Probability; Vegetation; Atmospheric nitrogen; Critical load; Forest understory; Occurrence probability; Probability of occurrence; Soil characteristics; Understory plant communities; Understory vegetation; Climate change; nitrogen; sulfur; nitrogen; atmospheric pollution; biodiversity; climate change; forest cover; nitrogen; numerical model; plant community; threshold; understory; abiotic stress; air pollution; air temperature; Article; atmospheric deposition; climate change; grassland; light exposure; mathematical model; nitrogen deposition; nonhuman; plant community; prediction; soil acidity; soil property; United States; vegetation; ecosystem; forest; Tennessee; Virginia; United States; Air Pollution; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Nitrogen; Tennessee; United States; Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081904111

However, the inaccuracy of global soil and climate databases to account for the large environmental variation occurring at small spatial scale prevents accurate estimations of the linkages between environmental variables and fine-root strategies. Here, using two global databases on fine-root traits (Rhizopolis-db) and species phylogenetic relatedness, and a regional database of species ecological indicator values (Baseflor), we quantified the predictive value of ecological indicator values, as an alternative to classical coarse soil and climate indicators, on the variation in four major fine-root traits. A strong phylogenetic signal was found among species for fine-root mean diameter, specific root length (SRL) and root tissue density (RTD), but less so for root nitrogen concentration (RNC). After accounting for this relatedness, ecological indicators still explained a large part of trait variation in our dataset for SRL, RTD and RNC. Multi-indicators best model R2 reached.40 for SRL and RTD, and.44 for RNC, whereas it was only 0.10 for diameter. Ecological indicators of nutrient availability and soil texture were those that most strongly related to SRL, RTD and RNC. Specifically, plant fast resources use strategies characterized by high SRL, RNC and low RTD occurred more frequently in nutrient-rich soils and in soils with light sandy textures. Additionally, light availability and atmospheric temperature were negatively related with SRL and continentality negatively influenced RNC. With respect to both nutrient and water availability ecological indicator values, opposite adaptations were observed between growth forms, particularly between woody and herbaceous species, limiting our ability to define simple, widely applicable patterns of trait–environment relationships. Synthesis. Our analysis demonstrates that species ecological indicator values are valuable predictors of plant below-ground strategies. It provides original evidence that herbaceous species with fine-root traits representative of fast resource use strategies typically occur in more favourable soil habitats (high nutrient and water availability); meanwhile, woody species may show the opposite trend. Other important environmental parameters concomitantly influence fine-root trait variation in contrasting ways. © 2020 British Ecological Society","ecological indicator values; environmental gradients; fine-root traits; plant–climate interactions; plant–soil (below-ground) interactions; root nitrogen concentration; root tissue density; specific root length","adaptation; air temperature; environmental gradient; environmental indicator; fine root; herb; life history trait; light availability; phylogenetics; woody plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081742753

The proportion of Fe/Al-associated organic carbon in the soil total organic carbon showed the opposite order. The fertilizations, especially the AM and NPKS treatments, increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Ascomycota as well as the activity of β-glucosidase and invertase. Structural equation modeling showed that the activity of the hydrolases, the content of labile organic carbon, and the composition and diversity of the microbes were positive factors in controlling SOM mineralization. Among the positive factors, the activity of the hydrolases was the most important, and the content of labile organic carbon was more important than the composition and diversity of the microbes.

The city of Shenzhen, in southern China, has focused on developing policies to encourage EV implementation over the past decade and now has the most EVs of any city in the world, including the largest e-bus and e-taxi fleets. This paper reviews Shenzhen's innovative incentive policies and business models with respect to the potential for other cities and regions to learn from the city's experiences. Subsidies for the purchase and use of EVs, the construction of charging facilities, and the provision of services followed an inverse U-shaped trend that initially rose to encourage early adoption before decreasing as the market matured. Additional incentives included preferential vehicle licensing, parking privileges, and road access. Furthermore, the city adopted a business model that incentivized cooperation between third-party financial institutions, EV manufacturers, and charging facility operators to reduce the initial financial burden and risk of EV adoption by pooling purchasing power through leasing and vehicle sharing while disassociating vehicle and battery maintenance. Although Shenzhen's experience has unique aspects that cannot easily be replicated, such as a strong financial position of the government, it offers two important lessons for other cities around the globe: (a) incentivize the whole EV value chain in order to avoid bottlenecks and (b) use innovative business models that mobilize both public and private resources by distributing both risks and rewards.

Most of the current knowledge on this topic is based on studies at the individual or species level. However, patterns at these levels can hardly reflect the response of vegetation or ecosystems along environmental gradients. Here, we explored how the nutrient demands of vegetation as a whole vary with productivity, climate and soil nutrient availability by generalizing the scaling relationship from the individual to the community level using community-weighted mean data from shrub communities at 1,080 shrubland sites and tree communities at 2,087 forest sites across China. By comparing the community-level leaf N–P scaling exponents under different conditions and using a bootstrapping method to construct continuous environmental gradients, we found that the scaling exponents declined with increased primary productivity (i.e. growth rate at the community level), temperature and water availability, indicating a higher P demand relative to N under these conditions. In addition, the scaling exponent of shrub communities had a declining trend, while that of tree communities had a rising trend, with higher soil N availability, showing a more resistant response of shrub communities to nutrient limitation. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that leaf N–P scaling exponents could be used as indicators of plant growth conditions and, more importantly, that communities, as assemblages of plants, exhibits varied nutrient preferences and utilization strategies among different habitat conditions. © 2020 British Ecological Society","biogeography and macroecology; community-weighted mean; growth rate hypothesis; moisture; primary productivity; soil nutrient limitation; temperature","assembly rule; bootstrapping; climate change; community dynamics; community response; concentration (composition); environmental gradient; growth; growth rate; leaf; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient limitation; nutrient uptake; phosphorus; plant community; shrub; soil nutrient; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081717864

On-road vehicles are the main contributing source to this kind of pollution. They are strictly regulated in many countries, with limitations on the number and concentration of released particles, and they must be equipped with particle abatement systems. Wall-flow particulate filters are the most popular and effective devices to reduce particulate emissions from diesel and gasoline vehicles. Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) have been a recurrent research topic since the last century. There are different research studies analysing different aspects of these systems, at different levels, using different methodologies and different approaches. Their results are not always comparable. This work analyses the latest advances and trends in this technology by comparing two relevant performance parameters: their filtration efficiency and pressure drop. The findings of this study suggest that, in order to be competitive, upcoming DPFs should have filtration efficiencies above 80%, and pressure drops below 10 kPa, for space velocities of 1.5·105 h−1 or more at the clean state. They should reach ∼100% efficiency after a short operation period, before the soot load reaches 0.2 g/L.

In China, two main MSW treatment options exist: landfill and incineration. The objective of this study was to evaluate the landfill and incineration methods in terms of two important indicators, energy balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to discuss the advantages as they relate to decarbonization policy. We set up two landfill cases: LF-Anaero, which adopted an anaerobic landfill structure, and LF-SAero, which adopted a semi-aerobic landfill structure. Two incineration cases were also established: INC-Non, where the MSW was not subjected to separated collection of non-burnable waste, and INC-Sep, where separated collection was conducted. Two conditions were also established. In the one-year condition, waste was assumed to entirely decompose in one year, whereas in the variable decomposition condition, the rate varied. Under the one-year condition, INC-Sep gave the best results for both energy balance and GHG emission reduction. When the decomposition rate of landfilled waste was considered, LF-SAero and INC-Sep had very similar cumulative amounts of GHG emissions after 50 years. However, in INC-Sep, the emissions all occurred in the first 20 years. In LF-SAero, about one-third of the emissions were accounted for in the last 30 years (after the landfill was out of service). Thus, this landfill method must be considered as a GHG emission source for a longer period when considering the total global warming impact. We concluded that INC-Sep is the superior technological option. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas (GHG); Heat balance analysis; Incineration; Landfill; Waste to energy","Emission control; Energy balance; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Land fill; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Comparative assessment; Global warming impact; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Heat balance analysis; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Semi-aerobic landfill; Waste disposal systems; Waste to energy; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081690928

Since it is crucial to determine the parameters that present the local conditions in Kuwait, this study was developed to modify the passenger car equivalent (PCE) values at different signalized intersections in Kuwait and obtain the heavy-vehicle adjustment factor. The headway ratio method was utilized to determine the PCE values for different kinds of vehicles. 1. The PCE values were 1.14, 1.11, 1.26, 1.68 and 1.48 for sport utility vehicles (SUV), pickups, minibuses, trucks, and buses respectively. 2.The heavy vehicle adjustment factor was 0.891. Synchro simulation software was utilized to build different scenarios for improving an existing intersection and compare the network performance for each scenario. Two scenarios were chosen to be the best which are having five lanes with 2.4 m width for the first scenario and 2.7 m width for the second one. 3. Based on Synchro results, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions parameters were used to estimate the cost difference in the two best scenarios, and it was 10.71 and 13.23 Kuwaiti dinar (KD), respectively. Also, the percentage reduction of the emissions were 15.5% and 19.19%, respectively. The impact of adding an extra lane was noticed to be better compared with increasing the lane widths in a significant way. Additionally, it is a must to localize the parameters to represent the local conditions in Kuwait. The heavy-vehicle adjustment factor has an essential effect on the network performance which indicates that the PCE values should be determined accurately. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Passenger car equivalent (PCE); Signalized intersections; Traffic conditions","Automobiles; Computer software; Highway engineering; Motor transportation; Network performance; Particulate emissions; Synchros; Utility trucks; Headway ratio methods; Highway capacity manual; Passenger car equivalents (PCE); Pollutant emission; Signalized intersection; Simulation software; Sport utility vehicles; Traffic conditions; Highway traffic control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081690616

Campus lighting is on automatically with the daylight sensor and operates for 10 h on average during the summer times and 13 h on average during the winter times. For this outdoor lighting system, energy-efficient lighting alternatives are investigated under four different scenarios. These scenarios are: shutting down some lamps 30 min after the education finishes at the campus; dimming for lamps; retrofitting the non-LED lights with effective LED lights and finally using the last two alternatives together. Next, potential energy-saving and the effects of this energy-saving on the environment are analyzed. According to the analysis results, a combination of retrofitting the lighting and dimming control systems are calculated to save 762 MWh electrical energy annually. With the reduced energy consumption, it is possible to cut down fossil fuels for electricity production and release 251 tons less carbon to the atmosphere annually. When the cost comparison is made for 12 years, it is predicted that about 1.3 million euros will be saved in the fourth scenario. Available traditional lighting systems in almost all of the cities in Turkey are inadequate in terms of energy efficiency. General lighting services constitute a significant part of the municipalities’ electricity costs in small cities.

HI initially realized the most desirable strong decoupling; while decoupling state of UMI and LMI were rather not ideal enough, especially LMI, changed violently and appeared no clear improving trend. Turning to decomposition results. energy transition had positively contributed to decoupling process of HI, while not in UMI and LMI. HI enjoyed better energy utilization efficiency, absolutely offsetting negative impact caused by economic scale to decoupling process. More importantly, UMI and LMI had great economic potential and will definitely emit tremendous carbon emission without taking appropriate measurements. Consequently, UMI and LMI shall take more responsibility to reduce carbon emission and actively accelerate the process of energy transition so as to achieve economic growth strongly decouple from carbon emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon intensity; Decomposition analysis; Decoupling state; Economic scale; Energy intensity; Income level group","Carbon; Energy utilization; Linear matrix inequalities; Carbon intensity; Decomposition analysis; Decoupling state; Energy intensity; Income levels; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081662058

The deposits of Kisenge-Kamata are the most significant, but manganese ores are also known to occur at Kasekelesa (former Katanga Province) and Mwene-Ditu (former Kasai Province). For the present study, cryptomelane-rich samples from these two localities were dated, using the 40Ar/39Ar step-heating method with a CO2 laser probe. The ages obtained are within a range of c. 77 Myr to c. 2 Myr. Cryptomelane formation took place at c. 76.4 Ma, c. 59.6 Ma, c. 45 Ma, c. 35 Ma, c. 23.8 Ma, c. 15.4 Ma, and c. 13.3 Ma at Kasekelesa, and it occurred at c. 35 Ma, c. 22.4 Ma, c. 15 Ma, c. 5.5–7.2 Ma, c. 3.6 Ma, and c. 2.1–2.3 Ma at Mwene-Ditu. The Campanian age (c. 76.4 Ma) recorded at Kasekelesa is the oldest 40Ar/39Ar age that has up to now been recorded for Mn ores from Africa. It documents the formation of oxidized ore along a Campanian or older erosion surface, which could be part of the ‘African Erosion Surface’. The complete age record suggests that continent-wide tectonics accounts for most of the recognized supergene ore formation episodes, controlled by vertical lithospheric movements that are ultimately responsible for alternating stages of landscape stability and erosion. Tectonics is thus regarded as the first-order control for secondary ore formation in Central Africa, over the last 80 Myr. Climate is a second-order control, because sufficient water supply is needed for supergene enrichment, whereby climatic conditions are recognized to have been favourable during some relatively cold Late Mesozoic and Paleogene periods, as well as during some humid and warm Neogene stages. © 2020","40Ar/39Ar; African Erosion Surface; Continental denudation; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Kasekelesa; Katanga; Manganese; Mwene-Ditu","Campanian; geodynamics; host rock; manganese deposit; ore deposit; Pleistocene; supergene process; tectonics; weathering; Democratic Republic Congo; East African Lakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081653250

This has led to the introduction of several binding and non-binding agreements, such as the Renewable Energy Directive to increase the renewable content of fuel for transportation, the carbon dioxide emissions standards to limit the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles and the Euro Standards to limit the amount of emissions harmful to human health in the exhaust. However, the influence of the fuel composition on hazardous exhaust emissions is a complex, and often contradictory, relationship between factors such as the fuel properties, combustion characteristics and engine load. Therefore policy implemented to improve one aspect, such as a reduction in carbon dioxide, can have a detrimental effect on another such as increased NOx emissions. This paper analyses, in a holistic manner, the impact on carbon dioxide and harmful emissions from transient compression ignition engines when increasing the renewable content of the fuel to meet the renewable energy targets. The analysis is based on a model developed from a rigorous Design of Experiment methodology used to determine the complex relationship between renewable fuel content and exhaust emissions (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides). Unlike other studies, the results were collected from a transient engine cycle, the World Harmonised Light vehicle Test Procedure, rather than steady state conditions, thus the results are more applicable to the real world. The results generally show that as the amount of ethanol is increased then the NOx and CO emissions decrease compared to current pump diesel. Increasing the biodiesel content generally increases the CO and CO2 emissions from the engine. For practical reasons a ternary blend is required to minimise the diesel engine emissions whilst meeting the UK's future renewable content target. A blend of B2.4E10 was found to be the optimum compromise between renewable content and engine emissions. However, for this to be achieved the UK will have to invest in second and third generation ethanol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; CO2; Emissions; Ethanol; NOx","Air quality; Binding energy; Biodiesel; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Design of experiments; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Testing; Vehicles; Carbon dioxide emissions; Combustion characteristics; Complex relationships; Compression ignition engine; Diesel engine emissions; Holistic evaluations; Renewable strategies; Steady-state condition; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081649061

We find that the probability of observing a wind farm in a municipality is higher, once controlled for geographical and political factors, if there is a mafia family embedded, identifying a causal link from mafia presence to wind investment. Moreover, the involvement of mafia groups adapted to the changing regime in incentives around 2012, moving from large investments, direct involvement or the provision of intermediation services to small scale investments in the municipalities where the families are rooted. These results are consistent with the episodes unveiled in judicial inquiries in Sicily. We compare these results with the case of Apulia, where large wind investments have been supported by an environmentally committed regional government and where the judges did not find evidence of a massive penetration of the local organized crime in the wind business. We show that the location of wind farms in this region depends on favourable geographical conditions but is not correlated with the presence of organized crime, consistently with the negative evidence from judicial inquiries. © 2020, Società Italiana degli Economisti (Italian Economic Association).","Infiltration in legal businesses; Mafia; Sicily; Wind farms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081610708

The purpose of this study was to explore how faculty teach social justice in theory courses in Baccalaureate programs. This qualitative study utilized constructivist grounded theory methods to examine processes informing participants' teaching. Participants utilize four overarching approaches: fostering engaging classroom climates, utilizing various naming strategies, framing diversity and culture as social justice, and role modeling a critical stance. They deploy specific strategies, varying largely by race, educational background, and nursing specialty. A background in social sciences supports pedagogy that interrogates health inequities rather than merely raising awareness about disparities. Findings also reveal that faculty of color navigate institutional structures predicated upon colorblind racism and problematic views of culture, which many white faculty teaching non-Community Health Nursing courses described doing. To enact social justice and be answerable to our communities, concerted anti-oppression efforts are needed across education, research, practice, and policy. This includes sustained commitment to address colonialism and whiteness in every institution that defines, promotes, and claims to advance nursing so that we can fulfill our responsibility to address unjust systems and structures to serve our communities. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","colonialism; hidden curriculum; nursing education; pedagogy; professionalism; social justice; whiteness","female; human; male; middle aged; nursing education; prevention and control; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; racism; social justice; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Faculty, Nursing; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Racism; Social Justice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081580519

Five fertilizing treatments, including no N fertilizer, N surface broadcasting, and N deep placement at the soil depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm were applied in the paddy field. The composition of main microbial groups were determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The absolute real-time quantitative PCR was applied to determine the abundance of the methanogenic and methanotrophic populations with mcrA, pmoA, mmoX, and mxaF as the functional gene markers. Compared with N surface broadcasting, the deep placement of N (i) significantly increased the microbial biomass carbon (C) and dissolved organic C by 7–90% and 6–75%, respectively; (ii) significantly enhanced the amount of the total PLFAs by 12–70% and the bacterial PLFAs by 15–82%; (iii) significantly mitigated the CH4 emissions by 6–39%; and (iv) significantly enhanced the abundance of the methanogenic and methanotrophic populations by 16–55% and 13–210%, respectively. The percent changes varied over a wide range due to different N placement depths as well as the seasonal variations. Moreover, structural equation modeling revealed that N deep placement directly or indirectly affected the CH4-related microbial communities through the increased labile soil organic C fractions by activating plant growth and soil microbial abundance, thereby mitigating the CH4 emissions in no-tillage paddy soil. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Methane emissions; Methanogen; Methanotroph; Nitrogen fertilizer deep placement; Organic C fraction","fatty acid; fertilizer application; methane; methanogenesis; methanotrophy; microbial community; phospholipid; soil carbon; soil emission; soil nitrogen; zero tillage; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081539916

PVP 2.0 realizes three functionalities: (i) a real-time system efficiency breakdown figure, (ii) an estimate of national solar electricity production, and (iii) an economic analysis for small-scale to large scale PV systems. The unique and novel aspects of this website are the dynamically updated climate database, the rainfall-dependent soiling loss calculation, and the orientation-dependent inverter sizing factor. This paper also justifies the PVP 2.0 capabilities in large scale studies. First, the PVP 2.0 modeling approach was validated by yield comparison with 26 real PV systems distributed over the Netherlands. The validation resulted in −11% to +5.5% deviation from measured data. Then, a back-end sensitivity study found that a rain-free summer in the Netherlands results in an AC energy loss of 3.4% in that period, while a change in wind speed or ambient temperature could lead to losses around 2–4.5 GWh/year (0.58%–1.16%) on province scale. The core of the approach presented in this paper can be used to develop similar websites for other countries of interest with adapted add-ons depending on the target climate condition. Such study tools could eventually provide more quantitative insights about the impact of climate change (by applying probable scenarios) on the renewable energy production of the World. © 2019","Meteorological data; National solar electricity production; Netherlands; Online performance modeling; Photovoltaic system; Real-time solar energy conversion","Climate change; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Energy dissipation; Interactive computer systems; Large scale systems; Photovoltaic cells; Rain; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Websites; Wind; Meteorological data; Netherlands; On-line performance; Photovoltaic systems; Real time; Solar electricity; Real time systems; alternative energy; climate change; economic analysis; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; wind velocity; World Wide Web; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081341701

Using a systematic evaluation of academic publications in the field, we argue that the current moment of research has been shaped by two recent waves of thought. The first, a wave of urban optimism, which started in 2011 and peaked in 2013, engaged with urban areas as alternative sites for governance in the face of the crumbling international climate regime. The second, a wave of urban pragmatism, which started in 2016, has sought to reimagine urban areas following the integration of the “sub-national” as a meaningful category in the international climate regime after the 2015 Paris Agreement for Climate Action. Four themes dominate the debate on climate change governance in urban areas: why there is climate action, how climate action is delivered, how it is articulated in relation to internationally reaching networks, and what implications it has to understand environmental or climate justice within urban settings. Calls to understand the impacts of climate change policy have fostered research on climate change politics, issues of power and control, conflicts, and the inherently unjust nature of much climate policy. What is largely missing from the current scholarship is a sober assessment of the mundane aspects of climate change governance on the ground and a concern with what kind of cultural and socio-economic change is taking place, beyond comparative analyses of the effectiveness of climate policies.

To control nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from HDDVs, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems have been widely used since the China IV standards. To investigate the impacts of aftertreatment technologies and driving conditions on real-world emissions of reactive nitrogen compounds, a portable emissions measurement system was employed to test eighteen heavy-duty diesel trucks in China. The results showed that the China IV and China V HDDVs with appropriate SCR functionality could reduce NOX emissions by 36% and 53%, respectively, compared to the China III results, although their real-world emissions were still higher than the corresponding emission limits for regulatory engine tests. For these HDDVs, five samples were tested with NH3 emissions, ranging from 1.67 ppm to 51.49 ppm. The NH3 emission rates tended to significantly increase under high-speed driving conditions. The results indicate that the current SCR technology may have certain risks in exceeding the future China VI NH3 limit. However, five China IV/V HDDVs were found to have SCR temperature sensors that were intentionally tampered with, resulting in comparable or even higher NOX emissions and zero NH3 emissions. Increased NO2 emissions due to the adoption of diesel oxidation catalysts and diesel particulate filters were also found from our experiments. This study highlights the importance of enhancing in-use compliance requirements and eliminating aftertreatment tampering for China IV and China V HDDVs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel; NH3; NOX; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Selective catalytic reduction (SCR); Vehicle emissions","Air pollution control equipment; Air quality; Ammonia; Automobile testing; Automobiles; Diesel engines; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Trucks; After-treatment technology; Diesel; Diesel particulate filters; Heavy duty diesel vehicles; Portable emissions measurement systems; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Selective catalytic reduction systems; Vehicle emission; Selective catalytic reduction; reactive nitrogen species; nitrogen derivative; ammonia; compliance; diesel engine; emission control; measurement method; nitric oxide; traffic emission; trucking; altitude; Article; catalysis; China; diesel engine; environmental management; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; flame ionization detection; humidity; oxidation; particulate matter; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; air pollutant; city; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; China; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Motor Vehicles; Nitrogen Compounds; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081306154

Study of U1512 samples could provide both an important high-latitude, southern hemisphere perspective on climatic evolution during the peak and demise of the Cretaceous hothouse and an offshore record of the sedimentation history in the basin during the Late Cretaceous portion of the Gondwanan breakup. The Upper Cretaceous sequence at Site U1512 is notable for its lithologic uniformity. Burrow-mottled to massive claystone and silty claystone make up the majority of the almost 700 m section, while rare (n = 28) isolated, 2 to 21 cm thick medium to fine sandstone beds are a minor lithology. Macrofossils present include common inoceramids and rare occurrences of other bivalves and ammonites. Microfossils include common occurrences of calcareous nannofossils, agglutinated and calcareous benthic foraminifera, radiolaria and organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts as well as rare, small, surface dwelling planktonic foraminifera. Carbonate (<7%) and organic carbon (<1.5%) contents are low. Despite the lithologic uniformity, rhythmic alternations in the intensity of magnetic susceptibility and natural gamma radiation are well-resolved in much of the recovered section and continue through minor coring gaps (as documented by downhole logs). Data from Site U1512 provide new perspectives on the deep-water frontier region between Antarctica and Australia. © 2020 International Association for Gondwana Research","Australo-Antarctic rifting; Cretaceous greenhouse climate; Cretaceous paleoceanography; Gondwana breakup; Great Australian Bight","basin evolution; Cretaceous; deep water; fault zone; lithology; nanofossil; paleoceanography; sedimentary sequence; stratigraphy; Turonian; Antarctica; Australia; Great Australian Bight; Indian Ocean",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081283533

This study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors of PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing during the 2013–2018 period, and further analyzed the impacts of environmental protection policies implemented in recent years. Notably, this study employed various statistical methods, i.e., ordinary Kriging interpolation, spatial autocorrelation analysis, time-series analysis and the Bonferroni test, to evaluate the regional and seasonal differences of PM2.5 concentrations based on long-term monitoring data. The results illustrated that PM2.5 concentrations decreased on a yearly basis, demonstrating that air pollution control policies have achieved initial success. Furthermore, PM2.5 concentrations were higher in the winter and in the southern regions. Diurnal variation presented a bimodal distribution, which varied slightly with the season. Relative humidity and wind speed were the principal meteorological factors affecting the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations, while precipitation had essentially no effect. A high positive correlation between PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, and CO) indirectly reflected the contribution of automobile exhaust and coal-fired emissions. Generally, PM2.5 concentrations demonstrated strong spatiotemporal variations, and meteorological factors and pollutant emissions played an important role in this. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ambient air pollutants; Meteorological factors; Monitoring data","Air pollution; Fog; Interpolation; Monitoring; Time series analysis; Wind; Ambient air; Environmental concerns; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Long-term monitoring datum; Meteorological factors; Positive correlations; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatio-temporal variation; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; coal; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; rain; sulfur dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; humidity; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution monitoring; seasonal variation; spatial variation; wind velocity; air analysis; air monitoring; air pollution; Article; China; circadian rhythm; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental policy; environmental protection; exhaust gas; fine particulate matter; humidity; material state; meteorology; particle size; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; wind speed; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; season; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081272664

The utilization of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomenon is an attractive strategy for developing visible-light photocatalysts.

We studied peatlands in the central part of European Russia, which initially was a swamp forest ecosystem with fairly homogeneous properties of woody peat. Different sites in the area were subsequently under different types of land use. We studied 4 sites in order of increasing management intensity: near-pristine swamp forest, a reforested site after 50 years of intensive cultivation and 2 agricultural sites with 50- and 100-year histories of agricultural use. We examined the dynamics of microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N and mineral nitrogen during the growing season (May-November). We conclude that land use type can affect the seasonal dynamics of available and microbial nitrogen by changing the vegetation cover. For peatlands covered with natural vegetation, an important feature of the seasonal dynamics of N is microbial immobilization and storage during winter. High activity of β-1,4-glucosidase and low activity of peroxidase indicate that microorganisms consume mainly nitrogen and carbon from fresh plant litter, rather than carbon and nitrogen conserved in peat. Long-term peatland agricultural use has led to significant changes in the dynamics of available and microbial nitrogen and carbon during the growing season, and land management has greatly modified the limitations of the activity of microorganisms from the availability of nitrogen (in the forest) to the availability of carbon (in arable peatland). The changes in peatlands occurred in the first years or decades of their exploitation because we did not find significant differences in any of the indicators between the arable lands used for 50 and >100 years. We found that natural reforestation for 50 years has not yet fully restored microbial activity; however, for some parameters, this site has characteristics close to those of near-pristine swamp forest. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cultivation on peatlands; Intensity of land management; Microbial carbon and nitrogen; Reforestation; Soil mineral nitrogen","enzyme activity; forest ecosystem; growing season; immobilization; microbial activity; peatland; reforestation; soil microorganism; swamp forest; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081244079

However, the temporal dynamic of wet BC deposition in China during the past two decades remain unclear. Here, we used long-term monitoring and literature data since 2000 to assess the temporal dynamics (seasonal and inter-annual variation), spatial patterns, main influencing factors, source apportionment, and capacity to neutralize the acidity of wet BC depositions at site, regional, and national scales. The results showed that total wet deposition of BCs was, on average, 2.12 keq ha−1 yr−1, where Ca2+ accounted for 65.57% of the total deposition, followed by Na+ (13.21%), Mg2+ (13.68%), and K+ (7.55%). Qinghai-Tibet had significantly lower BC deposition fluxes than northern, southern, and central China, as well as Inner Mongolia. Exchangeable BCs in soil, PM10 in the atmosphere, energy consumption, and cement production are significantly related to wet BC deposition, which account for 79.17% of the variation in the spatial deposition of BC. Influenced by the strategies to control acid rain and particulate matter in China, interannual variations showed a stabilization trend after a continuous decline from 2000 to 2017, which can be explained by inter-annual changes in PM10, energy consumption and cement production. Statistical methods confirmed that 45.95% of wet BC deposition was derived from crustal contributions, 27.78% from sea salt sources, and 26.27% from anthropogenic sources. Furthermore, we found that wet deposition of BCs neutralized 84.85% of the acidity due to NO3− and SO42− depositions. Under the emissions reduction strategy, there has been a decrease in the deposition of BC. However, SO42− and NO3− depositions decreased faster than BC deposition, which buffered a higher proportion of acidic depositions. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of wet BC deposition in China, an evaluation of their capacity to neutralize acidity, and important parameters for acidification models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acid deposition; Influencing factors neutralization; Inter-annual variation; Seasonal dynamics; Spatial patterns","Acid rain; Acidification; Emission control; Energy utilization; Positive ions; Soil cement; Acid deposition; Influencing factors neutralization; Interannual variation; Seasonal dynamics; Spatial patterns; Deposition; calcium; magnesium; potassium; sodium; cation; acid deposition; acidification; annual variation; black carbon; cation; neutralization; seasonal variation; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; wet deposition; acid rain; Article; atmosphere; China; ecosystem; energy consumption; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; exhaust gas; geography; particulate matter; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; wet deposition; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; Tibet; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Air Pollutants; Cations; China; Environmental Monitoring; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081222837

However, determining the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change is a challenge due to the complex nature of the problem. We propose a climate-crop modelling approach illustrated by using the APSIM crop model forced with daily climate data as a case study in eastern Australia to assess the biophysical vulnerability of wheat to future climate change. This impact assessment is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's definition of vulnerability as a derivative of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We selected one Global Climate Model (GCM) CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 representing dry conditions under high emission scenarios to explore the feasibility of proposed methodology. Our results show that, historically, the most vulnerable areas were the western parts of the wheat belt, accounting for 18% of the total wheat-growing area. However, areas of very high vulnerability would expand to central and eastern parts of the wheat belt into the future, accounting for 41% of the study area in the 2040s and 62% in the 2080s. With increased exposure to dry climate, adjusting sowing time and cultivar shift consistently improved wheat yield but were insufficient to decrease wheat vulnerability. We found the key driver for increased vulnerability was increased exposure to dry climate. We expect this study will help growers, farm advisors and state policymakers to adopt relevant adaptation strategies and promote efficient farming practices such as breeding drought-tolerant crop cultivars in highly vulnerable western areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Agricultural vulnerability; APSIM; Crop modelling; Wheat yield","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Plants (botany); Adaptation strategies; Adaptive capacity; Agricultural productions; Agricultural vulnerability; APSIM; Global climate model; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Wheat yield; Climate change; agricultural modeling; agricultural production; climate change; climate modeling; environmental impact assessment; feasibility study; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; vulnerability; wheat; Australia; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081155704

We relate soil organic and inorganic C mass (t ha−1 to 60 cm depth) with cattle stocking over periods of 7–27 year for 32 paddocks distributed across nine community pastures in the mixed-grass prairie of Saskatchewan, Canada. Initial analysis comparing Akaike information criterion models showed that cattle SR explained a greater proportion of variance in soil C, particularly soil organic C, than rainfall. Soil organic C mass increased with cattle SR (R2 =.293; p =.001), even when the latter was normalized to account for differences in vegetation composition and growing conditions among pastures. Normalized SR varied from 0.49 to 2.30 times recommended levels, over which SOC increased from 24.7 to 57.4 t ha−1. Increases in soil organic C under greater stocking coincided with increased abundance of introduced vegetation, particularly the rhizomatous grass Poa pratensis. Inorganic soil C accounted for 34.6% of total soil C, being particularly large below 30 cm soil depth, but did not vary with stocking rate. These findings indicate that both organic and inorganic C are important pools of C in northern temperate grassland soils, with soil organic C positively associated with long-term cattle SR. Further studies are recommended to understand more fully the mechanisms regulating grazing impacts on soil C mass in northern temperate grasslands. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science","carbon storage; cattle stocking rate; introduced vegetation; native grassland; organic carbon; soil carbonate","cattle; grassland soil; grazing; long-term change; pasture; soil carbon; soil organic matter; temperate environment; Canada; Saskatchewan; Bos; Poa pratensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081024537

Today, a major issue is the presence of impurities such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in CO2 containing gases, as they are known to inhibit acetogenesis in CO2-based fermentations. However, exact values of toxicity and inhibition are not well-defined. To tackle this uncertainty, a series of toxicity experiments were conducted, with a mixed homoacetogenic culture, total dissolved sulfide concentrations ([TDS]) varied between 0 and 5 mM and pH between 5 and 7. The extent of inhibition was evaluated based on acetate production rates and microbial growth. Maximum acetate production rates of 0.12, 0.09 and 0.04 mM h-1 were achieved in the controls without sulfide at pH 7, pH 6 and pH 5. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 qAc) was 0.86, 1.16 and 1.36 mM [TDS] for pH 7, pH 6 and pH 5. At [TDS] above 3.33 mM, acetate production and microbial growth were completely inhibited at all pHs. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed major community composition transitions that could be attributed to both pH and [TDS]. Based on the observed toxicity levels, treatment approaches for incoming industrial CO2 streams can be determined. © 2020 The Authors.

To verify policy interventions in reducing PM2.5 levels in Korea, the results were compared with previously published results from 2003 to 2007 at the same study site. A total of 215 PM2.5 samples were collected and analyzed for 24 species, i.e., carbonaceous species (OCEC), ionic species (NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+), and 19 element species in this study. The average PM2.5 mass concentration during the sampling period was 42.6±23.3 μg m−3. The seasonal average mass concentration of PM2.5 was the highest during winter (49.9±20.6 μg m−3), followed by spring (45.2±25.3 μg m−3), fall (34.4±19.3 μg m−3), and summer (28.4±12.5 μg m−3). Nine sources were identified and quantified using the PMF model: secondary nitrate (19.0%), secondary sulfate (20.2%), mobile (23.3%), biomass burning (12.1%), soil (8.3%), roadway emissions (3.1%), aged sea salt (1.0%), coal combustion (4.1%), and oil combustion (9.0%). The PM2.5 levels and chemical constituents during this study were lower than those during the previous study from 2003 to 2007. Particularly, concentrations of mobile related chemicals (OC, EC, and nitrate) and mobile source contributions consistently decreased from 2003 to 2015, indicating that the mobile emission reduction policy is improving PM2.5 levels in the region. The comparison between the two periods allows trends in chemical constituents and the sources of PM2.5 in Seoul to be understood. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical constituent; Long-range transport; PM2.5; Positive matrix factorization","Chemical analysis; Emission control; Factorization; Matrix algebra; Nitrates; Sulfur compounds; Carbonaceous species; Chemical constituents; Emission reduction policies; Long range transport; PM2.5; Policy intervention; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source contributions; Coal combustion; ammonium nitrate; ammonium sulfate; coal; diesel fuel; gasoline; nitrate; oil; sodium chloride; sulfate; coal; nitric acid derivative; chemical composition; chemical compound; coal combustion; long range transport; long-term change; particulate matter; pollutant source; seasonal variation; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; Article; biomass; chemical composition; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); exhaust gas; falling; highway; humidity; limit of detection; particulate matter; seasonal variation; soil; South Korea; spring; summer; time series analysis; trend study; winter; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; South Korea; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Air Pollutants; Biomass; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrates; Particulate Matter; Republic of Korea; Seasons; Seoul; Soil; Sulfates; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080972874

The goals were to quantify the respective contributions of local emissions and regional transport outside Thailand to EC pollution in Thailand, and to identify the most effective emission control strategy for decreasing EC pollution. The simulated EC concentrations in Chiang Mai, Bangkok, and Phuket were comparable with the observation data. The correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed EC concentrations was 0.84, providing a good basis for evaluating EC sources in Thailand. The simulated mean EC concentration over the whole country was the highest (1.38 μg m−3) in spring, and the lowest (0.51 μg m−3) in summer. We conducted several sensitivity simulations to evaluate EC sources. Local emissions (including anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions) and regional transport outside Thailand contributed 81.2% and 18.8% to the annual mean EC concentrations, respectively, indicating that local sources played the dominant role for EC pollution in Thailand. Among the local sources, anthropogenic emissions (including the industry, power plant, residential, and transportation sectors) and biomass burning contributed 75.1% and 6.1% to the annual mean EC concentrations, respectively. As the anthropogenic emissions dominated the EC pollution, we performed four sensitivity simulations by reducing 30% of the emissions from each of the industry, power plant, residential, and transportation sectors in Thailand. The results indicated that controlling transportation emissions in Thailand was the most effective way in reducing the EC pollution. The 30% reduction of transportation emissions decreased the annual mean EC concentrations by 12.1%. In contrast, 30% reductions of the residential, industry, and power plant emissions caused 8.4%, 6.4%, and 4.0% decreases in the annual mean EC concentrations, respectively. The model results could potentially provide useful information for air pollution control strategies in Thailand. © 2020 Elsevier LtdMain finding: Anthropogenic emissions in Thailand, biomass burning in Thailand, and regional transport outside Thailand contribute 75.1%, 6.1%, and 18.8% of the annual-mean EC concentrations in Thailand.

In May 2019 a grassroots coalition comprising a range of civil society groups—scientists, labour unions, Indigenous peoples, and youth—launched the Pact for a Green New Deal (PGND) in Canada, with more than 150 town hall meetings across the country. Participants called for 100% renewable energy, phase out of the oil sands, a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030, and the creation of 1 million new green jobs and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples [1]. A significant reorientation to the scale and direction of government expenditure, as happened in the American New Deal of the 1930s, can spur technical innovation but can also exacerbate inequalities. A Canadian green transition is significant globally given its high energy production, exports, and internal use. In this perspective piece we examine the transformative potential of a Canadian PGND by focusing on the social and political characteristics of energy infrastructure: the potential for 100% renewable energy, transitions for oil sands, energy democracy, Indigenous energy leadership, gender equity, and energy poverty. The actor coalitions emerging from these then forge specific energy transition pathways, whether just and inclusive, or not. The Canadian case highlights the complexities and opportunities that accompany countries with large geographies, fraught geo-political histories, strong federalism, inequalities of access to clean affordable energy, and an abundance of renewable energy. © 2020 The Authors",,,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080099374

Here, we performed 20-s resolution observations of O3 precursors and meteorological factors to train a random forest model capable of accurately predicting O3 concentrations. Our model performed well with an average validated R2 of 0.997. Unlike in typical linear model frameworks, variable dependencies are not clearly modelled by random forest model. Thus, we conducted additional studies to provide insight into the photochemical and atmospheric dynamic processes driving variations in O3 concentrations. At nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations of 10–20 ppb, all the other O3 precursors were in states that increased the production of O3. Over a short timescale, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can almost track each high-frequency variation in O3. Meteorological factors play a more important role than O3 precursors do in predicting O3 concentrations at a high temporal resolution; however, individual meteorological factors are not sufficient to track every high-frequency change in O3. Nevertheless, the sharp variations in O3 related to flow dynamics are often accompanied by steep temperature changes.

In order to detect the different effects of influencing factors on air quality index (AQI) between lower-AQI and higher-AQI cities, this study applies a spatial quantile regression model (SQRM) to investigate heterogeneity of influential factors on AQI, while accounting for spatial autocorrelation of AQI. The results show that heterogeneity effects of windspeed, terrain slope, urbanization sprawl and spatial autocorrelation on AQI are large across the entire AQI spectrum, while heterogeneity effects of precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, terrain fluctuation and urbanization intensity on AQI are not obvious. The spatial positive autocorrelation of AQI in higher-AQI cities is greater than that in lower-AQI cities. Compared with higher-AQI cities, the negative impact of terrain slope on AQI is lager in lower-AQI cities. One unit increase in wind speed contributes AQI to decrease 9.31 to 5.64 then to 5.39 for lower, medium and higher-AQI cities. One unit increase in urbanization sprawl would lead AQI increase 25.6 to 15.6 then to 10.5 for lower, medium and higher-AQI cities. The heterogeneity analysis of meteorological, topographic and socioeconomic factors effects on air quality are of guiding significance for realizing the differentiation of policy measures for air pollution prevention and control. © 2020 Elsevier LtdThis paper detects the heterogeneity of influencing factors on AQI between lower-AQI and higher-AQI cities in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality index; Chinese cities; Heterogeneity analysis; Spatial quantile regression model","Air pollution control; Air quality; Autocorrelation; Correlation detectors; Factor analysis; Landforms; Regression analysis; Spatial variables measurement; Wind; Air pollution prevention; Air quality indices; Chinese cities; Guiding significances; Heterogeneity analysis; Quantile regression; Socio-economic factor; Spatial autocorrelations; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; heterogeneity; numerical model; pollution exposure; public health; regression analysis; spatial analysis; urbanization; air pollution; air quality; article; autocorrelation; city; humidity; precipitation; socioeconomics; urbanization; wind speed; air pollutant; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; regression analysis; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Regression Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080052453

Here, we characterized the airborne bacterial community structure and concentration, during typical pollution episodes that occurred during the winter heating season of 2017–2018 in Jinan and Weihai. During this heating season, five and four heavy pollution episodes were observed in Jinan and Weihai, respectively. Compared with December and January, pollution episodes in March were significantly affected by sand dust events. Higher Bacillales were identified in the March samples from Jinan, indicating that sand dust influences bacterial communities. During similar pollution episodes, air pollution in the coastal city of Weihai was lower than the inland city of Jinan. The predominant bacteria included Staphylococcus, Cyanobacteria, Lactobacillus, Deinococcus, Enbydrobacter, Ralstonia, Bacillus, Comamonas, and Sphingomonas. These predominant bacteria are mainly from Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes phyla. Bacterial concentration showed significant variation with increased airborne pollutants. The highest concentration appeared during moderate pollution (up to 106 cells/m3), whereas bacterial concentration decreased during heavy and severe pollution (105 cells/m3), which may be related to toxic effects of high pollutant concentrations during heavy or severe pollution. Community structure variation indicated that Cyanobacterial genera were dominant in clean or slight pollution. With increased PM2.5, Staphylococcus increased and became the most abundant bacteria in moderate pollution (up to 40%). During heavy or severe pollution, bacteria that are adaptable to harsh or extreme environments predominate, such as Deinococcus and Bacillus. In the assessment of health risks from air pollution, the bioaerosols risks must consider. Additionally, although most microbial genera are similar between the two cities, there are important differences associated with pollution level. During air pollution regulation in different regions with varied geographical and climatic conditions, bioaerosol pollution difference is an unignored factor. © 2020 Elsevier LtdHighest bacterial concentration detected in moderate pollution.

Optical constants and optical properties of the TiO2 - Al2O3 multilayer stack, before and after thermal treatment at 450 °C, were studied via spectroscopy ellipsometry and UV – Vis measurements in the spectral range from 200 to 1100 nm. Also, similar samples were studied by means of TEM, SEM and AFM at room temperature in order to obtain information about the morphological properties. From optical studies, we found absorption due to carbon impurities related with organometallic precursor used in ALD process; to reduce carbon related absorption, samples were submitted to an annealing process at 450 °C under air atmosphere. A reject zone or “stopband region” between 381 and 451 nm, with maximum reflection around of 99.9%, cut-off points at 371 and 455 nm after thermal treatment.

To understand the size distributions of nitrated phenols in the polluted coastal region and the factors influencing these distributions, size-resolved particulate matters were collected from a rural site in the coastal city of Qingdao, China, in January 2019, and analyzed for the presence of 11 nitrated phenols. The average concentrations of total nitrated phenols in fine- and coarse-mode particles were 123.6 and 37.2 ng m−3, respectively. 4-Nitrophenol was found to be the dominant nitrated phenol, followed by 3-methyl-6-nitrocatechol, 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol, and 4-nitrocatechol. On average, maximum concentrations of nitrated phenols were in condensation-mode particles, whereas a minor concentration peak of nitro-salicylic acids was present in droplet-mode particles. In addition, a minor concentration peak of 4-methyl-2,6-dinitrophenol was noticed in coarse-mode particles. Comparisons of the size distributions under different situations confirmed that both primary emissions and secondary formation had significant effects on the abundances and particle-sizes of nitrated phenols. Coal combustion in residential villages and firework burning during a festival led to a sharp increase of nitrated phenols in condensation-mode particles, whereas dust promoted their heterogeneous formation in coarse-mode particles, and high humidity in the coastal area facilitated their aqueous formation in droplet-mode particles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aqueous formation; Coal combustion; Firework; Nitrated phenols; Secondary formation; Size distribution","Coal dust; Coastal zones; Condensation; Drops; Explosives; Rural areas; Salicylic acid; Size distribution; 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol; Aqueous formation; Average concentration; Firework; Heterogeneous formation; Maximum concentrations; Nitrated phenols; Secondary formation; Coal combustion; 2,4 dinitrophenol; 3 methyl 6 nitrocatechol; 3 nitro salicylic acid; 4 methyl 2,6 dinitrophenol; 4 methyl 5 nitrocatechol; 4 nitrocatechol; 4 nitrophenol; 5 nitrosalicylic acid; coal; nitrogen oxide; phenol derivative; sulfur dioxide; unclassified drug; carbon; catechol derivative; nitric acid derivative; nitro derivative; nitrocatechol; phenol derivative; aqueous solution; coal combustion; concentration (composition); dust; particulate matter; phenol; pollutant source; public health; rural area; size distribution; air quality; Article; atmosphere; China; combustion; humidity; ion monitoring; maximum concentration; particle size; particulate matter; wind speed; winter; aerosol; air pollutant; city; dust; environmental monitoring; human; season; China; Qingdao; Shandong; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Catechols; Cities; Coal; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Nitrates; Nitro Compounds; Nitrogen Oxides; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Phenols; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079844649

However, a large number of CBM wells face low gas production during development. High water production in many CBM wells is one of the causes of low gas production. Previous studies analyzed the causes of high water production in CBM wells, but few have conducted a comprehensive analysis of one specific well with high water production to determine the causes. Taking the Shizhuangnan block in the southern Qinshui Basin as an example, this paper summarizes the regional water production regimes and influencing factors on high water production by using limited production, logging and fracture data. Based on a variety of methods and considering the development of natural fractures in the coal roof, vertical variation of sand content in the coal-bearing strata, hydraulic fracturing process and orientation of the main fracture, the key factors causing high water production of five CBM wells were analyzed in detail. The results show a strong structural influence, as a catchment area formed in the depression zone in the northern section of the block, increasing the risk of high water production. The strata generally exhibits high permeability in the fault-influenced area and thus the coal seam easily communicates with the overlying aquifer. In the weakly structural influenced area, there are two causes of high water production in CBM wells. High pressure (>25 MPa) during hydraulic fracturing and the original natural high-angle fractures result in the formation of large cracks, which cause the coal seam to communicate with overlying water-bearing sandstone layers. This generally is the reason for the wells where the coal seam is far from the overlying water-bearing sandstone layer. The other cause is that the coal seam is close to the water-bearing sandstone layer (<2m) and the overlying strata itself has good permeability. Also, the water in the coal seam at a higher elevation is more likely to flow to the coal seam at a lower elevation. The fracturing operation curves were used to determine the orientation of the main fracture and predict fracture expansion. Secondary fracturing caused by high pressure during the fracturing operation dramatically increases the risk of fractures penetrating through the coal roof and floor. However, continuous low pressure during fracturing may indicate that the coal roof and floor have poor sealing capability and cannot isolate the aquifers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coal roof/floor; Coalbed methane (CBM); Hydraulic fracturing; Production characteristic; Qinshui basin; Rescaled range (R/S) analysis method","Aquifers; Catchments; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Firedamp; Floors; Fracture; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrogeology; Methane; Roofs; Sandstone; Comprehensive analysis; Fracturing operations; Hydraulic fracturing process; Large-scale development; Production characteristics; Qinshui basin; Rescaled range analysis; Southern qinshui basins; Natural gas wells; coal seam; coalbed methane; fracture orientation; gas well; hydraulic fracturing; sand; statistical analysis; water flow; China; Qinshui Basin; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079839473

Case summary: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in cigarette smoke are well-known inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. CYP1A2 induction by cigarette smoking increases metabolic clearance of substrates of this enzyme; smoking cessation results in a decrease in CYP1A2 activity, which causes an increase in serum substrate levels.

In line with this, an increasing number of cities globally have launched low carbon practices in recent years and gained various types of experience. However, it appears that existing studies do not present methods of how to use these valuable LCC experience in solving new problems. This study therefore introduces an experience mining approach to assist decision-makers in reusing previous experience when tailoring LCC development strategies. The mining approach consists of three processes, namely, collecting historical cases which have been experiencing LCC, establishing LCC experience base, and mining similar experience cases. This study innovates the existing experience mining approach by introducing a two-step mining process with considering the perspective of problem-based urban characteristics (PBUCs) and the perspective of solution-based urban characteristics (SBUCs). The application of the introduced mining approach has been demonstrated by a case study, where Shenyang's energy structure is adopted as the target problem. The new experience mining approach provides a valuable reference for decision-makers to retrieve similar cases for improving LCC development with the consideration of city characteristics. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","city characteristics; experience mining; low carbon city; similarity measure; sustainable development","data mining; decision making; energy use; environmental economics; sustainable development; urban development; China; Liaoning; Shenyang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079723929

While the international community has committed to ‘minimize and address’ ocean acidification as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, it is unclear how this is to be fulfilled, especially as there are no international agreements explicitly designed to tackle this issue. Ocean acidification is of relevance to the work of several global agreements and makes achieving their goals more difficult. Being largely sectoral, these agreements are restricted in their ability to address ocean acidification holistically, often unable to both minimize and address the issue. This has resulted in a very limited response to ocean acidification that is fragmented across a number of regimes. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has been identified as an agreement that could be used to regulate carbon dioxide emissions and thus mitigate ocean acidification. However, this article argues that a far more pivotal role can be played by UNCLOS, through its creation of a governing framework for ocean acidification. UNCLOS is the one Convention with a mandate broad enough to address ocean acidification in a direct, holistic manner. UNCLOS places a duty on States to both minimize and address ocean acidification through its various provisions that pertain to the protection and preservation of the marine environment and the conservation of marine living resources. The Convention establishes the framework through which ocean governance is to be implemented, which should be understood as extending to ocean acidification. Thus, UNCLOS is uniquely placed to guide a coherent international response. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; governance approach; Law of the Sea; living resource; marine environment; ocean acidification; Sustainable Development Goal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079720673

This research seeks consensus among expert sustainable architects in the United Kingdom on the relative importance of a range of factors in facilitating a sustainable built environment. It identifies key differentiating factors to provide an original typology of sustainable practice. A Delphi technique was used to engage a variety of geographically separated participant in a managed dialogue to achieve consensus. The technique used novel survey techniques and statistical analysis to create a series of parallel sample groups. Thirty practices took part in the study, forming three distinct groups differentiated by contrasting viewpoints. Individual groups were characterised by varying attitudes towards measurability, nature, user focus, and local issues. However, the research found that carbon reduction through fabric first approaches were universally prioritised by all groups to achieve sustainable design. This highlights the limited scope of sustainable design in the United Kingdom, and a tendency to favour global sustainability concerns over more local and regional challenges. This research has significance for professional organisations and policymakers who can shape practice, both in the United Kingdom and internationally. It also has consequences for architectural education as it emphasises the perceived relative importance of these factors in the creation of the built environment. © 2020 The Authors.

In tropical forests, drought is increasingly frequent and severe, causing widespread declines and altering community dynamics. Yet, little is known about whether foundation tropical trees vary in drought tolerance throughout their distributions, and how intraspecific variation in drought tolerance might contribute to their vulnerability to climate change. We tested for local adaptation in seedling emergence and establishment with a full-factorial reciprocal transplant experiment including 27 populations and 109,350 seeds along a 3,500 mm precipitation gradient for a widespread tropical foundation tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, in Hawaii. To more precisely relate seedling performance to soil moisture, we conducted a complementary greenhouse experiment to test responses of the same focal populations to simulated drought. In the reciprocal transplant experiment, we observed significant variation among populations and sites in germination and seedling establishment rates. Overall, there was a significant link between historical rainfall of populations and their performance under current rainfall at the study sites consistent with local adaptation. In particular, populations from historically wet sites demonstrated lower germination rates in currently dry sites compared to wet field sites, while populations from historically dry sites germinated well across all sites, with particularly high germination in dry sites. In the greenhouse, seedlings from wet populations survived fewer days without water, and succumbed at wetter soil conditions than populations from historically dry sites, corroborating results from the field experiment. Synthesis. While climate change models project the greatest drying trends for historically dry areas in Hawaii, even moderate drying of wet sites could significantly reduce Metrosideros polymorpha recruitment given the sensitivity of seedlings to very slight changes in water regimes. Thus, although M. polymorpha demonstrates high seedling drought tolerance in some populations, providing evidence of resilience at the species-scale, there are nonetheless vulnerable populations that will likely decline under climate change. Our approach demonstrates that even trees with high dispersal abilities can show significant clines in drought tolerance, and suggests that similar intraspecific variation might be an important consideration for other tropical foundational tree species. © 2020 British Ecological Society","climate change; ecotypes; germination; Hawaiian Islands; phenotypic plasticity; seedling establishment; seedling recruitment","climate change; community dynamics; deciduous tree; drought resistance; interspecific variation; local adaptation; seedling emergence; seedling establishment; tropical environment; tropical forest; vulnerability; Hawaii [United States]; United States; Metrosideros polymorpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079439786

However, despite the effectiveness of these coatings in combating the effects of fogging, most of the coating techniques explored to date are typically time-consuming and environment-unfriendly. Bearing this in mind, we demonstrate that the application of dielectric barrier discharges operated at atmospheric pressure proves to be successful in preparing antifogging coatings on glass samples from 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The antifogging performance of the coatings was found to be governed by the [N2O]/[TMCTS] ratio and not by the [N2O] + [TMCTS] sum. Coatings prepared under a [N2O]/[TMCTS] = 30 were superhydrophilic (water contact angles ≈ 5°–10°) due to surface silanol groups and endowed glass samples with a superior antifogging property, as revealed by the ASTM F 659-06 test. In contrast, because of the lesser hydrophilicity (water contact angles ≈ 60°), coatings prepared under a [N2O]/[TMCTS] = 10 did not endow glass samples with antifogging property. Regardless of the deposition conditions, the plasma-deposited coatings displayed crack-free smooth surfaces (Rrms = 2−4 nm). © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key indicator of soil fertility and grassland productivity. Increasing SOC stocks (so-called SOC sequestration) improves soil fertility and contributes to climate change mitigation by binding atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Grasslands constitute about 70% of all agricultural land, but their potential for SOC sequestration is largely unknown. This review paper quantitatively summarizes observation-based studies on the SOC sequestration potential of grasslands in six East African countries (Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda) and seeks to identify knowledge gaps related to SOC sequestration potential in the region. In the studies reviewed, SOC stocks in grasslands range from 3 to 93 Mg C/ha in the upper 0.3 m of the soil profile, while SOC sequestration rate ranges from 0.1 to 3.1 Mg C ha-1 year-1 under different management strategies. Grazing management is reported to have a considerable impact on SOC sequestration rates, and grassland regeneration and protection are recommended as options to stimulate SOC sequestration. However, a very limited number of relevant studies are available (n = 23) and there is a need for fundamental information on SOC sequestration potential in the region. The effectiveness of potential incentive mechanisms, such as payments for environmental services, to foster uptake of SOC-enhancing practices should also be assessed. © 2020 The Authors.

This study presents a simple probabilistic tool for quantifying changes in precipitation and temperature in the wet season over China during either developing or decaying phases of El Niño and La Niña events with a particular focus on the extreme conditions. We first construct the joint dependence structure between each climate variable (e.g. precipitation and temperature) and ENSO using a variety of bivariate copulas. We then examine variations of climate variables related to ENSO conditions through the conditioning sets of bivariate copulas. This approach allows a quantitative estimation of precipitation and temperature anomalies and a delineation of their spatial pattern across the country under individual effects of the developing and decaying phases of ENSO events. Comparison of results produced by the conditional probabilistic approach with those by conventional composite analysis reveals large similarity, highlighting the robustness of the presented approach in examining the response of climate variations to ENSO phases and its potential for a broader application in other regional/global diagnoses. Of particular importance is that this approach offers a way to yield probabilistic predictive information on extreme climate anomalies conditioned by ENSO signals. Despite only ENSO's effect considered in the current study, the presented approach could also be used to detect the effect of other large-scale climate signals on regional or global climate variations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Climate variability; Conditional copula; ENSO; Multivariate","Atmospheric pressure; China; Climate variability; Conditional copula; ENSO; Multivariate; Climatology; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; estimation method; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); quantitative analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079174661

In this work, we assessed the potential of EEN fertilizers to reduce winter losses of nitrous oxide (N2O-N) and ammonia (NH3-N) from a subtropical field experiment on a clayey Inceptisol under no-till in Southern Brazil. The EEN sources used included urea containing N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (UR+NBPT), polymer-coated urea (P-CU) and copper-and-boron-coated urea (CuB-CU) in addition to common urea (UR) and a control treatment without N fertilizer application. N2O-N and NH3-N losses were assessed by using the static chamber method and semi-open static collectors, respectively. Both N2O-N and NH3-N exhibited two large peaks with an intervening period of low soil moisture and air temperature. Although the short-term effect was limited to the first few days after application, UR + NBPT urea decreased soil N2O-N emissions by 38% relative to UR. In contrast, urease inhibitor technology had no effect on NH3-N volatilization. Both coating technologies (CuB-CU and P-CU) were ineffective in reducing N losses via N2O production or NH3 volatilization. The N2O emission factor (% N applied released as N2O) was unaffected by all N sources and amounted to only 0.48% of N applied—roughly one-half the default factor of IPCC Tier 1 (1%). Based on our findings, using NBPT-treated urea in the cold winter season in subtropical agroecosystems provides environmental benefits in the form of reduced soil N2O emissions; however, fertilizer coating technologies provide no agronomic (NH3) or environmental (N2O) advantages. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science","denitrification; inhibitors; N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide NBPT; polymer-coated urea; volatilization","agricultural ecosystem; air temperature; ammonia; clay soil; enzyme activity; fertilizer application; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; soil moisture; subtropical region; volatilization; zero tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079125599

This long-range analysis covers the period 2009–2017 in the Riotinto mining district (Iberian Pyrite Belt, Southwestern Spain), which is a mining district of world-class importance. This mine represents a susceptible anthropogenic emission source of toxic sulphide-associated elements in atmospheric particulate matter, which affects the air quality of the nearby areas. A total of 567 samples of 24 h were collected from 2009 to 2017 in a rural station. The filters were analysed to determine Organic and elemental carbon, mayor and trace elements, and water soluble compounds of PM10. The trends of PM10 and geochemical characterization were studied considering the following periods: mine abandonment (2009–2014) and the mine's state during (2015–2016) and after (2017) implementation of new emission abatement technology at this mine. The results revealed relatively high concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, As, Sb, and Bi during 2015–2016. A reduction of 42–59% was observed after 2017 for the same elements in PM10. Five sources were identified: regional, mining, aged sea salt, combustion + traffic and crustal, using positive matrix factorization model (PMF5). The contribution of the mining factor was higher in the reopening period (4.2 μg m−3, 16%). These results have been confirmed by As speciation analysis, in which the low extraction percentage obtained is related to the origin of the metalloids associated with sulphide ores. The reduction of emissions of atmospheric particulate matter in the mining processes is the main objective in the implementation of measures considering the technological progress for cleaner and sustainable mining. In the case of reopening of historical mines, with low ore grade and greater extraction of ore and rock, a major effort must be made in order to avoid a negative influence on the environment and human health. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Arsenic; Metals; Mine; PM10","Air quality; Arsenic; Atmospheric chemistry; Factorization; Filtration; Metals; Mines; Ore treatment; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Pyrites; Sulfur compounds; Trace elements; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric particulate matter; Chemical characterization; Geochemical characterization; Influence on the environments; Organic and elemental carbon; PM10; Positive matrix factorization models; Extraction; air quality; anthropogenic source; arsenic; mine; particulate matter; trend analysis; Iberian Pyrite Belt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079102867

GaN hexagonal microstructures are fabricated by selective-area metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy using focused ion beam for mask patterning. Low-temperature cathodoluminescence spectra measured with a high spatial resolution demonstrate two dominant emission lines in the near bandgap region. These lines merge at room temperature into a broad emission band peaking at ≈3.3 eV, which is shifted toward lower energies compared with the reference excitonic spectrum measured for the GaN layer.

Seemingly inevitable market and policy changes will push economies to transition away from reliance on industries with higher carbon emissions and bring transient economic impacts, especially in regions that are currently heavily reliant on such industries. This situation is not unusual in a global context. To underpin better-informed decisions that enable a smoother economic transition to a low-emissions future, we developed a ‘latent economic vulnerability to emissions reduction’ (LEVER) index, which maps and explores regions that are more likely to be economically impacted from climate change mitigation. Thus, this paper provides an analysis and discussion of the potential regional implications of a future low-emissions economy, with the analysis contextualised for the state of Queensland, Australia. Given this case study, the economic impacts and future of coal-fired power stations, coal mining and renewable energy are discussed. The LEVER index weighs the risk of high carbon economic exposure against the variability in carbon economic resilience from employment in low-emission sectors across local economies. We find that between 3 and 6 per cent of Queensland regions are assessed as having a very high latent economic vulnerability to increased decarbonisation of industrial activities. To promote a smoother transition, these regions will require targeted investments and strategies to enable their transition towards lower carbon-intensive systems, while maximising economic and social outcomes. © 2019 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","carbon economic exposure; climate change mitigation; coal mining; economic resilience; just energy transitions; thermal coal-fired power stations","carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; decision making; environmental economics; mitigation; pollution tax; vulnerability; Australia; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077155926

However, the claims underpinning the engagement of this Indigenous and forest peoples’ network in international climate finance processes reflect conceptualizations of climate justice that diverge from those that have dominated policy and popular discussions. This article assesses the multi-scalar efforts of the Mesoamerican Alliance to promote claims to climate finance around different concepts of justice. Using empirical justice analysis to assess the subjects, dimensions, and criteria explicit and implicit in Mesoamerican Indigenous and forest groups’ claims, and drawing on decolonial and Indigenous perspectives on environmental justice, the article presents evidence as to the possibilities and challenges of translating REDD+ into just outcomes in historically marginalized territories. Using participant observation, unstructured interviews, and document and social media review, it specifically assesses the Alliance-proposed Mesoamerican Territorial Fund, which aims to directly capture climate finance, bypassing problematic relations with national governments and traditional donors.

However, compared with conventional viticulture, it has shown higher interannual variability in its environmental impacts. Improved understanding of this variability would help organic winegrowers better address their environmental impacts. Methods: This two-part study examined interannual variability of environmental impacts of four vineyards with contrasting pedoclimatic and technical production conditions. First, life cycle assessments were performed on each of these four vineyards for two contrasted years in terms of both climate and pest and disease pressure. Next, for one of these vineyards located in Mediterranean conditions, life cycle assessments were completed on a chronosequence of six consecutive years. Life cycle assessments of organic wine grapes were calculated based on detailed inventories of data from the eight real vineyard situations. Interannual variations were considered to be the deviation between the impact results of two production years. Results and discussion: In all the vineyards, diesel combustion was the main impact contributor. For the four vineyards, the impacts that varied most were generally freshwater ecotoxicity, soil ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, freshwater eutrophication and metal depletion. The intensity/range of interannual variations differed between plots. The main agricultural operations contributing to impact variations were from disease management of climate-related disease pressures. The 6-year chronosequence analysis showed that certain years were very similar in terms of impact results. The impact that varied most was surprisingly terrestrial acidification. The chronosequence analysis brought to light that the choice of active ingredient could be a greater source of impact variations than interannual climatic conditions and disease pressure. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of the hotspots and variability of organic viticulture environmental impacts in contrasted climate years and a climatic chronosequence. The main pathways for environmental performance improvements are (i) reducing fuel consumption by either limiting the number of operations, using more fuel-efficient machines or different energy sources or/and adjusting tractor speed; (ii) reducing the doses and emissions of copper products and choosing the less impacting types of copper; and (iii) limiting nitrogen and heavy metal emissions through the choice of fertiliser type and management. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate; Copper; Cradle-to-farm gate LCA; Fuel; Variability; Vineyard","fresh water; metal; Article; chronosequence; climate; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; exhaust gas; grape; life cycle assessment; organic farming; organic viticulture; plant disease; priority journal; soil pollution; vineyard",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075140339

Eleven metals and metalloids including Al, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb and Se in PM2.5 were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy. The annual average mass concentration of PM2.5 was found to be 88.7 μg m−3. The highest PM2.5 concentrations were obtained during the heating seasons of winter and spring. The concentrations of metals and metalloids in PM2.5 were in a descending order of Al, Pb, Mn, As, Se, Cr, Sb, Ni, Cd, Hg and Be. The enrichment factors showed that Pb, Mn, As, Se, Cr, Sb, Ni, Cd, Hg originated from anthropogenic sources. Factor analysis indicated that the main sources of the metals were coal combustion dust, soil dust, metallurgical industry, brake abrasion of vehicles and other mixed sources. Coal combustion dust was the primary source of metal pollution in PM2.5. Non-carcinogenic risks associated with exposure through the respiratory system were between 6.30 × 10−4 and 7.62 × 10−1, which were lower than the safe limit (1). The carcinogenic risks of Cr, As and Cd were 3.17 × 10−5, 1.52 × 10−5, 2.22 × 10−6, respectively, which were higher than the precautionary criterion (10−6/year). This study indicates that the air pollution of PM2.5 is of public health concern in Licheng District of Jinan, particularly related to potential carcinogenic metals of As, Cr and Cd.

In addition, climate skepticism expressed by the political elites may spread to the electorate, thus ultimately affecting mitigation actions at the population level. It is crucial to better understand the psychological mechanisms underlying elite influences on public opinion formation and polarization. Here we show how affective processes contribute to these top-down influences using longitudinal data in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Findings revealed a general decrease in climate change beliefs immediately after the presidential election (November 2016). We moreover found an increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative emotions toward the Republican Party after the election of President Trump. Most importantly, the positive emotional shift towards the Republican Party mediated the decrease in climate change beliefs: Individuals with pronounced increases in positive emotions toward the Republican Party most strongly reduced their belief in climate change after the presidential election. The effect was intensified among Republican partisans, pointing towards a mechanism underlying political polarization. Using data based on a major real-world political event, our findings illustrate how partisans update their beliefs by referring to the positions of relevant political authorities. We moreover demonstrate how emotions drive top-down influences of political leaders on partisans’ opinions and beliefs. Finally, our findings reveal how intensified emotions can contribute to the aggravation of the public climate change divide. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Digital storage; Polarization; Social aspects; Affective process; Longitudinal data; Political efforts; Political events; Population levels; Positive emotions; Presidential election; Public opinions; Climate change; climate change; election; electoral system; perception; polarization; political discourse; psychology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074661081

Despite this, successive governments have struggled to implement policy to tackle this issue. Using the case of opposition to the Clean Energy Act, passed in Australia to establish an emissions trading scheme, this paper argues that a growing and broad sentiment of distrust in political elites, described as ‘anti-politics’, can explain some of this contradiction. Particular forms of climate policy, in particular emissions trading schemes, have been successfully framed as policies that appeal to the interests of a new class of liberal elites while hurting ordinary working people. This frame was used successfully in Australia by conservative forces to oppose the Clean Energy Act. While used cynically by political leaders in this case, the paper argues that anti-political sentiment reflects genuine concerns about the detachment between the state and voting population. This detachment is reflected in neoliberal climate policies. Through briefly examining the cases of the Trump Administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Gilets Jaunes protest movement, the paper argues that while formulating climate policy we must consider anti-political sentiment, developing responses to the climate crisis from a bottom-up rather than top-down approach. © The Author(s) 2019.","Anti-politics; carbon tax; climate change; climate justice; democracy; global warming; governance; social movements",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074439245

Practical application : Air pollution is now being recognised as having major negative impacts on public health. The use of insulation, as a large area and volume air filter, would appear to be a highly effective technique to reduce particulate matter, and when combined with activated charcoal that absorbs/adsorbs toxic gasses, can significantly improve indoor air quality in cities across the world that are presently exceeding WHO air quality guidelines. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2019.","activated charcoal; air permeable ceiling; dynamic insulation; high-rise housing; Indoor air quality","Activated carbon; Air conditioning; Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Ceilings; Developing countries; Housing; Humidity control; Insulation; Particles (particulate matter); Sulfur dioxide; Thermal comfort; Air conditioning units; Computer modelling; Dynamic insulation; High rise; Indoor air quality; Particulate levels; Particulate Matter; Quality guidelines; Indoor air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071546943

However, no study has yet comprehensively assessed the consumption-based GHG emissions of the entire New Zealand’s economy. This research, for the first time, quantified New Zealand’s GHG emissions using both consumption- and production-based accounting approaches and considered the policy implications for adopting a consumption-based approach over a production-based approach. Methods: A global multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis was undertaken to calculate the consumption- and production-based GHG emissions of New Zealand for the year 2012. The MRIO analysis was based on the Eora database, which accounts for 14,839 industry sectors from 189 countries. Given the sectoral classification of each country is quite different and in order to ease interpretation of the results, the industry sectors of each country were classified and aggregated into 16 key sectors, and GHG emissions were calculated for those key sectors. Results and discussion: The MRIO analysis showed that New Zealand’s consumption- and production-based GHG emissions in 2012 were 61,850 and 81,667 ktCO2eq, respectively, indicating that the country was a net exporter of GHG emissions in 2012. The dominant contributors to the consumption-based GHG emissions were the other services and construction key sectors (each representing 16% of consumption-based emissions), followed by food and beverages (14%), transport and equipment (12%) and financial and trade services (11%), whereas the dominant contributor to the production-based GHG emissions was the agriculture key sector (representing 52% of production-based GHG emissions). The results of the study provided two key insights to support climate mitigation activities and policymaking. First, the consumption- and production-based accounting approaches results have different rankings for the most dominant sectors contributing to New Zealand’s GHG emissions. Second, only the consumption-based accounting approach enables the quantification of the embodied emissions in New Zealand’s trade activities, and it indicated that a large proportion of GHG emissions are embodied in New Zealand’s trade activities. These insights, therefore, have important implications for future policies that could positively influence the consumption patterns of New Zealand citizens and the production structure and efficiency of New Zealand’s trade partners. Conclusions: This research quantified New Zealand’s GHG emissions using both consumption- and production-based accounting approaches. Given the two accounting approaches provided different insights, both approaches should be used in a complementary way when developing climate policies. However, implementation of a consumption-based accounting approach to support development and implementation of climate policies and instruments requires further consideration. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Consumption-based accounting; Eora; Greenhouse gas; Multi-regional input-output; New Zealand; Production-based accounting","agriculture; article; carbon footprint; climate change; food; New Zealand; quantitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070929201

However, insufficient or unplanned infrastructure leads to decrease in the share of bicycle in many cities of developing nations. In order to increase the bicycle share and to provide safer, faster and more direct routes, a bicycle superhighway is proposed for urban areas. This study identifies the potential of increase in the bicycle share. For maximum utilization of the new infrastructure, an algorithm is presented to identify the optimum number and locations of the connectors between proposed new infrastructure and existing network. Household income levels are incorporated into the decision making process of individual travellers for a better understanding of the modal shift. A real-world case study of Patna, India is chosen to show the application of the proposed superhighway. It is shown that for Patna, the bicycle share can escalate as high as 48% up from 32% by providing this kind of infrastructure. However, together with bicycles, allowing motorbikes on the superhighway limits the bicycle share to 44%. The increase in bicycle share is mainly a result of people switching from motorbike, public transport and walk to the bicycle. Further, to evaluate the benefits of the bicycle superhighway, this study first extends an emission modelling tool to estimate the time-dependent, vehicle-specific emissions under mixed traffic conditions. Allowing only bicyclists on the superhighway improves congested urban areas, reduces emissions, and increases accessibility. However, allowing motorbikes on the superhighway increases emissions significantly in the central part of the urban area and reduces accessibilities by bicycle mode to education facilities which are undesirable. This study elicits that a physically segregated high-quality bicycle superhighway will not only attract current non-cyclist travellers and increase the share of the bicycle mode, but will also reduce negative transport externalities significantly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Bicycle superhighway; Emissions; MATSim; Mixed traffic; Sustainable transport","Behavioral research; Decision making; Particulate emissions; Submarine cables; Urban transportation; Accessibility; Decision making process; Developing nations; Low carbon transport; MATSim; Mixed traffic; Sustainable policies; Sustainable transport; Bicycles; cycle transport; decision making; household income; road transport; transportation policy; urban transport; Bihar; India; Patna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068418534

Particularly, the migration of fine sediment particles can alter the hydro-mechanical properties of sediments, and reduce long-term hydrocarbon productivity by causing local-clogging around wells. However, questions as to under which circumstances and to what extent the fines migration and pore-clogging occur remain poorly resolved, particularly in association with two-phase flows. Therefore, this study explored the fines migration induced by fluid flows and the resulting pore-clogging in porous media. One-dimensional channel experiments were carried out with sandy sediments containing non-plastic silty fines to examine effects of fluid velocity and mixed fluid flows on pore-clogging occurrence. In single-phase flows, the flow velocity had a pronounced effect on determining the fines behavior, exhibiting from no or minimal fines detachment, through fines migration with no clogging, and to fines migration accompanying pore-clogging with increasing flow velocity. In two-phase flows with mixed gas–water fluids, the presence of gas–water interfaces clearly promoted pore-clogging because the fines were readily collected at gas–water interfaces, resulting in high particle concentration at the menisci. The particle-level force analysis also corroborates the experimental observations, showing that the drag force primarily determined by the flow velocity plays a significant role in the fines detachment against the particle weight in the single-phase flows. In contrast, the gas–water interfacial tension overwhelms the drag force and the particle weight, and thereby, governs pore-clogging behaviors in mixed fluid flow conditions. The presented results provide insights into pore-scale mechanisms of pore-clogging induced by fines migration, which is associated with gas production in HBS, as mixed fluids flow can accompany fines detachment, fines migration, and pore-clogging near wellbores. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fines migration; gas–water interface; Hydrate-bearing sediments; Multi-phase flow; Particle detachment; Pore clogging","flow velocity; gas hydrate; mechanical property; pore pressure; porous medium; sediment transport; two phase flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068096036

Using taxi inspection and trip data, we assessed changes in New York City’s taxi fleet following Clean Air Taxi legislation enacted in 2005–2006. Inspection and trip data between 2004 and 2015 were used to assess changes in New York’s taxi fleet and to estimate and spatially apportion annual taxi-related exhaust emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and total particulate matter (PMT). These emissions changes were used to predict reductions in NO and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations estimates using data from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) in 2009–2015. Efficiency trends among other for-hire vehicles and spatial variation in traffic intensity were also considered. The city fuel efficiency of the medallion taxi fleet increased from 15.7 MPG to 33.1 MPG, and corresponding NO and PMT exhaust emissions estimates declined by 82 and 49%, respectively. These emissions reductions were associated with changes in NYCCAS-modeled NO and PM2.5 concentrations (p &lt; 0.001). New York’s clean air taxi legislation was effective at increasing fuel efficiency of the medallion taxi fleet, and reductions in estimated taxi emissions were associated with decreases in NO and PM2.5 concentrations. © 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.","Environmental monitoring; Exposure modeling; Particulate matter","air; nitric oxide; air pollutant; air pollution; car; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; legislation and jurisprudence; motor vehicle; New York; particulate matter; public health; Air; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Automobiles; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Motor Vehicles; New York City; Nitric Oxide; Particulate Matter; Public Health; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066806398

The implementation of this policy raised a simple, albeit tricky, question: what is a forest? In response, Greenpeace, GAR and a consultancy firm developed a methodology for forest classification called the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach. Employing a vegetation classification based primarily on a threshold of carbon sequestration, the method identifies which forested zones to protect from conversion to agriculture. While currently gaining resonance in the realm of sustainability standards, its implementation in Indonesia and Liberia encountered resistance and criticism by rural dwellers and social NGOs. How did HCS advocates integrate local peoples’ concerns, interests and claims to compose commonality? By analysing the HCS methodology's content, implementation and progressive adaptation, this article shows how HCS advocates favoured a specific mode of composition: one that fits a liberal grammar and that has specific implications on the valuation of forest and cultivable lands. The HCS approach is thus more than a data collection tool; it encapsulates and reinforces a particular vision of the environment and how people should relate to it. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental valuation; Forest conservation; High carbon stock; Local communities; Oil palm; Pragmatic sociology","agricultural land; carbon sequestration; deforestation; forest cover; land classification; land use change; nongovernmental organization; policy implementation; sustainability; Indonesia; Liberia [West Africa]; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058147389

Its practical use, however, can be computationally challenging if the formulated TDP requires time-consuming computer models to evaluate candidate designs, especially if such designs must account for multiple objectives. For TDPs to be of practical relevance to the real-world planning of sustainable transportation networks, efficient TDP solution heuristics must be developed. To this end, two surrogate-based solution heuristics for multi-objective TDPs are proposed in this paper. Surrogate-based optimization uses simple approximations to computationally expensive models in order to accelerate the discovery of good solutions. The general search strategy of the proposed heuristics is as follows. In each iteration of the heuristics, a pool of candidate pricing schemes with unique sets of tolling locations and associated tolling levels is generated. From this pool of designs, the heuristics use the surrogate models to screen for solutions that are expected to be nondominated and that meet a specified selection criterion. Then, these promising designs are evaluated by the computationally expensive models, and the outputs obtained from these evaluations are used to update the surrogate models. Both heuristics repeat this general process until a maximum number of iterations are completed, at which point the best TDP solutions are returned. In addition to the solution heuristics, this paper presents a transportation network paradox that highlights how transportation network interventions intended to reduce traffic emissions could have unintended effects on a population's exposure to pollutants. The paradox also is used to illustrate the practical complexity of accounting for environmental inequality objectives, as well as the relevance of multi-objective analysis approaches to transportation planning. Formulations of multi-objective TDPs that consider both travel and pollutant exposure-related objectives are also presented, including the objectives of reducing human intake of vehicle-generated air pollutants and of minimizing environmental inequality. The Sioux Falls and Chicago Sketch networks were used in tests that examined the relative performance of the heuristics, as well as the characteristics of pricing configurations obtained under different budget constraints. Among other results, the tests show that a pricing configuration could decrease total pollutant intake and environmental inequality, while at the same time producing an increase in pollutant concentrations in a significant number of pollutant receptor points. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental equity; Road pricing; Surrogate-based optimization; Toll design problem","Air intakes; Budget control; Costs; Highway planning; Pollution; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Transportation charges; Design problems; Environmental equity; Multi-objective analysis; Pollutant concentration; Road pricing; Surrogate-based optimization; Sustainable transportation; Transportation planning; Optimization; emission control; multiobjective programming; optimization; road pricing; surrogate method; traffic emission; transportation infrastructure; Chicago; Illinois; Sioux Falls; South Dakota; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057521379

This initiative aims to build first-of-its-kind ensemble climate experiments of convection permitting models to investigate present and future convective processes and related extremes over Europe and the Mediterranean. In this manuscript the rationale, scientific aims and approaches are presented along with some preliminary results from the testing phase of the project. Three test cases were selected in order to obtain a first look at the ensemble performance. The test cases covered a summertime extreme precipitation event over Austria, a fall Foehn event over the Swiss Alps and an intensively documented fall event along the Mediterranean coast. The test cases were run in both “weather-like” (WL, initialized just before the event in question) and “climate” (CM, initialized 1 month before the event) modes. Ensembles of 18–21 members, representing six different modeling systems with different physics and modelling chain options, was generated for the test cases (27 modeling teams have committed to perform the longer climate simulations). Results indicate that, when run in WL mode, the ensemble captures all three events quite well with ensemble correlation skill scores of 0.67, 0.82 and 0.91. They suggest that the more the event is driven by large-scale conditions, the closer the agreement between the ensemble members. Even in climate mode the large-scale driven events over the Swiss Alps and the Mediterranean coasts are still captured (ensemble correlation skill scores of 0.90 and 0.62, respectively), but the inter-model spread increases as expected. In the case over Mediterranean the effects of local-scale interactions between flow and orography and land–ocean contrasts are readily apparent. However, there is a much larger, though not surprising, increase in the spread for the Austrian event, which was weakly forced by the large-scale flow. Though the ensemble correlation skill score is still quite high (0.80). The preliminary results illustrate both the promise and the challenges that convection permitting modeling faces and make a strong argument for an ensemble-based approach to investigating high impact convective processes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate applications; Convection-permitting; Ensemble models","atmospheric convection; atmospheric correction; climate modeling; computer simulation; ensemble forecasting; performance assessment; weather forecasting; Alps; Austria; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056567642

We study the production of standards as situated and practical action, which is shaped by opportunities, resource constraints, and existing infrastructure. Careful observations of this work reveals what people do and how they organize their actions relevant to the particular questions, conventions, and resources at hand. We apply this practice-centered, ethnomethodological approach to study the creation of an accounting protocol for nitrous oxide emissions from corn production, an effort within the broader project of enlisting agriculture in carbon markets. We find that efforts to create a far-reaching, rigorous, and efficient standard were frustrated by lack of data, contestation of knowledge claims, and the challenges of collapsing real-world heterogeneity into a model and a set of tidy decision rules. In this sense, carbon accounting standards should be understood as provisional, and potentially unstable, compromises. © 2018","Agriculture; Carbon accounting; Environmental governance; Markets; Standards","accountability; governance approach; heterogeneity; land use change; land use planning; local government; nitrous oxide; pollution tax; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051641976

But how is it possible to foster diffusion of plug-in electric vehicles? Our research focuses on the question whether e-mobility product service systems (i.e. plug-in electric vehicles, interconnected charging infrastructure as well as charging platform and additional services) are supportive to plug-in electric vehicle adoption in professional environments. Our user oriented techno-economic analysis of costs and benefits is based on empirical data originating from 109 organizational fleets participating in a field trial in south-west Germany with in total 327 plug-in electric vehicles and 181 charging points. The results show that organizations indicate a high willingness to pay for e-mobility product service systems. Organizations encounter non-monetary benefits, which on average overcompensate the current higher total cost of ownership of plug-in electric vehicles compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. However, the willingness to pay for e-mobility charging infrastructure and services alone is currently not sufficient to cover corresponding actual costs. The paper relates the interconnected charging infrastructure solutions under study to the development of the internet of things and smarter cities and draws implications on this development. © 2018 The Authors","Business model; Electric mobility; Electric vehicle; Platform service; Product service system; Smart city","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum transportation; Plug-in electric vehicles; Smart city; Business modeling; Electric mobility; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Particulate matter pollution; Platform service; Product-service systems; Professional environments; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); economic analysis; electric vehicle; mobility; ownership; road transport; service quality; technology adoption; transportation infrastructure; willingness to pay; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048742768

The conc. of 16 priority PHAs in soils from the urbanized/ industrialized outskirts in the vicinity of Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company were analyzed along with their associations with soil properties, its sources and spatial distribution. The selected soil properties include total organic carbon (% TOC), soil pH and cation exchange capacity. The pH of the soil samples varies from 7.0 to 8.2 with an average of 7.7. The total organic matter ranged from 0.2% to 3.6% with an average of 0.8 %. The CEC ranged from 14.46 to 42.9 cmol [Na+]/ Kg with an average of 28.5 cmol (Na+]/ Kg. PAHs were analyzed by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography having fluorescence detector. Only 11 PAH compounds were detected in almost all samples; anthracene, naphthalene, acenaphthene, anthracene, pyrene, fluorine, benzo[a] and benzo[b] fluoranthene, benzo[k] fluoranthene, benzo[a] perylene, dibenzo [g.h.i] pyrene and dibenzo[a, h] anthracene from the screened EPA 16 priority PAHs. Total PAHs concentration ranged from 32.7 to 573.5 μg /kg with an average of 219.9 μg/kg. Half of the sampling sites in the study area would be considered as uncontaminated with PAHs (&lt;200 µg/kg) while the rest of sampling sites would be considered as weakly polluted (200-600 µg/kg). Factor analysis of PAHs identifies four major potential sources impact the study area; oil refinery emissions, Al-Hussein power plant, anthropogenic sources; industrial boilers; recycling mills, steel smelters and small size workshops and traffic emissions. The PAHs concentrations/ levels were used as the input data for a point-based contouring map, for studying the distribution of PAHs in the study area soil.
